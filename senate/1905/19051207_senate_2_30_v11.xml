                    <para>In amplification of the latter portion of the reply, I may state that the information with regard to the transferred properties is not available in the Department of Home Affairs, and that so far as it knows, it has not yet been compiled by any State. It will be required in connexion with the proceedings relating to the valuation of the transferred . properties, to which reference was made in the discussion on the Appropriation Bill; that is to the proceedings arising out of the resolutions arrived at by the Premiers' Conference in Hobart. </para>

                        <para>- When a ruling is objected to, I have a right to restate it with more particularity than I could have done on the spur of the moment, and that I propose to do now. Yesterday I stated that I was informed by one of the clerks that the Life Assurance Companies Bill had been treated and dealt with by the Senate in a manner similar to that in which it is proposed' to deal with the Trade Marks Bill. I find on reference to the dates that that information is not correct. On the 3rd August the Senate resolved to proceed with the Bill as a lapsed Bill. On the 17th August it was read a second time. Amendments1 were subsequently made in it in Committee. It was read a third time on the 25th August. On the 29th August the House of Representatives agreed to the amendments. That Bill originated in the House of Representatives last session. On reference to the dates it will be seen that the Standing Orders Committee of the Senate and the Standing Orders Committee of the 'House of Representatives, recommended new standing orders, and the adoption of a resolution on the 17 th August; and that that recommendation was not agreed to by the Senate until the 30th August. Therefore, all the proceedings on the Life Assurance Companies Bill took place prior to the adoption by the Senate of the new standing orders recommended by the Standing Orders Committees. Consequently, the information given to me, which I conveyed to the Senate yesterday, was not quite correct ; and I wish to state that at once. I also desire to state with more particularity! than I could do on the spur of the moment, the position in reference to the Trade Marks Bill. Prior to last August the Senate had a standing order, No. 234, which said - </para>

                <para class="block">Acting on that standing order as it stood - and the House of Representatives had a precisely similar standing order - the House of Representatives had prior to the 17 th August, reinstated certain Bills as lapsed Bills. Amongst them was the Trade Marks Bill. When the two Standing Orders Committees met and considered this question, it was agreed by them unanimously that the standing orders on the subject then in existence were insufficient; that, although they provided what one House could do with a Bill which it had in its possession, they made no provision whatever as to what the other House might do with that Bill when it was dealt with by the House which had possession of it, and referred .it back to the other House. Therefore, they recommended new standing orders. One of these standing orders was this - </para>

                    <para>If a Bill be in the possession of the House in which it did not originate, it may be proceeded with by resolution of the House in which it is, restoring it to the notice-paper. But such resolution shall not be passed unless a message is received from the House in which it originated, requesting that its consideration may be resumed. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>But the Standing Orders Committees, in recommending that new standing order took into consideration this fact - that there were certain Bills, and amongst them was the Trade Marks Bill, on which proceedings had been taken under the old standing order; and they, therefore, provided by a resolution, which it was proposed that each House should adopt, to permit the Houses to deal with Bills of that nature in a peculiar and specific manner. For this reason. - that if either House had prior to the adoption of this new standing order proceeded on the old standing order, and reinstated a Bill, it could not proceed under the new standing order; because the new standing order provided that a message must be received from the House in which the Bill originated before the other House - in which the Bill did not originate - could reinstate that Bill on the notice-paper. But if honorable senators will search the records of the House of Representatives, they will see that on the 27th Tu! V that House reinstated the Trade Marks Bill as a lapsed Bill. The House had already reinstated it under the old1 standing order, and it was considered that a Bill of that nature should be proceeded with under a specific resolution, which I will read directly. The second reading of the Bill was moved on the 2nd August. It was read a second time on the 9th August. So that honorable senators will see that three stages' had been taken concerning this Bill in the House of Representatives before the Standing Orders Committees met and agreed to the resolution which I take to be a compact between the two Houses. It was in view of this Bill, and some other Bills of a similar nature, that that compact was re- commended by the Standing Orders Committees of the two Houses for adoption. The proceedings on Bills of that nature were to be dealt with under this resolution : - </para>

                <para class="block">It was necessary to do something to provide for Bills which had already been dealt with under the old standing order, but not finally completed; and it will be seen - indeed,' it was obvious - that the House of Representatives could not deal with the Trade Marks Bill under the new standing orders, because the House had already reinstated the Bill under the old standing order. Therefore, as I say, the Standing Orders Committees recommended that resolution to the two Houses. The resolution was agreed to by the Senate. I did not know yesterday, but I do know now, because I have searched the records of the House of Representatives, that that resolution has not been agreed to by the other House. It was laid on the table, but nothing further was done. But the other House has acted on it, on the faith that the Senate would carry into effect the resolution passed by us. </para>

                        <para>- By proceeding with the Bill. It was contemplated that the Senate would proceed with the Bill under the resolution which we passed, and which it was supposed that the House of Representatives would' pass, but which, owing to circumstances that I need not explain, that House has not passed. Therefore, in my opinion, it would be a breach of faith with the other House if, after allowing it to proceed with this Bill in full confidence that the Senate would act on the resolution recommended by the two Standing Orders Committees,, and passed by the Senate, we were to turn round and say that this Bill should be proceeded with under the new standing order. That is all I have to say. I think the matter is perfectly clear. I believe it is perfectly clear to every member of the Senate that that is what was intended- I believe the Senate had before it in language as plain as could be the opinions of the Standing Orders Committees, and adopted them. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say that you asserted it, but you said that you had been informed that the House of Representatives had agreed to the recommendation of the Standing Orders Committee upon this subject. You have already ruled - and of course from that ruling no one can differ for a moment - that under our Standing Orders as they exist the Trade Marks Bill could not come before us now. I then ask myself, " How does it come before us ? " The answer is that the Standing Orders Committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives have recommended to both Houses that they should adopt a certain resolution. It is a fact that the Senate did adopt the resolution. It is equally a fact that the House of Representatives did not adopt it. I wish to consider first the moral obligation - if honorable senators choose to term it so - that is upon the Senate to adhere to its determination. I say at once that if the resolution put before the Senate in. that way were not in the nature of a joint reference to both Houses, there could be no question that the Senate, having resolved to adhere to it, must necessarily do so. But by far the most important aspect of the matter is that the adoption of the resolution in question is analogous to the case of an agreement between two parties. In this case the two parties are the Senate and the House of Representatives. Under this analogy the agreement has been signed and properly executed by one party, but has not been executed in any way by the other party That is the position in which we find ourselves. To emphasize it, I put this view before the Senate: Suppose that the positions were entirely reversed, and that the other House were now being asked to take up a lapsed Bill under the circumstances that it had agreed to this resolution but the Senate had not. I ask every honorable senator to consider whether, under those circumstances, he is perfectly satisfied that the House of Representatives would not take advantage of that position. Would not the House of Representatives be entitled to say : " It is a fact the Senate has agreed, but we have made no such agreement, and do not consider ourselves bound in any way." If that be so, is it not worth our while to consider how far we are bound by an agreement which the other House has left unexecuted? If the subject-matter of the ruling were a Bill to which none of us attach any immediate importance, we might hesitate for some time before we decided to act on an agreement, when we know perfectly well that the other House had not completed its part. I do not believe that any senator will dispute the accuracy of that position; and it would be a pity if the great importance of this measure were in any way to cloud our judgment on the question before us. </para>

My reply would be that I am not in the mind of the other party - that all I know is that the agreement remains unexecuted. </para>

A recommendation by the Standing Orders Committee is worth nothing to this Senate, unless the Senate has ratified it. The recommendation of the Standing Orders Committee is worth nothing until the other House agrees. </para>

                        <para>- I do net desire to discuss this question with any suggestion of animosity. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> could remove' from his mind any consideration as to the importance of this Bill, would he think we could immediately act on an understanding that the other House was going to execute an agreement which so far remains unexecuted ? I am merely stating a case, and not attempting any argument ; but that is precisely the position. It is a great pity that this Bill should be one of such great importance, and that in connexion with it we should be compelled to act on the assumption that the other House is going to do what so far they have left undone, but what the Senate has rightly and properly done. Everything I have expressed represents mv own view, but I take the opportunity to speak, to a considerable extent, on behalf of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> who. for the reasons I have indicated, is unable to put his case before the Senate. </para>

                    <para>- This is a matter which in reality resolves itself into a question of the exercise of the discretion of the Senate. It is perfectly true that both Houses, as represented by the Standing Orders Committees, came to an honorable understanding that a resolution was to be. passed; and the Senate has done its pan in this connexion. The other ' House has not refused to pass a resolution ; but the mere fact that it has failed to do so, does probably place it within our_ power on a technicality to say : " We shall take advantage of the situation, and refuse to consider this Bill." </para>

                        <para>- It was understood that the resolution recommended by the Standing Orders, Committees should be passed by both Houses. It was passed by the Senate, and, consequently, I s,ay that technically we have the right to tell the House of Representatives that they must take a similar course. That, however,, would be an extremely technical view to take. </para>

                        <para>- I say that technically we have the right to refuse. Although for reasons which we cannot explain, the House of Representatives have, we shall say, neglected to actually carry the resolution, they have, as a matter of fact, acted as if they had passed it. That being so, would it not be the height of folly for us to refuse to deal with business that has already been dealt with by another place with the knowledge that the Senate had passed a resolution ? If the House of Representatives had given us an intimation that they refused to pass a resolution, our attitude would be very different. It is, however, a mere matter of circumstances that the House of Representatives have not actually passed the resolution, and we should be stultifying ourselves if we now refused to go on with this business. Under the circumstances, we have a clear duty to proceed with the Bill. </para>

                    <para>- I do not feel that my case is quite strong enough to warrant me in taking up any longer the time of the Senate. I desire, however, to make one or two remarks. In, the first place, the action of the other House has in every respect been quite correct. They took up the Bill in accordance with their own original standing order, at the time when that standing order had not been brought under survey by the Standing Orders Committees. As to the joint meeting of the Committees, I point out that we should be involved in very great trouble indeed if two Committees, meeting under the circumstances, were presumed to have power to commit both Houses in an important matter of this kind. That, however, if I may say so, with all respect, seems to be embodied in your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President.</inline></para>

                        <para>- The Committees decided to make a recommendation to both Houses, but had no power to enter into a compact, and did not do so. They exercised their power to make a recommendation, which this Senate has accepted-; whereas it was simply tabled in the other House, and has not yet been considered. Probably I should not have given notice yesterday of my intention to dissent from the ruling had it not been for the fact that on one or two points the President was misinformed ; and I thought it possible, on a further review, a different result might be arrived at. With these few remarks I beg leave to withdraw the motion. </para>

                    <para>- It is my duty to see that the Standing Orders are upheld, and at present I am of opinion that this notice of motion cannot be submitted. As a matter of fact, I do not yet know what the motion is, because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has given only a general notice ; and has not, as should be done in pursuance of the Standing Orders, followed' that notice up by a specific motion. I do not think that the honorable senator can give specific notice of motion now except bv leave of the Senate. I do not think the honorable senator can move a specific motion now unless bv leave of the Senate. </para>

                    <para>- I regret that, in your opinion, I have not sufficiently complied with the Standing Orders, but I thought it was sufficiently specific to say that I proposed to move a motion with a view to give effect to the prayer of the petitioners. The question was submitted as to whether the motion should be considered formal or not formal. It was declared " not formal," and it must therefore be discussed in the ordinary way . If that motion is carried, a definite motion in the terms indicated can be submitted. But if we decide to consider it, I think it would be very much better if we could discuss the matter on a definite motion at once. </para>

                        <para>- Some confusion apparently exists, judging by the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford.</inline> The honorable senator states that it is a common practice for honorable senators to obtain leave to amend a motion. We can admit that, as applied to a motion which is in order, and properly before the Senate. But the  President  has ruled that, under standing order 104, this is not a motion, and therefore it cannot be amended. I take it that that is the correct view of the matter, if the  President  has; not already definitely decided that the motion is not in order. </para>

Under that standing order he ought, to have given specific notice of the motion' he proposes to move. I may say that this, standing order has been complied with on a great many occasions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has given a great many notices of motion in general terms, but he has always subsequently given twenty-four hours' notice to the Clerk of the specific motion he intended to submit. </para>

Whether I' am right or wrong, it will be admitted that the matter with which I propose to deal is one of great urgency, and, in the circumstances, I ask to be allowed to give specific notice of motion now.

I believed that I had given a sufficiently specific notice of motion, and I am aware that other honorable senators held the same views, because they spoke to me of the opportunity afforded to discuss the question to-day. In view of the circumstances, I therefore ask that the Standing Orders may be suspended in order that I may put myself in order, and the motion I propose to move is - </para>

                    <para>- Are the Standing Orders here for our guidance, or are the)' to be played with? It seems to me that the business of the Senate is being reduced to a farce, and the position is made worse when we find the leader of the Government prepared to throw the Standing Orders under the table. I am not an old parliamentarian, bat I have had ten years' experience of Parliament, and this is the first time I have heard the Standing Orders spoken of as something to be played with in this way. </para>

                        <para>- If by any chance the session should end before the expiration of a fortnight, it really means that the inquiry is to continue for six months. If the honorable senator now got a week's extension, then at its expiration he could point out reasons for asking for another week's extension, and no doubt if we were satisfied it would be granted. Surely he does not wish to imply that he wants a longer extension than a fortnight ! If we agree to this motion, at the end of a fortnight he may say that the Select Committee wants leave to sit in recess. </para>

I do not propose to close the inquiry until that opportunity has been afforded. There are four witnesses in Melbourne, and four witnesses in Adelaide, who have yet to be called. There are eight witnesses waiting to be called, and there is not the slightest possibility of taking their evidence within a week. We have held two sittings in this week. At the week end we intend to go to Adelaide to take the evidence of the four witnesses in that city. On Tuesday next we shall return to Melbourne, and, if possible, hold two sittings during the week, in order to try to finish the taking of evidence. There is not the slightest possibility of the report being brought up next Thursday. It . would be farcical to ask the Senate for only a week's extension. There is not the slightest possibility of the work of the session being finished within a fortnight. Under the circumstances, we are quite safe in asking for a fortnight's extension. </para>

                    <para>- Many of us remember with pleasure the very interesting and instructive speech in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> proposed this motion, and I am sure we sympathize with him in his present state of health. I have informed him privately of an amendment which I intend to move. The question before us is not of a party character, and therefore anything that we may say in regard to it cannot possibly be said to have a party complexion. No one who knows the interest that I have taken in the question can have any doubt that I am sympathetically inclined towards it. But, nevertheless, the facts of the case convince me that it is altogether premature to expect that we can secure the. federalization of the railways at present. My views on the subject have been expressed in various places, and at different times. I expressed them at the Bathurst, Convention in 1896, again at the National Convention at Adelaide in 1897, at Sydney in the same year, and at Melbourne in 1898. My idea was that each State should be credited with the. income on its own railways and debited with the charges ; and that the Federal Government should consolidate the debts of the States, taking the railways as security. That proposal, however, proved to be unsatisfactory to the States. Then I propounded a second scheme, which, I am glad to say., to some extent met with the approval of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, namely, that where the income from Customs and Excise in the hands of the Federal Government was not sufficient to pay the interest on the debts of the States, that income should be supplemented by hypothecating a proportion of the railway income to the Federal Government. It will be within the recollection of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> and others who attended the Adelaide Convention that when section 69 or the Constitution was under consideration, I proposed that the word "railways" be inserted after the word " quarantine." Unfortunately, that Convention had to be brought to a conclusion before its work was done, in order to allow the Premiers of the States to go to London in time for the Jubilee of the late Queen Victoria. The language in which I formulated my proposal was - </para>

Much that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> said strengthens my argument from that point of view. In fact, after listening to his speech, I was much surprised that he did not earlier in the session support the Bill for the survey of the route of the proposed railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie. He seems to me to be rather inconsistent. The remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Eddy</inline> which I shall quote were with reference to the opening of the Hawkesbury Bridge in New South Wales. He said - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The opening of the bridge over the Hawkesbury by His Excellency the Governor, Lord Carrington, on May nth, marked a great event in the railway history of Australia, as it enabled passengers and goods to be conveyed by railway between four of the capital cities of the continent, but it is much regretted that, although this is true in regard to the continuous railway system, yet the inconvenience, delay, and expense of transhipment has to be suffered by all traffic owing to the lines having been constructed on three different gauges. The question of a universal gauge is of such vast importance to this great; continent, both from a commercial point of view, and also from a military stand-point, that we cannot too earnestly urge upon the Government the necessity of pressing the question upon the Governments of the other colonies, as we feel certain that if the break of gauge is allowed to continue, the consequent inconvenience and cost will in a few years be so great as to render the adoption of a universal gauge im- . perative. Every year the change is delayed, the mileage of rolling-stock increases, and the cost of altering the gauge becomes greater. If the question could be settled at once, and the change carried out in about four years' time, and all additions to the rolling-stock constructed with a knowledge that at the end of that period it would have to be adapted to the requirements of the universal gauge, the cost of making the alteration would be found to be comparatively trifling if divided between the four colonies affected. </para>

                <para class="block">At the Adelaide Convention, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn</inline> took a great deal of trouble in acquiring information on the same subject. I will quote his remarks - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>I would remind members of this fact, that the question of the gauges was mentioned as far back as 1857, when the matter of the Federation of the colonies was discussed in England, and it was recommended that there should be a uniformity in the gauges of the railways in the colonies, so that as far as I can gauge the opinion of the Convention, there has been a retrogression in public opinion. In1889 I tabled a motion in the South Australian. Legislature regarding the assimilation of the railway gauges in the colonies. I suggested then that the Railways Commissioners should decide what the gauge should be, and that it should be declared by Act of Parliament, that that should be the gauge of the future, and that any rolling-stock ordered in the future should be so constructed as to allow the alteration of that gauge. That was carried here, but except in New South Wales, little attention was paid to the subject. I would remind <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgins</inline> that the question of adopting a uniform gauge does not altogether receive its importance from its efficacy for military purposes. That is a subordinate one, and one, judging from the possibilities of Australia-, we need' not pay much attention to. We are more industrial than aggressive, and will not probably be called into defensive action for many long years to come. It has been shown by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Eddy</inline> and English authorities that by the establishment of a uniform gauge a saving can be effected, a saving that would pay the interest. </para>

                        I can refer the honorable member to the facts in print on this point, which I think will lead him to the conclusion at which I have arrived. A very great saving can be effected by this. As regards the rolling-stock, the Great Western railway had a gauge of 7 ft. 3 in. or 7 ft., and they changed it to the standard gauge of the world - the 4 ft. 8? in. - and some of the existing rolling-stock was used. If it is possible there with such a difference in the gauge, I say it would be possible to use the rolling-stock at present used for the 5 ft. 3 in. gauge on the 4 ft.8? in. If you carry out
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Eddy's</inline>
                        idea, and have a uniform gauge of 4 ft. 8? in. in them, the work of converting all our lines to one uniform gauge can be brought about in a week.

                <para>It may be that it would not be possible to do the work in this country in a week, although I learn that in Ohio, after trying all sorts of mechanical appliances, 10,000 miles of railway were altered from 5 ft. 3? in. to 4 ft. 8? in. in one week; and on the Great Western railway, in England, the gauge was altered from the broad to the standard gauge in thirty hours. </para>

                        <para>- No one denies, that. I believe that if the gauge on all our railways were made uniform, within a few months the public would begin to wonder how they had for so long submitted to the present antiquated methods. On the continent of Europe, I believe, it is no uncommon occurrence for carriages and trucks belonging to one country to carry passengers and goods over the lines of other countries. </para>

                    <para>. - Notwithstanding any views which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> may entertain, I can assure him that there is no desire on the part of the Government to do anything that will militate against the success of the Pacific Cable. Personally, I have, from the beginning, favoured preference for the Pacific Cable on the part of the people and Governments of Australia, and I understand that previous Governments of the Commonwealth have offered to confer on those who control that .cable the same rights and privileges, in regard to the opening of offices and the construction of. land lines, as are enjoyed by the Eastern Extension Telegraph ' Company. The Pacific Cable Board, as honorable senators are aware, is located in London, and is charged with all matters, pertaining to administration. The facilities in connexion with the opening of offices, and the construction of land lines, have been referred to in the course of the debates on the relative merits of the two cables, and, therefore, I do not propose to now deal with these matters in detail. As honorable senators know, all cables lodged with the Post and Telegraph Department for transmission beyond the Commonwealth are invariably sent by the Pacific Cable, unless the sender gives an express direction to the contrary. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline> and honorable senators generally, may rest assured that the Government, so far from endeavouring to do anything to prevent the success of the Pacific Cable, will direct their efforts in a contrary direction. I hope that with this intimation <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> will rest satisfied that the course of action taken by the Government will be such as will meet with his approval. </para>

                        <para>- The taxpayers have been put to considerable expense in order to assist a rival company, to the disadvantage of the cable of which we are part proprietors. Without the sanction of Parliament, and under the authority of a section of the Post and Telegraph Act - which section, I may say, was never intended to be applied in such a way - the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company have been allowed to open offices in Victoria, and in this and in other directions Governments of the past have, without any warrant whatever, extended material help to this private enterprise. This policy adopted in the past has in spirit, if not in letter, been most unfair to our partners in the Pacific Cable project. No objection would have been taken if facilities of the kind I have indicated had been extended in the case of the Pacific Cable; and such a policy would, I believe, have reduced very much the annual amount which we are called upon to contribute. Is it not extraordinary that Commonwealth Governments should have spent thousands of pounds on a rival private company and have extended no assistance whatever to the Pacific Cable? </para>

                        <para>- The British Government have advanced the money at a fair rate of interest, and that interest we pay in conjunction with the other partners. The special line gives the Eastern Extension Company an immense advantage; and the question arises why a similar privilege should not have been extended to the Pacific Cable Board. The money was probably spent by the Ministry of the day at the request of the company, and it is difficult to understand why the Pacific Cable Board was thus neglected. Our partners may rightly say that the Pacific Cable has received no encouragement whatever from the Commonwealth Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser,</inline> who attended at least one of the Conferences, will bear me out that a pledge was given on behalf of the countries who own the cable to influence traffic so as to make it a commercial success. This Pacific Cable was to be the beginning of a movement which would lead to the encircling of the globe, and to that end every effort should be made to secure its success. It is time that the Government granted facilities to the Pacific Cable equal to those which are now granted to the Eastern Extension Company. We have decided to adopt the agreement with that company, and the line running from Melbourne to Adelaide is irrevocable for ten years. The Eastern Extension Company has opened offices in Melbourne and elsewhere, and the Government, as the principal shareholder in this gigantic concern, should urge the Pacific Cable Board to open offices in the Eastern States, and to offer to the clients of the Pacific Cable all the facilities which are now offered to clients of the Eastern </para>

                </continue>
                <para class="block">Extension Company. In offering these facilities, the Eastern Extension Company have only done what any intelligent business firm would do. But if we are to take in hand a gigantic enterprise like the Pacific Cable, and have any desire to make it a commercial success, we must adopt commercial methods. We cannot afford to adopt the same attitude towards the Pacific Cable as we adopt in dealing with internal telegraphy, in connexion with which we have a monopoly, and can say to people that if they wish to send telegrams they must come to our offices. There is no need for us to provide extra facilities when our customers can go to no one else. When we are brought into active competition with one of the strongest and ablest companies in the world, we cannot hope to make the Pacific Cable a success unless we adopt the commercial methods which have already been adopted by the Eastern Extension Company. They have shown us what we should do. I mentioned twelve matters in connexion with which their clients are given an advantage as against the clients of the Pacific Cable. In strongly supporting the motion, I ask the Government, seeing that they have given a line to the Eastern Extension Company, to give a line to Southport, in Queensland, where the Pacific Cable lands, for the benefit of the Pacific Cable Company, to request the Pacific Cable Board to open offices at least in Melbourne and Sydney, to employ canvassers, and generally to see that the clients pf the Pacific Cable are given the same facilities as are given to the clients of the Eastern Extension Company. This will involve expenditure, but it will lead to a very great increase in the business done by the Pacific Cable. If the Colony of New Zealand has been so successful in diverting traffic to the Pacific Cable that three times as many messages are sent by that cable as are sent by the Eastern Extension Company's line, the example of the go-ahead New Zealand Government is one which we can well follow. If the State, after starting commercial enterprises in competition with private enterprise, permit them to take care of themselves, the result must be failure, and in this case the great undertaking in which we have embarked, instead of proving bv its success to be an incentive to the extension of such State lines throughout the world, will prove the end and the grave of all our hopes in that direction. </para>

In time of war, it is necessary that our cable should be kept open, in order that we may be advised of the movements of an enemy, and of the various precautions which it is necessary that we should take. If we have to deal with a private company, it is possible that foreign shareholders may become possessed of the majority of the shares, and be in a position practically to control the private line, to the immense detriment of the Commonwealth in time of war. If the Pacific Cable is allowed to become a burden on Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand, and the Commonwealth, it may be decided that the best thing we can do with a line which has become an incubus involving a financial drain, is to sell it. Our position would then be that the Eastern Extension Company, having maintained a monopoly for thirty years, would be able once more to rivet the fetters which we have momentarily thrown off, and we should be dictated to in the matter of telegraphic communication for all time. I urge the Senate and the Government to do all that is possible to see that every encouragement is given to the Pacific Cable - that it is at least given similar advantages to those given to the Eastern Extension Company, and to urge the Pacific Cable Board to do all that can be done to influence business in favour of the Pacific line. </para>

                        <para>- The Pacific Cable is a British-owned line. That is its justification, and that was the great plea which aroused so much enthusiasm for its construction in all British countries, and rightly so, too. We never know when war may break out, and, if foreign nations have the power to do so, they will cut cables, and create confusion.

                        <para>- I consider that the Government went out of their way to incur an unwarrantable expenditure of £30,000, to give to the Eastern Extension Company a special line. We cannot help that now ; but there can be no doubt that, it must be an immense advantage to the Eastern Extension Company. That company is at present obliged to open offices everywhere, and that must involve them in very great expense. What I would like the Government to do would be to see that the best experts in the Post and Telegraph Department are selected for the purpose of cabling, because it is a common complaint by all the big business houses that better results are obtained by cabling through the Eastern Extension Company than through the Government office. I can easily under- stand that, because every young operator must be expected to make blunders in cabling. The operators of the Eastern Extension Company never make blunders, because they are adepts at the business. </para>

Amongst other things, they keep a ledger account ; and I ask why the Post and Telegraph Department, in connexion with the Pacific Cable, should not keep a ledger account in just the same way as the Railway Department does? They could open a ledger account for the banks, the big wool houses, and merchants and traders generally. Surely their credit is good enough. </para>

                        <para>- That is so, and it is only business. If the Minister will draw the attention, of his colleagues to these matters the business of the Pacific Cable will be greatly facilitated. At present it is very much more convenient for people to do 'business with the Eastern Extension 'Company because they do what any private company would do. The difficulty is that we cannot remove red tape from a Government office. Government officials have a set way of doing business, and apparently nothing will move them out of it. What I suggest can be done. I have no wish whatever to treat the Eastern Extension Company unfairly. As pioneers they have done a great work, and are entitled to our thanks for having provided us with cable communication in the early days. We should not treat them unfairly ; but all the same, there is no reason why we should not support our own line in a reasonable way. I cannot understand why the Eastern Extension Company refuse to adopt the pooling arrangements proposed, but since they have refused the Government can, with more reason, bring pressure to bear upon them. The Eastern Extension Company can open offices in the city, but they cannot open offices all over the country. The innumerable post-offices throughout the States are receivers for the Pacific Cable Company. </para>

                        <para>- It is only natural that those who hold a monopoly should make the best use of it in. an equitable spirit, and that, I think, is what the company have done. Extraordinary agreements were entered into on behalf of four States, but the blame should not be attached to the company, but to the Ministers who put their signatures thereto. Until the formation of the Pacific Cable Company we were entirely in the hands of the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company. Although from a business stand-point we may fairly say that they did not take an undue advantage of their monopoly, still we may also fairly assume that the reduction in their rates was attributable to the coming competition. If that was so, and I think we must all recognise that it was - then how much more important is it that as the Commonwealth progresses we should feel that we are not in the hands of one cable company? The Pacific Cable Company was started to a certain extent under Imperial auspices, and it secured to us a reduction of rates on' the part of the older company. Quite apart from the sentimental aspect of the question, the Commonwealth Government should do everything in their power - of course, in fairness to the old company - to assist by every equitable means in promoting the welfare of the Pacific Cable Company. I confess that, from my little knowledge of the latter company, they have not shown that business acumen which some of us might expect from a company in which Australia and England are partners. To say that the company has been feebly administered is, I think, only to tell the absolute truth. They have allowed the. Eastern Extension Telegraph Company to continue to a certain extent the monopoly which they had to the disadvantage of the people of Australia. Although the Pacific Cable Company have had the sympathy of all portions of the British Empire, still they have allowed things to remain exactly as they were, appearing to me to be more asleep than awake. From a business point of view, they do not seem to realize the advantages which they possess, but which they will not exercise. I hope that the Government will" let the Pacific Cable Board know the views which are held in Australia in regard to their management, and point out that if they want facilities they must indicate -what they want, in order to be placed on an equality with the other company. I do not think that the Government are very much to blame for the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company continually "nagging" at them for certain privileges', and the Pacific Cable Company simply going to sleep, and resting content with what lis going on. A progressive firm, if they do not get exactly what they want, will continue to peg away until they do. The Pacific Cable Company appear to me to have let matters run on in the ordinary routine, which, I am sorry to say, marks so much Government work. They appear to have no one with any go-aheadness. Having got a certain guarantee from Australia in regard to the capital outlay, they seem to think that they have done all that is required of them. There is a great deal more to be done. If the Pacific Cable Company prefer to go to sleep, and take things as a matter of course, they are to blame if they do not get what they require. In view of the advantages which we have derived commercially from their existence, it is the dutv of the Commonwealth to assist the Pacific Cable Company as far as -it can, and, at the same time, to let them know that, in our opinion, they have not been sufficiently awake to their interests, and that if they will only rise to the occasion, we shall do our duty as partners in the enterprise. </para>

                    <para>- I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> has withdrawn the first, second, and fourth parts of his motion. I think that no one can dissent from the third part, but it seems to me that a good deal of misapprehension exists as to what our position is. Last night, Senators Higgs and Smith continually laid stress on! the fact that we are partners in the Pacific Cable business. They seemed to think that for that reason it was obligatory upon us to take active measures of interference in the management, that we - of course, I mean the Federal Government - were to do this, that, and the other. Last night. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> repeatedly used the word " we," as applying to both the Pacific Cable Board and the Federal Government. The two things are very distinct. Undoubtedly we are partners in this concern, but we are simply partners along with other people, and we have all conjointly appointed a board of management. It is this Board which is in fault in conducting the business, and as soon as the Federal Government recognise that fact the sooner we shall be on a fair way to recover some portion of the loss we have already incurred. No business could be carried on in the way in which this business is being carried on by the Board. It consists of a few eminently respectable gentlemen in London, who have no great business capacity, and who, apparently, have not taken any steps to appoint a business manager in Australia. Under the circumstances, is it surprising that the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company runs rings round the Pacific Cable Company's business, and secures the bulk of it? I do not know what the powers of the Federal Government are. but if they are going, year after year, to make up a very large portion, of this enormous loss,, they ought to insist, first, upon having an efficient voice in the Board of Management ; and, secondly, upon the appointment of an absolutely independent manager to take charge of the Australian business. When that is done, it will be for the Board to open offices, in exactly the same way as the other company have done. It is nonsense to talk of the Government giving these facilities. The Government cannot give them, but the Pacific Cable Board can. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> would only get the machinery. ,bv which this improvement of business must be effected firmly fixed in their minds, and work in that direction, a very great deal of good might be achieved. But so long as. they continue to talk of the Federal Government doing this, that, and the other, and facilities being given through the Telegraph Office, we shall get no adequate result from their agitation. We know what Government offices are. We know that, even in connexion with this telegraph business, the Government insist upon a man paying for a penny stamp if he wants a receipt for a telegram. This is not done for the purpose of revenue, but simply to defraud the sender of the telegram, it is not required by the law in any sense. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know what the other company do, but I fancy that they must s,tamp their receipts under Victorian law. The Federal Government are above the Victorian law, and, therefore, are not obliged to put a stamp on their receipts. This is a small matter, but it is just an example of the way in which the Government endeavour to impede business instead of trying to facilitate it. In a hundred other little matters public officers do everything they possibly can to stop the development of business. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that every one in a Government office is personally interested in giving to the citizens as much inconvenience as possible. I do not think that that is the fault of the subordinates. The leading idea of Governments seems to be what I have described. I could mention a dozen instances. I will give one by Way of illustration. If you go to the General Post Office in Melbourne to declare the value of a parcel from abroad the officers absolutely will, not supply you with the necessary forms. You have to go to Collins-street to buy a form, on which to declare the value. The same sort of management applies to the telegraph business. Until a manager is appointed and proper offices are opened, we shall have no efficient competition against the Eastern, Extension Telegraph Company. </para>

                    <para>- I quite agree that the Government should do everything possible to make a success of the Pacific Cable as a business enterprise. But I have risen to point out that the Government must not forget that we also have a State-owned telegraph line running through the centre of Australia to Port Darwin. If the whole of the traffic is diverted' to Southport, Queensland-, the central Australian line must result in an absolute financial loss. At all events, during the book keeping period South Australia ought to be recompensed if the traffic is to be diverted in that way, as the loss must be considerable. While I have every sympathy with the desire to secure all the business we possibly can for the Pacific Cable... South Australia ought not to be made to suffer. She came to the assistance of Australia in the early days by her enterprise which at that time she could ill afford. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to say a few words in support of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs'</inline> motion. As an ardent supporter of collectivism, I am bound to express my disappointment at the failure which up to date appears to have dogged the footsteps of the Pacific Cable. There can be no doubt, I think, that, under existing conditions, in many departments, privately managed businesses are very much more successful than are those which are publicly managed. But there is no reason under the sun why that state of , affairs , . should continue. I believe that it is as . possible to have good business management on behalf of the community as it is on behalf of a joint stock company. Holding that opinion, I think that the Senate ought to support the Government in every possible way to improve the system under which the Pacific Cable is working. We pay high salaries to officials. If they are not capable of conducting the business in a satisfactory manner, they ought °to be dealt with in exactly the same way as a private com1 pany would deal with its officers. If a private company were managed in such a manner that its manager year after year presented a balance-sheet showing a miserable failure, whilst a rival company that had probably had not nearly so many advantages, constantly showed a big balance on the right side, and paid handsome divid'ends, I think the first company would very soon get rid of its manager, and appoint some one else who would be able to conduct its affairs by more up-to-date methods. The chief defect in connexion with a State or Commonwealth managed business is that no individual seems to take a personal interest in pushing it. </para>

                        <para>- Just so. These failures are advanced by the opponents of collectivism as an unanswerable reason why that principle should not be adopted. To mv mind it is no reason. What is possible in the case of private companies is possible in the case of businesses managed in the interests of the community. What we have to do is to point out to the men who are engaged in the management of our businesses that if they do not make them a success .they will have to give place to others who will. </para>

                        <para>- I want to crush all that sort of thing remorselessly. As one who believes that in the direction of collectivism lies the ultimate redemption of the human race, I am prepared to trample down any one who stands in the way of the adoption of that system. If one set of officers cannot, or will not, carry on their business as it ought to be carried on, let us replace them, and have other officers. Let us exhaust every possible means of making this system a success, as I believe it ought to be. It has been pointed out by speaker after speaker how inadequate and out-of-date' in its methods the management of the Pacific Cable is. It has also been pointed out that the Eastern Extension Company is one of the most pushing affairs of its kind in the world. Surely the Government will poke up these people who are mismanaging the Pacific Cable. I hope it will. If it does not, the members of the Senate ought to poke up the Government. I am prepared to poke any Government out of office which will not do its duty in connexion with these matters. The Pacific Cable, instead of presenting a deficit at the end of each year, ought to be paying its way. If I were a member of the Government, I should certainly demand to know why it was not doing so. I trust that not only will <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs'</inline> motion be carried, but that every member of the Senate will consider it to be his duty to bring all possible pressure to bear upon the Government, so that they may be induced to take all the necessary steps to make this concern a success. </para>

                    <para>- Without reflecting upon the vote given by the Senate last night, I think I may say that no vote that has been cast in this Parliament during my experience caused me greater pain. But it is some consolation to find that honorable senators who voted for the ratification of the agreement with the Eastern Extension Company have expressed the hope that the Pacific Cable will be supported in every way by the Government. I do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> when he says that State institutions are not as successfully carried on as are privately-owned businesses. Take, for example, the Post and Telegraph Department. 1 think that that Department in this Commonwealth, covering as it does, such an immense area, is carried on most successfully. Whoever hears a complaint, except in an isolated case now and again, about the wrongful delivery of a letter? There was a case mentioned some time ago by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> where a letter addressed to a certain island was returned marked " Place unknown " ; but such instances are extremely rare. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> says that we ought to carry on our State-owned businesses as effectively as joint stock businesses are carried on. That is true. We need to have the most successful experts we can get in every profession connected with those enterprises. But if we want expert ability, we have to pay for it. It is a common thing in America for £10,000 per annum to be paid to a good organizer or captain of industry. I believe that .£10,000 a year was paid at one time to the manager of the Broken Hill Proprietary mine. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> wants to see our State institutions conducted successfully, but if it is proposed to pay more than ,£500 a year to a Commonwealth officer, he moves a reduction in the salary. I believe that the manager of the Queensland National Bank receives ,£3,000 a year. At all events, a few years ago he was paid £3,500. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> who is connected with banking institutions, knows that it is a common thing to pay over £2,000 per annum to an expert banking official. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> argues that these salaries are not necessary, I reply that the fact is that they are paid, and that that shows that they aTe necessary. Ability will go to the place where it receives the most remuneration. If we want our Commonwealth enterprises, such as the Post and Telegraph Department and the Pacific Cable, to be carried on successfully, we must be prepared to pay reasonably high salaries to those who manage them, and not to be constantly moving reductions. </para>

                        <para>- The Commonwealth is a partner to the extent that we hold a six-eighteenth share, the several partners being - New South Wales, with two-eighteenths ; Queensland, with two-eighteenths ; Victoria, with two-eighteenths ; Canada, with, fiveeighteenths; New Zealand, with twoeighteenths; and Great Britain, with fiveeighteenths. Great Britain advanced the £2,000,000 necessary for the work, and the partners undertook to bear any loss, and to pay interest and principal. The deficit, which was £80,000 this year is not altogether loss, a certain portion being devoted to a sinking fund for the repayment of the principal. The payment extends over forty years, by which time, of course, renewals may be required, necessitating further expenditure. The Government will be able to glean from the observations of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson, Senator Smith,</inline> and others, in what respects the Pacific Cable administration in Australia is defective. I think we ought to accept the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray,</inline> and adopt the same financial system that is carried out in the Railway Departments of the States. We should endeavour to find out if a customer is a " good mark," and trust him to the extent indicated. </para>

I was informed, in answer to a question, that the number of representatives to which Australia is entitled is two, but, in reply to further questions, I elicited the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Horace'</inline> Tozer is the only representative we have. It may be that Lord Jersey has been acting as one of the representatives ; but he is now in Australia. He was a delegate at the Pacific Cable Conference, and it may be that he no longer represents the Commonwealth in this connexion. If that be so, some up-to-date man, and not a mere figurehead, ought to be appointed to urge the Pacific Cable Board to do all that appears to be necessary in Australia to make the cable a success - to take those steps which the Government apparently do not feel themselves called upon to take. That we have not a live Pacific Cable Board is. largely the fault of our Government. New Zealand is carrying out its obligations in a very active way, as is shown by the receipts, and Canada, I also understand, has a very live representative on the Board. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Horace</inline> Tozer has done his best in the interests of the cable; but I think there ought to be a representative and also a canvasser appointed for Melbourne. One of the first duties of the canvasser should be to hunt the newspaper files, and ascertain the names of the members of the various Chambers of Commerce who pressed the British Government, Canada, and New Zealand to construct this cable, and who deputationized the various State Governments and carried resolutions in favour of the enterprise. It would be interesting to know whether these gentlemen send any of their business messages over the Pacific Cable. </para>

                        <para>- I have no doubt that some of them were active in that connexion. It ought also to be the duty of the representatives of the Board to ascertain what, and to whom, rebates are granted by the Eastern Extension Company. If good evidence could be obtained that rebates are granted, it would form sufficient reason for an early determination of the agreement entered into with the company. The Pacific Cable Board are bound by international obligation to charge every customer, large or small, the same rate, and all commercial men will admit the justice of such a policy. Imagine for a moment what the state of affairs would be if the Post and Telegraph Department were to charge a half-penny in the case of a firm who sent, perhaps, 1,000 letters, while charging the full price of twopence to all customers who use its lines to a lesser extent. </para>

It could be advertised that the Department is prepared to cable messages at a reasonable cost, and if a message be reduced to ten words for the customer, it might be reduced to five, or even to three, or one, by the Department. We saw from a recent Court case that Reuter's Agency were able to get a young man of twenty-one years of age at a salary of £75 per annum to do the coding ; and' surely the Commonwealth ought to be able to get a suitable person at , £140. </para>

                        <para>- But while the subordinates get low salaries, the heads are exceedingly well paid. I understand that the Eastern Extension Company pay their Australian manager over £1,500 per annum, with a considerable allowance for expenses, whereas <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scott,</inline> the Chief of our Post and Telegraph Department, receives£1,000 per annum. In a Department like that of the Post and Telegraph good experts ought to be paid well ; and until that view is taken in regard' to our public servants generally, we shall certainly encourage the feeling which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> says exists, that it is not worth while taking any more interest in the business than is represented by the salary. An American gentleman, who is assistant manager of a railroad company, was in Australia the other day, and gave as an objection to Government enterprise the fact that if a manager or employe made a successful suggestion he received no reward, whereas if a mistake were made there was nothing but censure. Under such circumstances, a Government servant very often says: "Well, perhaps the best thing I can do is to say nothing, and stick to my billet." I am afraid there is a good deal of truth in the opinion expressed by the American visitor. When we find in the Government employ men of high capacity and ability, we ought to give them credit for their value and pay them well. I am very gratified at the expressions of approval which have fallen from honorable senators as to the necessity for diminishing the annual loss, and for making the Pacific Cable an up-to-date business enterprise. </para>

                    <para>. - It might be as well if in a few words I were to indicate generally the nature and scope of the amendments which the House of Representatives, in this message, asks us to accept. As honorable senators will see by the schedule attached to the message, there are no Jess than eighty-seven amendments proposed, and included in these ; there are three separate new parts, one dealing with workers'-'trade marks, which the House Of Representatives has substituted for the part qf the Bill which, as it left the Senate, dealt with trade union marks ; another dealing with what is called a Commonwealth trade mark, and a third dealing with the protection of trade marks. Apart from these particular divisions, the o':her amendments which we are asked in the House of Representatives' message to accept, do not call for any very lengthy discussion or consideration. There are, for instance, amendments involving the alteration of the date in the title. of the Bill from, 1904 to 1905, and to provide that the Bill shall be brought into operation hot earlier than four months after it is passed, in lieu of the provision contained in the Bill, as it left tine Senate, that it should come into operation on a day to be determined by proclamation. It is hardly necessary that 1 should remind honorable senators that we dealt at length with this Bill last session. During the present session it has been dealt with in another place, and the amendments made in it are amendments upon the measure as «it went from the Senate to another place. Some of the amendments are necessitated by the adoption of the new parts of the Bill which we are asked to accept. Some of the earlier amendments are consequent upon alterations made in the definitions, which, in some instances, are made a little more extensive. The use of the word " person " and the definition of "Court" call for the consideration of some of the amendments included in the schedule. There are also amendments dealing with matters that were dealt with at very great length in the debate which .took place in the Committee or the Senate last year, in connexion with the case where application is made for the registration of a trade mark already registered in a single State or enjoyed or held by virtue of user in a single State. In connexion with such a case, we made provision for excepting from the effect of the Commonwealth registration of such a trade mark the particular State in which it was registered or existed by virtue of user. But the provisions we made in that regard have been re-drafted. I think that honorable senators will see that without any departure from principle they are now put in better form. A new provision included is one dealing with standardization: trade marks. This has been adopted from the most recent English legislation on the subject. When we were discussing the Bill last year, references were freely made to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fletcher</inline> Moulton's Bill, which was then before the Imperial Parliament. Since that time, a Trade Marks Bill, not entirely in conformity with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moulton's</inline> Bill' but containing modifications of the provisions of that Bill, has been passed by the British Parliament, and is now known as the Trade Marks Act 5 Edward VII., Chapter 15. We are asked to accept section 62 of that Imperial Act as clause 22a of this Bill. The only modification of that section is the substitution here of the Minister for the Board of Trade, and the use of the word "conditions," in sub-clause 1, with an exempting provision in sub-clause 3. to the effect - </para>

                    <para>Where any Commonwealth or State authority or any association or person undertakes the examination of any goods in 'respect of origin, material, mode, or condition of manufacture, quality, accuracy, or other characteristics, and certifies the result of such examination by the mark used upon or in connexion with such goods, the Minister may, if he judges it to be to the public advantage - permit such a certificate to be registered as a trade mark under this Bill. That follows the latest legislation from England on the subject. It really gives the certifying person a right in respect of his certificating mark analogous to that enjoyed by the holder of the trade mark in connexion with other goods. Provision is made for dealing more comprehensively and systematically with associated trade marks, and all cases of series of trade marks are brought within the provisions of the Bill relating to what are known as associated trade marks. In the case where an individual who is already in the enjoyment of one trade mark, and desires to register another so nearly similar as to be calculated to mislead and deceive the public, provision is made that he cannot obtain registration for that mark unless in conjunction with the other trade mark, so that the two shall be dealt with as associated trade marks. The object is to prevent the disposal of either separately in such a way that two marks should fall into different hands, and be so nearly alike that the public might thereby be misled or deceived. As honorable senators are aware, associated trade marks cannot be assigned separately. They must be assigned in association, and this, provision has been put in as an amendment in another place, with the object of protecting the public in such cases. Another very important amendment makes provision for sub-offices in the different States. We provided that an application for a trade mark should be put in before the Registrar at the Trade Marks Office of the Commonwealth, and the House of Representatives' amendment provides for the establishment of sub-offices in each of the States, so that applications may be lodged in any State, and the procedure then goes on as though they were lodged at the principal office. We are invited to make provision that in connexion with transmissions or assignments, of trade marks notice may be given so that it shall appear upon the register. It is further pro- posed that the directions in which the register of trade marks may. be rectified shall be extended by indicating other matters than those contained in the Bill as it left this Chamber. In two or three places in the schedule honorable senators will find a reference to what is called " address for service." These amendments* are proposed in order to provide proper notification of the address of parties who may be in conflict in connexion with any proceedings under this Bill. The object is to secure that a proper address shall be given by the party which shall be the address for service, so far as he is concerned, and at which notices, documents, and other matters relating to pending proceedings may be either left or sent for him by the other party, by the Registrar, or any person upon whom the duty may fall. I think I have briefly indicated the principal amendments proposed1. Apart from these. and from the new divisions, I think I may say that the amendments proposed are wholly verbal or consequential upon the adoption of one or other of the principles to which I have already referred. I may now refer to the three new divisions of the Bill dealing with workers' trade marks, the protection of trade marks from infringement, and the Commonwealth trade mark. But before leaving the consideration of the other amendments, honorable senators will remember that honorable members in another place have had the benefit of the English legislation, which has been passed since the Senate considered this measure previously. 'Some of the alterations which have been made in the Bill and which are submitted now to the Senate as amendments, have been adopted by reason of the fact that it was thought desirable to make the verbiage of the provisions of our law follow that of the provisions of the English legislation on. this subject. Some of the clauses we adopted were taken verbatim from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moulton's</inline> Bill. That Bill, as passed into law, has been altered, and the House of Representatives invites us. in dealing with the clauses taken from it, to adopt the alterations made by the Imperial Parliament. The new part, providing for workers' trade marks, is proposed in substitution for what were known as the. trade union marks provisions as the Bill left the Senate. In those provisions we defined what a trade union was, and what a trade union mark was, and we provided that a trade union mark should be registered in the manner prescribed. We made provision against the registration of any trade union mark so nearly identical with another as to be calculated to deceive. Perhaps the most important of the provisions to which we agreed was clause  76,  which provided that - </para>

We made provision in certain cases for the removal from the register of a trade union mark. The effect of the provisions was to enable any trade union to adopt a label., device, or mark for the purpose of registering it under the Bill. Having registered it the union became the absolute proprietor of the mark, and could take proceedings in the same way as any private individual to prevent the unauthorized application of the mark to any goods. We also provided that the mark should not be applied to any goods unless by the trade union itself, with its consent, or by its authority. The whole of those provisions have been struck out of the Bill by the House of Representatives, and we are asked to insert in their place the provisions which will be found on page 4 of the message, beginning with clause 73A, which provides that- </para>

                        <para>- Not at all. The attitude taken up then was that in the circumstances no union would be foolish enough to deny to a man who complied with the conditions the right to use a mark, and so jeopardise their chance of getting the sympathy of the public. But since then the provisions of Part VII. have been so amended t!ha.t an employer who has conformed to the conditions may apply the mark. Provision is made here for registration, for removal from the register, and for the duration of the term, which is fourteen years. Provision is also made that a trade mark of this kind shall not be capable of assignment either by an act of the parties or by the operation of law. </para>

I was not responsible for the. introduction of Fart VII. of the Bill, and perhaps if I had been I might have given attention to the objections' which he raised, and endeavoured to meet them. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; I am going to ask the Committee to accept these provisions in place of clauses 73 to 78. I think that, without departing from the principle of the division of the Bill known as " Trade Union Marks," its system and verbiage have been considerably improved upon ; and the more important, if not all the chief objections which were raised against the insertion of the clauses have been met, I submit, in these amendments. As the law stands at present, there is nothing, as I pointed out last year, to prevent a trade organization in any State from adopting any particular label or device or mark, and! using it for the purpose of indicating, in respect of the goods on which it is used, the conditions referred to in these provisions. There is nothing, even apart from the registration or non-registration of such a mark to prevent that organization from using all the moral suasion it can to induce the community to approve of the conditions which the marks indicate, by purchasing, as far as they possibly can, the goods on which they appear. We know that organizations of various kinds do appeal strongly to the community in connexion with the different matters for which they stand. In different parts of the Commonwealth, for instance, persons who wished to adopt a system of early closing in connexion with particular trades, banded themselves into an association and used various means to enlist the sympathy of the public. They held meetings, gave entertainments, and adopted various other means of drawing public attention to the fact that there was in existence; an association which had for its object the early closing of certain classes of shops. As soon as that was done they published the names of the shopkeepers who had conformed to their wishes, and asked the public to patronize the shops which belonged to what was known as the Early Closing Association. In precisely the same way, there is nothing to prevent a trade union from adopting a label or device to indicate that the goods upon which it appears are manufactured by members of that union ; and having adopted such a device, there is nothing to prevent the union either from advertising in the newspapers or by means of placards bringing to the notice of the community that that mark has been adopted, so as to familiarize the public with the appearance of it. There is nothing to prevent a union from using every means of moral suasion to induce the public to patronize the goods upon which its label appears. That is the present position under the law; and all that these clauses provide is that once a union has adopted a mark or label, it shall be able to register it, and that if any person pirates it, or applies it to goods to which it should not be applied, he shall be subject to a penalty. That is the whole effect of these amendments. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, anything made in Australia must stand condemned bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford.</inline> With regard to Part VIIb. of the Bill, I have not much to say. It relates to the protection of trade marks. The clauses running from 78Q to 78X I need not mention in detail. They provide for the punishment of fraud. But I wish to observe that last year the Senate dealt with a Bill called the Fraudulent Trade Marks Bill. A number of the provisions contained in that Bill have not become law, and although, in that measure, they applied both in respect of registered trade marks and ordinary trade marks that were not registered, but which served to indicate certain things to the public, Ave now, in this Bill, provide, so far as registered trade marks are concerned, for the Insertion of those provisions for the protection of trade marks against fraudulent dealers. Part VIIb., therefore, is practically those provisions, of the Fraudulent Trade Marks Bill lifted bodily out, and transferred to this measure. </para>

                        <para>-Yes; but the Bill did not become law. These clauses are " lifted " from that Bill. I hope that the consideration of the measure will proceed, and that honorable senators will find, as they discuss the different clauses, that they are not asked to accept any amendments which make any radical departure in principle from what was affirmed by the Senate when we discussed the measure last year. The amendment in clause 1, which is now before the Committee, alters " 1904 " to " 1905." I move - </para>

                    <para>. - When the Bill was passed last year it was provided that it should come into operation on a day to be fixed by proclamation. It is still provided that the date shall be fixed by proclamation, but it must be a date not less than four months after the passing of the Bill - that period is a minimum and not a maximum. Of course, if a really valid reason be shown, I shall have no objection to a recommittal, but I do not desire to make any definite promise under the circumstances. It is quite right, however, that the amendment to substitute "workers' trade marks" for "trade union marks.," and also the amendment dealing with the " Commonwealth Trade Marks " and the " Protection of Trade Marks " should be postponed. </para>

I do not know whether there were any grounds for the apprehension, but those honorable members pressed their claims strongly, and the Government consented, as it were, to suspend the operation of the Bill for the period mentioned.

To that extent it anticipates the provisions relating to the Commonwealth trade mark, and I would suggest to the Minister that its consideration should be postponed for the present. </para>

                    will see if he refers to section 62 of the English Act. Sub-clause 3 would exclude a trade union from getting a trade mark under the provision in respect of certifying conditions. The Commonwealth or a State authority may certify as to conditions, and adopt a mark for such certificate, and acquire in respect of the mark the rights of a trade mark proprietor. That is the only addition to the provision from the English Act. and for that reason it is limited to the Commonwealth or State authorities.

                        <para>- No. That subclause provides that there shall be kept a register, but there is no obligation to register. In the new clause, however, provision is made that notice in the manner prescribed mav be given to the Registrar. </para>

                    (Tasmania).- This is a very desirable clause, but I do not think it goes far enough. If I read it aright, it means that after an assignment the assignee may refrain from giving notice for as long a period as he likes ; and I am afraid that may lead to confusion. It is desirable, in my opinion, that notice of the assignment should be given within a certain time. The clause also fails in that the registration is not made compulsory.

                        <para>- I am not sure that there would not be considerable hardship in compelling registration of an assignment, and, while I do not press that point, I say it. is doubtful if we are acting wisely in allowing the registration of an assignment to be delayed as long as the assignee may choose. I do not desire to fix any unfair limit, but there certainly should be some limit. </para>

                    (Tasmania- Honorary Minister). - I understand that with regard to trade marks in every other part of the world, there is no compulsion to register any assignment. If a person does desire to register he may do so whenever he pleases, and, in any case, I fail to see what could be done with a person who failed to register. He could not be said to have forfeited his right to the trade mark.

                        <para>- He would also lose his assignment, and would, for instance, be unable, under certain circumstances, to bring an action. He would not lose the absolute ownership, but would be deprived of rights which, I think, he ought not to possess if he conceals the fact that he is the owner. His position as an assignee is not the same as that of an original owner, who has become the vendor ; and under the circumstances, it is desirable that there should be a time limit. Ample opportunity will be given to the Minister to decide what is a fair time. </para>

                    <para>- There seems to be some doubt whether, if we inserted these words, it would still be left optional with the assignee to register, but I point out that if we introduce a time limit within which registration must take place, the clause will automatically provide its own penalty, as if the registration is not affected within the time prescribed there can be no registration. The insertion of the words will, therefore, insure registration of the assignment of d trade mark within- a reasonable time, and there will be the element of compulsion to which I have directed attention. As to the desirability in the interests of the public of such registration, it may be said that it matters .little to the public whether A or B is the proprietor of a certain- trade mark. Experience has shown, however, that it is desirable that the public should1 know who represent the trading corporations and firms with which they do business. In New South Wales, and, I believe also, in other States of the Commonwealth, it has been found necessary, in the interests of the public, to pass a law to compel people trading under other than their own names to register the fact. The same principle is involved here. The original proprietor of an assigned' trade mark might have secured a certain hold upon the public by reason of the reputable manner in which he conducted his business. If the trade mark was assigned to some one of whom the public had a less favorable opinion, it would be an advantage to him to continue to permit the public to assume that the original owner of the trade mark was still, using it. In my opinion, it is desirable in the interests of the public that registration of the assignment of a trade mark should take place within a reasonable time, and for that reason I support the amendment. </para>

A man might, by assignment or transmission, be- come the owner of one or more registered trade marks. A particular trade mark might at the time, be of no commercial value to him, but three or four years later he might have gone into some industry in which it would be of use, and he would thereupon register his assignment of the trade mark in order that it might become his registered property, and he might have all the rights conferred by the Statute, and especially the right to proceed against any one fraudulently applying the trade mark to other goods. In the English Act, as well as in this Bill, the registration in such a manner as may be prescribed of an assigned trade mark is left optional with the assignee.

                    (New South Wales). - The Minister's remarks induce me to again appeal to the Committee to accept the amendment. The honorable senator has referred to two classes of transfers in support of his contentionj, but his selections have been extremely unfortunate. The transfer of land from one individual to another affects those individuals only.

                        <para>- The honorable senator must know that there is a certain disability where a mortgage is not registered, and under the land laws of New South Wales in many instances penalties and disabilities follow the omission to register a transfer. The Minister has told the Committee that the clause is similar to the English legislation on the subject. I think there is a tendency, which may not be confined to the honorable senator, when support is asked fora certain measure, to remind the Committee that the provision in question is to be found in " the English Act" </para>

If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> attaches value to this argument we should expect him to adopt the English Act in its entirety, but when we come to consider other amendments which will not be found included in the English Act, I have little doubt that the honorable senator will explain that we are a more enlightened, progressive, and up-to-date people, and propose to start where the English Act leaves off. The fact that no time limit is prescribed in the English Act is no reason why we should not prescribe such a limit here, and as no argument has been advanced! to show that it would be unwise to do so I again ask the Committee to accept the amendment of the House of Representatives' amendment. </para>

                    <para>- I think it would be a fair thing to postpone the consideration of all the amendments relating to the workers' trade marks, the Commonwealth trade marks, and the protection of trade marks, and to deal with the amendments in clauses 85 to 99.

                    <para>- This amendment seems to me to open up rather a large question. The clause as it originally stood provided that if the King was pleased to apply to the Commonwealth any law of the United Kingdom in respect of trade marks, he could do so. The amendment provides that the King can only act if the Governor-General requests him to do so. Surely that is an alteration of principle. I am not seriously alarmed, but I should like to know what is the necessity for the proposed amendment. </para>

As honorable senators are well aware, the position of the Commonwealth is such that the Crown does not interfere directly with its legislation; and it is not at all likely that unless the Crown was directly approached by the Commonwealth it would expressly extend' British legislation to Australia in any legislative field in respect of which the Commonwealth has supreme powers. We have, for instance, supreme legislative powers with regard to the registration of trade marks. It is not at all likely that . the Crown would expressly extend to the Commonwealth any legislation on that subject which might come into effect in Great Britain, without being 'moved to do so from Australia. Under these circumstances it is thought desirable to insert before the words "the King" the words "upon the request of the Governor-General." </para>

It seems rather to limit the power of the King, and does not increase the power of the Governor-General, who at any time, without the insertion of these words, can do what it says may be done. But the King, if we make the amendment, cannot act without a request from the Governor-General. Therefore it distinctly curtails the power of the Home Government to take steps which might be to our advantage. </para>

                    (New South Waies). -I think that this is a matter to which the Minister might devote a little explanation. I have not followed the reasons why the term "Trade Union Marks " has been omitted and " Workers' Trade Marks " substituted. From some points of view I prefer the former words, and' should like to know why a change has been made.

                    (Tasmania - Honorary Minister). - I have already explained that the " Trade Union Marks " provisions of the Bill, as it left the Senate, have been omitted, and in their place have been substituted provisions dealing 'with "Workers' Trade Marks." Provision is made for the registration of these marks, whether by an individual worker, an association of workers, or a number of associations conjoined1. It is further provided that anybody who falsely or fraudulently applies those marks or has in his possession for the purposes of trade goods, to which the marks have been applied, shall be punishable. The right of using these marks is not necessarily confined to the workers or associations themselves, but may be applied to goods manufactured by persons who employ workers under conditions which the marks indicate. In consequence of the substitution of these provisions-, the heading of the division has been altered from "Trade Union Marks" to "Workers' Trade Marks."

                <para>Before the tea hour I explained the effect of these clauses, which have been printed and circulated in the schedule of amendments. Last year this Bill was threshed1 out in Committee of the Senate at great length, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> moved the insertion of certain clauses which appeared as Part VII. under the heading of "Trade Union Marks." The effect of these clauses, which numbered  73  to  78  inclusive, was that a trade union which was there defined, might register a trade union mark, and no identical mark, or any one so resembling it as to be calculated to deceive, could be registered. The clauses went on to provide that as soon as the trade mark was registered, the union itself, as a corporate body, became the proprietor, and was entitled to apply it to goods, or to authorize or license any individual to apply it. Clause  77  provided for penalties if a person unauthorizedly applied such a trade mark to goods, and clause  78  set forth that a mark could, when necessary, be removed from the register. Broadly speaking., that was the effect of the clauses when they left the Senate. We had empowered a union to register a trade mark, and given to that union the same rights and privileges as those enjoyed by the holder of an ordinary trade mark under other provisions of the Bill. But a union was given the power to either use the trade mark itself, or to authorize or license a limited number of persons to do so. </para>

The object was to enable a trade union to obtain by registration property in a trade mark which would indicate to the public that the goods were made under trade union conditions - to obtain such a property that nobody could take advantage of the mark without consent. It was pointed out in the course of the discussion that the most objectionable feature of the provisions was that a union might withhold the use of a mark from an employer of union labour, because of a difference of opinion there might be with regard to some other matter.

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> Honorable senators expressed hearty approval of a principle which would enable a trade union to get proprietary rights in a trade mark, indicating that goods were made under trade union conditions, but the chief objection pointed out was that it was left absolutely to the discretion of a union to license or refuse to license others to use the trade mark. There were many expressions of sympathy with the principle contained in the provision, and the objections raised were all on the ground that a union would be placed in a position to be able to tyrannize; over employers, even though they employed union labour - that this might be made a means to force an employer to conform to some other conditions. </para>

                        <para>- Which we shall no doubt hear strongly urged. When the Bill reached another place, a number of provisions were substituted for those which had been introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> and the effect of the former are set out in the schedule of amendments. Substituted clause 73A provides, in effect, that no person shall falsely apply to any goods a worker's trade mark, which, in a subsequent clause,, is defined and described. Then no person shall - knowingly sell or expose for sale, or have in his possession for sale or for any purpose of trade or manufacture, any goods to which there is falsely applied - a workers' trade mark. No person shall knowingly import into Australia any goods not produced in Australia to which this is applied - a distinctive device, design, symbol, or label registered by any individual Australian worKer or association of Australian workers corporate or unincorporated for the purpose of indicating that articles to which it is applied are the exclusive production of workers or of members of the association (and which mark is hereby declared <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> be a workers' trade mark), or any mark substantially identical with a registered, workers' trade mark, or so nearly resembling it as to be likely to deceive. </para>

                <para>It is provided that a workers' trade mark is falsely applied unless one of several sets of circumstances occur, the implication being that when any of these circumstances do arise, it is correctly applied. The workers' trade mark is falsely applied unless the goods are exclusively the production of the worker or of the members of the association, or are - in part but not exclusively the production of the worker or of members of the association . . . and ... is applied to the goods (being goods produced in Australia) by the employer for whom they are produced, or, with the authority of the employer, by the worker or a member of the association registering the mark. </para>
                <para class="block">The last provision I have read removes <inline font-style="italic">in toto</inline> the objection referred to in the quotation I read from the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> An employer of labour, who employs trade unionists wholly in the production of a certain class of goods, may apply the mark which is registered by the association under the Bill ; he has not to go to the union and ask for their leave: Then on the other hand, it is not obligatory on any employer to apply this mark. I make this statement for this reason : I happened to be in Sydney recently, and met there a gentleman whose name is well known throughout Australia as that of a man who occupies a very prominent position. He assured me that, from what he had read in the newspapers, he understood that the provisions of this legislation were such that every employer of labour had to brand his goods as union made, and had to employ none but union labour. </para>

                        <para>- We have yet to see that. As I said when speaking before the adjournment for dinner, the present position of the law with regard to trade unions, and any other organization for that matter, is that they may adopt any distinctive label, device, or mark, to indicate .anything they please of the character contemplated by these particular provisions, and having adopted it, whether they have the power by Statute to register it or not, they can still bring it under public notice by advertisement in the press or otherwise, and enjoin the public to assist with them in providing the conditions which the mark indicates. They can use all the moral suasion at their command to influence the community to adopt the principles which they profess by buying goods that bear these particular marks. . That being the. case, in the absence of any law at all, the whole effect of these provisions is to give to these unions when they adopt such a mark the right to register it, and the right to pursue into Court and to recover adequate penalties from the man who pirates or fraudulently uses it. If we are agreed that it is reasonable that organizations _ or persons banded together for the elevation of the labouring classes and the improvement of conditions of labour, should have the right, as we tacitly agree they have, to adopt labels, devices, or marks of this character, the right to apply them to goods, and the right to ask 'the public to help them by purchasing goods that bear these brands, we have the right, and I think the duty also, to say that we shall protect them in the enjoyment of the proprietary rights they have in these marks, just as we protect the capitalist in respect of the trade mark he registers. This principle is recognised outside of Australia. The trade union mark, so far as I have yet spoken of its legality in the absence of Statute, has been adopted as a device of the kind in Great Britain in connexion with some of the industries, and the persons engaged in those industries use a great deal of moral suasion to induce the public to patronize the people who sell the goods that bear their particular mark. So far as the United States is concerned, the principle has been recognised there for about thirty years, and to such an extent that legislation has been passed to give effect to provisions somewhat similar to those now submitted to the Senate, though the public have not been safeguarded in the manner here proposed. </para>

                        <para>- I tried to be as explicit as possible, and said that I. was dealing with the English matter altogether apart from any legislation. I said that, so far as Great Britain is concerned, in some industries trade union labels have already been adopted, and moral suasion has been used to induce people to patronize those selling goods to which the labels are attached. I said that this was in the absence of legislation. In the United States of America the trade union label has been used by various trades, and it has been legalized in various States, in which it is adopted and in use. </para>

A Bill similar to this has already gone through the House, but was defeated in the Senate. This House has given its opinion three different times that the request made by the trades unions of this country in favour of a registration of the union label should be complied with. Members of this House on both sides have agreed to that principle but unfortunately the Senate has seen fit to kill each Bill to that effect as it came before that body. </para>

                <para class="block">I say that this Senate last year, by its vote ' in respect to similar provisions, affirmed the principle contained in the division dealing with trade union marks. Some honorable senators were opposed to the insertion of those provisions, because they left to the unions absolute discretion to grant or refuse the right to use them to employers. In the amended provisions the Committee is now asked to consider the provisions then objectionable to some honorable senators are deleted, and so far as the public are concerned, there are safeguards provided in these workers' trade marks provisions to meet the contingencies and dangers which honorable senators, who last year professed themselves in sympathy with the principle, but in opposition to certain clauses, seemed to apprehend. After the utterances of honorable senators on the occasion to which' I refer, and the attitude assumed by the Senate when these provisions were before it in Committee, and afterwards when it was proposed to recommit the Bill for the reconsideration of the clauses. I can confidently rely that the Committee will accept the modifications here proposed of the provisions which, were then inserted in the Bill. Because, although they provide additional safeguards, so far as the public are concerned, they do not involve any radical departure from the principle involved in the provisions which were last year inserted in the Bill on the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline></para>

                        <para>- I am sure that it helped to some extent to keep the Minister out of mischief. I am quite, familiar with the words which have been quoted. There is no single line by which I do not stand, and which is not entirely consistent with the vote I shall give against this proposal. What was the proposal before the Committee last year? It was first that a union should have the right to register a trade mark, and to say what employers should or should not use it. I said that if the union label be registered, and the power of refusing to any one the right to use 'it were taken away from the union, the objections would be largely minimized. I admit at once that the new proposal does largely minimize the evils contained in the original proposal ; but to try to make it appear, as some honorable senators wish to do, that because I regard the present proposal as less objectionable than the original, therefore I necessarily say1 that it is a good one, is, altogether a perversion of logic and fairness. </para>

                        <para>- It is infinitely objectionable, but less objectionable than the previous one. There are degrees of objection ; and whilst this proposal is sufficiently objectionable to justify the vote of every honorable senator who will vote against its acceptance, I regard it as less objectionable than the original one. </para>

I have never thought that there was anything but false courage in a man refraining from acknowledging a change of opinion. I have not made an alteration in my opinion, and therefore I have no change to acknowledge. But had I done so, I should have stood up at once and acknowledged the fact. I am quite certain that the Committee will not think any the less of a man who does change his opinion for reasons advanced. </para>

                <para class="block">Ave have had statements made, supported by records, of what has taken place elsewhere in the shape of boycotting under the legalized union label. As the result of the discussion which has taken place since the Bill was last before the Senate, I have made myself more familiar with what has taken place elsewhere, and have had further time for considering what the effect of this union label proposal would be. All the discussion which has taken place, and all the inquiry which I have been able to make, has had the effect of showing me that the more one looks at the proposal, the more pernicious it becomes. And if, when a more injurious proposal was before us, I thought that the elimination of some part of the proposal would minimize its evil effects, I still think that its effects would be sufficiently evil to justify the fears which I then expressed. It is a curious thing - and it seems to largely prove the contention that the effects are very pernicious - that it is proposed to exempt certain industries from the application of this provision. Why? If it is justifiable to authorize the attachment of a union label to goods produced under union conditions, why should any trades be exempted? Why should not all the trades have the benefit of this provision, if it is beneficial? It is curious that the Minister has passed over this question. When, by interjection, I asked him to deal with it, he became extremely petulant, and said that he would deal with it in his own time, and that he was not going to be dictated to. No one knows better than he does that it is not competent for one senator to effectively dictate to another senator. Therefore, the use of such a term was not only uncalled for, but utterly misleading. What I did want, and what I think the Committee was entitled to get, was an explanation from the Minister as to why, when he comes forward with a general proposal, certain exemptions should he made. Honorable senators on the other side, who probably know a great deal about the origin of this clause, and the reason why it is being pushed on at this late period of the session, may know why these trades have been exempted, but the Committee, as a whole, have not been informed. If there was any justification for leaving out these trades, surely it was the duty of the Minister, when bringing this new proposal before the Committee, to make us acquainted with the reason. What did he do? He did not even venture an explanation, and! he only became indignant when I pressed him for an explanation. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; but the Minister was making a general explanation in regard to all these new clauses. Surely he ought to have explained then the reason for making this exemption, and not wait until a later period, when we are considering a detail in these provisions. When the Minister was dealing with the subject generally, was the proper time to tell the Committee why these trades were exempted. If there be anything beneficial in the clauses in dispute, if they can be justified as being sound economically, of advantage to the workers, and not injurious to others, the Minister should have shown us why certain trades are denied the benefit which they will confer. Surely it is not the duty of a Federal Parliament to legislate on principles of favoritism - to confer benefits on one section which it denies to another. We ought to guard against the imputation of passing class legislation. But this legislation is entirely for the benefit of a class. While it confers certain rights and privileges on trade unionists, it denies them to persons who are engaged in other industries. On the general principle: involved in the proposals before us - that of conferring the right on trade unions to register a trade mark - I am entirely at variance. It seems to me to be utterly foreign to trie purpose of a Trade Marks Bill that there should be a possibility of registering a trade mark to indicate bv what class of labour goods were made. If I understand the purpose of a trade mark at all it is entirely different from that. I regard this as a piece of class legislation such as is being attempted with increasing frequency here. It is class legislation, both as to its origin and purpose. There can he little doubt that the clauses in Question originated within the inner circles of unionism. </para>

                        <para>- And I would carry the principle further if I could. It is justifiable to say : " These union label clauses, applied to 100 trades, are iniquitous, and therefore we. will limit them to fifty." That is a different attitude from that of honorable senators opposite, who profess to believe in the application of the union label to alL trades, and yet deny its benefits to certain trades. </para>

                        <para>- I know perfectly well that the party has spoken. I know that there is but one course open to honorable senators who are associated with the caucus. Whether there is the slightest prospect of still further limiting the objectionable features of the Bill I do not know. What I do know is that there are proposals before the Committee which, to my mind,, are seriously defective, iniquitous, and opposed to common sense and justice! Believing that to be the case, I conceive it to be my duty to oppose them and to set forth the reasons for my opposition. I presume that as we proceed it will be possible for me to address myself more closely to the details, and I shall take the opportunity to do so. </para>
