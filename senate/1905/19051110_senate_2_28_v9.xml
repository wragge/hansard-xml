                    <para>- On Wednesday, last the Minister of Defence gave notice of this motion relating to the Queen Victoria Memorial for the following day, but yesterday it was not dealt with. It is not desirable that the notice-paper should be trifled with in this way. If the Minister really did not intend to move the motion on Thursday, it would have been better if he had allowed it to stand over for a week or two. </para>

                    <para>. - I am treating this notice of motion in exactly the same way as my honorable colleague treated the notice of motion relating to the renewal of the Vancouver mail contract. Necessarily it has to appear on the notice-paper before the Government Orders of the Day. Some time ago I said that I intended to proceed with the consideration of the Commerce Bill until it was finished, because I like to take one thing at a time. I think that honorable senators were aware that, although this notice of motion appeared as the first Government business on the notice-paper of the day, it was not my intention to take it until the Commerce Bill had reached the third reading stage. </para>

            </quote>
            <para>I believe that in connexion with the Bill there are one or two matters in respect of which an understanding was arrived at in another place, that in the Senate some alteration would be permitted, and I think that its members were encouraged to expect that a change in the title would be made. Clearly the title is not a very satisfactory one. In the first place, the term "commerce" is very wide. It is, in fact, ail-embracing, so far as commerce is concerned. It is a little too big for what is proposed. It is so wide that it confines the Bill to commerce with other countries, and prevents the Government from carrying out to the full extent their alleged desire to promote honest trade. The provisions of the Bill, as they stand, cannot affect any operation, However gross it may be, in connexion with the transfer of goods from State to State. For these reasons, which I think are ample, I submit this amendment, and if it is carried we shall be able to insert a clause which will make it quite clear that the Government have power to deal with Inter-State transfers. </para>

                    <para>. - I know that the Minister of trade and Customs consulted the Comptroller-General' of Customs to see whether they could not invent a more appropriate title than the one they had chosen. Originally this was described as "A Bill for an Act relating to Im-' ports and Exports." and its title was changed to "A Bill for an Act relating to Commerce with other Countries." After considering the matter fully, they could not find a more appropriate title than the latter. It ig a matter of very little consequence what the Bill is called. The title adopted is certainly descriptive, because the Bih relates to commerce with other countries, and not to commerce between the States. It apnea rs to me that it is quite as appropriate as the one which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> proposes with a view to making: the  Bill  apply tn InterState trade as well as foreign trade. We must oppose the amendment. </para>

                    (Tasmania).I intend to support the amendment. I think, however, that it would be an improvement if the title of the Bill were altered to " Fraudulent Importation- and Exportation Act." That is what it really is, and what the Government want the public to understand that it is. The expression "commerce7' embraces many things which the Bill does not touch at all.

                        <para>- The first thing we have to do is to show that " Commerce Act" is not a correct title. The Minister has admitted that the title is faulty, and that he is not satisfied with it. Instead of scouting, suggestions for the improvement of the title, he ought to work with us in our endeavour to design a better one. Surely " Commerce Act " does not define the purpose of -the Bill. It cannot be said to deal with commerce in the larger sense of the term; certainly not in the sense in which the word is used in the Constitution. "Trade Descriptions Act," to whatever objection it may be open, is a verv much more appropriate title for the Bill, because all through" it sets out: that its purpose is to secure that there shalT be no false trade descriptions, and, in clauses 7 and n, that the descriptions shalT tally with those prescribed bv the Minister. The Bill has nothing to do with commerce as I understand the meaning of that term, but it has everything to do with the marks which are placed on goods for the purposes of commerce. The Minister is treating the amendment in too light a spirit, I think that it ought to be adopted. </para>

                    <para>- I could not help noticing that the Minister of Defence did not think it worth his while to take up the subject of making the Bill apply to Inter-State trade. The whole of the accusations which were hurled at honorable senators on this side yesterday were to the effect that we really did not wish to repress the use of fraudulent trade marks. That was quite untrue, because we are as anxious as any honorable senators can be to put down fraud, and I am taking the first step this morning to enable the Minister to have increased powers. If the title of the Bill remains as at present, the Minister's hands will be tied, however undesirable the proceedings may be that are taking place under his very nose ; and I cannot understand why he does not at once accept the suggestion. The idea mooted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlanes,</inline> that the title should refer to fraudulent importation and exportation, would also confine the Bill to external trade. If the Commonwealth has any power to repress fraudulent trade, that power should be used, not only in regard to foreign trade, but also Inter-State trade. </para>

                    <para>- Perhaps it is not too late even now to incorporate this Bill with the other (measure known as the Fraudulent Marks Bill, and give the combined measure the title of Merchandise Marks Bill. Why have two separate measures, one dealing with false trade descriptions in Australia, and the other dealing with false descriptions of goods imported or exported? Both deal with exactly the same subject. If the suggestion I have made is objected to, or considered too difficult of accomplishment, I shall support the amendment suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> as being more appropriate to the measure before us. </para>

I am inclined to think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> is correct, and that the Bill ought to receive the title of the Act from which it has been derived, because in every sense of the word this is a Merchandise Marks Bill.

The Bill as it stands is altogether too restrictive, and the most able Minister that ever lived would not be able to administer it without doing harm. I am not prepared to support any amendment of the title, if, by so doing, the operation of the Bill will be extended to commerce between State and State. </para>

                    <para>. - I listened with some surprise to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> when he suggested an alteration in the title. One of the arguments used by the honorable senator was that his amendment would give the Bill more extensive scope, and affect not only external trade, but Inter-State trade. I cannot see how the alteration would bring about that result; and I can only anticipate that, if the honorable senator is successful with his amendment, he intends to extend the scope of the measure by subsequently proposing additional clauses. It is desirable to adhere to the present title, containing, as it does, the words used in that section of the Constitution from which we derive our power to legislate in matters of this kind. There is a large ambit of legislation reserved to the States in connexion with merchandise marks and trade descriptions, and it is much better that the Commonwealth measure should bear a distinctive title, which at once conveys the information that it. is Federal, and not State, legislation. Even if we exercised our fullest authority to deal with both external and Inter-State commerce, each State would still be at liberty to pass Bills covering commerce within the State itself. If the Commonwealth Parliament pass a Merchandise Marks Bill,, or any measure of the kind, each State may do the same ; and, under the circumstances, it is better that the titles should differentiate. I pointed out last night that, so far as concerns Inter-State transactions, each State may, by domestic legislation, to a large extent nip in the bud the evils which we are endeavouring to cure in regard to fraudulent' importation. For that reason, the Government at this stage refrain - and I think wisely - from exercising to the fullest the legislative powers conferred by the Constitution, and leave the States to legislate supplementally, in connexion with the sale of fraudulent goods within their own borders. </para>

                    has given no reason whatever why we should not adopt a better title than that of Commerce Bill if one can be found, and either of the two suggested would be more accurate. If we adopt either, a new clause may be inserted providing that the BiH shall not apply to Inter-State trade, and I hope that honorable senators will not be led away by the fact that the Government wish to adhere to the present title. The words " commerce with other countries " have, in my opinion created much unnecessary suspicion, and, while there are grave objections to the Bill itself, I believe that the title has caused them to be regarded as much graver.

                    (New South Wales). - I did not assert that the change which I suggest in the title would automatically extend the scope of the Bill to the supervision of commerce between States. I merely pointer! out that if the Minister, in his very laudable anxiety to restrain fraud, desired to do that, it could be accomplished by the addition of a new clause. The term " commerce " is altogether misapplied, and the first step is to eliminate it, deciding afterwards what shall take its place.

A person is to be liable if he does not give an accurate description, and we ought to adopt that principle in regard to the title of the Bill. </para>

The title of a Bill should give some indication of the particular subject with which it deals. The particular subject dealt with by this Bill is that of merchandise marks as applied to goods imported to and exported from Australia. </para>

I hope the Committee will decide the question on its merits. The Government have admitted that the title adopted is not appropriate, and they refuse to adopt a title which clearly is appropriate. </para>

It has been repeatedly pointed out that they are proposing the adoption of a title which will convey a false impression of the nature of this measure. The Minister in charge of the Bill realizes the force of the arguments submitted by honorable senators opposite, because, while he says that the Bill deals with commerce, he admits that it deals with but an infinitesimal part of the subject. Surely a reference to the short title of a Bill should enable any one to discover the subject with which it deals. The short, title of this Bill would indicate that it is a measure relating to commerce, whilst it is merely a measure relating to trade description's. I invite the Minister to point out in what respect this Bill deals with anything appertaining to commerce, except trade descriptions. I urge the Government, on behalf of honorable senators sitting alongside of me, to take the matter into- serious consideration. I am sure that honorable senators on this side are agreed that an appropriate title should be adopted and that they will not slavishly follow the lead of other individuals in the settlement of a question which may be fraught with grave constitutional consequences.

                        <para>- Surely, when it is pointed out that there is no clause in this Bill which doe's not deal with merchandise marks, the term " Merchandise Marks Act " must be a better title than " Commerce Act," which covers many matters, that are not touched on at all ? A Customs Act, a. Shipping Act, or a General Navigation Act might be called a Commerce Act with equal inappropriateness. If it does- not matter a tittle what we call" a Bill - provided, of course, ' that deference is paid to any suggestion by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wollaston</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne - the work of the Senate will be lightened considerably. But it is the duty of the Senate to see that, legislation does not pass from this Chamber in "an imperfect form, and a defect admitted by the Minister in charge of the Bill should certainly be remedied.. If the Minister is not satisfied with the title of the Bill, and is not satisfied with the suggested title, the proper course is to postpone the clause, in order to see whether in the interim we can arrive at a' title which will be satisfactory. </para>

                    (New South Wales). - I have heard of a fly on a wheel that thought it was the moving power, and much more important than the wheel itself. That seems to be the position in connexion with this Bill. Marks are to commerce something like the fly to the wheel. The Bill, is named, not after the fly, but after the wheel. That is carrying things to a ridiculous point. As I have said before, a gentleman from any part of the world coming to Australia, and desiring to find out what legislation we had with regard to fraudu-lent marks would look up the index of our Statutes for something which indicated that purpose. He woul'd never believe that in a Commerce Act he would find provisions regulating fraudulent trade marks. I assure the Committee that I am not proposing this amendment with any wish to delay the Bil! or to injure it, but simply because' I regard it as desirable, and think that it will improve the measure.

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline>
                    has made that charge, and the members of the Government have taken no steps to resent it.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline>
                    has informed us that if we could suggest a more acceptable title he would be prepared to give way. That affords an opportunity to honorable senators.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline>
                    appears to have desired to liken the Minister in charge of the Bill to a fly. Senator Playford may naturally object to being compared with such an insect. We must recollect, however, that unless the wheel were a very big and solid one, he would certainly be am overwhelming fly, and might very well consider that he had a' great deal to do with its movement. Apart from such considerations, the representatives of the Government must realize that- the Bill has been given a title which is inappropriate. The title to a Bill is intended to indicate its purport. The title of this Bill should not make it appear to cover all commerce, when as a matter of fact it merely deals with an infinitesimal part of commerce. I dare say the Government feel that, as an amendment has been suggested by the Opposition, they are bound to stand to their guns ; but surely when they find that there is a strong desire on the part of the Committee to make a change which does not affect the character of the Bill, but merely indicates that it applies only to trade descriptions, they ought to be satisfied to accept the amendment.

When this debate commenced I listened with considerable interest to hear whether any argument would be advanced for an alteration of the title. But I have come to the conclusion that honorable senators opposite are so excited by the measure that they must either amend it or burst. That being the case, I venture to make a suggestion to them. Why do they not ask the Minister to agree that the measure shall be printed in a coloured ink? That probably would relieve them. </para>

It is the most inappropriate name that could possibly be applied. The Senate was informed some little time ago by the Minister of Defence that this Bill was prepared by the late Government. When he made that statement my honorable friend, who has a powerful imagination, was entirely drawing upon it. </para>

I am happy to say that the late Government was not in any respect responsible for this measure. I am proud to believe that they never sanctioned it - that neither in this form nor in any other form was the Bill ever sanctioned by the late Government. But what happened was this : Probably some honorable senators are aware of the history of it. When a very weak Government was in power, known as the Deakin Government- </para>

                        <para>- They introduced a measure which was called a Trade Marks Bill, and which has been dragging along a lingering existence, and waiting for a favorable opportunity to have crushed into it what are called Trade Union Marks provisions. The Deakin Government also introduced at the same time a Bill called the Merchandise Marks Bill. It was based upon a piece of Imperial legislation which has been more or- less adopted throughout the States of Australia, and is known as the Merchandise Marks Act. The object of it was to provide that a person who deals with a retailer - or it may be with a wholesale merchant - may not be imposed upon by goods which are fraudulently marked. The Bill was one to deal with internal trade. The Act in England itself, which is still upon the Imperial Statute-book, was for the same purpose. It was that measure which was submitted to this Parliament. These two Bills were introduced in the Senate, if my recollection serves me rightly. The Trade Marks Bill had embodied in it at the instance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> provisions with regard to the trade union label. When the Watson Government came into power, in order, I suppose, to make it more attractive, and to give it that facility for being swallowed which, if you dub a measure something to stop a fraud, it is sure to have withdrew the Merchandise Marks Bill from the notice-paper, and changed its title to " Fraudulent Marks Bill." Of course the object of that was perfectly legitimate. I will not say that it was to gild the pill, but it was to' suit the taste, and to make the measure more easily swallowed by some. When that Fraudulent Marks Bill was going through the Senate, my recollection is that it was subjected to a great deal of criticism from the point of view, first of all, of the Constitution, and our right to deal with matters of that kind ; and, secondly, from the point of view of the States. Because there can be no doubt whatever that the States are far more deeply interested than we are. In fact, it is a matter for a State Parliament and State administration much more than for ourselves. We have little or nothing to do with it, and nothing that we can do, so far as some of the provisions of the Bill are concerned; can possibly affect the great object which we should all entertain of securing the consumer in obtaining pure and unadulterated articles, whether of food or of any other nature - of securing that they are articles which correspond with the name under which they are described. The criticism was justly levelled against the Bill that it was <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> of our powers, that it encroached upon the domain of the States, and, in some of its provisions, that it mixed up matters that would more properly be left to a Trade Marks Bill. That is the history up to that stage. Under these circumstances, and I presume under the direction - the very proper direction - of the Watson Government, the officers set about analyzing the Fraudulent Marks Bill, and endeavoured to place on the one side the powers which they thought more properly belonged to a Trade Marks Bill, to set upon the other side the powers that seemed to encroach upon the domain of the State, and to put into a third classification the powers that they thought might possibly be applied to goods imported through the ports of the Commonwealth. The officials accordingly made that analysis and called the Bill, not the Commerce Bill, but the Imports and Exports Bill. That was the state of the draft print as I first saw it. At the time I last saw the Bill it was undergoing an examination, not by me, but By the officers, by my instructions, with a view to showing clearly, for the information of Parliament, the principal parts which were considered to bc <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires,</inline> or to encroach upon the domain of the States. The Bill was not advanced enough to be .considered by me, and of course it follows that it was not considered by the Government. The title was to be limited in the way in which it was limited, even in that suggested framework. The Bill does not deal with commerce in the sense in which it would be. understood either in the Commonwealth or outside. If we appropriate the term "commerce" to the Bill we shall debar ourselves, at least in ordinary circumstances, from using that word where it might be more appropriately used. If we were dealing with the entire subject of commerce throughout the Commonwealth, it would be an accurate title. But when we are simply seeking to make imports and exports liable to certain supervision, with a view to preventing the use of fraudulent descriptions, then I think we ought to make the Bill, even in its title, if I may use the phrase, understandable by small as well as big traders. My honorable friends must see that it will be better understood if it is called the Merchandise Marks Bill, or even the Trade Descriptions Bill, than if it is called the Commerce Bill, because the latter title is absolutely misleading. It is generally agreed that it is undesirable to give an opportunity to any one to defame or belittle us. or to say that we are legislating for the mere sake of legislating. We shall give such an opportunity if this is called the Commerce Bill of Australia. I understand that in another place it was understood - I shall not s3.v promised - that there would be no objection to delete the word "commerce." and substitute a 'word more appropriate to the purpose of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- I have not had sufficient time in which to lav my finger upon the exact phrase which was used, but if it was not absolutely promised, it was very nearly promised, that in the Senate, if the Government would not see to the word being deleted, they would offer no objection to its deletion. It is well to have a title that will describe the Bill and its objects, and we must all admit that Commerce Bill is not a descriptive title. The object of a short title is to earmark the subject-matter of the Bill, so that a man can very readily make himself and any one with whom he is dealing aware of what its purport and intention are. "Commerce" is a fine, euphonious word, but surely we can find a better use for it than by pinning it to this Bill. Certain of its provisions are taken, not from the Imperial Merchandise Marks Act, but from the Imperial Customs Act, so that literally the Bill has nothing whatever to do with commerce as ordinarily understood. So far as those provisions are concerned, it would be just as appropriate if it were Galled the Customs Act Amendment Bill as the Commerce Bill. I hope that the Ministers will see their way to consent to the deletion of the word "commerce." There seems to be some confusion as to what word should be substituted. The expression " merchandise marks ' ' is one which is well understood. It would almost enable us to have the benefit of the decisions given under the Imperial Merchandise Marks Act. The purpose of the two measures is not exactly the same, because, while the English Act relates to internal trade, this Bill relates to over-sea trade. If it encroaches, as I think it does, in spirit, if not in letter, on the domain of the States, it is very much better that it should be confined to that which we intend. </para>

                    suggested the adoption of the English title, I at once intimated my willingness to accept the suggestion, as I thought that "merchandise marks" was a better term than "commerce " to apply to this Bill.

                        <para>- Section 51 of the Constitution empowers this Parliament to legislate in respect of thirty-nine distinct subjects, and the term "commerce" might just as appropriately be applied to a Bill dealing with any one of twenty of those subjects as to this Bill. For instance, the expression "trade and commerce" is an all-embracing one, and a Bill dealing with taxation might be called a Commerce Bill, because there is the taxation of commerce. There are bounties in connexion with commerce, and therefore a Bill relating to bounties) might be called a Commerce Bill. Money has a good deal to do with commerce, and therefore a Bill relating to the borrowing of money might be called a Commerce Bill. The postal and telegraphic services have a good deal to do with commerce, and therefore a Bill dealing with those services might be called a Commerce Bill. Surely lighthouses and light ships have to do with commerce, and a. Bill dealing with those subjects might be termed a Commerce Bill. Quarantine has to do with shipping and commerce, and therefore a Quarantine Bill might be called a Commerce Bill. A Bill relating to fisheries in Australian waters might be called a Commerce Bill. Statistics have to do with commerce, and why should not a Statistics. Bill be called a Commerce Bill? In the same way, the term might be applied to a Bill relating to currency or coinage, or legal tender or banking. There could be at least twenty Bills to which with equal justice, the term "commerce" could be applied. To adopt the illustration I used before, we are giving to the fly on the wheel the name of the wheel itself. That is altogether ridiculous. Let the Bill bear a title - Merchandise Mark's Bill - which will clearly and accurately describe its subject-matter. </para>

                    <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> will peruse <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> he will find that his colleagues in another place made it clear that, so far as they were concerned, they would offer no objection to an amendment of the title of this Bill. I do not believe that there would be any serious objection offered to an amendment of the title. The word "commerce " is understood throughout the world to include all the details to which Senator Play ford has just referred. Apparently the Minister of Trade and Customs does not realize that with this title the Bill would be understood to include all classes of commerce. No greater mistake could be made than to give a wrong impression of the Bill to those who have business relations with us in the commercial centres of the world. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> to accept the amendment. I do not regard the measure from a party standpoint. I realize that we are all animated by a desire to do the best we can in the interests of the Commonwealth'; and although we may differ from the Minister's view of the effect of the Bill, surely we can all agree that its title should truly indicate its subject-matter. </para>

                    <para>- Honorable senators have only to bear in mind what has transpired since we met this morning, to realize that the amendment is not submitted in any spirit of levity, but in order to remedy a defect which has been admitted, not once, but half-a-dozen times, by the representatives of the Government. It was from that point of view that the amendment just disposed of was discussed at some length ; and now a suggestion is made which I think most happily meets the difficulty. It is admitted that the word " Commerce " embraces everything that may be brought within the wide scope of the term, whereas the Bill itself deals with only a small sectional part of commerce. </para>

                        <para>- Then let us call this a Bill to amend the Dog Act. When shaping a Bill we surely have enough knowledge of language to be able to set out with some approach to accuracy what we really mean. The Bill deals with fraudulent marks - that is the main object of every clause, with the exception of those which are essentially machinery or complementary. The very first important clause, which deals with interpretation, shows at the commencement that the whole purpose of the Bill is to deal with merchandise marks. Clause 4 provides that " A trade description shall be deemed to be applied to goods," and so forth, and clause 5, which is merely machinery, provides for inspection. All the following clauses deal with fraudulent marks, the use of which is made punishable. The whole purpose of the Bill is to insist on honest marks. </para>

                        <para>- If that be admitted, surely it is not impossible to remedy a defect the existence of which the Minister does not attempt to deny. The term "Trade Descriptions," previously withdrawn, might meet the wishes of the Committee, but some words ought to be inserted to qualify the word " Commerce." I again suggest that if there is a unanimous opinion that some improvement should be effected, and if the Committee and Ministers are not prepared at present to determine upon the accurate word or words, the proper course is to postpone the clause, or to agree that there shall be a recommittal, if a happier suggestion be made later on. That would prevent the consumption of a great deal of time, and afford the Committee an opportunity which they desire to make the Bill as perfect as possible. </para>

                    JOSIAH SYMON (South Australia}. - The Minister in charge of the Bill has, I think, a verv curious notion of what his duties are under the circumstances.. When an honorable senator submits an amendment, in order to give effect to views expressed in regard to an earlier amendment, the Minister regards it as not offered seriously. But the Minister thought it serious enough to cause him to consult a visitor on the subject before he made that statement? Did the Minister not leave the table, and take his instructions from a gentleman visible, though not in the Chamber ?

                        <para>- We all heard the answer, " Certainly not," given' in a stage whisper, and then the Minister returned to the table, and, instead of saying that he had been ordered not to consent to the amendment, he declared that he could not regard it -seriously. That is not the way in which to treat this Committee. Every amendment of the kind is serious, and is meant to carry out what the Minister desires, namely, to give a title which will clearly define the purpose of the Bill in the eyes of laymen, who, perhaps, do not read it from end to end. There was practically a promise that the inappropriate title of " Commerce Bill " would be changed. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister said that he would have no objection to the title 'being altered; but now the representatives of the Government resist for hours proposals to make a change. What has arisen <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> the meantime to induce a change of front? What is the attitude of Ministers but that of sheer obstinacy? If the  Minister  declares that, with! a majority behind him, he intends to listen to no reason,, but to have this Bill passed literally as it entered the Chamber, we shall know that we need simply submit our amendments, and save any further discussion. But that is not the attitude which ought to be assumed in a deliberative assembly - an attitude which, as no one knows better than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> himself, would render our functions and proceedings! a farce. I do not support the amendment simply because it is moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford.</inline> I ask every honorable senator whether " Commerce Bill " is a premier description? The Committee has declared on a division that it is satisfied to leave in the word commerce, and now <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> proposes a sort of sub-title, which would make it perfectly clear to everybody what part of commerce is dealt with in the Bill. The amendment would be perfectly effective; but still I think there is great force in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> has said. " Fraudulent marks," although amply sufficient to indicate the drift and intention, is not an expression, which, so far as I know, occurs in the Bill. The expression used in the Bill is "trade description." I do not support the proposal to amend the title merely because an honorable senator on this side has made it. I think the Bill might be more appropriately designated the " Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act 1905." </para>

                        <para>- It is a pity that that was not thought of before, because other honorable senators have been allowed to refer to what occurred in another place, and have asserted that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne made certain promises. I wished to quote what <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports the honorable gentleman to have said in order that there might be no misunderstanding. I can, at all events, say that he concluded with the words, "I make no promises." I hare already explained that I am not altogether satisfied with the" title chosen for this Bill, because I consider that it covers too much ground. If I could discover a more appropriate title, I should! be pleased to adopt it; but one suggestion has been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> another by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> and others again by other honorable senators, and so far as I can gather, the same objection applies to them all. It seems to me that they all cover too much ground. If we use the expression " Trade Descriptions," it may be contended that the Bill deals only with a certain section of trade. lt was originally proposed that the title of the Bill should be the " Imports and Exports Examination Act 1905," but it deals only with certain imports and exports, and that title would also cover too much ground. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> has suggested the " Merchandise Marks Act," but the Bill is only a restricted Merchandise Marks Bill, and the title suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> would imply that the Bill dealt with trade marks of all kinds and characters. I promise honorable senators that if they pass the clause as it stands I shall not have the slightest objection to its recommittal if, in the meantime, a more appropriate title than that adopted can be suggested. </para>

                    on speaking in so reasonable a way. It is not necessary to re-debate the question, since the honorable senator admits that the "Commerce Act" is far too large a title for this Bill. The measure really deals with trade descriptions, and if the words " Trade Descriptions " are inserted there is less objection to the retention of the word "Commerce."

                    might accept the amendment in that form, and if he does so I can assure him that honorable senators on this side will not regard it as binding, and it will be open to the Minister, if it is subsequently considered necessary, to propose the elimination of the word "commerce," or to substitute some other term for it, and we will assist him as far as we can.

                <para class="block">There are two good reasons for this amendment. One is that the 1st of July will be the beginning of a half-year, when new business arrangements are made, and it is for that reason a suitable time for the commencement of the operation of the Act. Another reason that weighs very strongly with me is that by the 1st of July next the Federal Parliament will, inall probability., be again' sitting, and we shall be able to review any regulations which may have been gazetted under this Bill. The matter is perhaps not of much consequence, because I do not suppose that in any event the Bill is likely to become law much before the end of December, but the reasons I have given are sufficient to induce me to ask the Committee to accept the amendment. </para>

If it were mandatory that the proclamation should be issued earlier, I could understand such an amendment being moved. But as it is, I hold that on the face of it the amendment is frivolous and trivial, and can only have been introduced for the purpose of wasting time. </para>

I hope that is in order. If the amendment is made it can only tend to endanger the passing of the Bill. That may be the object. I regard it as being an important and necessary measure, as I explained in my speech at the second-reading stage. I shall resist all amendments which I do not consider to be serious, and which will not, in my opinion, make the Bill more perfect. </para>

                    <para>- I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> is labouring under a mistaken idea in regard to this amendment. It is serious. I happen to know that some time ago it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford's</inline> intention to submit the amendment on the Bill getting into Committee. His object is only to insure that the Bill shall not come into force earlier that the 1st July next year. It may come into force at a later date than that, but at any rate he has given good reasons why it should not come into force earlier. It would still be necessary to give the six months' notice. Let us assume that the Bill receives the assent of the Governor-General next week, and that the Government then issues a proclamation bringing it into force, possibly three or four weeks earlier than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford's</inline> amendment provides. Great inconvenience might be caused by that course. The amendment has the great advantage that it makes the measure come into operation concurrently with the commencement of the financial year of the Commonwealth, and of all the States. </para>

If we do not, and the Government bring the Bill into force at a broken period of the year, and it is objected to, they will say : " Why did you not object in the first instance?" <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Puls</inline> ford cannot generally be accused of proposing amendments for the purpose of delaying business, and he is just as serious in this matter as he is in others. </para>

                    <para>- I must emphatically repudiate the imputation that I have brought forward this amendment with any other object than that of improving the Bill, and doing my duty as a senator. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> is perfectly correct in stating that he knew some time ago that I intended to propose the amendment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> is the only member of the Senate who has doubted it. I gave two reasons, and I stated them in the briefest terms possible. My reasons are first to make the coming into operation of this measure synchronise with the commencement of the financial year. The financial year for the Commonwealth, the States, and many business firms begins ora the 1st July. The second and even stronger reason is that Parliament wilt probably be sitting on the 1st July next. There will have to be regulations under this Bill, which, indeed is to be worked mainly by means of regulations. On the 1st July, when Parliament may be sitting, the regulations may be before us, and we shall have an opportunity of dealing with them. For these reasons, both of which are strong, I feel justified in asking, the Committee to accept the amendment, and shall, if necessary, call for a division upon it. </para>

                    <para>- I did not at first quite gather the effect of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford's</inline> amendment, although I was perfectly certain, knowing him as I do, and as we all do, that the last thing he would propose would be an amendment that was not seriously and honestly intended to improve the Bill." When the amendment was first proposed, I did not feel prepared to support it, as it did not appear to me to be necessary. The Bill itself provides for its being brought into operation at a day to be fixed', not being, earlier than six months after the passing of the measure. Remembering that we are now in the middle of November, and that we understand - at least I gather from statements in the press - that we may be here for five or six weeks longer- </para>

But it is an argument which will be used when any amendment which my honorable friend may consider of importance is offered. He will then say, "For goodness sake do not try to carry that amendment, because, if you do, it will lead to fresh debate in the other Chamber, and imperil the passage of the Bill. ' ' I quite appreciate his objection, but the result will be that if we give it logical effect we shall move no amendments. We shall simply say, "The other House would debate our amendments for a week or two, therefore we had better leave the Bill alone." I am quite sure that mv honorable friend does not wish to put us in that position. </para>

                    <para>- I hope that party feeling will be kept out of the discussion as far as possible. The amendments which have been moved to the clause may have been instigated by a little party feeling, but if, after consideration, they are found to be based upon commonsense, they ought to be adopted. I cannot understand why the Minister refuses to accept the present very sensible amendment, to secure an opportunity which we all desire, and that is to deal with the regulations, if possible, before the Bill is brought into operation. Where so much is left by the Bill to prescription and regulation, it is most essential that we should have an early opportunity of discussing the regulations. </para>

                    the amendment is of little moment, and a. number of honorable senators consider that it is of some moment, then from his stand-point he might well advise the Minister to accept it, and so let us get on with the business. I do not take exactly the view which Senator Symon takes. He says he doss not see that the Bill can be assented to before the first of next year. But I see the possibility of the royal assent being given at least a month earlier than that date.

                        <para>.- Why does the honorable senator express that hope? Because he wants the Bill to come into force on an earlier date. In view of the fact that the Bill has been upon the stocks for such a long time, I assume that, once it has obtained the Royal assent, the Government will very quickly advise the Governor-General to issue a proclamation bringing it into force. I can only assume from the interjection of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> that he would like the Bill to be assented to in the coming week, the proclamation to be issued immediately afterwards, and the regulations to be gazetted two months, possibly three months, before the Senate could have an opportunity of considering them. It would be monstrous to take such a course, and an assurance would be acceptable that Parliament will meet again before the Bill absolutely comes into force. It is only fair and reasonable that the Government should meet the Opposition in a trifling matter of this kind; even the amendment may, by some honorable senators, be deemed unreasonable. When a Government, in consequence, possibly, of the attitude taken by their supporters, decline to  give way on minor points, they simply invite opposition, and further discussion. If the Government are prepared to accept the suggestion I have thrown out and to give the assurance indicated, there will, so far as I can see. be an end to the debate. </para>

Now, it is contended that the regulations under this Bill must be reviewed. </para>

I cannot understand that spurious kind of democracy, which, instead of saying, " Another man is as good as myself," says, " I am much better than another man." I do not quarrel with the honorable senator for having his own opinion, but surely I have the right to an opinion of my own ? </para>

Only last night we were told that there was nothing to be afraid of in the regulations. Why? We were told that a Minister could not do anything very wrong, because the regulations have to be submitted to Parliament, which has the power to punish a Minister. That was the reply which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> gave when I directed attention to the enormous powers conferred on the Minister who will have the administration of the Bill. It is prevention more than cure which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford's</inline> amendment seeks to attain. If the amendment be carried, there will be greater assurance that Parliament will have reasonable time to consider the regulations.

                        <para>- That was not due to any Ministerial act, but in order to comply with the Constitution, that being the first session after the general election. The practice is, and it must be continued, to call Parliament together towards the end of the first half of the year - that is, the end of the financial year. I think I am correct in saying that this year Parliament met in June. Assuming that Parliament meets next year, well on towards the termination of the first half of the year, it will be inevitable that a long discussion will subsequently take place on the Address-in-Reply to the Governor-General's Speech. In the course of that debate, a motion may be moved involving the fate of the Government, and if the practice which has hitherto obtained is followed the Senate will adjourn during the time that motion is under consideration, and we shall have no opportunity of discussing the regulations framed under this Bill until after the stipulated time set out in the Acts Interpretation Act. That Act allows thirty days for the presentation of the regulations' after they have been published. If they are published early in May they need not be presented until thirty days afterwards. Something may happen in another place in the meantime, which will lead to the adjournment of the Senate, and we shall have no opportunity to consider the regulations. </para>

                        <para>- I am opposed to the Bill if the clauses to which I refer are to be retained, but I still hope that honorable senators opposite may be induced to agree to some amendment. In the event of the contingencies to which I have referred, it would be impossible for the Senate to have sufficient time to discuss regulations framed under the Bill, unless the amendment is agreed to. If it is accepted we shall at least secure the two or three weeks' additional time, and we shall have better assurance that the regulations will come before us in time to be considered before they become operative. It has already been contended that enormous powers are proposed to be conferred on Ministers under clause7 - powers which find no parallel in any other legislation the world over. The Czar of Russia has no greater powers than those conferred on the Minister in this Bill. In view of the further fact that these powers are absolutely vague, that there is no indication as to the limits to be placed am their exercise, and that the Minister is at liberty to apply the provisions of the Bill to seven-tenths of the imports and exports of Australia, the matter is certainly serious, and it is incumbent upon the Committee to see that ample time is given for the discussion of regulations framed under the Bill before they are put into operation. It is on this account that I am now pleading for an extra week or two, and the answer is that the matter is not worth fighting about. It will make all the difference between the Senate having an opportunity to consider the regulations and losing that opportunity. Will honorable senators opposite contend that it is an insignificant matter that Parliament should exercise some control over the Executive? If I were to put the question to them in an abstract form, they would admit that Parliament should exercise control over the Executive, and yet the only way in which the Senate can expect to exercise that control in connexion with regulations framed under this Bill is by agreeing to the amendment. </para>

                    (Western Australia).I may, perhaps, have used rather strong terms in the interjection which I made, but I do believe that there has been a waste of time in the consideration of this Bill in Committee. I do not think that the importance of the amendments proposed on this clause justify the time occupied in their discussion. We have not yet passed one clause of the Bill. I asked several honorable senators whether they were prepared to sit all night to consider this Bill, and we are certainly justified in talking of sitting all night when we find honorable senators on one side prepared to talk until they get what they want, especially when the amendments they desire to see made are not important: When I spoke of sitting all night, I did not mean that we should do that if we made reasonable progress.

                        <para>- Well, I withdraw the word "twaddle." What I say is that I shall be prepared to sit late, if reasonable progress is not made. I speak entirely for myself. I am not the leader of the party to which I belong, nor do I hold office in it. This is not a party question, although honorable senators opposite appear to desire to make it one. If honorable senators were in earnest they would reserve their criticism until we came to the more vital clauses of the Bill. Any amendment then sought to be made for the betterment of the measure will receive my support, whether the Government approve of it or not. I admit that an attempt was made by me to organize a number of honorable senators who were prepared to sit late. But I deny that there was any desire to gag any one. </para>

                    for the little lecture that he has given them. It was just as well that he should have an opportunity of explaining his attempt to apply the gag.

We do not know now what course the Government propose to take. I do not think any one has a right to blame <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft</inline> for his attitude. He had a perfect right to make a certain suggestion, and has explained his reason. I gather that he had no intention of applying the gag, as it is termed. But any ordinary man, much less an Englishman, an Irishman, or a Scotchman resents anything in the nature of the application of the iron hand. I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft</inline> would set himself up to be the infallible judge of what was sufficient progress. </para>

                        <para>- It is my desire to suit the convenience of the Committee. In doing so, I am more likely to conduce to a smooth method of carrying on business. If honorable senators desire at a stage in Committee to ascertain what course is proposed with regard to the progress of business, I do not consider that I ought to act upon the strict letter of the standing order and compel the discussion to be applied absolutely to the amendment before the Chair. But I would urge honorable senators not, on every amendment to a clause, to ask the Minister how far he proposes to proceed with the Bill. If it be the wish of the Committee to ascertain his intention, perhaps it will hear a statement, and, as soon as it has been made, consider the question before the Chair. </para>

Does he intend on this - the first day on which the Bill has been in Committee - to sit after the usual hour of adjournment? If he does, then we shall endeavour to ascertain how much longer he proposes to sit. Certainly this is the first occasion on which I have known any departure from the ordinary course of procedure in regard to the details of a Bill during its first day in Committee to be suggested. If it was the second or third day on which the Bill had been in Committee, not after three months, as was the case in another place, and my honorable friend wanted ray assistance in bringing the discussion to an early close, it would be given. He knows perfectly well that never in any House of Parliament has an attempt been ma(ie to force a Bill of importance through Committee at the first sitting. I take the liberty of asking my honorable friend to state definitely whether he intends to keep us here after the usual hour in order that some at present undefined progress may be made? </para>

                        <para>- This is my first speech to-day, and I think I have an absolute right to say why I support the Government in their 'action. One argument which' has been used in favour! of the amendment is that, because the financial year will end on the 30th June, the Bill should be brought into operation on the 1st of July. It contains no financial proposal1, and it would be just as reasonable to ask that it should not be brought into force until the 12th July - that day of. "pious and glorious memory." With regard to the regulations to be made under the Bill, it has been suggested by several honorable senators that the Parliament will not be in session before the 1st of July. Have they a single reason for making that suggestion? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> attempted to justify the suggestion by stating that there was an inclination on the part of Ministers to keep in recess as long as possible. Probably he has formed that impression from the fact that the Government which he supported last year delayed calling the Parliament together longer than any previous Ministry had done. Honorable senators know that of necessity it must be called together early next year, because there must be an early dissolution. </para>

I think that it already provides for ample opportunity in that regard, even if the Parliament should not meet until the 1st July. The provision is that we shall have fifteen sitting days in which to disallow any regulation. </para>

                        <para>- That may or may not be ; but I have never known a Government table regulations before they came into operation. I do not think that any Government would have regulations sent back to them in; the absence of any test of their efficiency, and I hope honorable senators opposite will give way on this matter, which, after all, is not vital. When the Arbitration Bill was before us, amendment after amendment, moved by the supporters of the present Government, was rejected by the Opposition, who were the supporters of the Government then in office, and who declared that they would adhere to the measure as presented. But when that Bill was sent to another place, it was returned with an amendment almost identical with one which had been moved by senators who now sit on this side of the Chamber, and was immediately accepted by honorable senators opposite. In a matter of detail it is a good principle to allow the draftsman to word a provision, as he is best able, and then have it revised by the Minister and discussed by the Executive; and under such circumstances this clause may very well be accepted. </para>

                    <para>. - I have been asked whether I intend to ask the Senate to sit after four o'clock, and I reply that that is undoubtedly my intention, unless fair progress is made. I have a right to expect that a certain amount of progress shall be made with the Bill, and I remind honorable senators that we are sent here, not to talk, but to do business. True, we must express our views in order to do that business ; but there is no necessity to speak at length on subjects which really have no connexion with the measure, and only serve to waste time. I may reasonably be asked what I should consider to be fair progress. It has been suggested to me by some of my friends that it is not wise to express an opinion on such a matter until progress has been made; but I think it is only courteous to senators <inline font-style="italic">an</inline> both sides of the Chamber to answer the question.

                        <para>-All the more important features were discussed at length, though I admit that we did not discuss this particular clause, which I regard as of little or no importance. The Bill naturally divides itself into three parts, and I think a fair proposal would be to devote a sitting day to considering each part in Committee. That would give honorable senators ample opportunity to express their views, which, of course, they ought to do, as concisely as is consistent with clearness. If at four o'clock we have dealt with the first four clauses, I think I could regard that as fair progress. The next part of the Bill deals with the inspection of imports and exports, and the third part relates to the prohibition of exports and imports. The whole of Tuesday might be devoted to " the second part of the Bill, and the consideration of the measure concluded on Wednesday. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> cannot myself make progress, because the Bill is in the hands of the Committee; but I can rightly ask honorable senators to remain until a fair number of the provisions have been dealt with. </para>

                    has put the matter very fairly.

I am afraid that, in those first four clauses, there are a great number of matters of a very controversial character, and, without arguing them further at this stage, I should like to say, in reference to

                    very moderate, proper, and business-like statement, that under the heading of " trade description " there are many departures from the language of the Merchandise Marks Act, involving serious and grave questions. Under the heading of " false trade description " also there are departures, especially in the phrase " likely to mislead," to which I intend to call attention. Anything I have to say shall be characterized by brevity ; and, while I frankly welcome
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline>
                    Playford's statement, I point out to him that it is possible, before we reach clause 4, for him to be satisfied, on hearing the amendments which honorable senators may desire to move, that the business done justifies him in asking the Chairman to report progress. In the meantime I shall ask honorable senators who sit with me on this side to assist the Minister, not overlooking amendments, or withholding or refraining from repeating, if necessary, arguments again and again, while confining their remarks within reasonable limits.

                    GOULD (New South Wales). - The point- of order which was raised has had the effect of eliciting a statement from the Minister as to what he considers fair progress, and has afforded
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline>

                    has very courteously intimated to us what he desires, but I point out to him that very often four clauses of a Bill contain more debatable matter than another fourteen. It is not always possible to gauge the progress made bv the number of clauses passed.

There is an old adage that " prevention is better than cure," and I would rather see this question settled forthwith. I am aware that some honorable senators on the other side may think that this so-called amendment comes under the classical definition of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> as expressed ' last night, of a " deleterious adulteration " of the Bill. That strikes me as not at all a bad expression, although it is one that is somewhat Givenish.. As I say, it is my intention to vote for the amendment, and I hope honorable senators on this side will strengthen the hands of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> in his support of the efforts of the leader of the Senate to get through the Bill as quickly as possible. </para>

                    (New South Wales). - I cannot understand the attitude assumed by Ministers towards the amendments I have moved to-day. I think that there is some misunderstanding as to the duties and privileges of private senators. I take it to be the duty of all honorable senators to. study Bills in detail, as far as they can, and naturally there are some who understand certain classes of Bills better than do others. I am very seldom found proposing amendments in Bills relating to matters which I do not thoroughly understand ; but I do claim to know 'something about trade and commerce. I have repeatedly drawn attention to the continuous proposals for government by regulation. Measure after measure is laid before us in which we are committed to that policy. The Committee cannot wonder, therefore, that when I found that this Commerce Bill was to be administered almost absolutely by regulations, I realized the probability of its coming into force some time before Parliament had had an opportunity to discuss the regulations. Can honorable senators wonder that I seek to prevent that possibility? Had
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor,</inline>
                    now justice O'Connor, been in charge of the business to-day, and had seen that the simple amendments proposed did not in any way conflict with the principle of the Bill, he would have accepted them straight away, and we should have made a great deal more progress. With these few words, I am prepared to leave my amendment with the Committee.

I need not tell honorable senators that the sections of the Customs Act are very severe, nor need I remind them that various cases of most severe hardship and of undoubted injustice have occurred in connexion with the administration of that Act. I have in mind a case in which the cook of a foreign ship sold a cask of ship's waste fat, generally known as " slush," which was bought for the purpose of being used in the manufacture of soap. Both buyer and seller were brought before a magistrate in Newcastle, and fined. The cook was. fined <inline font-style="italic">£5,</inline> which the captain of his vessel paid, and he was able to return to his ship, but the man who bought the " slush," being a poor huckster,' was unable to pay his fine of <inline font-style="italic">£5,</inline> and went to gaol, and he was kept there for one month. </para>

                        <para>-" Shameful " is a weak term to apply to it. Under this clause a man guilty of some merely technical offence against the provisions of this so-called Commerce Bill may be sent to gaol. It will be admitted that I have urged exceedingly strong reasons why the Committee should negative this clause. There is another reason to which attention might be directed. . There is a possibility that the passing of this clause in the Bill will render it invalid. Honorable senators will be aware that the Customs Act is incorporated with the Tariff Act. By the incorporation of this Bill with the Customs Act, which is also incorporated with the Tariff Act, we may bring about a state of things which might justify the High Court in deciding that this Commerce Bill does not comply with the provision of the Constitution, which requires that a measure of taxation shall include no other matter. If we tack this Bill on to the Tariff Act, as the result of its incorporation with the Customs Act, we shall probably have done that which, according to the Constitution, will invalidate the measure. Ministers might do well to consider that point. It is not one which greatly concerns me, because if this Bill were declared by the High Court to be invalid, I should not feel disposed to weep very much over it. I am, however, inclined to grieve over the prospect of the authorities having the power to bring the severe penal sections of the Customs Act into operation for the punishment of people who may make some slight technical error in the marking or shipping of goods. I have every confidence in asking every honorable senator who is prepared to consider the just claims of the people to assist me in negativing this clause. </para>

I do not propose to address myself to the point raised that the incorporation of this Bill with the Customs Act, and through if with the Tariff Act, may render it invalid.

                    <para>- I suggest that it is advisable to strike out the word " suggestion " in the first paragraph of the definition of "trade description," because of its dangerous vagueness. The words preceding it are " description, statement, indication." Those words are sufficient to make clear what a "trade description" is. The word "suggestion," however, seems to offer the possibility of complications arising, if a magistrate were called upon to give a judicial decision on that point. All that can possibly be covered by it is set out in the previous words, and " suggestion " is so exceedingly vague that it ought not to be retained. I therefore move - </para>

When I subsequently quoted the English Act, it was made clear that its words are those which appear in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d,</inline> which has relation to the mode of manufacture. The two things are totally different. The paragraph which is taken from the English Act deals with the operations themselves; the other deals with the persons who perform the various operations. It appears to me to be obvious that the only purpose for which paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> can be required is to place it in the power of the Government to demand something equivalent to the union label.

                    (Tasmania).The object of this provision is largely provided for in the Customs Act. But of what advantage is it to know who is the selector or packer of goods such as apples? What advantage is it either to a buyer or the Customs officers to have that information ? What does any one care who selects apples, or packs them, or picks them off the tree? They are sold according to their good or bad quality. This provision goes too far altogether. In many cases it would be impossible to comply with it.

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> is shifting his ground. He has said that the definition of false trade description has to be read in conjunction with the definition of trade description. That is to say, that two paragraphs dealing with different things in the interpretation clause must be read together. If that be so, then1 I contend that any two paragraphs in the clause must be read together. Does the Minister mean to tell me that the paragraph interpreting what is meant by " Officer " cannot be considered by itself, but has to be read in conjunction with another paragraph ? It is obvious that each para graph stands by itself. If I were asked to pick out one portion of the Bill as being clear and free from ambiguity, it is the portion which says - " False trade description " means a trade description which, by reason of anything contained therein or omitted therefrom, is false or likely to mislead in a material respect. </para>

                    <para>- I do not follow the Minister in his contention that if paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of this clause were omitted, and a person were to put a false name on a case, there would be <inline font-style="italic">no</inline> means of prosecuting him under clause 12. The interpretation clause tells us what "false trade description" in relation- to any goods means. It is perfectly clear that if we were to strike out paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of the definition of "trade description," and a person were to omit to do any act required to be done by the regulations, he would be liable to punishment. But if he were not required to put on the goods the name of the manufacturer or producer or person by whom they were selected, and he saw fit to put on a case a name which was not correct, and was likely to mislead, surely that act on his part would come within the offence of making a false trade description. I cannot see that " false trade description " hangs on "trade description." It is to me perfectly clear that if a person, although he was not required to put on his goods the name of the manufacturer or packer, were to put on a. false name, that would be regarded by the Court as a false trade description if it tended to mislead. If, for instance, a man were to incorrectly use the name of Jones, and it was well known that goods branded with that name would sell at an enhanced price, he would be misleading the public and rendering himself liable to the penalty provided in -the Bill. If no stronger reason can be advanced for the retention of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> than we have heard, I do not see why it should be retained. In their circular letter, Messrs. Jones and Company, of Hobart, point out that they are doing a considerable trade with merchants in South Africa on the condition that the label shall not disclose by whom or where the goods were manufactured or packed. The firm simply receive an order to supply a certain quantity of goods, and the consignee has the right to put on any brand he may see fit in South Africa. </para>

                    <para>- The amendment I am about to propose is the last on my list prior to the end of clause 4. I draw attention to the fact that under the interpretation clause a trade description includes " a Customs entry relating to goods," and, in my opinion, a fair reading of the provision is that a Customs entry may be made to include not merely the terms of the Customs. Act, but. also the terms prescribed by the regulations under this Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgins,</inline> who is a supporter of the Government and a well-known legal authority, has not the slightest doubt that the provision could be so used, and the Comptroller-General, while not agreeing with that opinion, has, with a view to meeting objections, suggested -certain words, the insertion of which I now intend to move. It is desirable that under the circumstances , we should take precautions against any possible danger, and therefore I move - </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>That after the word " goods," line 25, the following words be inserted : - " but in any Customs entry no further description of any goods shall be necessary other than such as may be required under any Customs Act in force." </para>
                <para class="block">If the Minister prefers that the words should appear in the Bill as a separate clause amongst the miscellaneous provisions, I shall be quite willing to withdraw the amendment for the present. </para>

                        <para>- There can be no danger in the amendment, because it only provides for what Ministers say is already law. There is good ground for the opinion that more than appears on the face of the provision might be required - that all the matters under the head of trade description might be required to be set out in a Customs entry - and, backed by high legal authority, as it is, the amendment is a most reasonable one. I have spent much time in endeavouring to improve the provision, and I do not think there ought to be much hesitation on the part of the Committee in accepting my proposal. </para>

                        <para>- I think a separate clause would be better. Honorable senators will see that a reference is made in the clause to a Customs entry. That entry is brought within the definition of a "trade description," which in its terms is purely inclusive. It includes all those matters dealt with in the lettered paragraphs, and also " a Customs entry relating to goods." A. Customs entry is something definite and known. Because the provisions of the Customs Act prescribe the details which it shall set forth. That being so, we cannot, by virtue of the fact that a Customs entry becomes, by an inclusive definition, a trade description, so amend the Customs Act as to provide that a Customs entry shall contain anything further than the law now prescribes it shall. We do not, by this, alter the present well-known meaning of a Customs entry relating to goods. We are not defining a Customs entry in 'this Bill, hut are using a known term to help us, by way of definition, to explain something else. We could only alter the meaning of a Customs entry by an amendment of the Customs Act.. </para>

                    argument is that the mere fact that the words, " a Customs entry relating to goods," are used here, will not in any way alter the law with respect to what it will be necessary to insert in a Customs entry under the Customs Act.

                        <para>- The contention pf the Minister is that there is no necessity for the amendment, and that it can do no possible good; but I did not understand him to contend that it could do any harm. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> has pointed out that a well-known lawyer, whose opinion is entitled to considerable weight, has expressed very strong views on this question in another place. I submit that the Government might accept the amendment, .retaining the right to have the matter considered later on, when, if it became obvious that it was unnecessary, it could be struck out on reconsideration If they are not prepared to do that, the Government might consent to the insertion of a proviso, or a new clause embodying the amendment, in which case, I have no doubt, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> would be willing to withdraw the amendment at the present stage. If no promise is given in connexion with the matter, I presume it is because Ministers know that the numbers are up. _ The amendment' will then" be defeated at this stage, and it will be left to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Puls</inline> us]-* ford to see whether he cannot have the matter reconsidered, when there will be a further discussion upon it, which might be avoided by the adoption of the course I have suggested. </para>

                    might have been a little more generous. I am asking the Government to permit me to insert in this Bill :in amendment which will make clear the view which they say is their own, and which they believe is certain to be recognised. As I have already said, a well-known legal authority,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgins,</inline>
                    has stated that he has not the slightest doubt that the clause as it now stands can be held to render it necessary to include in a Customs entry any or all of the, matters that come under the head of a trade description in this Sill. It would, of course, make the possibilities in connexion with the Customs entries of a frightful character. I therefore feel that I am fully justified in asking Ministers to consent to the amendment, or to promise that they will accept it in the form of a new clause at the end of the Bill.

                    <para>- I am very anxious that any amendment likely to improve this Bill shall be introduced, but I do not quite follow what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> desires in this matter, lt is provided in this clause that a Customs entry relating to goods shall be a trade description within the meaning of the Bill, and, as .1 understand the amendment, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford'</inline> proposes to define what a Customs entry is, In the absence of any further explanation of the honorable senator's intention, I scarcely think that necessary, because a Customs entry is a Customs entry. I am quite sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> knows more of the practical or business aspect of these matters than I do, but if his intention is merely to define a Customs entry, I would ask him to consider whether his amendment is really necessary. We are aware that in England a Customs entry relating to goods has, by an amendment of the Merchandise Marks Act. been included as a trade description. A. Customs entry relating fo goods is a well-understood term, and if I am right as to the honorable senator's intention, I would ask him whether he thinks it worth while to press the amendment. </para>

                <para class="block">I may repeat that the words in question have been drawn up by the Comptroller-General of Customs, who, while expressing the opinion that they, are not needed, has suggested that if the opinion prevails that something of the kind is necessary, they might be accepted in the form of a new clause. I have submitted them as an addition to the clause before the Committee. It appears to me that the possibilities of this very wide term are so great that it would be wise to limit them to the actual terms required. </para>
