                    <para>- With some diffidence, sir, I rise to draw your attention to the fact that a measure dealing with this matter is likely to come before the Senate. May I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> that he should postpone the notice of motion until next week, with a view to consulting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> and asking his permission, either to move the motion on his behalf, or to allow it to drop off the notice-paper. Otherwise the Senate may be hampered at a later stage if the question is sought to be discussed in his absence. </para>

                        <para>- I think we shall have to make an alteration in our Standing Orders in reference to this matter. Under the Standing Orders of the House of- Commons no honorable member can give notice of a motion for. more than, four sitting days ahead, but our Standing Orders contain no such &#39; limitation, and an honorable senator can give notice of a motion for a date months ahead. That precludes the Senate from discussing the question, because to do so would be to anticipate the discussion on the motion. It is a state of affairs which, I think, ought not to continue, and I intend to ask the Standing Orders Committee to consider it. It is not right that one member of the Senate should be able to put a motion on the notice-paper, and thus, prevent any discussion of its subject-matter. Under the present Standing Orders, however, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> has merely to state that at the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> he postpones this notice of motion to a certain date. </para>

Honorable senators will, I think, see the position. A notice of motion on the paper is the property of the mover, and no one else can move it, except at his request, and on his behalf. If it is called on and is not moved, either by the honorable senator who has put it on- the paper or by some one on his behalf, it falls off the paper. But the Senate cannot insist on discussing it, because it cannot be moved except by the senator who has given notice. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> on behalf of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> ask that notice of motion No. 3 shall be postponed until 9th November ? </para>

                        <para>- From the honorable senator&#39;s attitude and his remarks about it. My reasons for preventing the motion going as formal were these: In the first place I desired to direct the attention of the Senate to the fact that the Committee originally appointed was directed to inquire into the question of old-age pensions. The Committee last .appointed was constituted for quite a different purpose. There was no direction to it to inquire into any matter connected with old-age pensions. As far as the evidence taken by the first Committee relates to the tobacco industry, I am quite in accord with its being referred to the second Committee. But we are asked to hand over to a Committee appointed solely to deal with the tobacco business, evidence upon the question of old-age pensions, with a direction to the Committee to report. To report upon what? Upon old-age pensions? The Senate has not sanctioned the appointment of a Committee for that purpose. By a side wind -I use the term without arty sinister meaning - we are asked to empower a Commit- tee to report upon a matter which has not been specifically referred to it. I hope I make my point quite clear, that the second Committee was authorized to inquire into the tobacco industry, and the existence of an alleged combination of tobacco manufacturers; and, if such combination exists, the effect upon the tobacco growing and manufacturing industries of Australia, and upon the Commonwealth itself. The first Committee, however, was appointed to inquire into the question of raising funds for old-age pensions. Seeing that this motion is not merely to hand over to the. second Committee, the evidence taken by the first Committee, but is a direction to report, I object to the procedure proposed. If it were merely a direction to hand over to the second Committee the evidence for what it is worth, well and good; but the Committee is specifically called upon to report on the evidence taken primarily with regard to old-age pensions. </para>

                        <para>- If that contention be correct, I cannot compliment my honorable friends opposite on the drafting of the motion. I can only assume that the motion means what it says. Another matter to which I wish to direct attention is this : I believe that honorable senators will quite understand that in what I am about to say, I speak with an entire absence of any personal feeling towards any of the members of the Committee. I think that it is desirable, with all the emphasis of which I am capable, to direct public attention to the fact that six out of seven of the members of the Committee to whom we are referring the gigantic proposal to create a public monopoly and to launch the Commonwealth upon a system of manufacturing, have declared themselves in favour of the proposal. </para>

                    <para>- The Senate has appointed a Select Committee to consider the alleged tobacco monopoly. I do not think that any honorable senator is in order in reflecting on that Committee. But I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> contends that the Committee recently appointed is not the same as that which took evidence last year. It is differently constituted. </para>

                        <para>- If it will allay any anxiety, I will withdraw them again. I find some little difficulty, in my desire to observe your ruling in determining how far I can discuss the matter from the point of view in which it presents itself to my mind. My objection to send this evidence to the Committee recently appointed is, as I have indicated, that it is not the same Committee as took the evidence on the previous occasion, and also because the latter Committee was appointed for a totally different purpose. My second objection - and here I fail to catch the exact scope of your ruling - is to the evidence going to the second Committee because of its composition. I do not reflect upon the action of the Senate in appointing the Committee, or upon its competency for the work. I point out - if I can say so without offending the rules of debate - that the members of the Committee have expressed themselves in favour of a certain course of action. For that reason I feel that whatever my own views may be, it is extremely undesirable to refer a debatable matter of such great public importance to a Select Committee, the members of which, with one exception, have declared themselves as holding a certain view. </para>

                        <para>- I am afraid honorable senators are getting a little wan-i, and, perhaps, if I point out one matter, it may have the effect of limiting the discussion. The motion asks that the evidence taken before the Select Committee of the Senate last session &#34; on the subject of the tobacco industry,&#34; shall be referred to the Select Committee on the Tobacco Monopoly &#34;with leave to report it.&#34; What is &#34;it&#34;&#34;?

                        <para>-Will the honorable senator hold his tongue ? &#34; It &#34; is the evidence, which will be sent on to the Committee, but not for the Committee to comment on or discuss, except in so far as it comes within the purview of the power given to them, by the Senate, that power being to inquire into the alleged tobacco monopoly, and that only. The present Select Committee on the Tobacco Monopoly have nothing to do with the question of old-age pensions, but have been authorized to inquire into one matter, and one only. Certainly, it is proposed that certain evidence shall be referred to them, and that they shall be empowered to report that evidence, though they are not empowered to comment on it, or report concerning its value or otherwise; they are simply to send it up as an appendix to their report. In reference to the point of order, I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> was in order in making the interjection that an honorable senator &#34;probably has a brief,&#34; and I ask him to withdraw it. </para>

I say that that is a reflection upon the Committee, in which the honorable senator is persisting, notwithstanding your ruling. </para>

                        <para>- I never accused the Select Committee of want of fairness, but there is such a thing as unconscious bias, to which we are all subject on questions of race, religion, and so forth. No one, for instance, would think of appointing a committee of New South Welshmen to decide a matter in dispute between their State and Victoria. This is not a question of fairness; and on a matter of abstract justice I should be quite as willing to trust this Select Committee as any other Committee of the House. I should not have moved in this matter had I not felt it to be of sufficient public importance to justify me in directing attention to the fact that the Select Committee is constituted as I have indicated. I rose for that purpose, and to justify my action in declining to let the matter go as formal. </para>

The motion is that the evidence taken last session &#34; on the subject of the tobacco industry &#34; shall be referred to the Select Committee on the tobacco monopoly. There is nothing in the motion about old-age pensions, and I understand that only that portion of the evidence dealing with tobacco monopoly is contemplated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> who, as Chairman of the Committee, submits this motion. T understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has no objection to evidence dealing with the tobacco industry being sent on to the Committee, and, therefore, it is difficult to see why there should be all this noise. </para>

The whole of the evidence taken was on&#39; the question of the tobacco monopoly, and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has no objection to such evidence being referred, no possible harm can arise from adopting the motion.

In any case, this measure is now the property of the Committee, and we should go on with it, in order that as soon as possible it may be sent to another place. A Select Committee has recently been appointed by the Senate, and if there is any doubt as to the powers of Select Committees to take evidence it is as well that it should be cleared up at once. </para>

                    <para>. - When this Bill was last before the Committee <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> wasin charge of it, and on the motion that the Committee have leave to sit again, the honorable senator fixed this date for the resumption of its consideration. Ministers have had no direct communication with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> as to his intentions, and do not know whether it is the wish of the honorable senator that any one else should&#34; take his place in connexion with this measure. I suggest that the best plan to adopt would be to report progress, and make the further consideration of the Bill in Committee an order of the day for this, day week. In the meantime I will undertake to communicate with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> and inform him that on Thursday next the Bill will be definitely proceeded with. The honorable senator will be thus given an opportunity to consult with any other honorable senator he would like to take his place in connexion with the measure It is true that the Bill is the property of the Committee, but in the circumstances, and in view of the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> may have some amendments to suggest, we shall, I think, best conserve the rights of the Committee and of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> by adopting the course I have suggested. </para>

                    <para>- I quite indorse the views expressed by Senators Pearce and Stewart as to the desirability of placing on our statute-book some law relating to the taking of evidence by Select Committees. Honorable senators, however, must recognise the inconvenience of having a Bill before us without anybody in particular in charge of it. Whilst I very much regret that it is unlikely that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> will be able to conduct the further proceedings connected with the passing of the Bill, by postponing its further consideration for a week or a fortnight, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> will be enabled to do what he has undertaken to do - to look into the matter, and to communicate with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild. Senator Neild</inline> will also, in the meantime, be enabled, if he so desires, to place in the hands of any other honorable senator the data ion which the Bill is founded. The suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> will, I believe, be found ultimately to expedite the passing of the measure. </para>

                        <para>- Those of us who objected to the taking over of British New Guinea are confirmed in our objection by this unfortunate business. By that act we landed ourselves in a sea of troubles. The Possession is not self-supporting. The Commonwealth appropriates ^20,000 a year to carry on the administration, but apparently that is not sufficient to enable the authorities to place white constables over white prisoners. Those positions are held by one-fourth educated Papuans. The Minister of Defence took up a most extraordinary attitude when he said that, because a man has a number of charges alleged against him, such as arson, theft, and assault, he must be a bad character. I observe that persons who are brought up in the Possession have a list of offences against them as long as one&#39;s arm, and&#34; embracing all the crimes in the calendar. The officers who send down reports about persons like O&#39;Brien, of having been guilty of so many offences, really brand themselves with incompetence. How is it that a man happens to Le at large in the Possession when he has been guilty of so many alleged offences? The Government ought to push on with the British New Guinea Bill, and allow the miners to have electoral representation in the Legislative Council. I believe that that reform in the system of government would very soon lead to the removal of a number of the grievances under which they now labour. </para>

                        <para>- One might reasonably ask how it is that any man could be at liberty Jong enough to commit the long series of offences which have been read against O&#39;Brien. When I heard it read, I was not at all surprised that he did clear out, as it seemed to me the only sensible thing for him to do. I hope the Government will ascertain, not only whether O&#39;Brien was under the control of a coloured constable, but also whether it is the practice to commit white offenders to the custody of Papuans. We have been asked by interjection why Papuans should not be placed in this position. The simple answer I would advance is that, not only in British New Guinea, but elsewhere, whites hold their position largely by prestige. It seems to me that that prestige will be undermined if the natives become familiarized to the fact that they occupy a position not nearly equal, but on certain occasions superior, to that of white men. It is not desirable that we should do anything to induce a feeling of that kind, for it is quite conceivable that if we whittle down the prestige which gives us. our main hold on the natives, it may lead to very serious trouble at a later date. </para>

I do not object to white men being constables over white men; but, as there are no white constables, I cannot see why a man, even though He is not white, should not have the necessary power given to him to uphold the law. In the circumstances, it is quite proper for the Administration to employ men who, perhaps, have led as good lives as even miners, to repress crime. </para>

We have heard that a native constable has allowed himself to be nearly butchered instead of shooting his assailant dead, as a white constable would have done. But the sympathy of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> is given to the white man who attempted the butchery, and not to the man who was nearly butchered. I do not understand his point of view at all. The whole circumstances of this case need further investigation, and I shall be very glad if it is undertaken. </para>

At the same time, I do not think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> adopted a judicial attitude and put the case in as unbiased a manner as he might have &#34;done.

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator STANIFORTH</inline>SMITH.According to the honorable senator, O&#39;Brien must be a perfect fiend in human form, for that is the only inference which can be drawn from his remarks. He said that O&#39;Brien murderously attacked his guard, presumably with the intention to kill him. Although that guard happened to be a coloured man, yet the honorable senator said a few minutes afterwards there were no coloured guards. That contradicts not only the magistrate&#39;s statement but his own. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> did not state that the guard seriously injured O&#39;Brien, but the evidence shows that he was wounded first. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator STANIFORTH</inline>SMITH.The honorable senator read out a list of most atrocious crimes, alleged against this man. The charge of attempted murder refers to the <inline font-style="italic">fracas</inline> with the guard, who, it is stated, was nearly killed&#39;, although it is interesting to know that he was able to walk to the station, and a few days afterwards he was giving evidence, so that he could not have been very badly injured. Putting aside the question .of the murderous attack, which was related in such a thrilling manner by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> we have the charge of robbery of &#163;1,000 The grounds of the charge were that O&#39;Brien happened to be in the neighbourhood at the time of the robbery. But the owner of the gold publicly stated that he was satisfied that O&#39;Brien was not the thief. Surely the owner would be the last man to acquit him, unless he was perfectly satisfied on the point. When we come to look into the charge of arson, we find that it amounts to the burning of a trumpery bush shed. It must have struck the Senate that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> adopted rather a biased attitude. I do not say whether O&#39;Brien is, or is not, a decent member of society. He may be a despicable character if we take the&#39; version of the authorities, or a violent-tempered but good-hearted1 man, if we take the miners&#39; version. </para>

I am not aware that any white man or any coloured man in British New Guinea did condone actual offences, or would sympathize with the man who committed them. But it is significant that of those seventeen men, four signed a petition to the Minister of External Affairs. With regard to the statement that white prisoners have white gaolers, I desire to say that, as a matter of fact, they do not. There are a resident magistrate and two assistant residents, one of whom may theoretically be regarded as a gaoler. But the man who actually watches the prisoners and looks after them, is one of the black constabulary; and when a white prisoner is put to a menial occupation like scrub-cutting, work which is never done in New Guinea except by a coloured man, and when the white man has a coloured gaoler standing over him, possibly insulting him - though I am sure that the Resident Magistrate would punish any gaoler who was guilty of doing that - he is subjected to treatment which is calculated to create resentment. </para>

                        <para>- I am stating what is possible. Our Government in British New Guinea rests on our prestige. The natives believe that a white man is very much more powerful than one of themselves, and that if they kill a white man his spirit is much more powerful than theirs. The reason of our success in British New Guinea up to the present - and it is a success of which we can be proud - is that the natives have always recognised the power of the white men, and have never risen against them. We have never had1 occasion to send one white soldier into British New Guinea. Although we have 400,000 natives, trained to arms, many of them cannibals, and some head hunters, we have had very little difficulty with them. That is largely due to the magnificent administration of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> McGregor and those appointed by him. But directly the natives begin to feel that they are equal or superior to white men, and can make white men work and do as they like, our prestige disappears. Up to the present we have had the loyal co-operation of the white miners in maintaining law and order. </para>

                <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator STANIFORTH</inline>SMITH.There is a number qf discrepancies. For instance, one of the miners is reported fo have stated to the magistrate that whatever he did .he should be careful to keep O&#39;Brien safe, because he was such a dangerous man. A few paragraphs further on in the same letter it is stated&#34; that this man was a great friend of O&#39;Brien. Evidently that is a contradiction. There ls a white gaoler at Port Moresby, which <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> only seventy miles away from the field, though certainly it is over the gap, which is a very difficult climb. There is also a white gaoler at Woodlark Island. I think that the Government might ask the chief judicial officer or the Administrator if it would not be advisable to send white prisoners to one of those places. I am sure that would give satisfaction to the miners, and would not result in the loss of prestige which undoubtedly will occur if natives are put over white men&#39;. </para>

                    <para>- In the absence of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy,</inline> who moved the adjournment of the debate on this motion, I rise to support it. I consider that it is a great privilege to have an opportunity to say a word or two in support of the principle of Home Rule. It is in accordance with the fitness of things that a democratic House of Legislature, such as the Senate undoubtedly is, should pass a motion of this nature. If there is any people in the world who can speak with authority on the advantages of self-government, it is the Australians. From our long, experience of it, there can be but one conclusion - that self-government is beneficial to a people who have the making of their own laws in their own way. I cannot understand how any Australian can find&#34; anything to say against this principle. I cannot understand how people who have the privileges and rights of self-government themselves should not desire to do everything possible to extend those rights to other people, more especially in the case of a country like Ireland, where the lack of self-government has undoubtedly wrought more disaster than in any other country in the world. </para>

                        <para>- I think I shall be able to prove that, notwithstanding all that has been said about Russian misrule in Poland and Finland, the population of those countries has increased j and that is more than can be said for unhappy Ireland, where the population has decreased by something like one-half during, the last fifty or sixty years. If the populations of Poland and Finland have increased - and I shall be able to show that they have - whilst the population of Ireland has decreased, then, whatever may be said about Russian misrule, there is clearly something to be said on the other side. Before going further, I wish to say that this motion would be improved if it were differently framed. Seeing that another place is moving in the same direction, it would, I think, have -been advisable to place this motion in the form of an address to the King, so as to make the action of both Chambers uniform. An address of this kind to His Majesty appears to me very fitting, because it is generally understood that the King is .very sympathetic in his attitude towards Ireland. That is an additional reason why it would be better if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson-</inline> had consulted honorable members of another place with a view to unity of action. So far, the only argument that I have heard against the motion is that we in Australia ought not to interfere in the affairs of the Empire. It is rather too late in the day to take up such a position. So long as we are part and parcel of the Empire, we are entitled to take the responsibility of expressing our opinions an Imperial questions ; and this is a most important matter from the standpoint of the Empire. Indeed, I know of none more important, and therefore I claim that the Senate has every right to pass a motion of this kind. </para>

                        <para>- I recognise that that was a flaw in the Bill, but considering the attitude of the Irish representatives and people .on the point, it is a flaw which could be removed without much difficulty. It is hard to understand how the House of Commons could be constituted with members having the right to legislate on Imperial matters, but excluded from dealing with the business connected with England* Scotland, and Wales. That would be a clumsy way to conduct parliamentary business; and certainly a Government would find itself iri a very strange position with members on whose support they could not count on domestic questions. but, as <inline font-style="italic">1.</inline> say there have been numerous proposals made since then which point a way out of the difficulty. It is to be deeply regretted that a question of this kind cannot be discussed without the danger of insulting references to one&#39;s political opinions. I am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> is absent, because I am about to offer some criticisms of the attitude which he took up when this motion was first introduced. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> then referred to Home Rulers as enemies of England. The honorable senator did not discriminate in any way, but classed all Home Rulers alike, and added that he made the&#39; charge advisedly and deliberately. The absurdity of the charge, however, is recognised when we consider the vast numbers of worthy subjects of the Empire who are in favour of Home Rule for Ireland; and I am satisfied that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> was guilty of mere extravagance of language. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> argued that because Irishmen were &#34;against the flag,&#34; more particularly in reference to the South African war, they were disloyal to the Empire. But if criticism of a war of the Empire constitutes disloyalty, then amongst the disloyal we must class <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. CampbellBannerman,</inline> leader of the Liberal Party in the House of Commons, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Morley, one of the leading Liberals, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Harcourt, and nearly all those who are or were the leading lights on the Liberal side of politics at home. Even if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser&#39;s</inline> remark was intended to apply only to Irishmen, it was quite uncalled for. Irish Home Rulers have as much right to criticise a British war as have any subjects of the Empire. We do not exempt Home Rulers from the responsibility of contributing to the cost of our wars, or from taking their fair share of the fighting, some of the hardest fighting regiments in the Boer war, from beginning to end, being Irish, more particularly the Dublin Fusiliers. These facts only show the utter unfairness of the charge of disloyalty made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser.</inline> If the charge was made deliberately, in the belief that it is true, I can only feel sorry for a gentleman who can hold such views, and regard any opinions from him on a question of this kind as of verv little value. It may Le, perhaps, that some allowance should be made for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> in the use of extravagant language on a subject of this kind. Another remark made by the honorable senator was that there are two Irelands - one prosperous, and the other poverty-stricken and discontented. A great deal more is made of the minority opinion in Ireland than is quite justifiable. At least three of the four provinces are absolutely solid on the question of self-government. Every parliamentary representative returned for those three provinces goes to the House of Commons on the distinct understanding that he must endeavour to bring about Home Rule as early as possible, and at least one-half of the representatives from the fourth province hold the same opinion. There are, therefore, no two Irelands, or, at all events, if there are, one is very small, and the feeling against Home Rule there is a diminishing quantity. </para>

                        <para>- I should not think that, with Home Rule, there would be Irish members in the House of Commons. I have already explained that several schemes have been propounded for getting over that difficulty. In any case, that and kindred questions are matters of detail, which I do not think it wise for us to debate. Several of the most prominent advocates of Home Rule have refused to go into detail, contending that all it is necessary to obtain at present is a recognition of the principle. There is no doubt that public opinion in Ireland is changing on this question, and an extract from a Glasgow newspaper, which I propose to read, will show that there are no two Irelands in the sense suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser.</inline> The <inline font-style="italic">Glasgow Observer</inline> of the 22nd July of this year contains the following : - </para>

The manifesto, which is signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. T.H.</inline> Sloan, M.P., <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lindsay</inline> Crawford, the Imperial Grand Master, and other officials of the institution, is addressed to all Irishmen, both Protestant and Roman Catholic, whose country stands first in their affection ; and, after dealing with land and labour, town tenants, the financial! position of the country, and redistribution of seats, concludes as follows : - &#34; Castle government stands self-condemned. We do not trust either of the English parties on any of the questions that divide Ireland, and we are satisfied that both Liberals and Tories will continue in the future, as they have done in the past, to play off Irish Protestants and Nationalists against each other to the prejudice of our country. This being so, we consider that it is high time that </para>
                    <para class="block">Irish Protestants should consider their position, as Irish citizens and their attitude towards their Roman Catholic countrymen, and that the latter should choose once for all between nationality and sectarianism. In an Ireland in which Protestant and Roman Catholic stand sullen and discontented it is not too much to hope that both, will reconsider their positions, and in their common trials unite on a true basis of nationality. The higher claims of our distracted country have been too long neglected in the strife of party and of creed. There is room in Ireland for a patriotic party with a sound constructive policy that will devote itself to the task of freeing the country from the domination of impracticable creeds and organized tyrannies, and to. securing the urgent and legitimate redress of her many grievances.&#34; </para>

It is stated here that the manifesto was also signed by others, but the names of two persons only are given.. It is the opinion of this organization that &#34;Castle government&#34; stands self condemned, and that political parties in England have all along been merely playing one section of the people in Ireland against the other. The people of the North of Ireland are showing a desire to bring this kind of thing to an end, and, in view of that fact, we, in this Senate, should have no doubt as to what our opinion on the question should be. If this manifesto is a true indication of the feelings of the people in the North of Ireland, I hail it as one of the most welcome documents which, has appeared for many years in connexion with Irish affairs. </para>

              <para>- They cannot be compared. In this document, signed by Orangemen of Ulster, it is clear that they are beginning to realize that they have been long enough made tools of, and are now endeavouring to bring about a better state of affairs. My opinion has long been that the opposition of different sections in the North of Ireland has been continued in existence and fostered for one purpose, and for one purpose only, and that is to keep the people apart. It has been fostered by the landlord class, whose interest it has been to keep the people apart, so that they may drag rents and the profits of the farmers&#39; work from this hard-working class. I take it that there are farmers amongst the Orangemen of Ulster as well as amongst the Catholic population of the province, and they are now evidently beginning to see that they have been made catspaws of in the past. It is now clear that they believe that an end should be put to such a condition of affairs, and that is a good sign. We have, from time to time, heard a very great deal about the prosperity of Ulster. We have been told1 that that part of Ireland is advancing in prosperity by leaps and bounds. I have endeavoured to find out if these statements are true. I have had a little experience in Ireland. When I nad reached the age of manhood, and was quite capable of forming an opinion, I visited the North of Ireland, and, later on, I made a visit to the South of Ireland. I worked for some time in the iron ore mines of Antrim, in the North of Ireland, and was sufficiently long in that part of the country to gain an insight into Irish affairs as presented by existing conditions in the North of Ireland. I am able to say that I found there was quite as much poverty and distress in the North of Ireland as I afterwards saw in the county of Wicklow, the part of the South of Ireland which I visited. In the light of my experience of the country, the continual references to the prosperity of the North of Ireland have come as a surprise to me. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser,</inline> in making his statement on the subject, did not think it necessary to advance any proof. I propose to subject the honorable senator&#39;s remarks to some criticism, and to give figures bearing on the question which will put a different complexion on them. Taking Mulhall&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Dictionary of Statistics</inline> as my authority, I find that according to the census returns, during a period of twenty years from 187 1 to 1 89 1, there was a loss of population in the&#39; province of Ulster of 220,000 ; and during the same period a smaller loss is shown by the figures for each of the other provinces. For Leinster the figures are 218,000, Munster 148,000, and Connaught 121,000. These figures relate to a period within that referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser,</inline> who told us that within the last fifty or sixty years the North of Ireland had been going ahead by leaps and bounds. If we take a longer period, and go back to the census year of 1841, and up to the latest census year of 1901, a period of sixty years, we shall find that Ulster lost something like 800,000 people. That is surely a marvellous proof of prosperity ! Here we have a province with a population of some 2,000,000, losing nearly half that number during a period of sixty years. If that is a sign of prosperity, God help the country afflicted with it. Such a loss of population, wherever it takes place, is a proof that there has been no prosperity. 1! have had great difficulty in getting information bearing on &#39;the statement made bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser.</inline> I recognise that it is true that Belfast has, within the last fifty or sixty years, made great strides. </para>

              <para>- I have not the figures for the city itself. The only figures I have been able to get cover the whole of the province. We must remember that Belfast is not Ulster any more than Ulster is Ireland, and the statistics of a city may give no indication of the condition of affairs over a whole province, like Ulster, in which there are nine counties. I quote now from a paper presented to the British Parliament by the Home Office, and, taking the figures relating to the income tax assessments in Ireland, I find&#39; that they do not place this much-belauded Ulster at the top of the list. It is nearer to the bottom of the list. According to this parliamentary paper, Leinster paid <inline font-style="italic">&#163;,1.0</inline> 6s. 9d. per head of population in income tax, Munster paid <inline font-style="italic">&#163;6</inline> os. 7d., Ulster, (second last on the list) paid <inline font-style="italic">&#163;,$</inline> 14s. 5d., and Connaught <inline font-style="italic">&#163;3</inline> 13s. 7d. These figures do not show any great prosperity in Ulster. In a table appearing in the same parliamentary paper, showing the income tax paid on profits made in professions and trades in the various provinces, I find Leinster again at the head of the list with <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4.</inline> 2s. 6d. per head. </para>

In the very infancy of our country, and whilst we were contenting ourselves with the exportations and sale of our cattle, you made an Act to prohibit those exportations. We next gave our attention to the increase of our sheep, in order to export wool, but you forthwith prohibited the exportation of wool, and made it subject to forfeiture. We then endeavoured to employ and support ourselves by salting provisions for sale ; but you immediately refused them admittance into England, in order to increase the rents of your lands, though you thereby increased the wages of your labourers.&#39; &#34; </para>

          <para class="block">Surely, in the face of these statements as to want of prosperity, there is good reason? for me to urge that Home Rule should be- granted to Ireland. This want of prosperity was due to the Acts of a foreign Parliament, which stands condemned by these enumerations - &#34; The Navigation Act had unwittingly but kindly permitted all commodities to be imported into Ireland upon the same terms as into England; but, by an Act passed three years afterwards, the exportation of any goods from Ireland into any of the plantations was prohibited, and, as if that had not sufficiently crippled the benefits given fay the Navigation Act, we were soon afterwards forbid to import any of the enumerated commodities from the plantations into Ireland. This restriction, too, was much enforced by subsequent Acts, and the list of enumerated goods was much increased. I say nothing of your regulations respecting glass, hops, sail cloth, &#38;c, and other inferior barriers and obstructions to our commerce.&#34; </para>

I do not mean to say that Irish people have become so degenerate that they cannot, when the opportunity is presented, become quite as prosperous and industrious as any other people. In Australia we have very fair proof that the Irishman is quite equal to the Englishman or the Scotchman, that whenever he gets an opportunity he requires no advantages over others in order to make headway. </para>

              <para>- Yes. With Scotch blood running in his veins, it would be hard for any man to surpass the North of Ireland man in thrift and industry. The same remark might be applied&#39; to all Irishmen. We know that a great many Irish people emigrate to the United States. When they are left untrammelled, and stand upon the same footing as other people, Irishmen display their inherent good qualities. I propose to read an extract showing what the American opinion of this race is. </para>

But be that as it may, I propose to read an extract in order to show that the history of the Irishman is not a chapter of defeat and disaster, and that wherever he gets an opportunity he is quite able to take his part in the industrial life of a country, where the conditions are fair. The extract I propose to read is taken from a New York newspaper called the <inline font-style="italic">Evening Post,</inline> which was published on the 10th November, 1903.

Just where the old native stock of Massachusetts is left seems problematical, for the foreigners have an overwhelming majority in the industries- and the Irish are a large majority of them - while in the Government service the Irish are more than double all other of. foreign birth, and they are about a third more than those of Massachusetts birth or descent. . . . Nine classifications are made under the head of professional occupation, religion, law, medicine, literature, art, music, amusement, education, and science. In every one, except art, the Irish are the most numerous among foreign-born, and the distribution among the different professions in this State doubtless indicates what is probably true of the race in all other States. In science, next to art, the race shows the least relative lead, but under the head of education, which includes thousands of school teachers, they have 2,506 , out of 4,700 of foreign descent. So one turns to occupation after occupation and finds similar predominance of the Irish over all other foreignborn. </para>
                    <para class="block">The census figures bear out the statements in the extract. This quotation ought to show that if a race which is often looked upon as rather thriftless, were granted the blessing of Home Rule, they would become as industrious and thrifty as any other race in the United Kingdom. Considering the awful state of poverty which has existed in Ireland for so many years, I do not think there should be two opinions as to what action shall be taken, if the desire be to restore prosperity to that part of the Empire. Although the population of Ireland is constantly decreasing, still the taxation is increasing. Let us contrast the figures for 1820 with the figures for 3904. In 1820 the annual taxation was only &#163;5, 500.000, while the population was 6.800,000; but in 1904 the annual taxation had increased to .&#163;9,750,000, while the population had decreased to 4,400,000. </para>

              <para>- From those figures I draw the inference that in Ireland there is the most disheartening state of affairs that perhaps has been witnessed in modern history. I do not think that it is rivalled in any part of Europe. When it is remembered that the annual taxation has increased, by 85 per cent., while the population has decreased by 35 per cent., I think it will be admitted that no other country in Europe presents such a depressing picture. </para>

              <para>- It has been proved beyond a shadow of doubt that they are. Ten years ago a Financial Committee was appointed: by the House of Commons to inquire into the question of taxation in Ireland, and its finding was to the effect that it was taxed to the extent of three millions sterling a year more than it ought to have been in comparison with other parts of the United Kingdom. Although Ireland is so poor, and so heavily taxed, and no ameliorative step has been taken, still, honorable senators seem to be astonished that the Irish people should ask for the right to make their own laws. </para>

              <para>- It is a very, great wrong, in view of the fact that it is owing to bad laws that Ireland has been depopulated. If she had retained the population she ought to have had, instead of her representation in the Imperial Parliament decreasing, we should have heard something of the necessity for increasing it. Why has her population decreased ? Through unjust laws. Why, therefore, should she be robbed of some of her members? And her decrease in population is not a matter of the past. It is -still going on. It might have been expected that there would be a loss of population during the years of famine. But even to-day there is a constant drain of people from Ireland. Surely something should be done to put an end to that state of affairs. . We have to remember that the loss to Ireland is a loss to the Empire. The great majority of people who leave that country do not come to Australia or go to Canada. The overwhelming majority emigrate to the United States, and the reasons which cause them to leave their own country harden them against the Empire. They use their opportunities whenever international questions arise for settlement. When arbitration treaties have been proposed between Great Britain and the United States, it has been admitted in both countries that the Irish-American influence has prevented their ratification. That is a direct result of misrule in Ireland. Are we content to allow that state of affairs to continue, or shall we do our best to remove one of the most deplorable factors that operate against the interests of the Empire? There is no country in the world that it would be so much to Great Britain&#39;s advantage to have a good understanding with as the United States of America, but that is impossible so long as Ireland is denied the right of self-government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> advanced a rather novel argument when he referred to Ireland as being so close to Great Britain that her very proximity should exclude her from self-government. I would remind him that the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands are much nearer to Great Britain than Ireland is. Yet those little communities have self-government, and we never hear a word of suspicion as to its being dangerous. </para>

              <para>- I do not enter into the question of the kind of self-government that they enjoy. They have a form of Home Rule that satisfies them. I dare say the people of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man would, if they were discontented, make known their wishes. But if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker&#39;s</inline> argument is a good one, I might remind him that the distance between Dover and Calais is only about twenty miles, If we say that the proximity of Ireland to England is an argument against self-government, we might as well object to self-government being enjoyed by &#34;France and other countries of Europe. Why not say at once that England alone has a right to govern the earth, that all other nations are intruders ! When one hears an argument like that he is reminded of a remark by Mark Twain, that the British people are the only modern race who are singled out for reference in the Bible. He said that he could not but think that the passage, &#34; Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth&#34;&#39; must apply to the English. The objection to self-government in Ireland, because of its proximity to England, is really an instance of that proclivity for land-grabbing which, I am sorry to say, finds its defenders even in this Senate. Statistics which I have quoted from authorities which cannot be doubted, prove that the condition of any country cannot be worse than that of Ireland is. </para>

              <para>- As it is, and as it has been for many generations. I have shown how Ireland has lost her population. I have compared her in this respect with Finland and Poland under Russian rule. There cannot be other than misrule when one country governs another without its consent. Honorable senators may object to our passing this motion, but there is one thing of which they may be sure. Whether Home Rule is granted in this generation or the next, there will be no breaking down the determination of the Irish to win it. If there is one thing more than another that I admire in the Irish, it is the steadfastness and the patient endurance with which, for generation after generation,&#39; they have persisted&#34; in their struggle for self-government. Every one who takes an interest in the affairs of the Empire must deplore that this open sore has, by bad government,, been kept from healing for so many generations. From an Imperial stand-point,, and from every stand-point, there is reason for supporting the motion which has been submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson,</inline> and I hope that the Senate will carry it by such a majority as will show beyond any doubt the feeling of the Australian -Senate on this important question. </para>

            <para>- I do not propose to occupy any considerable time in discussing this motion. It does not seem to be necessary to debate it at length, because, its opponents are so barren of argument that we have nothing to reply to. It is useless to try to convince people who have no arguments to bring forward&#39; in support of the case which they profess to maintain. There are, however, one or two things that I should like to say in justification of our right to pass a motion of this character. It has been contended that it is altogether beside our duty and out of our province to discuss the question of Home Rule. </para>

              <para>- That is so. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> pointed out, this motion merely asks for an expression of opinion. I have no hesitation, and I do not think the Senate will have any hesitation, in expressing an opinion on this question. But I go further, and give utterance to the hope that the opinion, when it is expressed, will have considerable weight with the Imperial authorities. We were told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser,</inline> and it was more than hinted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> that Home Rule, if granted, for Ireland would not really mean Home Rule, but something entirely different. There has been imported into the discussion a feeling of sectarian bitterness, which is very much to be deplored. I should have preferred to see the question discussed in its political aspect, entirely removed from any religious or social associations. But as the sectarian view has Deen touched on, some reply should be given ; and although Ireland is the country where I was born, and where nearly all my friends and relatives at the present time live, I feel all the more free to offer some explanation, seeing that my religion &#34;is not the religion which seems to be so much condemned bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser.</inline> I belong to the Protestant religion, and I can say in the face of all the world that, although I was born in the middle of one of the southern counties of Ireland, where over three-fourths of the population were Roman Catholics, the utmost good feeling prevailed between the two bodies, and I never witnessed there one quarter of the sectarian bitterness that I have heard in Australia. If Home Rule would mean Rome rule, as those honorable senators would have us believe, it is curious that the strongest advocates of self-government .for Ireland during the last half-century have been members of the Protestant faith. Parnell, the great leader of the Home Rule movement in recent years, was a Protestant of Protestants ; and if we look at the roll of Irish patriots and agitators we shall find it almost monopolized by men of the Protestant faith. </para>

              <para>- Lord Edward Fitzgerald, Wolfe Tone, and most of the Irish patriots during the last fifty years, have, with a few notable exceptions, been men of the Protestant faith. That fact disposes of the argument adduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> that Home Rule would practically mean Rome rule. .As a matter of fact, the most trusted leaders of the Irish party to-day in the old country, and outside the old country, are, the majority of them, of the Protestant faith. Those who are possessed, or profess to be possessed, with a fear that Home Rule would create sectarian bitterness in Ireland, and, leading to what they call a religious war, would bring about the usurpation of all power by a foreign religious potentate, have no ground for alarm. I am afraid such arguments are the result of the unconscious sectarian bitterness which lies at the back of the taunts which they utter. Home Rule really, means giving to Ireland exactly that measure of self-government which we in the Commonwealth possess - giving the right to the people to manage their own affairs in their own way, so far as they relate to Ireland only. Nobody has ever put forward a demand that Ireland should have the right to manage its own affairs, so far as Imperial interests are concerned. Ireland has always possessed the right to manage Irish affairs, notwithstanding that she has unjustly been deprived of the power to exercise that right. What I mean is that technically and legally Ireland has always possessed the right to manage her own affairs; and when the power to exercise that right was taken away in 1800, it was done in an illegal and corrupt fashion. If I appoint an agent to do a certain thing for me, that agent cannot destroy me in the process. A Parliament elected by the people to legislate for the people has no legal or technical authority to destroy itself, or take away from the people the right which they possess to govern themselves. When the Irish people gave the mandate to the Irish Parliament, which sat at that time, to legislate for Ireland, they did not give it any authority to divest itself of the power to legislate; and yet that is what the Irish Parliament corruptly did. As I say, the Irish people have always possessed1 the right to govern themselves, and it only need&#39;s the assertion - which would probably have to be backed by force to be effective - to restore that right to them. The right to govern themselves is inherent in the Irish people; and to give them Home Rule now would be only restoring what should never have been taken from them. I am one who believes that Home Rule is needed, not only for Ireland but for every part of the British Empire. Home Rule is just as necessary for Scotland, Wales, and England as for Ireland. </para>

              <para>- That is only a small measure of Home Rule for one particular place. I maintain that the people of England would be better able to manage their own affairs if they were not partially governed by the people of Scotland, Wales, and Ireland, and the same may be said of each of those countries. What are the facts in relation to the British Parliament of today? That Parliament, as a machine for doing certain work, has grown unwieldy, incapable, and ineffective. </para>

              <para>- As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> interjects, the British Parliament is overladen with duties which do not properly belong to it. The Imperial Parliament should have to legislate only in regard to Imperial affairs. Like the Commonwealth Parliament in Australia, the British Parliament should have to deal only with affairs of purely national concern throughout the Empire, while the &#39;local Parliaments should be left to deal with matters of purely local concern. If this idea were carried out in regard to the four countries which form the United Kingdom, the Imperial Parliament would be free from the enormous load of work with which it is incapable of dealing, and would be able to more effectively discharge the duties which properly come within its sphere. It must be recognised that Englishmen are more competent to deal with English affairs, Scotchmen more competent to deal with Scotch affairs, and Irishmen more competent to deal with Irish affairs than a whole conglomeration of them is to deal with matters belonging to all parts. As the motion, however, deals only with Home Rule for Ireland, I shall confine myself to that particular aspect of the question. I put forward my views on the general question, in order to show that it is not mere patriotic or partisan feeling as an Irishman which leads me to so strongly favour self-government for Ireland, but the firm conviction that it would be essentially good for every portion of the Empire to have the same absolute right, each in consonance with local conditions, knowledge, and needs. If Ireland were given Home Rule, the Imperial Parliament would, as I say, be relieved from the enormous load of detail local work, which it has at present to perform, and which all great authorities admit it is incapable of properly carrying out. For that reason alone, it would be exceedingly desirable to give self-government to Ireland. It must be remembered that the question of Home Rule for Ireland has been a constant thorn in the side of the British Parliament; it has led to the business being almost hung up time after time, and has made the House of Commons the scene of struggles and squabbles in no way creditable to that great assembly. To grant Home Rule to Ireland would remove a bone of contention from the arena of that House, and leave it free to deal with the great national questions which urgently call for attention. As to the right of Ireland to self-government, it is conceded by every democrat that peoples who form separate nations or communities have an inherent right to govern themselves. Undoubtedly a country such as Ireland, whose separate nationality goes back to the dim ages, of which we have but a very imperfect record, has a special claim to the right to govern itself in accordance with its own ideas. Ireland has one overwhelming claim, which I think cannot be denied or disputed by anybody, namely, that until the beginning of the last century, it absolutely possessed Home Rule, under the British Crown, and it has never given up that right. </para>

              <para>- England was the buyer, but the people from whom she bought had not the right to sell, and the transaction therefore would not stand in any court of law. It was not a binding transaction, and the Irish people were in no way pledged to acquiesce in it. I pointed out that the Irish people possessed the right of self-government, and they exercised that right. They elected certain representatives to legislate for them in the Parliament in College Green, in Dublin. But they did not give to those representatives the right to deprive the people of Ireland of their power to legislate for themselves. They told their representatives to legislate for them, and they did not give them any mandate to sell or to barter away their right to legislate for themselves. The Irish people have never parted with their right to self-government. It is inherent still, and it is only the barest justice that the British&#39; people should restore it to them. It is admitted by all English historians who have dealt with the question at all, and even by those who have displayed the utmost antipathy to the Irish people in many respects, that the legislative Union of Ireland and England was effected by the most foul and corrupt methods, and that the members of the Irish Parliament who consented to the Union were bought wholesale by British gold. They sold, as I said before, something which was not theirs, and which they had no right to sell, and that which was so bought could not pass rightly or legally. The Irish people are therefore in as full possession of their right to self-government to-day as they were before the Union was effected. </para>

              <para>- They have not got it, but that does not in any way affect the right or wrong of the matter. They have the same right to-day as they had before the Union, because they never gave it up, and were never consulted in the matter. Before the Union they were never asked for a mandate to consent to it. It was never put to them at any election, and their right was filched from them by corrupt legislators and by a corrupt Government in England, that tried to purchase the liberties of the people in that way. </para>

              <para>- I am aware of that. A great many portions of the British Empire already possess self-government. Australia, New Zealand, and the South African Colonies enjoy that right. Even the Transvaal Colony, which was conquered only the other clay, is to be given a measure of self-government. Canada possesses self-government, and I ask every thinking man in this chamber whether the concession of the right of self-government to those portions of the British Empire has had the effect of weakening the Empire? On the contrary, we know that it has strengthened it. As a matter of fact, the only great- Possession which Great Britain ever lost was that portion of her Empire to which she refused the right of self-government - the United States of America. What has proved to be good for other parts of the Empire must of necessity prove to be equally good for Ireland. I am willing to admit at once that the English Government have endeavoured in a great many ways to do good for the Irish people. Of late years they have sought to settle the land question, which has been at the root of all the Irish trouble, but they are only now at this eleventh hour trying to repair the almost irreparable injury previously inflicted upon Ireland. The system of government which in half a century results in the depletion of the population of a country by one half, stands self-condemned. In the middle of last century the population of Ireland, in round figures, was 9,000,000 ; to-day, fifty years later, it is 4,000,000. That it is a fact with respect to Ireland, no one can deny, because it is recorded in the public statistics of the country. How was that depletion of population brought about? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Puis-</inline> ford and others who are advocates of the great system of free-trade established by Great Britain, may attempt to deny the facts I am going to recite, but they are facts all the same. England, by legislative enactments, absolutely destroyed some of the great industries which Ireland&#39; possessed. </para>

              <para>- It was a brutal Act. Almost every industry that Ireland possessed at that time was destroyed by Acts of a similar nature. Whenever Ireland possessed an industry which gave promise of being a source of lucrative employment to her people, England came along and destroyed it. As a matter of fact, the only two great survivors of Irish industries in Ireland to-day are the linen industry of Belfast, and the manufacture of poplin in Dublin. </para>

          <para class="block">Yet we are told that the movement for Home Rule is a movement for Rome Rule. As a matter of fact, in the last little rebellion in Ireland, in 1867, it was an Orangeman, and a member of one of the Orange lodges of the North of Ireland, who fired the first and almost the only shot that was fired. I do not desire to deal at greater length with the way in which England, in order to build up her own industries, destroyed by legislative enactments the industries of Ireland, but the quotation I have read from Lecky, who is acknowledged to be one of the most unbiased historians who has dealt with the subject, places my statement beyond dispute. </para>

              <para>- The Act is always in existence. I have had a taste of this coercion, and therefore I know what I am talking about. It is useless for honorable senators opposite to talk to us about British justice and liberty, and to indulge in &#34; hifalutin.&#34; I admit that in England an Englishman has perhaps more liberty, right, and justice meted out to him than the citizen of any other country. But when we come to examine the English government of Ireland, we find an entirely different state of affairs existing. The English know that they purchased the self-government of Ireland corruptly and wrongfully. They know they never had a title to the country, because they purchased it from people who had no right to sell it. The iniquity of tha crime has lain heavily on their conscience, and like most persons when they are in the wrong, they try. to buttress their wrong by all sorts of unjust and brutal acts. Ireland has been impoverished by the land question. It is well known, that over three-fourths of the land-owners spent all their revenues from, the land in other countries. In the great famine of 1847, which decimated the country, and was the cause of untold misery and suffering1 to the people--- </para>

              <para>- In that year Ireland produced a crop of wheat more than sufficient to feed every person within its territory. What had to be done with the wheat ? It had to be sent away and sold, in order to pay rack-rents to Irish landlords living in England. When people in America and elsewhere, out of the charity of their hearts, sent in cargoes of Indian corn or maize to feed the starving people, the ships . passed wheat-laden ships going out of Ireland. That is a fact which even&#39; one ought to know. The result has been that Ireland has become almost depleted of her rural as well as her manufacturing population. In 1847 the population numbered very nearly 9,000.000, but to-day it numbers only 4,000.000. The government of a country which results in the depletion of its population by 50 per cent, in fifty years, stands condemned by the mere recital of that fact. In my young days, in the south of Ireland;, I saw helpless families evicted from their homes ; I saw helpless men and women brought out on mattresses, and laid down in the snow in the most heartless and brutal manner. The land question has been the root cause of all the trouble in that country. I am pleased to find that the English Government have at last recognised that fact, and are making efforts in the direction of settlement. I hone that the efforts will be successful, but if they were successful tomorrow, there would still be an aspiration . to be satisfied before the Irish question could be held to be finally settled. </para>

              <para>- - I claim to have as good a knowledge of Irish affairs as any man in the Chamber, and speaking with a full sense of responsibility, I assert that the land question is not yet settled. Let me point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> that the settlement of the land question which has been attempted, has one exceedingly grave defect. Although money will be provided to enable the tenants to buy land, the fact that the landlords are offered very large inducements to sell has increased the value of the land to them, and placed them in a position to exact a higher price from the tenants. The consequence is that as the tenant will be given along period in which to pay the price - it may be an excessive price - to the landlord, it will impose an exceedingly heavy burden upon him and his family for very many years. </para>

              <para>- The English Government did not give &#163;112,000,000 for that purpose. They made, as they admitted in the House of Commons, a present of ,&#163;12,000,000 to the Irish landlords, as a bribe to induce them to sell their interest in the land. For the removal of the grievances of Ireland, not only is it necessary to settle the land question, but it is also necessary to satisfy the worthy, and I may say noble, aspiration of the Irish people to govern themselves. I think that a people are to be most highly commended for desiring to govern themselves. The Irish are a people with a strong national feeling. They have always desired to be allowed to govern themselves. I feel confident that the grant of Home Rule, instead of weakening, will strengthen the Empire. It will do good to England herself, and to every component part of the Empire. It will remove a festering sore from the very side of England ; it will enable her in time of difficulty and danger to draw upon at least half-a-million of the finest young manhood in the world in order to fight her battles, if necessary, whereas at the present time she could not claim perhaps one-fiftieth of that number to fight loyally by her side. These are the chief objects which may be attained by the granting of Home Rule. I believe that the people of the old country, who are intrusted with its destinies and management, will pay a great deal of deference to the opinion of this Senate. I feel absolutely certain that if England does accede to the request of Ireland, as expressed in this motion, it will enable Ireland to join the number of exceedingly prosperous countries which go to compose the great British Empire. I hope that the motion will be carried unanimously, and &#39;that it will go a considerable way towards effecting the object which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> has in view. </para>

              <para>- No ; and I would ask the honorable senator to permit me to say what I have to because the position is rather a difficult one. When a similar motion was proposed in the State Parliament some years ago by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Bryan</inline> O&#39;Loghlen, I then said something like what I propose to say now. It is not the function of this Parliament to legislate on the subject; it cannot do anything in connexion with the question which it could enforce; and to express an opinion is, it seems to me. to act childishly. I feel sorry to have to express an opinion on the question here. If a division be called for, undoubtedly I shall vote for the motion ; but I would strongly urge its withdrawal. </para>

              <para>- I should. This Commonwealth has powers of self-government within its own limits. It has a perfect right to do what it thinks fit within those limits. Interference from outside would be resented by us. The same applies to interference by us in the affairs of other parts of the world. . I do not desire to discuss the main question. I say again that I am, and, ever since I have been able to think, have been, in favour of Ireland, as well as Australia, having the power to legislate in &#39;relation to, and for the benefit of, its own people. But I do not think that this is a place where expression should be given to our feelings on that subject. I have always refused, if I could help it, to express an opinion in Parliament that could not be followed by an Act. It is the function of Parliament&#39; to make laws. That is why Ave are sent here. </para>

              <para>- I was elected to represent the people of Victoria in the Commonwealth Parliament, and to legislate in their interests. It may be that my opinion on this question is distinctly opposed to the opinion of those who elected me. Parliament is not justified in expressing an opinion in its representative character on a question as to which it cannot say that it has behind it the authority of the people by whom it is elected. I have no doubt for my own part that the majority of the people of this country are in favour of Home Rule. But the question was not &#39; discussed when the Federal elections were in progress. Certainly it was. not discussed by me as a candidate. It has often been discussed by me as a citizen of Victoria; and whatever weight attached to my opinion as a private citizen, I have always taken every opportunity to give to the side of this question in which I believe. But I urge honorable senators not to adopt the plan of initiating in the Senate . discussions of this character, that occupy our time, and prevent us from doing something that is our duty, and that we were elected to do. whilst at the same time they lead us to interfere with otherpeople&#39;s business in a way that may lead to our receiving a snub that we ought not to call down upon ourselves. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator BEST</inline>(Victoria).- I regret that my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> did not see his way to consent to the adjournment of the debate. I admit that one of the reasons which induced me to make the request was more or less personal. It was only an hour ago that I happened to hear that the motion was coming on for discussion to-day, and naturally I desired to ascertain exactly the character of the debate which has taken place. At the outset, I have to concur in the remarks of my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> who has expressed his regret that we should occupy our time with the discussion of an abstract question of this kind. The mere fact that we discuss it in an abstract way will not advance the cause of Home Rule in any &#34;degree. But what is more regretable is that we should attempt to interfere in one of the most vexed of questions - one that is not viewed with that degree of calmness, either here or in those parts of the Empire more directly concerned, that we should desire. Personally, I have not the remotest intention of imparting the slightest heat to the discussion. What I protest against is that an abstract question which is calculated to generate heat, and to arouse feeling, while at the same time it does not immediately concern us, should occupy the attention of the Senate. I concur in the view that the question of granting Home Rule to Ireland does not come within our jurisdiction. It is a mistake for us to attempt to interfere in matters of Imperial concern, which are at the present moment, and have been for many years, giving the most serious difficulty and concern to the British Parliament. </para>

            <para>- We are, and if the British Parliament had before it at the present time some&#39; measure dealing directly with this subject - some measure giving a certain amount of local government to the Irish people - we might be more or less justified in expressing an opinion. We might or we might not. But the point I am making is that there is no proposal of the kind immediately before the Parliament of Great Britain. The problem involved is one of an extremely difficult character. We are justified in saying that the Imperial Parliament has endeavoured to give satisfaction and to calm the strong feelings which exist. Measures have been enacted which may be described as the most advanced pieces of Socialism passed by any Parliament in the Empire. Quite irrespective of any taunts which might be launched against them, the Imperial Government, with a view to allay differences and remove ascerbities, have proposed to Parliament, which has carried, legislation of the most far reaching description. Honorable senators are well aware that the question of Home Rule is not one as to which anything like unanimity exists in Ireland itself. </para>

            <para>- However that may be, I am urging a reason why we should not deal with this matter. I apprehend that the argument has been used that, inasmuch as we in Australia have a degree of Home Rule, we should be prepared to extend the principle to Ireland. But there is a vast difference between Ireland and Australia, seeing that we are 13,000 or 14,000 miles away from the Imperial Seat of Government. </para>

            <para>- Not at all. If it were only municipal government that is sought for. Ireland, I would at once admit that it should be. granted in. the fullest way. At present I am utterly at a loss to know what good object can be attained by this motion, or where lies our right to deal with such a matter. It is futile to argue that because we in Australia have a certain amount of local government, the same system should be extended to Ireland. Whatever government we have is subject to the jurisdiction and control of the British Parliament, which has by Statute granted us certain powers. But I have always been under the impression, rightly or wrongly, that what is sought for Ireland is co-ordinate power with the British Government. </para>

            <para>- I know that the aspiration of a substantial section of the Home Rule Party was for a co-ordinate Parliament. Co-ordinate power is not granted to. and never was contemplated for, the outlying parts of the Empire, even for such a community as ourselves. However, the proximity of Ireland to England makes it part and parcel of England; and the very object of the Union was consolidation of England, Ireland, and Scotland. By a motion of this kind we are practically seeking to disintegrate rather than to consolidate the Union with the mother country. </para>

            <para>- England is our mother country. We cannot with reason be expected to accept the view that because we have local government here, the same measure of local government should be granted to Ireland itself. At the least, Ireland has a fair share of representation in the Supreme Parliament of the Empire ; indeed, if representation be based on population, there is not the slightest doubt that Ireland is over-represented. From that point of view, therefore, . there does not appear to be any serious grievance of which Ireland has reason, to complain. &#39;If it were possible for Australia to be equally represented in the Imperial Parliament, I should be prepared to say that Australia ought to become a closer partner with the mother country with the object of further unifying and consolidating the Empire. If Australia were in as close proximity to the mother country as Ireland is, I should desire nothing more for Australia than a fair and reasonable representation in the Supreme Parliament of the Empire. That, in my opinion, is the ideal of Empire. </para>

            <para>- I should always advocate the most ample self-government for municipal purposes ; but, in order to carry out the idea of the Empire, I should prefer a unified Parliament. However, it is unreasonable to argue on any analogy between Australia and Ireland. In addition, certain misguided persons, who are rather too vigorous in their advocacy of Home Rule, have avowed that what they ultimately desire is separation. </para>

One honorable senator on the other side expressed his general approval of the principle that such matters should be the subject of Executive responsibility, but, to my great surprise, that honorable senator, in order to express his want of confidence in the present Government decided to support this motion. I do not for a moment suggest or think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> is animated by the same consideration; but, as has been pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> - and I ask honorable senators to consider the point - this motion is, in a sense, not altogether a mere affirmation of an abstract principle, but an affirmation of a principle in connexion with a particular case. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> emphasized this view himself, but he failed, I think, to show that there is likely to be any want of a sense of due responsibility to the Commonwealth on the part of the Government, when called on to discharge this duty, which will devolve on. them in the ordinary course. </para>

The honorable senator may be in the inner circle of the Cabinet, and able to read the minds of the members of the Government, but, so far as I am concerned, I am not in a position to indicate to him, or any one else, who is likely to -be chosen to fill this important office. In the first place, it is absolutely necessary that a Bill, creating the office and defining the duties which will appertain to the office, shall pass both Houses of Parliament. Until such a Bill is passed, the powers of the High Commissioner defined, and the salary to attach to the position prescribed it will be impossible, I think, for any Government to take steps towards the selection of somebody to fill the position. </para>

                        <para>- That is a very unjustifiable interjection. I understand and thoroughly appreciate the sentiments which actuate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs.</inline> The honorable senator is of opinion that by following this course Australia will secure the benefit of the united wisdom of the members of both Houses of this Parliament in choosing somebody to represent the Commonwealth as High Commissioner in London. I remind honorable senators of an argument used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford.I</inline> think it is important that it should be emphasized, not merely for the benefit of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline> but of every honorable senator on this occasion, and on any other occasion when it is sought to bring the two Houses together to exercise any act which would ordinarily be an act of Executive responsibility. Under the Constitution, with certain exceptions, that are defined, in relation to money Bills, the Senate has practically . co-ordinate powers with the House of Representatives, but when honorable senators and honorable members of the House of Representatives are brought together to sit in joint conference to exercise a right of selection such as this, it must not be forgotten that the Senate will be represented by thirty-six units in that conference, and the House of Representatives will be represented by seventy-five. So that in the determination of that choice the House of Representatives will exercise a power in proportion to that exercised by the Senate of two to one. </para>

                        <para>- I am not in a position to speak as to that. I say that in similar cases in the States and in the Commonwealth that has been the practice in the past. I venture to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline> and those who are supporting his motion, have not put forward any satisfactory reasons why in this particular instance that principle or policy should be departed from. If there were any exceptional circumstances connected with this case - and there are not, because, after all, it is analogous to the appointment of an Agent-General for the first time to represent a State - there might be some show of reason for adopting a new procedure. No reason has been shown in this case, and I venture to warn honorable senators who are disposed to vote for this motion, that they may be establishing a precedent which will be found to be very dangerous indeed, not merely in, connexion with this particular appointment, but in regard to the prestige, power, and position of the Senate as a co-ordinate branch of the Legislature of the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford&#39;s</inline> argument, it seems to me, has been absolutely unanswered. No honorable senator, who has addressed the Senate in support of the motion, has ventured to take any cognizance of that argument, for the simple reason that he would have found it absolutely impossible to give an effective answer to it. </para>

                        <para>- The . argument that if the two Houses of this Parliament act in conference in making this choice, or any other choice, the Senate practically places itself in the position of exercising in that conference only one-half of the power it ordinarily has. It will have only one-half of the voting power . in such a conference, inasmuch as the House of Representatives consists of seventy-five members, and the Senate consists of only thirty-six. <inline font-style="italic">As</inline> our powers are equal with those of the House of Representatives in every respect, with the exception of certain powers in connexion with money matters dealt with in certain sections of the Constitution, we should be practically derogating from our own power, prestige, and position under the Constitution in taking part in such a conference. That, it seems to me, is a very great difficulty which must present itself in the consideration of a motion of this character dealing with any appointment. I feel that honorable senators, having heard the arguments put forward, will see that it is not desirable that we should follow the procedure proposed. If honorable senators desire to exercise a choice in the selection of the first occupant of this office, and if honorable members in another place desire to exercise such a choice, there is an effective way by which they may do so. When the Bill comes before the Senate it will be competent for any honorable senator to move for the insertion of a clause which shall contain the name of the gentleman proposed as the first occupant of the office. &#39; </para>

The action I have referred to can be taken in the Senate or in another place; and if that procedure is followed it will have at least this advantage, that the Senate will not be surrendering one-half of the power which it at present enjoys under the Constitution. </para>

                    <para class="block">Inasmuch as this is a measure which has. for its object to amend the Electoral Act in many particulars with reference to administration, I thought it would Be in the best interests of its proper consideration that I should move its second reading to-night, and agree to an adjournment of the debate, if that is desired, until next week. Such a course will afford honorable senators an opportunity to acquaint themselves with its provisions, and I hope by Saturday morning to have every one of them supplied with a printed memorandum which will not only give a reference to the sections of the Act sought to be amended, but point out concisely the effect of each amendment and the necessity or reason for its enactment. The Bill is largely framed on the results of the investigations of a Select Committee which was appointed by the House of Representatives on <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> 19th May, 1904. It included <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Poynton,</inline> from South Australia; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cameron</inline> and&#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Starrer,</inline> from Tasmania ; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fowler,</inline> from Western Australia; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Groom</inline> and&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDonald,</inline> from Queensland; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sydney</inline> Smith, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly, Mr. Brown,</inline> and&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, from New South Wales ;: and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger, Mr. McCay,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLean,</inline> from Victoria, so that it was; thoroughly representative of the States. It was brought into existence as the result of various complaints about the administration of the Act at the first elections thereunder. It conducted a series of inquiries in Melbourne and Sydney, examined witnesses concerning the various complaints and the administration of the Act generally ; and in October of last year it brought up a report which was circulated amongst the members of each House. At the beginning of that report it is described as - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The Select Committee appointed to inquire into the unsatisfactory manner in which the last general elections were conducted throughout the Commonwealth, : and the administration of the Electoral Act, and to report the results of such investigations. </para>
                        <para class="block">In its very interesting report the Select Committee made many recommendations. &#39; It was more particularly interesting to persons who were directly connected with the Electoral Department. But apart from that fact, it contained some paragraphs which were of very great interest indeed. I think, to the general public in connexion with the electoral administration, the compilation of the rolls, the cost of the elections, and the possibility of reducing that cost by taking a certain course of action which is therein indicated. Paragraph 5 reads as follows : - </para>
                        <para>With respect to the administration by the Chief Electoral Office, no complaints of a serious nature were sustained, and your Committee find that strenuous efforts were made by the officers to bring into due operation the Electoral Act, and to secure the efficient conduct of the general election. </para>
                        <para class="block">In the rest of the paragraph the Select Committee indicated that any little omissions or faults which might have occurred were occasioned by reason of the fact that all the officers were necessarily new to the duties thrust upon them by an Act which -for the first time was then put into operation. Paragraph 20 reads as follows : - </para>
                        <para>From the evidence given, it appears that the Commonwealth Electoral Act has met with strong approval. Yet the evidence has disclosed that, in certain respects, there is need of amendment to secure more efficient administration, and to give better effect to the intention of Parliament. Your Committee has considered the more important of the amendments suggested to them. </para>
                        <para>Then follow a number of the suggested amendments, some of which the Committee did not recommend, and others of which they did recommend. With one exception this Bill practically embodies their recommendations. The one exception is a suggested amendment of section 76 of the Act, and the reason why it has not been adopted is because in this Bill it is proposed to abolish the system of Revision Courts, and to provide that the work hitherto done by Revision Courts shall be done by the divisional returning -officer, with the right of appeal from his decision to a Court of summary jurisdiction. One very important suggestion of the Select Committee was that the assistant returning officers should be empowered to exercise the same functions in connexion with voting by post as the Act devolves upon the divisional returning officer. In very many instances it was found that the facilities we purported to grant for voting by post could not be availed of by reason of the fact that application had to be made to the divisional returning officer - that is, to the chief officer for the division. It is thought desirable that the assistant returning officers should be able to exercise similar powers, and that is provided for in clause 6. Another recommendation of the Select Committee was that it is desirable that claims to be enrolled to vote should be witnessed by a competent witness. I use the word competent to mean a witness such as an elector who may know or have some knowledge of the applicant. That alteration is endeavoured to be effected by clause 18. </para>

                            <para>- No. This clause deals with a case where an ordinary citizen who is not on the roll applies to&#39; be enrolled for a particular division in accordance with the provisions of the Act. Previously an application of this kind was not required to be witnessed in the way now proposed. If the applicant is at all known he should be able to get a resident in the locality to witness his form qf claim, and in some sense to substantiate the simple statements contained in it. </para>

                            <para>- Not so much as the present system, under which no witness is required. Another recommendation of the Select Committee was that in cases where an elector desired to be .transferred from one division to another, the process should be simplified. According to the Act, if an elector is resident in a certain portion of a division, he goes to the assistant returning officer or the electoral registrar who &#39;has charge of the polling list for the polling place he votes at, and applies for his transfer&#34;. That transfer goes to the &#39;divisional returning officer of the division to &#39;which he wishes to be transferred, and from that officer to the electoral registrar at the particular polling place in such division. It was recommended bv the Select Committee that this process should be simplified, and that the transfer should go direct from one electoral registrar to the other, and the acknowledgment of it should go back by the same course, so that the polling list could be altered. It will avoid a considerable amount of circuity, and a good deal of what might almost be called red-tapism, and facilitate transfers. </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para class="block">That alteration is provided for in clause 20. Another very important recommendation of the Select Committee is endeavoured to be given effect to in paragraph 36 of clause 16, and that is that all the Commonwealth and State officers be required to furnish the Commonwealth Electoral Officer with any statistical information necessary to prepare the rolls. Of course that provision was in the original Act, in section 33, but it was only applicable to the case of the preparation of the original lists. Clause 16, paragraph 36, of this Bill makes the provision applicable for all time. Another very important recommendation of the Select Committee was in connexion with the issue of the postal ballot papers. Honorable senators will remember having read in connexion with some cases which came before the Court that there were many abuses or charges of abuse of the privileges conferred by the Act in the way of facilities for postal voting. Clause &#39;26 of this Bill makes, I think, adequate safeguards against the infringements of the principles of the Act. </para>

In many instances these forms were signed some time before the election by persons who, as it turned out, were not absent from their polling-places by anything like five miles. There is reason to believe that in this way postal ballot-papers were abused as well as used. In some electorates, applications for postal ballot-papers were witnessed in blank in great numbers by authorized witnesses, and then taken round by parties interested in the election of one or other of the candidates, and signed by applicants. This Bill therefore provides that any person witnessing the application for a postal ballot-paper shall himself be present at the time, and that the applicant shall make out the form in his own handwriting. Of course, there is the usual provision in the event of his being illiterate. But, at any rate, the application must be signed there and then, in the presence of the witness, who must attest it and make all due and proper inquiries to satisfy himself that the statements contained in the application are correct. If he does not do that he is liable to a penalty. In many other ways this extraordinary privilege or facility which is conferred upon the elector by the Federal Act is safeguarded against many abuses which have crept in, and other abuses which may arise in the course of the development of parliamentary election tactics. </para>

                            <para>- That is a matter for settlement in Committee. With regard to the persons who are competent to witness applications for postal ballot-papers, and those who are competent to witness the recording of postal votes, although they do not, of course, see who is actually voted for, in the present Act the witnesses in both cases are not alike. Some classes of persons, like justices of the peace, are authorized to witness applications, but are not also authorized to witness the despatch of a vote. I think that the anomaly possibly arose when the Bill was going through Committee, through tHe inclusion in the clause authorizing the witnessing, of some other persons than those originally proposed as competent witnesses. But the persons authorized to witness the application for ballot-papers were mentioned in the schedule, which was not amended conformably. Probably that is the reason why there is a difference in the two cases. I am not sure, but think it probable that that is how the anomaly crept in. To remedy that defect, provision is made whereby persons who are competent to witness applications for postal ballot-papers shall be equally competent to witness the using and despatch of the papers. Clause 29 at the same time provides for additional persons as competent witnesses in both cases. It was found in many instances, especially in very large electorates - although perhaps we seemed to exhaust the list of persons who would be competent as witnesses - there was nobody within a reasonably convenient distance who came within the designation of competent witnesses under the Act. Consequently, the list of persons has been somewhat extended in this Bill. A difficulty that cropped up in connexion&#39; with the recording of votes was this : In addition to the despatch of the postal ballot-papers after the voter had recorded his vote, we provided that he should also send the certificate that was issued in connexion with his application form. In many instances, persons who endeavoured to vote by post sent forward&#39; in good faith their postal ballot-papers, but forgot to send the certificates. As a con sequence their votes were void, and could not be recognised by the returning officer To remedy that defect we propose that the ballot-paper shall have the certificate printed on the back, so that the two documents shall be inseparable. Consequently, there will be no possibility of a postal vote being void by reason of the separation of the two documents. That is provided for in clause 30. </para>

                            <para>- No, it simplifies it. Instead of there being two documents we shall have the certificate printed on one of the folds of the ballot-paper; consequently, the voter cannot send one document without the other, and his vote cannot be lost by reason &#39;of that defect. In forms in the schedule to the Bill we seek to give effect to these provisions. One difficulty that many candidates experienced in the first election, especially in the very large electorates, was in reference to the appointment of scrutineers. The Act provided that the appointment of a scrutineer could only take place on the divisional returning officer being notified. In a. large electorate like Maranoa or Coolgardie, a candidate might wish to appoint a certain scrutineer some hundreds of miles away from the centre where the returning officer was stationed, but could not appoint him because the returning officer could not be notified in time. We propose to remedy that by providing in clause 38 that assistant returning officers shall be competent to accept such notifications in the same way as returning officers. The words &#34; absent from one&#39;s polling place &#34; are not very clear in the original Act. Honorable senators will recollect that in connexion with the Wimmera election petition, it came out before the High Court that at one polling place an adjournment of the poll from the ordinary election day to a subsequent day took place. &#39; When the poll was resumed, electors who were not on the roll to vote at that polling place, but some of whom had been absent from their own polling places on the day of the election, flocked to vote; and on the ground that they had not exercised their right to vote at the election they demanded the right. It was obvious that that was not the intention of the Legislature in connexion with the adjournment of a poll at one polling place. These electors had forfeited their right to vote through not voting at their proper polling places. In order to clear up some obscurity and doubt - and there was some obscurity, in the &#34;opinion of the High Court - provision is made in clause 43. </para>

                            <para>- No, to give effect to what was the intention of the Legislature. In connexion with the Riverina election another difficulty arose. Honorable senators will remember that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chanter</inline> petitioned against the return of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blackwood,</inline> and during the hearing of the case it transpired that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chanter</inline> - or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blackwood,</inline> I forget which - at one polling-place had asked that there should be a re-count of the votes. The re-count was, I think, refused on the ground that there was no specific power given to the officer under the Act to permit a re-count on the application of any candidate, or under any circumstances. Provision is made in this Bill to grant a re-count if an application is made before the declaration of the poll by a candidate. The provisions dealing with that are contained in a part of the Bill by itself, consisting of clauses 44 and 45. </para>

                            <para>- I think he would be entitled to get such a re-count if he applied for it. It is a case in which, I think, a contrary intention not being expressed, the singular includes the plural. A new provision is inserted in clause 52, which, I think, is very desirable. That is to say, persons who are guilty of bribery, or of the exercise of undue influence in connexion with elections, are rendered incapable of being. chosen, or of sitting, as members of Parliament for a period of two years. In clause 51 provision is made to enable the Court of Disputed Returns to void an election, if illegal practices be proved. Honorable senators will remember that the High Court expressed its opinion that it had no power to void an election - that, although certain acts were declared by the Electoral Act to be illegal practices, and others were declared to amount to undue influence or bribery, Parliament had omitted to provide that the commission of any such acts should be ground for voiding an election. I do not remember whether the High Court expressed its doubt as to whether it could void an election, or whether it was its opinion that it could not do so ; but to clear up any uncertainty on the point, the provision is made not merely that these offences shall be grounds for voiding an election, but also that if any person has been convicted of bribery or of undue influence, or is found by the Court to have committed or attempted to commit bribery or undue influence, he shall be disqualified for a period of two years. </para>

                            <para>- That, again, is a matter for Committee. I have now dealt with the recommendations which were made by the Select Committee. There are a few other matters which are also provided for in the Bill, but which are not dealt with in the report of the Select Committee. These consist of one or two slight amendments of the original Act with regard to details iri administration. For instance, under the principal Act, the Governor-General is the person who appoints registrars and polling places, and carries out other functions of that character. This provision has been found, in many instances, to be somewhat cumbersome, and it is proposed that the Minister shall appoint the registrars, polling places, and polling areas. </para>

                            <para>- The Bill provides that the Minister may perform this duty without making it an Executive act. In many instances, polling places are fixed or officers appointed as an election is approaching, because there may have been since the last fixing of polling places, an alteration in the population ; and if it were necessary to wait for a fortnight or so, in order to call the Executive together, the opportunity might be lost to give greater facilities to numbers of electors. </para>

Under this Bill, the Chief Electoral Officer will be placed under the permanent head of the Electoral Department, whereas at present he is under the- control of the Minister of Home Affairs; and it is thought that the change will lend to greater discipline. </para>

                    <para class="block">State,&#34; and to insert in lieu the words, &#34; the Chief Electoral Officer shall, whenever necessary, ascertain a quota for each State.&#34; In the original Act it is not exactly prescribed that the Chief Electoral Officer shall be responsible for this, though the presumption, of course, is that he is responsible, and the object of this clause is to make the position certain. In clause 12 it is provided that, in the event of a redistribution of seats taking place in any States, that redistribution shall not take effect in connexion with any by-election ; that is to say, it shall not take effect in connexion with any casual vacancy before the next election. </para>

It is provided in section 22 of the principal Act that if both Houses of Parliament reject a redistribution scheme, the Minister may return it to the Commissioner, with a direction to provide a new one, but no further provision is made. Clause 13 amends this section of the principal Act by adding the following subsection : - </para>

If those events occur, and a proclamation does not issue, obviously those who are responsible for the administration of the Act are guilty of neglect, and the responsibility is thrown upon them. Part IV., which is very important, makes new provisions in connexion with polling places and subdivisions. The clauses in this division repeal the whole of Part IV.. of the principal Act, which is very small, consisting of only three clauses. The sections in the principal Act are 24, 25, and 26. Section 24 provides for the Governor-General proclaiming polling places or the cessation of a place as a polling place: section 25 provides for a report as to the polling places by the Commonwealth Electoral Officer, specifying what polling places are. required ; and section 26 provides where electors are to vote in case of a polling place having been abolished. Part IV. consists of one clause and paragraphs 24, 25, and 26. Paragraph 24 provides that the Governor-General may in any case in which he thinks fit to do so, by proclamation, divide any division into subdivisions. I shall deal . with this paragraph after I have given the purport of the other two. Paragraph 25 provides that the Minister may by notice in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette -</inline></para>

Take, for instance, the city of Melbourne ; if a polling place is established, the boundary of it may not be particularly described, and this is only an optional power to facilitate the collection of names, and the reference on the part of the electors themselves to the lists. </para>

                            <para>- In some places in the country that will be so : the elector may know the boundary, and he need not consult the list. Paragraph 26 is a provision consequential on the two previous paragraphs. The first paragraph in this part of the Bill, as I have already said, provides that the Governor-General may, in any case in which he thinks fit to do so. by proclamation, divide any division into sub-divisions. This looks a simple clause of little consequence, but it is one of great importance. Honorable senators will understand that many Commonwealth electorates in&#39; numerical strength may be equal to four or five State electorates, and it has been thought desirable to harmonize the State and Commonwealth electoral administration wherever practicable. If that can be done, it will result in great convenience and economy to both Commonwealth and States. </para>

                            <para>- That is the proposal. For instance, there may be a Commonwealth electorate containing 30,000 electors, and the State authorities, in mapping out their divisions, may decide to divide that Commonwealth electorate into three State electorates. This provision, in such case, will enable the Governor-General to make each such State electorate a subdivision of the Commonwealth electoral division ; and &#39;then the rolls used for the Commonwealth sub-division mav also be used as the rolls for it as a State division. This is simply a power given to the Governor-General, which he may exercise, so that the same rolls and same officers may be utilized, and expense thus saved. </para>

For the purpose of the Commonwealth elections of 1901 there were 974,504 electors enrolled, and the cost of the election was ^56,331 ns. rd. At the election held in December last there were 1,893,000 electors, and the cost of the election was about &#163;45,000. Except, as elsewhere indicated in this report, your Committee do not see how any further reduction in the cost can be effected if the officers employed are&#39; to be paid in proportion to the services rendered. </para>

                        <para>The evidence reveals that a great saving to the Australian people could be effected By the adoption of a uniform franchise and electoral system. By the acceptance of the uniform franchise and polling-places in common, the one collection and revision of names, and the one set of rolls could be made to serve both the Commonwealth and States. In South Australia, by the utilization of the State roll, the cost of printing the Commonwealth roll for that State amounted to &#163;500 instead of &#163;1,800. In Victoria the Government Printer estimates that by being able to use the State rolls a saving could be made to that State of ^2,500 per annum. Further economies would result if the same sets of officers could do the electoral duties for both Commonwealth and States. </para>

At any rate, economies can be exercised in this direction in all the States, excepting Victoria, and we. should not do well if we did not take advantage of the recommendation of the Select Committee to make such elastic -provisions in our Bill as will enable us, should the opportunity arise, to give being to such a very desirable state of things. I remind honorable senators that at the Premiers&#39; Conference held in Hobart, the matter was discussed, and on page 84 of the report of the Conference, honorable senators will find that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dugald</inline> Thomson moved, the Premier of Tasmania seconded, and the Conference agreed, to the following resolution: - </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">It is not stated whether that motion was agreed to unanimously, but there seems to have been no expression of dissent on the part of Victorian representatives to the suggested harmonization of the franchises, and that may be considered a hopeful sign that Victoria will shortly be brought into line with the other States in this matter. Part V. of the Bill repeals <inline font-style="italic">in toto</inline> sections 27 to 54 inclusive of the principal Act. It proposes the enactment of some new sections, and the re-enactment of some of the sections of the present Act, which are to be repealed, but for greater convenience it repeals the whole of the sections to which I have referred, so that those to be reenacted may be expressed&#39; in better verbiage, and with the advantage of the experience of their practical working. The main reasons why these sections are repealed is that they were largely framed to meet the peculiar circumstances attaching to the preparation of- the first rolls. By the preparation of those rolls the operation of most of these sections has been exhausted. I indicated in the course of my remarks that it was proposed to abolish, the Revision Courts, and to propose that divisional returning officers should do the work now done by those Courts. It will be interesting for honorable senators to learn that the Revision Court system, so far as the preparation of the rolls is concerned, has been found to be unworkable and unsatisfactory. Of course the system originated with Courts of Revision that were held in the old country, and charged with the responsibility of inquiring into the eligibility or title of individuals to the franchise. Where there were difficult and knotty questions to determine, that system was very likely a desirable piece of machinery for the purpose of solving them. We all know that revising barristers were appointed in connexion with those Courts to study the qualifications or disqualifications of applicants for the position of an elector. But when we have the simple qualifications of adult age, and residence in Australia for a certain time, these nice and intricate questions cannot possibly arise, and in actual experience it is found that the public take the very slightest possible interest in the work of the Revision Courts. Th*e figures will no doubt interest honorable senators. During the months of March, April, and May of this year Revision Courts have been held at 327 centres throughout the seventy-five electorates of the Commonwealth, and not more than fifty alterations have been made in the rolls as the result of any action on the part of the public. At present no names can be removed from the rolls unless upon action by a Revision Court, by the death of an elector, or by the transfer of an elector from one roll to another. A curious anomaly arose in connexion with this. In the Riverina district there were a number of full-blooded aboriginals, who were on the New South Wales State roll, and by virtue of the operation of section 41 of the Constitution they were entitled to be placed, and were placed, on the Commonwealth electoral roll. I do not know whether they were subsequently disfranchised in New South Wales, but I am informed that for some reason or another they ceased to be qualified as electors for the State Parliament, and their qualification as electors for the Commonwealth Parliament also ceased. But they could not be removed from the Commonwealth roll. They were not dead, they had not been transferred, no Revision Court was held that could deal with their case, their names were allowed to remain on the roll, and they were allowed to exercise the franchise in violation of the whole spirit of the law dealing with the matter. </para>

An appellant will not be required to wait a fortnight or a week for a Court of petty sessions to be held at a particular centre; but he can ask that two justices of the peace shall sit, not as a Court of summary jurisdiction, but to determine his appeal alone. I think that, on reflection, honorable senators will see that this system will work very much better in the interest of all parties, and will conduce to a far better administration of the.

Practically in all the States which have had an extended franchise, the Revision Courts have been working to a large extent only in name. What do justices of the peace know of the names on the roll? The public do not attend the Courts. The illustration I gave of 327 Revision Courts having been held this year illustrates that fact, and any alterations on the rolls were made in this particular method. In addition to that, we are providing, a safeguard against the possibility of abuse, which is just as likely to creep in under one system as under the other. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. The last clause provides that in future, when the Government Printer prints the main Act, he shall print it with all the necessary omissions and insertions occasioned by the passing of this or any other amending Bill. That has been the practice in Queensland. The present print of our &#39;Defence Act is a print of the principal Act, with all the omissions and insertions occasioned by the passing of the amending Bill of last session. At first sight, it may appear to be a dangerous system, but with the exercise of care and caution, such as are invariably exhibited by the Clerks in connexion with our Bills, it will work very well, and greatly .conduce to the convenience of the public, and those who have to consult the Acts. I may say that the Government have considered whether it is not advisable to bring in a short Bill with a general provision of that kind. </para>

If honorable senators will apply themselves to the consideration of the memorandum I shall circulate, I think they will come here next week and find that the object of this Bill is to provide for the greatest possible facilities to be given to electors to record their votes, the simplification of the administrative machinery of the Act, and the guarding against any abuse or infringement of the law. </para>

                    <para class="block">I do not intend to occupy the time of honorable senators very long in submitting this Bill for their consideration, lt makes a departure from the usual practice, and. I think, a very wise and proper one. The appropriations for the services of the year have been divided into two parts. The general Estimates of Expenditure will be embodied in the ordinary Appropriation Bill, which will come up to the Senate in due course. This Bill appropriates the money for new works which are required in various parts of the Commonwealth. Hitherto the Senate has had to wait for the Appropriation Bill until Parliament was on the eve of prorogation. Verv properly, a Parliament will not give up its hold upon the purse strings until .the last possible moment, because directly the annuall! Appropriation Bill is passed, the </para>
                    <para class="block">Ministry have .the whip-hand, and can prorogue at any moment. In the old country, as well as in the various States of the Commonwealth, the Parliament has very naturally delayed the appropriations for the year until honorable members have been quite satisfied that it was time to prorogue. The result of that practice in this Parliament has been that a number of public works which were provided for in the annual Appropriation Act could not, in some instances, even be taken in hand, and in many instances could only be partly proceeded with in the financial year, with the consequence that a large re-vote was required in the next financial year. Usually the prorogation has not taken place until the warm weather has begun to affect honorable members, and as the Christmas holidays came immediately afterwards; the works could not be put in hand for some time. Consequently, the re-votes for this year are very large. It is certainly desirable that the construction of public works should be authorized as early as possible in the financial year, so that they may be taken in hand and the necessity for asking for large re-votes avoided. For that reason it was decided to appropriate the money for public works in a special Bill. This is really a measure for discussion in Committee rather than in the Senate. Of course 1 am supplied, with all the requisite information concerning each item, but sometimes it is difficult to pick out the information exactly as it is desired by honorable senators. In Committee I hope to be able to furnish satisfactory information concerning every item. The Bill provides for the appropriation of &#163;418,911 for the construction of public works. Last year the appropriation for this purpose amounted to &#163;404.240, of which &#163;67,766 was unspent at the end of the financial year, and of which we require to re-vote ^&#163;51,000. Under the head of Trade and Customs we are asked to vote only &#163;2,164, of which &#163;1.979 is a re-vote. The additions to the Sydney Custom House absorb -^&#34;1,909. .We were not able to get on with that work last year, although the money was voted, and therefore a re-vote is required. On Defence works, we propose to expend ,&#163;13.818 in New South Wales, &#163;11,717 in Victoria. &#163;7,577 in Queensland, ,&#163;4,985 in South Australia, and ,&#163;25,223 in Western Australia. </para>

It is required for a fort at Fremantle, which is estimated to cost &#163;80,000. As we know, in a great many instances the estimates are considerably exceeded, and I should not be surprised to find that the amount runs closer to &#163;100.000 than &#163;80,000 before the work is finished. </para>

                            <para>-No; we have nothing to do with Esperance or its harbor. The total Defence vote is &#163;66,516, of which &#163;26,245 is a re-vote, and &#163;40,271 is for new service. As to Post and Telegraphs, we propose to spend in New South Wales, &#163;21,250 <inline font-style="italic">;</inline> in Victoria, &#163;20,137; in Queensland, &#163;7,145; in South Australia, &#163;5,624; in Western Australia, &#163;25,425. On telegraphs and telephones we propose to spend in New South Wales &#163;63,000 ; in Victoria, &#163;37,750; in Queensland, &#163;17,000; in South Australia, &#163;20,400; in Western Australia, &#163;23,000; and in Tasmania, &#163;8,000. That is a summary of the principal sums to be expended. Amongst the amounts I have enumerated are included items of which I shall be glad to give details in Committee. One of the principal votes for telephones is that for the construction of a line from Melbourne to Sydney. It is a work which is urgently required, and the Post Office officials consider that it will pav interest on the money from the start. Honorable senators will see on page 17 of the Bill details of expenditure under&#39; the control of the Department of Defence. Certain special defence material, costing, as estimated, &#163;178,045, is detailed, and on the following page are other items making the total &#163;181,060. of which we consider that &#163;41,060 will not be required during the present year; leaving a total of &#163;140,000 for defence purposes. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator will restrain his impatience, I will come to that item a little further on. I wish to make an explanation in connexion with the vote for special defence material. I do not intend to make any general speech in regard to defence questions as a whole, but I trust that I shall be able to state briefly to the Senate, when the general Estimates come forward, the policy of the Government in respect of the defence of the country, showing exactly the position in which we stand, and what we consider necessary to be done in regard to guns, ammunition, and so forth. At the present time I need not go into these details, except so far as is necessary to explain matters connected with this Bill. Honorable senators will perhaps remember that in 1903-4 a statement was laid before Parliament in which an expenditure was proposed of some , &#163;524,683, to be distributed over four years, for warlike stores to place our land forces on a war footing. In 1903-4, we spent &#163;96,000, and in 1904-5&#39;, &#163;169,000 was voted, of which we spent only &#163;138,000. We are now providing for the year 1905-6 a sum of &#163;154,000. The vote of &#163;24,000 for two7.5 guns and ammunition is for the Fremantle fort in Western Australia. With the expenditure of &#163;154,000 this year, there will be left a balance of &#163;135,000 in round figures to be voted next year. When I took office the Estimates had to be laid upon the table within a very short time. I went very carefully through the proposals contained in them with regard to the expenditure on the ordinary Military Forces for the year, but I did not see the details of this special proposed expenditure. . I went through&#39; the items and cut down the expenditure somewhat, but not so as to destroy efficiency. I was in a better position to do so than the late Minister of Defence was, because I had an opportunity not only of seeing what was proposed for the year, but also what was expended in the previous year. I could, therefore, form an opinion as to where there would be a chance of a saving being made. I cut down, the Estimates by &#163;10,000 or &#163;13,000. But, as I have said, I did not see these special items at that time. A sum of &#163;32,500 is set down for accoutrements of one sort and another, such as great coats, straps, and a variety of things that are necessary for military purposes. There is also a sum of &#163;10,000 for saddle-trees, stirrups, and bits; &#163;22,500 for making saddles; &#163;5,653 for medical equipment; &#163;4,000 for tools and miscellaneous materials, and other items. When I came to be Minister of Defence, my attention was called to the fact that we had very little cordite in stock. I noticed that an honorable member of another place asked a question as to how it was that certain guns could not be- used by the artillerymen on account of the scarcity of cordite. I made inquiries, and found that we had such a small quantity that we could not afford to fire it away in practice. Consequently, we were not able to give our artillerymen the opportunities for practice that they require. They could&#39; have used ordinary black powder, but such practice is not considered so good as is that with the ammunition that would be used in actual warfare. </para>

                            <para>- We do treat Western Australia rather badly sometimes,, do we not? No doubt the artillerymen in some places are firing with black powder, and it gives them a certain amount of practice, but it is not desirable to use it more than can be avoided. . As I have explained. I found that we were very short of cordite, and were also very short in our number of improved rifles. I came to the conclusion that saddle-trees, saddles, and other accoutrements were not quite so necessary to have in stock as was cordite; because such accoutrements would be put in store ready for time of war, and very possibly would rot before they would be required. The conclusion that I came to was that if war took place, what we should certainly require most was proper arms and ammunition. Such warlike stores, it seemed to me, were of much greater consequence than great coats, saddle-trees, saddles, and waggons. We can commandeer any number of waggons if necessary, and we can make saddles, or can use those we have been using in the past. But we could not do without ammunition, and we could not do without the most improved rifles. In reference to rifles we are in this position. It has been decided by the Council of Defence, on the advice of Major-General Hutton, that on a peace footing we should have something like 25,000 men. We are providing on the general Estimates of the year for something like 23,000 men, which is very close to the number considered desirable. On a war footing we are supposed to have 39,000 men. We must also arm them with the mosfimproved rifles. The weapon with which our service is armed is the Lee-Enfield magazine rifle. I have a statement here showing that we have something like 4,000 more rifles than are absolutely necessary to arm our forces on a peace footing. Of course our artillery and some other members of the forces do not require to be armed with rifles. In addition we have. about 30,000 men belonging to rifle clubs who are armed with Martini-Enfield rifles. The Martini-Enfield is a single-loader, and although it is a most excellent arm, it is not so good as a magazine rifle, which contains ten cartridges, that a man can fire very quickly. In actual war, as honorable senators can well imagine, troops armed with single loaders are placed at a great disadvantage when engaged against troops armed with magazine rifles, and the moral effect of having an inferior weapon must be considered. Therefore we ought to get the most improved rifles to arm our forces at their full strength. I do not say that we can attain that object at once, but we should vote for the purpose so much money every year until all our men are armed with magazine rifles. We can already arm in that way our troops on a peace footing ; but our reserve-list contains a large number of elderly men who are, perhaps, not as fit as they once were. It is necessary, however, to arm them also. </para>

When I saw that statement, I at once came to the conclusion that the expenditure on accoutrements, saddle-trees, the making of saddles, camp equipment, medical equipment, and so forth might be reduced, and attention devoted to what is absolutely required in case of war. </para>

                            <para>- In my opinion, it would be better to gradually increase the number of rifles and the arms we require for defence purposes year by year, as we have done in the past, spending just what money we can afford. Of course, I know that it has been advocated by the ex-Minister of Defence, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCay,</inline> that the Commonwealth should) borrow &#163;800,000 in order to obtain accoutrements, arms and ammunition, big guns for the forts, and so forth, and to keep the forces up to war strength. I have, however, had a statement prepared by the officers of the Department, who informed me that it would cost over &#163;1,000,000 to carry out the idea of the ex-Minister. When I address the Senate on the whole question of defence, I shall go into the details of all these matters. </para>

When the Council of Defence has decided as to what alterations of the items are desirable, I shall cause a statement to be laid upon the table of both Chambers, so that the fullest information and opportunity -for discussion may be afforded. </para>

I cannot at present indicate the exact variations which I shall propose, because I have no special knowledge, and must trust to officers who have. It ii&#39;s not proposed1&#39; to decrease or increase these items by a single pound in the lump, but merely to vary them, and, as I say, a statement will be laid before Parliament giving full details of the proposed expenditure. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps I am in one sense, though I did not know the item was in existence. At any rate, it is not proposed to mount those guns. It was intended that the <inline font-style="italic">Cerberus</inline> should be thoroughly overhauled, and converted into something like a decent fighting ship; but a careful survey showed that the vessel was beyond repair, and Captain Creswell thinks that she will have to be condemned and thrown to the scrap-heap. The gyroscopes are wanted for the torpedoes, and the service of shell is also necessary; and the total amount for special defence material is , &#163;140,000. </para>

                        <para>. - Some little time ago a Friday sifting was set aside for the discussion of the scheme by the Senate. At the conclusion of the day&#39;s sitting it appeared that there were one or two honorable senators who had not had an opportunity to take part in the discussion of the scheme. I then, stated that it was not the desire of the Government to block discussion of the matter, but that we were prepared to hear any discussion considered necessary, and to see that any representations made touching the policy and principle qf the Act and the classification scheme&#39; would receive proper recognition. Subsequently, owing to an honorable senator having placed a notice of motion oh the business-paper, I was prevented from in any way affording an opportunity for further discussion. The motion to which I refer was to have been discussed to-day, and I understand it- has been postponed. </para>
