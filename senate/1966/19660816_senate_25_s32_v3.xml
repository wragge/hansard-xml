          <para>. - It is with deep regret that I have to inform the Senate that our former colleague in the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Spooner, who retired from the Cabinet in 1964 and from the Senate in 1965, died on 15th July. Almost two years ago to the day in this chamber, on 11th August 1964, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Shane</inline> Paltridge, then Minister for Defence and Leader of the Government in the Senate, paid tribute to the service to the Senate and the Parliament of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Spooner who had retired from the Ministry in June of that year. Now, two short years later, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Spooner has died, leaving all who knew him with a sense of deep personal loss. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>For the last 15 years of his career, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Spooner served Australia as Cabinet Minister and senator in this Parliament. </para>
        <para class="block">Those 15 years were an inspiration to all who were fortunate enough to work with him. He had already had a long and distinguished career before he entered the Senate. He served his country well during the First World War with the 5th Australian Field Ambulance, was wounded and awarded the Military Medal. Later, he became one of the first members of the Australian Flying Corps. Then followed a successful commercial career and considerable service to the Liberal Party in New South Wales and Australia. </para>
        <para>In 1949, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Spooner was appointed Minister for Social Services in the Commonwealth Government. In fact, he was sworn in as a Minister before he was declared to be elected senator for New South Wales after the elections of 1949. To enter Cabinet at the very outset of a parliamentary career was a rare honour and a mark of the esteem with which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Spooner was regarded. A year and a half later, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Spooner became also Minister in Charge of War Service Homes. A few months later, in 1951, he was appointed Minister for National Development. </para>
        <para>For 13 years, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Spooner held this portfolio through a period of development unprecedented in this country's history. During that time, the reorganisation of the coal industry, the discovery and development of uranium and iron ore deposits and the encouragement of the search for oil, all marked the great progress being made by Australia and were largely the result of the imagination and driving power of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Spooner. Housing, too, progressed immensely under <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Spooner's guidance and his great interest in water conservation made names like the Snowy Mountains Authority, Chowilla Dam, Blowering Dam and the Ord River Scheme almost synonymous with the name of Spooner. The development of Australia's north made great strides during his term as Minister, with the establishment of a beef roads policy and the setting up of the Northern Division within the Department of National Development. </para>
        <para>All these things are a matter of record. Those of us who worked closely with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Spooner knew him as a fine leader, a man of great integrity and a steadfast friend. From 1956 to 1959 he was  Deputy  Leader of the Government in the Senate. In 1959 he was appointed Leader of the Government in the Senate. Thus we remember that he came into the Federal Government with no parliamentary experience at all. Yet from the very beginning he was a man of the Senate, a man for the Senate. He was quick and firm in his belief in this chamber and in the part that the Senate plays in the government of the nation. He brought to the Senate an authority and a dignity of which we can be proud today. </para>
        <para>During his parliamentary career <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Spooner represented Australia at international meetings at home and overseas. He was Acting Prime Minister in 1962 during the absence overseas of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies. When he retired from the Ministry and later from the Senate his energy and wise counsel were sadly missed. With the death of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Spooner Australia has lost a fine citizen who served his country well. We of the Senate have lost a great leader, a staunch colleague and a good friend. I move - </para>

          <para>. - On behalf of all senators of the Australian Labour Party I second the motion that has been proposed by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, all of whose remarks in relation to the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Spooner I endorse. Our own activities in and about the Parliament have been so intimately associated with those of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Spooner for so many years that his death afflicts us with a sense of bereavement and the feeling that we have lost some part of our souls. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline>was a senior Minister of every Government from 19th December 1949, on which day I surrendered to him the office of Minister for Social Services, until he resigned from the Ministry on 10th June 1964. During that period of 14Â£ years he had the added responsibility of leadership, at two levels, of the Government in the Senate for more than eight years. He mastered the detail of the work of the departments that he controlled and was an efficient and hardworking administrator. In addition, he made himself knowledgeable on all questions of the day.  His  common sense and experience led to a demand for his services on innumerable committees of the Cabinet. In short, for 14} years he led an arduous life of unceasing work on complex and important matters as a service to his Party and his Government, and in the interests of Australia as he saw them. In retrospect, I think he was a man who was thoroughly exhausted by his labours when he resigned from the Ministry in 1964. He was driven by a sense of loyalty to the causes he supported, at the cost of his health and at the sacrifice of a domestic life that I know was very precious to him. </para>
        <para>Soon after he resigned from the Senate in July last year he suffered from an illness which led to his death last month. During that trial he comported himself with the same stoicism and courage that he had shown in all his activities. It was consoling to learn from the naval chaplain who spoke of him at the funeral service at St. James' Church in Sydney that throughout his illness he turned increasingly to his Maker and his church. That is one more proof of the wholeness of the man. I thought the chaplain had great insight into character when he showed the constancy and steadfastness that ran through <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William's</inline> life. If, as I believe to be the case, every act, important or even seemingly inconsequential, that is not actually wrong attracts merit then <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> will have ended his life with much merit to his credit. I am sure he had neither inclination nor time for wrong-doing. He did many things of great importance, as his distinguished record shows. My colleagues and I respected him as an unyielding and able fighter for the causes he espoused.  His  manly qualities won our affectionate regard. I treasure a letter I received from him only a few days prior to his death, signed simply "Bill", suggesting that on my way in or out of the city one day I should call and see him for, as he put it, he "would love a yarn". 1 pay tribute to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> as a true Australian, a good man, an upholder of the traditions and the dignity of the Senate, and one of its great leaders. My colleagues join me in extending to Lady Spooner and her son and daughters our deepest sympathy in their great loss. We trust that they will be given the strength to bear their burden of sorrow. </para>

        </talk.start>
        <para>The Country Party wishes to be associated with the motion of condolence. It is its wish, too, to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to the widow and family of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Spooner. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William,</inline>a member of the Senate for 16 years, was a remarkable man. One would have to delve deeply into parliamentary archives to find a record to compare with his. He was elevated to the Ministry immediately after his election to Parliament in 1949. This, in itself, was a considerable achievement, one that few senators could hope to emulate. He had a tremendous capacity for work. He had personal qualities that made him a distinctive senator and Government Leader. He had wide experience in administration and he served his country in war and peace and during the most dramatic period of growth in the nation's history. </para>
        <para>The Government and Opposition leaders have outlined his parliamentary career. I do not wish to add to it, beyond passing the general observation that Big Bill Spooner, as many of us would like to remember him, as Government Leader directed the affairs of the Senate with force and skill. He was an iron willed character, a warm hearted man, a man with a kindly and happy disposition. When he was the leader of the coalition parties in this chamber, his co-operation with my Party was always highly appreciated. I was the recipient of many kindnesses at his hands. All senators mourn his passing. </para>

I did not have the pleasure, as a member of this chamber, of knowing <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Spooner but as a Minister of a State government I had an opportunity on frequent occasions to come into contact with him on matters of national development. All that has been said of him today, I believe, has been merited by him and is truly justified. He was a great Australian, a man who never sought to impress other than by his genuineness and his enthusiasm to do things for the development and growth of Australia. He served this country well in time of war and in time of peace. He was a man of exceptional experience in the commercial and political life of Australia. He served this Parliament - and I use the term " Parliament " in the broadest sense - as a senator and as a member with distinction. He had a long Cabinet career and in that time he was able to display his exceptional ability, administrative capacity and realistic approach to the innumerable problems that face Ministers of Government now as they did during the period that he was a Minister of the Commonwealth Government. He displayed exceptional capacity, vision and enthusiasm and had unlimited hope and confidence for the future of this country. On many occasions he discussed with me at length matters such as the finding of oil in Australia, the utilisation of natural gases, uranium resources and all the other natural deposits and gifts of providence that this country possesses. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline>was tireless in his efforts to win the consideration and the appreciation of the Commonwealth Government and of State Governments in respect of the necessity for doing things, not merely talking about them. If many of these things were not developed or exploited as readily and as rapidly as some of us thought they should have been, I can say in conscience that it was not due to lack of enthusiasm, hope or desire on the part of the late gentleman. </para>
        <para>It is undeniably true that this country is poorer for the passing of such men as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Spooner. However, there is not anything that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> or I can do about that. At least we should be grateful for and appreciative of the services these men have rendered and we acknowledge them with gratitude today. My colleague and I express our sincere condolence and sympathy to his sorrowing relatives. </para>

          <para>. - I, too, wish to express sympathy and regret at the passing of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Spooner. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William's</inline> career over a long period of years at all levels was one of service to Australia and to the community. He was a distinguished parliamentarian. He was a man who played an outstanding part in the promotion and practice of our democratic way of life. He was a leading and respected businessman in the commercial life of the city of Sydney. He was a lifelong helper and friend of the cause of ex-servicemen. He was a devoted and loving husband and father, a good friend and a very considerate opponent. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I had the opportunity of knowing <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> for a few years longer than his service as a senator. I knew him before he came to this Parliament in 1949. I have said that he was a distinguished parliamentarian and both the Leader of the Government in the Senate and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate referred to his career in that capacity. It is significant that he became a Minister of State immediately upon entering the Senate. By one of those odd circumstances his brother, Eric Spooner, became a Minister of State in the New South Wales Government in almost identical circumstances. Immediately upon being elected he became a Minister of State in the Stevens Government. </para>
        <para>One of the outstanding things in <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William's</inline> service as a parliamentarian was that he was able to reach the pinnacle of Acting Prime Minister of Australia. Being called upon to carry out this duty was an honour from which he obtained tremendous pride. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir William</inline> Spooner was a man with a great sense of duty and a great sense of proprieties. He was a great parliamentarian who believed in the cause of Parliament. When I said that he had played a tremendous part in the promotion and practice of our democratic way of life, I was referring to the fact that prior to coming to this place he was prominent in the formation and was the first  president  of the Liberal Party which is one of the leading political parties in our system of government. I say, in the sense of parliamentary practice, that anyone who played the part that he played in the promotion and formation of a political party which puts democratic principles into practice has a record of achievement which will find its place in the history of this great country of ours. </para>
        <para>I refer also to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> as a man who was a good friend to the ex-servicemen. He himself was an ex-serviceman; he had been awarded the Military Medal. Despite his tremendous activities in his business and parliamentary career, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> found time to take a very real and active interest in, and render support to, the Legacy movement. He found time to take a real and active interest in and give support to ex-servicemen's .groups of which he himself had been a part. I think that one of the very lovely things that happened on the day of his funeral service was the attendance of a group of men who had served with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> some 50 years before. They had come to pay their last respects to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William,</inline> or Bill as they knew him. Over those 50 years, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> had found time for the companionship of ex-servicemen, to keep in touch with them and to go to various functions that they held. </para>
        <para>I have said that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> was a devoted husband. He was devoted to his family. This we all knew. We all knew how proud he was of his family. I know that we all join in extending our very sincere sympathy to Lady Spooner and the other members of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William's</inline> family. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> was a good friend. He was not a flamboyant friend who made his friendship apparent all the time. He was a man to whom a person could go to talk when he had a problem. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> would be kind and gentle. He would show interest in, and give careful consideration to, what a person had to say.  His  record in this place as a leader, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> said, is that of one who fought hard for what he believed in. But in the cut and thrust of debate in this place, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> was, I believe history will show, a fair man and one who had respect for the point of view of the other man. He recognised above all else that our democratic way of life and the party system had to be made to work. In that concept there was the opportunity for him to consider the points of view of those opposed to him. </para>
        <para>I wish to conclude by saying that we who knew him quite well had tremendous respect for his achievements. I have spoken thus today because I wished to add my words to the tributes which have been paid to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> already. </para>

He was able to make a special contribution to debates in the House on matters concerning shipping because he had been for several years the Secretary and Industrial Court Advocate of the Sydney Branch of the Australasian Steamship Owners Federation. He also served in public office before entering Parliament when, from 1953 to 1956, he was a member of the Sydney City Council.

I concur in this tribute that has been paid to the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cockle</inline> by the Leader of the Government in the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cockle's</inline> five years in the House of Representatives climaxed a long period of community service in various fields. He was highly regarded in the Parliament. I extend our sympathy to members of the Government parties who, through <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cockle's</inline> untimely death, have lost a valuable colleague.

I can only add that with the death of John Cockle the Parliament has lost a man who was competent to speak with great personal knowledge and ability on the shipping industry, as the Leader of the Government has already mentioned. Those of us who had the privilege of working with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cockle</inline> on the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee recall his evident sincerity, his integrity and his personal friendship. He was liked and respected by us all and we all regret that a man of such qualities was not spared to carry on for a longer time.

I am at a disadvantage in that it was not my pleasure or good fortune to have been very intimately associated with the late gentleman for any length of time. However, I have knowledge of his capacity and ability, particularly in matters relating to the shipping world and I recognise that the Liberal Party, of which he was a member in the House of Representatives, has suffered a great loss because unquestionably he was a man who had had a very wide experience. He brought to this Parliament a good deal of knowledge that he had acquired over the years and which I am sure was of great value to his Party and to the Parliament. Men of varied experience from all walks of life and from a cross section of the community contribute to the success of this Parliament. The Parliament can ill afford to lose, particularly prematurely, men with a knowledge and an understanding of the requirements of the community life of Australia. We join very sincerely with previous speakers in extending our deepest sympathy to the relatives of the late gentleman. </para>

      <para>Tonight, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McMahon)</inline> is delivering in another place his Budget Speech for 1966-67. It is my privilege to outline to the Senate the Budget proposals of the Government. I want to refer first to the economic state of the nation and the outlook for the future. </para>
      <para>For five years now economic expansion has continued strongly although drought has taken toll in the past year. There have been many notable achievements; I mention a few. Since June 1961 employment has increased by nearly 600,000 or 19 per cent. Net immigration has brought us about 400,000 more people and we have had a net capital inflow of more than $2,500,000,000. Most industries have increased production, some of them considerably. Many of them also have considerably expanded their capacity for future production and many new industries have come into being. </para>
      <para>The value of our exports last year - not itself the best of recent years - was $2,648,000,000; that is, 43 per cent, above that of five years ago. Our overseas reserves have been considerably strengthened. The pessimism in some quarters of a year ago has proved to be unjustified. We have achieved these results without an undue rise in prices. Despite the fact that there has at times been heavy pressure on resources, the Consumer Price Index has risen by only about 9 per cent, during the last five years. This relative stability in our price level as compared with trends in prices overseas has been very welcome from the standpoint of our international competitiveness. </para>
      <para>In these years our problems have been extremely complex and have involved much more than the straightforward task of increasing employment and production. We have had to provide a big and rapid build-up in defence. Just at this time, too, many valuable capital projects, some of them very large, were getting under way. In a fully employed economy such as ours this involved a substantial transfer of resources so that some activities had to be held back in order that others could go quickly ahead. </para>
      <para>This readjustment has been accomplished without any serious dislocation or significant check to the overall growth of employment. Inevitably, however, there has been a slackening of demand in some industries. This occurred in the motor vehicle industry and most of the industries producing consumer durables. In addition to this, the serious drought in New South Wales and Queensland affected both consumer spending and farm investment. </para>
      <para>Looking ahead, there is reason for confidence about the outlook for production this year. From local increase and from immigration there should be enough additional labour to make possible a rise of about 3 per cent, in civilian employment; this of course is quite substantial. Other conditions should also favour an increase in output. On the rural side, while the drought or dry conditions have affected large areas of New South Wales and Queensland, seasons elsewhere have been generally good. Given good fortune with the weather over the next few months it is expected that total farm output will rise - though by how much is, of course, uncertain at this stage. </para>
      <para>There should be a large increase in the output of minerals and metals, especially as lange new projects in iron ore, alumina and so on come into production. The large expenditures on plant and equipment which have already taken place must raise productivity and will continue to do so for some time to come. Looking to the future, the level of activity and hence of output depends very much on the trend and strength of domestic demand. As to one big sector of demand - that is, expenditure by governments and other public authorities - we can be absolutely certain that it will go on rising strongly. </para>
      <para>The outlook for private capital expenditure in building and construction is difficult to assess. Dwelling construction has made some recovery and seems likely to continue to rise. The Government will do all it can to see that it does. </para>
      <para>There are, however, doubts about the trend in private non-dwelling construction. This wide and varied category has been increasing rapidly for several years past - partly because some large mining and industrial developments have taken place. In recent months there have been indications that the pace of growth in this sector may be slowing down. The possibility that it will do so cannot be ignored and we have kept this possibility well in mind while shaping our policy on the Budget. </para>
      <para>Much the same applies to private capital expenditure on plant and equipment. Expenditure in this sector has been running high for a long time. Whilst much of the equipment has been imported from overseas, a good deal of it has been made locally, so that any fall in expenditure would tend to affect the local industries involved in such forms of production. </para>
      <para>As to consumer spending, the rate of increase in it has tended to fall off in recent years, especially over the last twelve months or so. Tax increases, the effects of drought and the pressure of debts have all affected consumer spending. Some reduction in the rate of increase of consumer demand had to take place in order to release resources for defence purposes and for other high priority uses. Obviously it would not be wise to permit such a trend to go too far if our resources are to be kept fully employed. As it is, there was a fall in output and employment in a large number of the industries which produce consumer durables, and employment in manufacturing as a whole rose very little in 1965-66. </para>
      <para>Speaking generally, we expect a considerable lift in consumer demand through 1966-67. The large and widespread wage increases flowing from the decisions in the national wage cases will undoubtedly boost community spending. This spending will be strengthened if there is some rise in farm income. The effect of the Commonwealth Budget will be expansionary and will affect many avenues of demand including consumption. </para>
      <para>Because of the prospective increase in the supply of labour and the growth of industrial capacity we should welcome some increase in demand in this area. But we do not want the economy to be stimulated to a degree that will later cause heavy competition for labour and materials. </para>
      <para>In the broad, then, there should be scope for a rise in employment this year of about the same size as last year; it could be a little bigger and, with some encouragement from the weather, output should grow a good deal faster than last year. </para>
      <para>Our overseas trade has grown in both money and physical terms and our overseas reserves are substantial. For all these reasons a reasonably strong increase in overall demand could probably be met without causing too great a run-down of our international reserves. </para>

        <title>DEFENCE AND THE BUDGET</title>
        <page.no>10</page.no>
        <type>miscellaneous</type>
      </debateinfo>
      <para>This year the Government is providing $1,000,000,000 for outlays on defence. This is $252,000,000 or 34 per cent, more than actual expenditure in 1965-66. </para>
      <para>Thanks to the excellent financial arrangements we have made with the United States Government, about $114,000,000 of the amount to be spent in that country for the purchase of materials and equipment this year will be covered by credits. This obligation is, however, only deferred and cash will have to be found in later years. </para>
      <para>This fact of steeply increasing defence expenditure dominates our budgetary problem this year as it did that of last year. It also raises profound issues of national priorities. Since 1963-64, only three years ago, annual defence costs have risen by Â§480,000,000 or over 90 per cent. Some allowance must be made for price and cost increases; even so, it is obvious that, in this comparatively short space of time, defence has come to claim  a  very large additional amount of resources that would otherwise have gone to developmental or consumption uses. </para>
      <para>No one could seriously question the rightness of this. The need has arisen to strengthen our defences and to support allies with whom we have treaty obligations: We have faced that necessity and no one can reasonably say that the cost has so far been unduly burdensome. In fact we have been able in these years to ensure both a big increase in the defence effort and also  a  large expansion of our productive capacity. And yet, with each successive rise in defence expenditure, we have become increasingly conscious of a developing conflict between major national purposes - between the requirements of defence and those of growth. It is a real and substantial conflict. For Australia, more than for most countries, growth in its more fundamental forms is vital and of great urgency. </para>

      </debateinfo>
      <para>So far as defence preparations compete for resources with other aims and activities we have difficult choices to make. Many times when compiling this Budget, these choices had to be made. The problem just cannot be solved or evaded by some conventional process of turning the screws  a  little harder and then a little harder again - that is, by increasing taxation to cut back consumption in order to release resources and when this has been done to increase defence expenditure and provide for more development. Beyond a point that sort of process can have adverse effects on the economy. </para>
      <para>Accordingly, while a big rise in our defence commitments has been inescapable and has been accepted, it has been very much our concern to ensure that the burden should not become so great, either now or in the period ahead, as to force a curtailment of other activities which are fundamental to the growing strength of the nation. </para>
      <para>We have had to put aside some popular and desirable measures. We have not, however, been prepared to put aside the claims of those who, through age or illness or other misfortune, are in need of help. </para>
      <para>Total expenditure is expected to reach $5,930,000,000 in this financial year. On existing accounting procedures, the increase over expenditures last year will be $600,000,000. Besides the increase of $252,000,000 on defence spending there is estimated to be an increase of $348,000,000 in other items. The figure was kept down to this level <inline font-style="italic">only by</inline> rejecting many expenditure proposals that came before us and by drastically pruning others. The plain fact is that many ideas of what the Budget can carry, the costs the taxpayer should be asked to bear and, indeed, the extent to which our resources can be stretched, have been tending to outrun the limits of what is practicable. </para>
      <para>May I turn now to each of the main expenditure groups. </para>
      <para class="block">Payments to or for the States. </para>
      <para>The financial assistance grants are estimated this year at about $816,600,000, an increase of about $59,000,000 over lastyear. The special grants to Western Australia and Tasmania, as recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission, total $40,072,000, which is $1,698,000 less than in 1965-66. </para>
      <para>Because of the continuing effects of drought we have had to give special consideration to the financial difficulties of New South Wales and Queensland. Last year we provided them with $21,700,000 so that they might carry out programmes of drought assistance and relief. This year, regrettably, the need continues; to some extent it is accentuated because of the problems of re-stocking in areas which have had relief rains. As well, it has been found that the budgets of both States are suffering heavy adverse effects of an indirect kind which are clearly attributable to the drought and they would both be in serious financial difficulties without some further help. Accordingly it is proposed that, besides providing some $24,250,000 for drought assistance measures, we should also make grants of $8,000,000 to New South Wales and $2,750,000 to Queensland to help them meet budgetary problems due to revenue losses arising from the drought. All told, therefore, our assistance to those two States this year on account of the drought is estimated to be $35,000,000. </para>
      <para>There are in addition some miscellaneous grants for general assistance to the States. They amount this year to about $34,000,000, an increase of about $1,280,000 over last year. So that, on these figures, general purpose grants to the States and drought assistance will total about $926,000,000, which is some $72,000,000 above the total for 1965-66. </para>

        <para>Next, on the capital side of the account, there is the money that has to be found by the Commonwealth for construction activities of many kinds, mainly on the part of the States but also on its own account. First, I refer to the Loan Council programmes, which cover the general run of State works and housing operations. Last year the total was $605,000,000; this year it will be $645,000,000, or $40,000,000 higher. This amount has to be found either by public borrowings, or insofar as borrowings fall short - as they are almost certain to do this year - from the Commonwealth Budget. </para>
        <para>Next, there is a long and fast increasing list of payments to the States for specific projects or classes of development work. It includes land development, forestry, water conservation and flood mitigation, roads, railways and ports. Such activities are estimated this year to require $198,600,000. an increase on last year of $12,900,000. Besides these, the Commonwealth has its own big programme of capital works and services, estimated .this year to require $471,400,000, which is $37,400,000 above expenditure in 1965-66. </para>
        <para>We have set down an amount of $58,000,000 for war service homes. This is $12,000,000 less than last year because applications for advances have fallen and there is now no waiting list for advances either to buy or build new dwellings or to buy previously occupied dwellings. If applications through the year prove to be more than now expected, additional funds will be provided. Works in the Territories are expected to cost $80,900,000, which is $15,000,000 more than last year. </para>
        <para>Bringing these large items together, then, the Commonwealth is undertaking to find in this financial year $1,315,000,000 for works, including housing, and related capital services. This is an increase of $90,000,000 over the amount found for comparable expenditure in 1965-66. </para>

Following a request by the Government of New South Wales for financial assistance for the purpose, we have decided to offer New South Wales a grant of $10,000,000 towards meeting the cost of upgrading the Parkes-Broken Hill section by the end of 1969. It is envisaged that the arrangements between the Commonwealth and New South Wales will be contained in an agreement which will be submitted to Parliament in due course.

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>Following the same broad theme, I next draw attention to the formidable amounts being provided these days for subsidies and other forms of assistance to industry. Last year the total was $124,200,000. This year the estimate, allowing for a major addition we propose to make, is about $142,000,000. The list already includes subsidies on butter and cheese, cotton, gold mining, ship building, petroleum products prices, petroleum search, wheat stabilisation, wool use promotion, and superphosphate.  petroleum search subsidy. </para>
        <para>The amount provided this year for expenditure under the Petroleum Search Subsidy Act is $11,900,000. This is designed to cover a programme of new subsidy approvals during the year of $16,000,000, compared with a programme of $1 1,700,000 in 1965-66. It is estimated that at 30th June 1967 the outstanding commitments in respect of subsidy approvals will be $10,800,000; the corresponding figure at 30th June 1966 was $6,700,000.  superphosphate bounty. </para>
        <para>In 1963-64 we brought in a three year scheme to pay a bounty on superphosphate at a standard rate of $6 per ton. The purpose was to awaken interest in and stimulate the use of superphosphate as a means to improve the productivity of farm lands deficient in phosphorus. The effect of the scheme is illustrated by the fact that sales of superphosphate in 1965-66 were just on 50 per cent, higher than in 1962-63. The scheme will be continued in operation, at the same standard bounty rate of $6 per ton, for a further period until 31st October 1969. The estimated cost of the bounty in 1966-67 is $28,000,000. nitrogenous fertilisers bounty. </para>
        <para>Nitrogenous fertilisers have long been important to a number of our primary industries, especially sugar growing and fruit and vegetable production. Recent developments have indicated that there is much scope for increasing productivity by applying nitrogenous fertilisers to fodder and grain crops and new or established pastures. We have accordingly decided to introduce a bounty on nitrogenous fertilisers in addition to that payable on superphosphate. </para>
        <para>The rate of bounty will be $80 per ton of the determined nitrogen content of naturally occurring sodium nitrates and products manufactured from inorganic chemical nitrogen. The bounty will be payable on such products sold by manufacturers and importers during the period 17th August 1966 to 31st October 1969 for use in Australia as fertiliser or stock feed supplement. </para>
        <para class="block">The bounty is estimated to cost $4,750,000 in 1966-67 and $5,600,000 in the first full year of operation. research and development. </para>
        <para>In a world where technology is changing rapidly and becoming increasingly complex, industrial research and development is assuming increasing importance in the promotion of the nation's industrial strength and efficiency. For this reason we have for some time now been studying the question of encouraging Australian industry to undertake more research and development work on its own. </para>
        <para>The Government has decided to provide up to $6,000,000 a year for a scheme of grants for this purpose. Some details of the scheme have still to be finalized, but eligibility for grants will be confined to firms which increase their expenditure on research and development as compared with a base period. </para>
        <para>This year expenditure on the scheme will necessarily be small because legislation will need to be enacted and also because the scheme will apply only to expanded research and development. Accordingly, provision is being made for expenditure of $250,000 on the scheme in 1966-67. </para>

        <para>In 1961-62 this expenditure amounted to $51,900,000. Last year the total was $110,900,000. This year it will be $141,100,000.

Of the provision for this year, $54,600,000 will comprise grants for both capital and recurrent expenditures of universities.

      <para>Much that I have said so far is directed to the fact that our expenditure this year will show a very large increase. By contrast, there will not be a large rise in revenue. The effects of drought and of cost increases on farm income will show up in reduced yields of income tax from primary producers. The income of many companies assessable for taxation this year will reflect the indifferent year those companies had in 1965-66. </para>
      <para>No doubt, with rising employment and earnings, there will be a fairly strong increase in pay-as-you-earn collections and we can expect substantial increases from sales tax and customs and excise. These considerations however do not add up to the prospect of buoyant revenues. Regrettably, in the light of its heavy current and prospective expenditure commitments, the Government cannot propose any general tax reductions this year. It does propose a number of minor concessions, which I will outline presently. The cost of these to revenue will be $1,500,000 in 1966-67 and $3,700,000 in a full year. After taking account of these reductions we estimate that taxation revenue will increase this year by $274,000,000. </para>

      <para>As a corollary to the increase in age pensions, it is proposed to raise the income level up to which the age allowance exemption is available to residents of Australia who meet the age qualification. The qualifying age is sixty years for women and sixty-five years for men. No tax is payable at present by an aged person whose net income does not exceed $988. In future, no tax will be payable by an aged person whose net income does not exceed $1,040. For a married person qualified by age, exemption from tax will be authorised where the combined net income of the husband and wife does not exceed $1,950, as compared with $1,872 at present. The cost to revenue of these adjustments to the age allowance will be $800,000 in a full year and $400,000 in 1966-67. </para>

      <para>One proposal affecting primary producers relates to those wool-growers who, because of the drought, advanced shearing dates during the 1965-66 income year. In these cases proceeds of two wool clips would be brought to account for taxation purposes in the one year. It is proposed that these wool-growers will be able to elect to transfer the net proceeds of the second clip to the 1966-67 income year. This will extend to the 1965-66 income year a measure adopted to meet corresponding circumstances in the 1964-65 income year. </para>
      <para>A second proposal relates to the forced sales of livestock in consequence of fire, drought or flood. At present, a primary producer may elect that the net proceeds of these sales be taxed over five income years if the proceeds are used principally to purchase replacement stock. It is proposed to extend this right of election to cases in which the proceeds are used principally to re-stock otherwise than by purchasing new stock, for example, by maintaining a breeding heard or flock. The extended right of election will apply to forced sales made during the 1965-66 income year and subsequent years. </para>
      <para>A further proposal would remove the limit of seven years on the carry-forward period for deduction of prior year losses incurred in primary production. The limitation will not in future apply to a loss incurred in the 1957-58 income year or a subsequent year. It is also proposed to amend the averaging provisions applicable to primary producers by raising the income limits up to which the averaging provisions apply from $8,000 to $16,000. The provisions governing the right of taxpayers to withdraw from or re-enter the averaging system are also being reviewed. An announcement will be made on both these matters shortly. The final proposal affecting primary producers is the allowance of a deduction in the year in which it is incurred for the full cost of fences erected to combat soil erosion. The cost to revenue of these proposals is estimated to be <inline font-style="italic">$1,560,000</inline> in a full year and $300,000 for 1966-67. </para>

Gifts to the national trusts of other States are already exempt from estate duty. The estimated cost to revenue for a full year is $70,000. No cost is expected in 1966-67. </para>

This proposal will cost $60,000 in a full year and $40,000 in 1966-67. A further proposal relates to the payroll tax rebate available to exporters. In calculating the rebate, it is proposed that excise duty and sales tax be excluded from the gross receipts of an exporter, where these levies on particular goods are included in the price for which the goods are sold by him. This change will increase the rebate available to exporters liable to pay these levies. The changed formula will have effect in relation to exports made after 1st July 1 966. The cost to revenue is estimated to be $200,000 for a full year, but there will be no cost in 1966-67. </para>

Apart from the effects of accounting changes, there will be a small increase in miscellaneous receipts. Included amongst the latter are the proceeds of air navigation charges which, in accordance with its standing policy of seeking full eventual recovery of the cost of commercial aviation facilities, the Government proposes to increase by a further 10 per cent. In all, therefore, we are reckoning on receipts from taxation, charges and similar sources of the order of $5,397,000,000. Accounting changes apart, this would represent an increase of about $318,000,000 over that of last year. </para>

      <para>Last year, although redemptions were fairly heavy, our net public borrowings were $252,000,000. We are unlikely to do nearly as well this year because capital for international investment is drying up and there is intense competition for what is available. Interest rates are very high and tending to rise further and both Great Britain and the United States have placed restraints on capital exports. Within Australia there is also strong competition for capital and public authority borrowing programmes are larger than ever. We also face the prospect of heavier redemptions this year than last, especially in respect of overseas debt. </para>
      <para>Net loan raisings are always difficult to assess. In the Budget we have used a tentative figure of $150,000,000 which would be about $100,000,000 less than those of 1965-66. Besides these net loan raisings we have available, as I have mentioned earlier, credits to cover purchases of defence equipment in the United States, the amount to be provided this year being estimated at some $114,000,000. There would accordingly remain an amount of about $270,000,000 to be financed from temporary borrowings in Australia. Last year no such borrowings were necessary. A Bill will later be introduced to authorize the necessary borrowings. </para>

      <para>In terms of cash receipts and outlays, therefore, this Budget will probably run fairly heavily into deficit. Such a deficit will increase monetary liquidity; on the other hand, this will bc offset to the extent that there is any decline in our overseas reserves. Earlier, when discussing the general outlook for the economy and, in particular, the likely trend of demand, I said that the Government expected the general effect of the Budget to be expansionary. </para>
      <para>Within limits the Government wants the Budget to be expansionary. Indeed, if the Budget were not expansionary we would be taking other measures to ensure that expansion took place. We want to see full employment maintained and expansion go on as well in the private as in the public sector. We do want resources to be fully and effectively employed. This is not an easy task and requires both sensitive judgment and continued attention. We must always keep in mind the possibility of significant changes occurring both at home and abroad which could affect the prospect of achieving our goals. We do say that we will be ready to meet the changes and shall do our best to see that our objectives are achieved. </para>
      <para>We regret that we cannot propose general reductions in taxation. The weight of our expenditure commitments, especially on the side of defence, precludes such a possibility even though the Government is very conscious that the burden of taxation has increased in recent years, particularly for the individual taxpayer. It is the price we pay for growth and for security; but it is also a warning that, as a nation of fewer than 12 million people with a continent to develop, we face strict limits on the commitments we can and should accept. </para>

This is no mean achievement and I am sure that had you not been qualified and had you not discharged your duties in the able manner in which you have done you would not have created this record.

I commend you, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, for</inline> the very impartial and courteous manner in which you have discharged your duties since I have been here. </para>

        <para>It is good to hear the Leader of the Opposition compliment you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> because in most cases members of the Opposition think that the Presiding Officer of the House of Parliament, whether  President  or  Speaker,  cannot be impartial but must be opposed to them. That is not so. It is possible for men who occupy these positions to be fair and impartial in the discharge of their duties. In the 12 years during which you have occupied this position, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> evidently you have won many friends and the admiration of all who have served under your jurisdiction. I want to say that I acknowledge very readily your qualifications and your impartiality during the 12 months I have been here and I thank you for the courtesy you have extended to me in that period. </para>

          <para>- I would like to join with other speakers, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> in offering to you my congratulations on your record term as Presiding Officer of what is the Upper House of the Australian Parliament. I heartily support the remarks of other speakers and have very little to add, except to say that 1 want to take this opportunity of thanking you personally for all the courtesies you have extended to me as a Temporary  Chairman  of Committees and more recently as  Chairman  of Committees of this Senate. Your advice and assistance have at all times been most appreciated by me. All of us in this chamber know that you have seen the inadequacy of these parliamentary buildings and we are conscious of your efforts, over a great number of years, to do something about the matter and give a lead in overcoming the limitations of the buildings. To my mind it was -fitting that on the appointment of the Joint Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House you were made  Chairman  of that Committee. I warmly congratulate you and extend to you my best wishes for a happy and fruitful association in the remaining period of service in your high and important office. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr. President,</inline>I desire to join with my parliamentary colleagues in paying you this very well earned tribute. You have been most gracious to me. 1 have never known any other  President  in this chamber as you were elected  President  on the day that I was sworn in. My reason for rising is to say that you have been more than kind to me. Unfortunately, at times I possibly take a little longer in speaking than others do. Some may think I am not entitled to do so but, with the warm friendship that you display, you have always made me very much at home. In 28 years in politics, both State and Federal, only once have I been hurt owing to an impediment that I have. I have always been most grateful to you for the great help and kindness that you have shown in allowing me the extra time that I have taken. I wish both you and Lady McMullin everything that you wish yourselves. May you both have the greatest of all gifts, good health. </para>

          <para>- Honorable senators, and particularly those who have spoken of my service in this chamber, it is with great humility that I look back over those 12 years, knowing full well that had it not been for your loyalty and readiness to assist and your genuine appreciation of the institution of Parliament I would never have been able to preside as I have in this chamber. It is with great humility that I remember my association with you, ladies and gentlemen of the Senate. If 1 have rendered a service it has been possible only because of the assistance and loyalty I have had from you collectively as senators in this chamber. I thank you very sincerely and I shall always remember your very kind words spoken here tonight. They will be much cherished by me. </para>
