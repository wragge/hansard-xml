Trethowan, M.L.C., at a meeting in Sydney,&#34; That the blame for the unsaleability of Australian meat in England is attributable to the Australian Government authorities&#39; in England&#34;?

If there is truth in the charge, will the Minister take steps to remedy the situation? </para>

                    <para class="block">This  isa  very short and simple measure, with which I anticipate the speedy concurrence of the Senate. Under the existing law there is a provision requiring that Ordinances issued on the authority of the Government in respect of New Guinea shall be &#34;notified&#34; in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Gazette.</inline> The legal interpretation of that provision has been taken  to  involve the actual printing and publishing of the Ordinances in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette.</inline> That has been, and  is,  deemed an unnecessary expense. This Bill is intended  to  provide that a notification in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> of any specified Ordinance  as  setting out where copies of the Ordinance can &#34;be obtained shall be a sufficient compliance with the law. If the Bill is passed, instead of being under the expense pf publishing the whole of these Ordinances in the Gazette - and many of them are very lengthy - a mere notification that an Ordinance has been made, and an indication of the places at which it can be purchased, will be regarded as sufficient. </para>

Their inclusion does not interfere with the principle of the Bill in any way, and they are simply put in as an ordinary safeguard.

In the majority of cases where amendments are found to be necessary it is because of something that has arisen between the time of the passing of the original measure and the time when the necessity; to amend it becomes apparent. It would be absurd to omit the words, because they are quite necessary to avoid possible trouble which might arise in the future out of some omission in the past. . </para>

                    <para>. -  The clause simply repeats what is already in the principal Act; hut in  the  principal Act tie section applies only to the Territory of Papua. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> is a repetition of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of section 9a of the principal Act. The need for it arises because there were certain trade marks given under State law, and the object is to include them. The clause will cover the Mandated Territories in the same way as the original Act covers Papua. </para>

There are certain reservations, if I remember rightly, in the terms of the Mandate, which had reference to the nations which signed the Treaty; but as the United States of America was not one of them, and as it has been shown by the Washington Conference that that country desires to take a very strong hand in the trade and commerce of the Mandated Territories, I want to know whether the extension of the Act to those Territories is in keeping with the spirit of the terms of the Mandate. I should also like to know where such countries as the United States of America would stand in relation to the operation of this law. </para>

These powers have the backing, first, of the Treaty of Peace, and, secondly, of the League of Nations. It is true that the United States of America has made a reservation; but that applies only to that nation. She has reserved the right to negotiate with Great Britain as regards the Mandated Territories;  but that does not affect our powers, which are clearly set out in the Peace Treaty. &#39;The Mandate has been given to us in accordance with the terms of the Treaty. The United States of America has announced, however, that she reserves any rights she has as one of the associated Powers in regard to the Mandate. </para>

The three nations are in the position of a company working the phosphates. While the Commonwealth appoints the Administrator, it can, by proclamation, bring Nauru under this law; but it does not follow that, because we take that power, it will be exercised. I cannot conceive that there will be any need for a trade marks law in Nauru ; but if it should be so the Act can be extended to that Territory. </para>

                            <para>- That would apply to the larger centres of population, but I am speaking of the position that might arise in what may be regarded as purely railway towns, and unless the situation can be safeguarded in some way by allowing railway employees exemption only in the event; say, of serious inconvenience being threatened to the working of the railway service, I see no special merit in this Bill. If a railway man is told off for duty to take a train out or to look after his business and keep the service running, that ought to be ample excuse for exemption under the Jury Act as it stands. But to exempt, by one clause in this Bill, the whole of the Commonwealth railway employees, seems to me to make possible an anomalous condition of affairs, because in certain towns a very large section of the population would be prevented from serving, and thus discharging one of the duties of citizenship.. </para>

                        <para>.- I should like to know from the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> whether the Jury Act does not contain provision for the exemption of officials, such as railway employees, whose attendance on a jury might result in the disorganization of the railway system at any particular point. Would not the situation be met if the Bill were made to apply to the running staff, or to those officials whose attendance on a jury might result in serious inconvenience to an important public department? In any case, every man who is asked to serve on a jury does so at some personal inconvenience either to himself or to his firm. To exempt, by one stroke of the pen, the whole of the railway employees from service upon a jury is rather a serious matter, and I feel dubious about supporting the Bill unless I have some assurance from the Minister that this course is essential. If difficulties have been experienced, I should think that some remedy less drastic than that outlined in the Bill could be suggested. I understand that the Jury Act makes provision for exemption in some cases where it can be shown that serious inconvenience will result from the attendance of a person summoned to act as a juror. </para>

                        <para>. -  I may be displaying my ignorance, but I have to confess that I was not aware that the New South Wales Jury Act exempted railway employees from service, but if there is any such exemption I can only say from long experience of the work of summoning juries that there is absolutely no occasion for such exemption, because I have never known of any man with a genuine excuse being mulct in a fine or subjected to any inconvenience for not attending. At most jury sittings applications are received beforehand from jurors who have been summoned, asking to be excused. There is no occasion at all for a man to attend in order to be granted an exemption from service, if his excuse is reasonable, and in the case of a railway employee his excuse would be so reasonable in many circumstances that no Judge would dream of refusing to accept it, especially if the man belonged to the running staff. There appears to be no urgency for the exemption of this class of employees. I speak from practice. The acceptance of the Bill will withdraw an eminently respectable body of men from duty as jurymen in trials, and unless the Minister can give a very much more definite reason why the Bill should be passed, I shall not vote for it. </para>

                        <para>. -  It seems to me that the only reason for objecting to the measure is that advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline> In certain centres the course of justice might, possibly, suffer through the exemption of a large section of the population, as in the case of a railway town, from service on juries. I have in mind one particular town through which I pass frequently. If all the railway employees were exempted, it would be almost impossible to empanel a jury there. Owing to the fact that the trains have to climb to a very high altitude at that point, the little township at the foot of the range is composed largely of railway employees who have various duties to perform in working trains over the range. </para>

                            <para>-  No. But&#39; there are other places at which inconvenience might be caused. For instance, at Port Augusta, an important railway centre, mentioned this afternoon by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> a jury might be required. Apart from the points submitted, I can see a great advantage from a safety point of view in exempting railway employees from&#39; serving on juries. It is quite conceivable that when a man is called in to do another person&#39;s job, with which he may not be fully conversant, certain elements of danger would be present, owing to the work not being satisfactorily performed. If drivers, guards, stationmasters, and signalmen were taken from their duties the Department might be seriously inconvenienced, and although the introduction of this measure may be somewhat belated, there is no reason why it should not have our support. </para>

If the officers of the Commonwealth Public Service are exempt, surely there can be no reason why the officers of the Commonwealth Railway Department should not also be exempt. This matter has not been brought forward in a haphazard manner and submitted to Parliament, simply because a draftsman may have said, &#34; Here is an opportunity to draft a Bill.&#34; The Commonwealth Railways Commissioner has represented that such exemption is necessary, as at Port Augusta, for instance, officers have been called up for service to the inconvenience, and possibly to the danger, of the Department and the travelling public. The officers of both Government and private railways in Western Australia are exempt from serving on juries. In South Australia, certain classes are exempt; but if we were to exempt those mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poll</inline> there would be a very small number left. </para>

The principal Act provided for no sanction or penalty to cover this omission; but the Bill provides that, failing compliance with the conditions of the recognisance, the justice of the peace may declare the recognisance forfeited, and the payment of any sum due shall thereunder be recoverable as a fine. The Department of the Attorney-General in Sydney has had several cases where it has been unable in cases of default to recover recognisance under the Act, particulars of which I shall be pleased to submit to any honorable senator. Clause 3 of the Bill follows very much on the lines of similar Bills we have been dealing with, and provides for the application of the principal Act, as amended by this Bill, to New Guinea and the Mandated Territories. The non-application of the Act to the Mandated Territories is causing inconvenience. I do not know if any honorable senators desire to give the measure closer consideration; but if they should, I have no objection to agreeing to an adjournment of the debate. On the other hand, if they are satisfied with its provisions I am quite prepared to go on. </para>

                        <para>. -  Perhaps it is like rushing in where angels fear to tread for me to question this clause, but I find that it proposes to vest in a justice of the peace the extreme power of forfeiture of recognisances. Whether this is right or not I do not know, but so far as some justices of the peace are concerned, I think it may be admitted that it would be  as  well to vest this power in at least two of them. If a serious step is to be taken it is better that it should be with the approval of two rather than of one, in view of the old saying that two heads are better than one. </para>

                <para class="block">I submit the motion in these circumstances : As honorable senators are aware, the Government business first on the notice-paper to-day was the resumption of the debate on the motion for the printing of the Budget-papers. But when it was called on. honorable senators apparently were not desirous of continuing the debate to-day. I submit my motion on the assumption that they will not be desirous of continuing it to-morrow. If they do wish to continue that debate tomorrow, when it would be the only business which the Government have ready for consideration, I am prepared, with the sanction of the Senate, to withdraw my motion. If, however, honorable senators require a. little longer time to consider the Budget-papers before discussing them, there is no reason why the Senate should not adjourn until Wednesday week. If honorable senators are not ready to continue the discussion of the Budget-papers it would be useless for us to meet here to-morrow. </para>

                    <para>. - I am always ready for a spell, I candidly admit, because I want one. According to some authorities in this city we should never get a spell. If we happened to be members of a Legislative Council we might take a spell and there would be no talk about it, but being members of the Senate there will be something said, as usual, if this motion is agreed to. The Minister has proposed an adjournment for a week, because there is no business before us. We have passed some leaflet legislation which, no doubt, has been very necessary; but the Government, in my opinion, should have seized the opportunity to use this Chamber as one in which a number of the measures referred to in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech might be initiated. If those measures had been in such a state of preparation as to be placed before the Senate in sequence, we should not be brought to a stand-still. </para>

                <para class="block">It is the duty of the Government to have ready for our consideration measures which might be originated and carried through in the Senate. So far for the position of the Government, but how do honorable Senators stand ? . Those of us who come from distant States, if given a week&#39;s holiday, cannot get to their homes, as representatives of Victoria  may  do, who can jump on a train and reach their destination the same evening. The Commonwealth covers a vast area, and is by no means confined to Victoria. Some people consider that that is a good job, too. This will not save us from the criticism of those organs that pose as our guides, philosophers, censors, and friends, and would tell us what to think, what to say and do. We shall be told by these good people that we are doing wrong in adjourning, but I say that the Minister is doing wrong in not giving representatives of distant States a chance to go to their homes, gust as the editors of these journals can go to their homes every night. Their troubles about public duty! What is my position ? When I leave here I roll my bones over the stones&#34; for five days before I can reach my home. That is a part of my duty as a legislator in this country, but what sympathy do I get from those editors? When my time comes it will be said of me, as it has been said of many another public man, &#34; He was a good fellow, but a fool to himself.&#34; That is the average verdict on public men in this country, from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes downwards. If we adjourn for only a week it will take me the whole of that week to get to my home. Coming from the West, I suppose I should not have a home or a business. No one knows anything about the dividends returned by the newspapers, because they are so large that the proprietors are ashamed to tell the public what they really are, but it would be an easy matter to tell the public what my dividends are, and easier still to tell them my losses. I wish that some of these editors would take on my farm and do some useful work for the first time in their lives. That is the way to talk to them. They are not used to being talked to in that fashion, but it should do them a world of good. The Government could well afford to give us a fortnight&#39;s leave, so that some of us may get home and, playing &#34; tig &#34; on the wife and family, say, &#34; I saw you,&#34; and then come back again. Our little grey homes are in the West, but according to the critics of this Parliament we should not have any homes or businesses at all. That is virtually what they say. If there is any humanity in the make-up of Ministers, and they have any compassion for honorable senators coming from distant States, who are not continuously employed here, as Ministers or as public Commissioners are, they might give them an opportunity to reach their homes, and they can only do so by an extended adjournment. The Leader of the Senate has said that Supply will not be required until the 14th of next month. He asks that the Senate should . adjourn until the 6th. If we add seven days to that we can assemble here again on the day preceding, that on. which Supply will be necessary. We have complained in the past that we have been given only one day in which to consider a Supply Bill, and what I suggest would not alter our practice in that regard. I suggest that the Government might give some consideration to poor wayfarers, who happen to have homes in distant States, and propose an adjournment for a fortnight, that we may go back to what, after all, are the only places in this country, or in the world, that have any peculiar attraction for us, namely, our homes. I ask the Minister to reconsider his motion and propose the adjournment of the Senate for a fortnight, in view of the fact that such an adjournment would still give us the usual time for the consideration of Supply. </para>

I assume that the gentlemen who have left the Defence Department are anxious to get their money. Most people I know who have any money coming to them are rather anxious to get hold of it. I submit that we should not be doing our duty, and that it would not look well in the eyes of the country, if we were on holiday whilst these men outside were waiting for their money.
