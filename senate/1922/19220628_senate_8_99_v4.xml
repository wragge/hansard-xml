War exigencies have hitherto made it impracticable to obtain adequate supplies of necessary material for telegraphic and telephonic services. My Ministers have now made special arrangements whereby a largely increased amount of loan money will be made available, so that a continuous and progressive policy may be undertaken extending over a period of years. In this way it will be possible&#39; to overtake arrears and meet the growing needs of the Commonwealth. In order to secure the economical expenditure of this money and the most modern system in equipment, a special expert Advisory Board will be constituted. </para>

Four contracts have been let for the conveyance of passengers, mails, and parcels. The service between Geraldton and - Derby has now been in continuous and successful operation for five months, thus bringing one of the most remote parts of Australia into close touch with the world. Aeroplanes have been ordered for the other services&#39;, and construction works are well advanced in connexion with the aerodromes on the routes to be traversed.

My Ministers, realizing that unless all parties concerned in the production and preparation of meat for export co-operated, it would be impossible to give effective aid to the cattle industry, took steps to approach the shipping companies, the proprietors of the meat works, and the employees. These efforts were entirely successful. Under the arrangements entered into, all parties agreed to reduced charges, and these reductions, together with the assistance promised -by the Government, have led to the resumption of export, and have materially assisted the grazing industry to recover from a desperate position. A Bill will be submitted for your approval to sanction the action taken.

                    <para>That this Senate expresses its profound regret at the death of the late Honorable Prank Gwynne Tudor, who, from the commencement of the Commonwealth, represented the Division of Yarra for twenty-one years. This Senate also places on record its high appreciation of the sterling public service rendered by the deceased member to the people of the Commonwealth, and extends to his widow and family its sincere sympathy in their bereavement. </para>

                <para class="block">The Senate has already been reminded of the fact that death has been busy in the ranks of Federal parliamentarians since we last met here. I feel certain that, although that reference was timely, it was not needed to remind honorable senators of those whose loss we now mourn. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor</inline> had had a long, distinguished, and honorable public career. He entered the National Parliament on its formation in 1901, and it is evidence of the esteem of those who sent him here that they retained his services until his decease. During that long period of very assiduous and faithful public service he attained Ministerial rank, and held office in four Ministries. Even those most sharply separated from him in political views &#39;felt that on all occasions and under all circumstances he administered the Departments under his control according to the highest traditions.  His  worth to the country and to his party was recognised further by his receiving the high and honorable position of leader of his party, which he held up to the time of his death. Regarding his public career I need hardly add more than that, if there was ever a man of whom we might say that he sought to serve his country from a high sense of duty as that duty presented itself to him, it was the gentleman whose loss we now mourn. He was the esteemed friend of us all..  His  kindly, lovable disposition, his generosity towards his fellows - even in the moments of warm debate - were very marked. There was that about his personality that attracted, and, indeed, compelled, esteem and respect. That characteristic <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor</inline> possessed to the fullest extent. We can only regret that his services, which were very constant and very marked, are no longer available&#39; to this Parliament and to this country. Perhaps I may make a passing reference to those who will necessarily mourn his loss more than we do. In close proximity to the tragedy that has robbed them of a husband, and father, our expression of sympathy may be a poor thing,&#39; but in all sincerity we offer it to the relatives of the deceased. No more appropriate epitaph could be written over his grave than that on all occasions his one thought was to do his duty. </para>

                    <para class="block">The late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Adamson</inline> was, as far as his membership of this Parliament was concerned, quite a young man. He only joined our ranks at the election of 1920, and therefore was, comparatively speaking, new amongst us. But he had a very creditable period of public service in the State which he represented. For fifteen years he was, in one capacity or another, serving the people of his State, and for some portion of that time in a Ministerial capacity. Whatever views may be held regarding the incident to which I am about to refer - I have in mind his resignation of Ministerial office owing to a difference of opinion with his colleagues - ho was returned to represent the people of the great northern State in this Parliament. The members of this Chamber had then an opportunity of direct acquaintance with him. He had always been an active figure in the public life of his State. I may refer particularly to his work in connexion with the war. He was a thorough Britisher in the sense of ever striving to do that for which the Empire stands.  His  activities&#39; in connexion with our soldiers, which were brought particularly under my notice because of my association with theRepatriation Department, deserved the highest praise. He was at all times available to do what he could to alleviate the conditions in which our returned men necessarily found themselves. &#34;Whilst a member of this Chamber his deep earnestness and great concern in the discharge of what he thought to be his duty, in spite of failing health, must have impressed us all. I venture to say that, had it not been for his conscientious desire, and his determination to stand to the post to which he had been called, possibly he would have prolonged his days somewhat. During his term here we learned to respect and admire the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator John</inline> Adamson for his blunt honesty and sincerity of purpose. Therefore, I submit the motion with the full confidence that all senators will earnestly join in extending to his widow and family that sympathy which we undoubtedly feel.  </para>

Millen)</inline> in express ing the regret we all feel at the death of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator John</inline> Adamson and our sympathy with his relatives. The late senator did not enjoy a prolonged period amongst us., but we all know that he had won for himself a favorable name and an honorable position in the State of Queensland. The personality of the man was unmistakable. My slight acquaintance with him only confirmed me in the high opinion I had formed of him from his reputation in Queensland. It is with most sincere regret that I now join with the Leader of the Senate in mourning the loss of one of the most distinguished members ever sent by the people of Queensland to this Chamber. </para>

                            <para>. - As an old friend and colleague of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Adamson,</inline> I should like to indorse the remarks made by the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> and the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gardiner).</inline> I knew him for a long time before he entered politics. He left the ministry of the Church to take an active part in the public affairs of his State, and I may add that his sympathies were always with the suffering and the oppressed. In everything he did he sought to uplift those whom we may call the &#34; working classes &#34; of this country.  His  political career was at times very stormy and his fortunes changeable. The Minister forRepatriation has referred to one incident in connexion with the late war, in which the late honorable senator took such an active part. He resigned his position in the Queensland Ministry owing, as the Leader of the Senate has remarked, to a difference of opinion with his colleagues. He came out of the Ministry and stood for what he considered to be the true ideal of a Democracy, namely, that every Democrat should serve his country during such a crisis. I may be excused if I refer to something that occurred at a public meeting which I attended with the late honorable senator during the conscription campaign in Queensland, but I shall not mention the name of the town, because the incident does not redound to its credit. As we left the meeting the mob became so unruly that the late honorable senator was felled by a stone which struck him on the head, and we were obliged to take shelter in a railway carriage under police protection. </para>

I join in the motion and wish to convey to his widow and family my deepest sympathy in their bereavement. </para>

Chamber. I knew the late senator for a . number of years, and in circumstances quite different from those in which he appeared to other honorable senators. My acquaintance with him did not, perhaps, extend over such a long period as was indicated by the honorable senator who preceded me, but I saw a good deal of him for many years before he entered this Parliament, and I formed the very highest opinion of him as a man of his word and as one who held, perhaps, too strongly, in view of the uncertainty of human affairs, to his political -beliefs. Probably this trait in his character . hastened his end, because we all know that in the discussion of political questions we sometimes speak too heatedly and expend a great deal of vital force, which in later life cannot readily be made up, and whose absence leads to catastrophe. On certain occasions, long before the war threw its dread shadows over the world, I was the recipient of little homilies from the late senator, - with whom I was on terms of friendship. I knew him as a highly cultured and widely read man, who had &#39; delved very deeply into those sources of - knowledge which are available to every one of a literary bent. I would like to say very much more ; but as this is an occasion when brevity is observed, I will merely add my expressions of appreciation of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Adamson&#39;s</inline> personality and join with others in conveying my deep sympathy to his widow and family.. </para>
