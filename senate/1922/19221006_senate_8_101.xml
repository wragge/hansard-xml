        <para class="block">As I am on my feet, I may give an explanation of some words in sub-clause 1 of this clause which are a little obscure. In the case of an employee over the age of thirty years the following is an example of the method of calculating the Commonwealth contribution to the fund :  - An employee, whose age is fifty years next birthday, contributes for four units at the rate for age thirty years. Twice the rate for age fifty years - four units - would be 50s. 8d. ; contribution for four units at age thirty, 8s. 5d.; difference 42s. 3d. The ratio is 42s. 3d. divided by 50s. 8d, which gives 507 over 608 as the fraction of pension payment to the fund, which in this case is practically five-sixths. </para>

          <para>. - I intended to invite attention to this matter also. As honorable senators are no doubt aware, a recent decision of the High Court in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Le Leu</inline> versus <inline font-style="italic">The Commonwealth</inline> a South Australian case - was that the provision of the Public Service Act fixing sixty-five years as the age for compulsory retirement is inapplicable to officers transferred from the South Australian Service to the Commonwealth Service, because the Public Service Acts of that State, I think of 1881 and 1884, make no provision for retiring officers of the South Australian Public Service at the age of sixty-five, or, indeed, at any. age. As a matter of fact, members of that Service, so long as they are efficient, in good health, and ready to do so, may continue in the service of the State. On the transfer of South Australian public servants to the Commonwealth Service by the operation of the provisions of the Constitution, they retained that right. This Parliament legislated, fixing sixty-five years as the age for compulsory retirement, but it was held that the right which South Australian officers carried over under the Constitution enabled them to remain in the service of the Commonwealth after they had attained the age of sixty-five years. I take it that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foil&#39;s</inline> question is directed to that matter, and he desires to know whether officers who are now in a position to claim this transferred right will, in common with all others, when the superannua- tion scheme is established, be required to retire at the age of sixty-five years. </para>

          <para>. -  There are two questions involved. The first is whether it is the intention of the Government, when the Superannuation Act is in operation, to insist in all cases on retirement at the age of sixty-five years. I am not prepared to answer that question in the affirmative. There may be cases where, in the interests of the Commonwealth, and not of the employee, it may be necessary to retain the services of a public servant after he has reached that age. </para>

            <para>- In such a case, the Government would retain the services of the officer after he had reached the age for compulsory retirement under the Public Service Act. It is intended, of course, in the general run of cases, that officers shall be retired when they reach the age of sixty-five years. Whether a public servant is retained beyond the age of sixtyfive years, because of provisions in a State Act, and the constitutional application of such an Act, or by the action of the Commonwealth Government, does not affect the question. The answer  in  both cases is the same. He will not be required to continue his contributions after the age of sixty-five years, nor will the Commonwealth pay in any contributions after that age, and his pension will commence, not as from sixty-five years of age, but as from the time when he retires from the Service. </para>

          <para>. -  I do not think that the . statement by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> quite answers the questions I put. Doubtless the Government may exercise its right to retire  a  man compulsorily at  or  before sixty-five years of age. The High Court has held, in the case of transferred officers from South Australia, that the section of the Commonwealth Public Service Act which makes it obligatory for  a  public servant to retire at sixty-five years has no application to them. They are entitled to remain in the Service under the conditions applicable to officers  in  the Service of the South Australian Government under the Acts of 1881 and 1884. They had that right before Federation, and when they came over to the </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Commonwealth as transferred officers, they carried their rights with them. Does the superannuation scheme involve, in its application, a uniform retiring age of sixtyfive years for all officers, or will the Commonwealth be in the position that it is in at present? At present transferred officers from South Australia, so long as they are efficient, able, and willing, may remain in the Service after reaching sixtyfive years of age. Will an officer, if this Bill is passed, be able to refuse to retire at sixty-five years? Will the question of retirement rest with the Commonwealth or with the officer? </para>

          <para>. -  I do not think that any purpose would be served by pursuing this discussion, because the Bill does not affect the question one way or the other. The effect of the Bill is that if a servant should, under the judgment referred to, or for any other cause, continue in the Service beyond the age of sixty-five years, he would not make any further contributions, and his pension would commence from the date of his retirement. </para>

          <para>. - I realize that the reply given by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> is practically the only one he can give until the main Public Service Bill has been amended to make retirement at sixty-five years of age compulsory for all officers. We have had the spectacle, in the State which I assist to represent, of officers being retired who have rendered long and faithful service. In view of the fact that we are providing for  a  superannuation scheme, and that, generally speaking, progress in the Publio Service is slow, I think it is fair that men who reach the age of sixty-five should be called upon to retire so as to increase the opportunity for younger men to advance. We know there have been many cases in which representations have been made by Heads of Departments, sometimes in the interest of the Department, and sometimes in the interests of the officers concerned, to retain men in the Service beyond the usual age for retirement. I have nothing to say against that in present conditions, but seeing that officers who have rendered long and faithful service, will, now be rewarded with  a  liberal pension, retirement at sixty-five years of age should be compulsory, except in very exceptional circumstances. I do not want  to see old and faithful servantsthrown upon the world as they have been by the Labour Government of Queensland. </para>

          <para>. - This clause makes a distinction between &#34;retrenchment&#34; and &#34;discharge.&#34; In the case of retrenchment, the officer affected would be entitled to a pension, but in the case of discharge the pension would be on the basis of an &#34; actuarial equivalent.&#34; The point is affected also by the following clause, the two clauses being practically inter-related. Three different terms are used - &#34;retrenchment,&#34; &#34; discharge,&#34; and &#34; dismissal.&#34; Why should there be a differentiation ? It is stated that acontributor shall be deemed to be &#34; retrenched &#34; if he has been in the Service &#34; not less than ten years,&#34; and it &#39;also says that he shall be deemed to be &#34; discharged &#34; if he has been in the Service &#34; for less than ten years.&#34; It is a matter of time, but it might make a very great difference to the contributor. There might be a very small margin of difference between two men, one of whom would be subject to &#34; actuarial equivalent,&#34; while the other would not. There might be a great deal of difference between the effect of this line of demarcation upon different individuals. &#91; do not like the look of the clause, because I can see cases of hardship resulting from it looming up ahead. </para>

          <para>. - Whether we think there should or should not be differentiation between those public servants who are &#34;retrenched&#34; and those who are &#34;discharged,&#34; it is obvious that we cannot deal with the matter on this clause, which is in the nature of a definition clause. I suggest that we postpone this discussion until we reach the clause which makes the differentiation. The only question which arises is the provision relating to ten years. If honorable senators will look through, not only this Bill, but the various Superannuation Acts, they will find that the period of ten years is generally employed. Persons who have served for a longer period than ten years are placed in a better position than those who have served for a shorter period. The object is to give some recognition to length of service. That is the only explanation I can supply of why the period should be ten, instead of eleven or twelve, years. Ten years is deemed to. represent a fair length of service, but it is necessarily an arbitrary period. </para>

          <para>. - My reason for calling attention to this matter is that I happen to know men in the Public Service who are not classified, and are regarded as temporary hands. They are not employees in the sense in which the Bill uses that word, but in their case a distinction is made which is almost a reflection on the individuals concerned. It occurred to me that the clause under discussion might operate detrimentally to such persons. I know it has been to the disadvantage of these public servants that they have been called employees when they are really unclassified officers. The line of demarcation proposed in the clause is exactly similar. </para>

            <para>- That is so. I know of many men who have been doing permanent work for a number of years, but who were employed only in a temporary capacity. If they have qualified for appointment as permanent employees1, I think that, for the purposes of this Bill, their appointments should date from their entrance into the Service in a temporary capacity. This question cropped up when I was a member of tha State Railway Department in Queensland. When men who had served for a considerable period during the war as temporary employees were afterwards appointed to the permanent staff, their appointments dated as from the date of their entry into the Department; that is to say, their .service was regarded as continuous for Retirement and leave purposes. In many cases temporary employees in the Commonwealth! are actually employed: on permanent work. If a man has, say, three years&#39; temporary service, before: being appointed to the permanent staff, his period of employment iri a temporary capacity, for the purposes of this Bill, will not be taken into account. I contend that if a man so employed passes the necessary examination, and becomes a permanent employee, his service should commence from the actual date of his first employment, otherwise a great deal of injustice will be done to a large number of men, very many of whom are returned soldiers. </para>

            <para>- If not, then I think we shall be creating a difficulty and complicating the measure immensely if we attempt to include the service of a temporary employee in the term of service to be calculated in respect of him as an employee and a contributor. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> has quoted the case of men who may have been three years employed in a temporary capacity before they became permanent employees. It might so happen that instead of being only three years in temporary employment, an employee had been upwards of ten years in a temporary capacity.  I  observed the case the other day of a witness in one of our Courts stating, in reply to a question as to the nature of his employment, that he was a &#34; temporary caretaker &#34; or &#34; temporary doorkeeper,&#34; and when he was asked how long he had been in that position he replied, &#34; Thirty-two years.&#34; Suppose an officer in the Public Service had been in temporary employment for a considerable number of years - it is conceivable that he may. have been employed in that capacity for ten years - the introduction in a measure of this nature of any provision to regard his temporary employment as service for the purpose qf this Bill would necessarily complicate the whole scheme. </para>

          <para>. -  There is continual pressure on Parliament to water down the provisions by which we attempt to insure an efficient Public Service, and I know of nothing more dangerous than this request to recognise temporary employment as permanent service, because, if acceded to, it will gradually do away altogether with the proper method of entering the Service. It opens the door to political patronage, which is the shortest cut. If Parliament agreed to the course suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> it would only be the beginning, not the end, of our troubles. </para>

            <para>- No; but it will lead to that. If we break down the line of demarcation between temporary and permanent employment, we at once vitiate the principle upon which the Service is based. There is, too, a tendency, I am afraid, to speak of temporary employment as if it represents an injustice upon those who are given temporary work in the Public Service, whereas it is the one thing that so many people are asking for. They make one&#39;s life a misery with their requests to get into the Public. Service, and immediately they secure employment very many of them turn round and suggest that some hardship or injustice is being inflicted upon them. I remember a case in point that amply bears out what I am saying. On one occasion, some few years ago, a man pestered me to get him some work, on the plea that he and his wife and children were in extreme need. He told me that if he could only get twelve months&#39; employment he would be a happy man. I went out of my way - I was not then a Minister - and managed to get him a temporary job. </para>

            <para>- Yes, it was. But for that policy, many of these men would have been appointed permanently, and our soldiers, upon their return from the war, would have found their positions filled. This principle of not making permanent appointments during the war was strongly pressed on behalf of the returning soldiers themselves, and I suggest that what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> is proposing will only be the thin end of the wedge. If, for the purpose of this Bill, we regard temporary service as permanent, many other requests of a like nature, and which could not logically be refused, would be made. </para>

          <para>. -  I have in mind cases in which, through no fault of the individual con cerned, permanent appointments were not made to the Service, because it was not the policy of the Government during the war to do so. If appointments had been made then, the ten years&#39; period of service would have been reached by many of these men three or four years earlier, and, therefore, they would have been entitled to the privileges of this measure. I know  of hundreds of cases in South Australia of officers who were doing permanent work, and who were transferred with their offices to the Commonwealth. I mentioned this matter when speaking on the Public Service Bill, and I mention it again because of its effect upon these men in connexion with the superannuation scheme. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> has pointed out, very many returned soldiers are affected. And suppose it is the thin end of the wedge, is that any reason why a manifest injustice should be done to a section of employees in the Public Service? </para>

That was quite the correct thing to do, and that course was heartily indorsed by the whole of the people. I merely pointed out that &#60; had there not been a war many of these men would have become permanent employees, and would have had a recognised status in the Public Service. I still contend that their period of service should date from the date of their first appointment. </para>

          <para>. -  It seems to me that the contributor who is retired through sickness due to his own fault is to be in a better position than the unfortunate man who is discharged for a cause for which he was in no sense responsible. I thought at first that this disability might have to do with the length of service, but I notice that: under this clause a contributor who has been at f ault has only to be in the Service for seven years to enable him to retire and receive the pension, whereas a retrenched man may be in the Service for nine years and  364  days, and still be in the position that he only gets back the amount of the actual contributions made by him. I would like sub-clause (b) made quite clear as to whether &#34;the actuarial equivalent of the contributions made&#34; means that in this case the  Commonwealth  does not contribute anything towards that actuarial equivalent. </para>

In the case of the man who is discharged, we give him hia money back. Where the man becomes invalided through his own fault, he gets the actuarial equivalent of what has been paid in. The contributor who receives his money back can put it into some annuity society that will give him the actuarial equivalent. </para>

A person retrenched will have the contributions returned to him, but a person who, perhaps, has to leave the Service in consequence of wilful neglect or misbehaviour causing invalidity, has an advantage over the man <inline font-style="italic">who</inline> is retrenched through no fault of his own. </para>

          <para>. - In some cases the actuarial equivalent may mean that the person is getting his money back, or a pension on what he has contributed alone, whereas in another case it may mean, plus the contribution of the Government, and as the&#62; same term is used in both instances, it is somewhat confusing. In the case of a, public servant who is retrenched, I should imagine that the actuarial equivalent would be plus the amount contributed by the Government. In the case of a person who has a pension on retirement necessitated by his own actions, I understand that he will be paid only the actuarial equivalent of his subscriptions. </para>

Where the Government contribution is also included, it is distinctly stated in the Bill.; and if honorable senators will refer to the concluding paragraph of clause  29 they will see the position clearly set out. In this instance it is a return of the public servant&#39;s contribution. </para>

          <para>- (Tasmania) &#163;12.10&#93;. - I desire to direct the attention of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> to the fact that this clause is limited in its application to the widow of a male contributor. I have no doubt that the Minister and honorable senators are aware that there are many cases in which officers in the Service are not married, but who have persons dependent upon them quite as much as would be a wife. A male contributor to the fund may be the mainstay of the household, which might consist of a mother, sisters, and younger brothers. When we were discussing an earlier clause, I read what I considered an interesting letter from a returned soldier, who placed his budget before me, and I was able to bring before the Committee this man&#39;s responsibilities, particularly in the matter of paying for a War Service Home and meeting the premiums on a life assurance policy. This communication is written in a very temperate and calm way. </para>

          <para>Another desirable amendment without which the Bill seems to be incomplete, is in the direction of pensions to dependants other than wife and children. From the information to hand, the parent or parents who are dependent upon a public servant wholly or in part, are not entitled to a pension in the event of the death of that public servant. Take  as an example my own case. If I am a contributor to this fund, and my life policy is cancelled, my mother would get absolutely nothing in the way of a pension, and there are in the Launceston office several similar cases. This seems to me a very undesirable feature of the proposed Act. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>The writer of the letter from which I have quoted, and which I mentioned yesterday is the sole support of his mother ; in fact, of the whole household, and all expenses were met by him out of his salary, which is &#163;168 per annum, but which is brought up to &#163;210 per annum- by adding the basic wage and other allowances. After he pays for the maintenance of the household, meets his payments for a War Service Home, discharges his obligations in the way of insurance and life assurance, he has approximately &#163;21 left per annum for clothing and meeting sundry and emergency expenditure. It seems to me that there should be some provision in the Bill to enable a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> dependant of  a single man to derive the benefits to be paid to a widow of a male contributor. There are cases where officers in the Service have palpably remained single because they are the sole support of a widowed mother, and in such instances the Government should have power whereby when satisfied .with the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of a dependant, to pay to the mother what would in the case of a married man go to the widow. The Minister has had a good deal of experience in connexion with similar cases in relation to War Service Homes administration, and he possibly encountered a number where the Department was imposed upon. In this case, however, the Government would - be- dealing with officers under their immediate observation, and if there was a provision in this measure which would enable an officer to acquire the benefit for his widowed mother, it would meet many deserving cases. Ho would, of course, have to notify the Department long before the benefit would accrue to . the dependant, and the Department- would have every opportunity of checking the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of the claim. The Government should give some consideration to the matter before the Bill leaves this Chamber. In the case of military service, a man who went abroad made his allotment, and in a great number of instances he was not known to any one in the Defence Department until the time of his - enlistment. Here we are dealing with officers of the Public Service who will be under daily and hourly observation. If an officer can establish the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of his claim that his mother is dependent&#39; upon him, I think we should provide that in the event of his death, she should be given the pension which would be given to his widow if he had been married. I am not dealing with an. isolated case. I suppose  that .every member of the Committee knows some public servants who are the absolute support of widowed mothers, and perhaps of sisters or other members of the family to which they belong. The Government could protect themselves in the case of these permanent officers of the Public Service, in a way which would have been impossible in the case of members of the Australian Imperial Force. </para>

          <para>. -  Such cases as the honorable senator has referred to appeal to the sympathy of us all. There can be no doubt that if the Committee decided that this Bill should cover such cases, regulations could be drafted which would fully protect the Department against imposition. There would be no difficulty about that. But I remind honorable senators that to do so would immensely widen the scope- of the Bill, and must involve increased contributions. The Bill is drafted to cover certain definite cases, and every extension of its scope must increase the contributions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has himself expressed doubt as to whether the officer to whom he specially referred would be able to pay even the contribution for which he will be liable under the Bill as it stands, and, if the rate of contribution is to be increased, there must be many who will have great difficulty in meeting it. It should not be forgotten that the man who is the support of a widowed mother derived considerable benefits under the scheme. He is insured superannuation benefit on his retirement, and invalidity pension at any time should he become an invalid. Ho may marry, and in that event he is insured a pension, should he die, for his widow and children. So that, for the modest contribution he is called upon to make under the Bill, he is given substantial benefits. I have looked through a great many superannuation schemes, and I know of none that covers such a claim as tha.t put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating.</inline> They are all limited to the class of cases dealt with by this Bill. I suggest to the Committee that it would be unwise to make provision in this Bill for such cases as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has referred to, because, to do so, must increase the rates of contribution, and this would mean that the Bill would have to be withdrawn temporarily, in order that an actuarial investigation might be made to estimate the increase of contribution that would be necessary. We should have to find out the number of single males in the Public Service, and then, in some way, the number pf them who were supporting their mothers. If such a provision were inserted it would mean that the Bill could not be passed this session. The matter is one which can be looked into, and I have  110  objection to it being considered fully, but it is impossible to deal with it in this Bill if the measure is to be passed this session. The case submitted by Senators Keating, Fairbairn, and other honorable senators has merits, but I ask that it should not be pressed at this juncture. </para>

          <para>. -  I am going to suggest that this clause should be left out. The position in the case of an unmarried male contributor who dies in the Service is that his contributions remain in the fund. I do not see why we should burden the fund with the contribution in the case of an unmarried female contributor for the benefit of her personal representatives or such persons as the Board may determine, if she should die in the Service. It appears to me that the clause draws an unnecessary distinction between the unmarried man who dies before retirement from the Service and the unmarried female who dies before retirement. It may be regarded as ungallant to speak in this way, but the Bill has been drawn up to give simple justice to the contributors, and I do not see why one sex should bo favoured more than another. I can see no reason for the discrimination. The Minister may be able to give some instances in support of this clause, but failing a satisfactory reason for it, I shall vote against it. </para>

He is in any event given a right to secure a pension for his widow and children should he marry. That is not a right which can be enjoyed by the female employee. We have to take into consideration the circumstances which cause the female employee to be working in the Public Service for her living.

I would like the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> to explain exactly what it means. It seems to me to mean that the payments, which are made by way of pension out of the Superannuation Fund after it is established, shall be repaid to the Superannuation Fund out of the Consolidated Revenue. The clause is involved, and perhaps my question is also. Should not the expression, &#34; the payments from&#39; that fund,&#34; be limited to so much of such payments as represent the Commonwealth&#39;s share thereof? Will there not be instances of payment of pension out of Consolidated  Revenue prior to the establishment of the Superannuation Fund, and for which the Treasurer will have to be recouped as to that portion of such payments as represent the contributor&#39;s share thereof? </para>

          <para>.- When this Bill is assented to,, there will be no Superannuation Fund in existence, but certain payments will be due to persons who have retired. The whole of those payments will come out of the Government&#39;s, and not the employees&#39;, contributions. Therefore, there is no necessity for the payments to be made out of the Superannuation Fund, and that fund to be afterwards recouped from the Consolidated Revenue. The payments might just as well be made in the first place from the Consolidated Revenue. That will be done. On the Act becoming operative, steps will be taken to establish the Superannuation Fund, but there will be a period during which there will be very little in the fund. During that period, the payments  will have to be made from the Consolidated Revenue. There will be some employees who will retire almost as soon as the Bill becomes law, and this clause has been drafted by the Treasurer to provide for such contingencies. </para>

        <para class="block">Seeing that the section is intended to meet the case of those employees who, on or after the 31st December, 1920, and before the passing of the Act, have been retired or permitted to retire, does the sub-clause mean that if a man is retired . on, say, 31st January, 1921, his pension will be made retrospective to the date of his retirement or to the date of the passing of the Act? Will the. man get no consideration for the period between the 31st January, 1921, and the date of the commencement of the Act? I understood that the object of those who drafted the Bill was to insure that all men who were in the Service on the 31st December, 1920, and who have since retired, should be placed upon the same footing as though we had passed the measure into law at the date of their retirement. </para>

          <para>. - This clause states that where an employee resigns, or is dismissed or discharged, he shall get his contributions back. No two meanings can be attached to the word &#34;resigns,&#34; but &#34;dismissal&#34; is an ugly word, and has a very clear import. If an employee is &#34;dismissed&#34; or &#34; discharged,&#34; it carries the implica- tion that he has done something wrong. Sub-clause 2, however, provides that he may re-enter the Service. Clause 29 deals with employees who elect to retire or are retired. Tn these cases, the Department says, &#34; Please leave our employment,&#34; and the man receives a pension on an actuarial basis. In the other case, the Department says, &#34; Leave the Service, you have not done your duty,&#34; and then we make provision for him to re-enter the Service.

          <para>. - This clause gives me an opportunity to bring under notice a matter that I referred to earlier in the debate on a previous clause. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has raised the question with regard to the refund of the amounts paid in by those who may be dismissed or discharged. There is a very great deal of difference between a dismissed and a discharged officer; but, according to clause 25, if, through a policy of retrenchment, the services of an officer are dispensed with -after he has served, say, nine and a half years, he is regarded as having been discharged from the Service. Under this clause that officer will be placed in exactly the same category &#39;as an officer who has been dismissed through misbehaviour and inattention to duty. Both, so far as the return of their contributions to the Superannuation Fund is concerned, will be treated alike, although in the one case an officer may have lost his employment through a policy of retrenchment and through no fault of his own, while the other man may have been dismissed for misconduct. I think a discharged officer should receive something more than his contributions to the fund. </para>

I want to direct attention to the first paragraph of clause 29, which provides .that any contributor who has attained the age of sixty years and elects, or is called upon, to retire before attaining the maximum age for retirement, shall be entitled to a pension which is the actuarial equivalent of his contributions; and this clause, which has to be interpreted according to its own words, stipulates that where a contributor resigns from the Service, there shall be paid to him the amount of the actual contributions paid by him under the Act, irrespective of the cause of his resignation. We will assume .that an officer resigns ,at the age of sixty years. This clause will cover his case, but if we look at clause 29 we shall find that we have already made provision for the case -of a man who has attained sixty years of age and elects to resign, in which case he would get a pension according to the actuarial equivalent of his contributions.  to the fund.

          <para>. -  I regret that more liberal provision is not being made for the wife or children of a pensioner who deserts her or them. In common fairness a deserted wife of a pensioner should get something more than would be payable in the case of a widow of a pensioner. This, undoubtedly, is a case of manifest hardship, and is one in which something may be done without any undue interference with the basis upon which the Superannuation Fund has been built, because .no actuaries can possibly have any actuarial basis upon which to determine what proportion of men in the Service are likely to become wife-deserters. There1 is adequate provision made in clause 63 in the case of a man who does not desert his wife and children, but who, through mental disorder, is confined in a lunatic asylum; and I suggest that treatment on the same lines should he given the widow or children of a deserting pensioner. Clearly, then, it is infinitely better for the unfortunate wife or children for the pensioner to .become mad than for him to take the law into his own hands and desert the family ; because, in the case of a deserted wife and children, the pension payable to the deserting father, who ought to be the breadwinner of the family, does not go to him at all. It is simply retained in the fund, and a certain proportion only is payable to the wife and children. I urge the Minister to reconsider this clause, which may impose a grave injustice upon the wives or children of some pensioners in the fund. </para>

            <para>- That is so. If the husband leaves her she has her legal remedy. But if he dies, clearly she is in a much worse case. As regards the comparison between a deserted wife and the wife of a man who becomes insane, there is every reason why greater consideration should be shown to the &#39; latter, because she may be called upon to contribute something towards the maintenance of her husband in an asylum. I think that if the honorable senator looks at this clause again he will admit that there is very good reason why it should stand. </para>

          <para>. -  I have already considered that aspect of the matter. I note that clause 43 provides for the retention of an insane male pensioner in a Government hospital. We have hospitals in New South Wales that, are not Government hospitals. Possibly those responsible for the draftsmanship of the Bill took very good care that in the unfortunate case of the lunacy of a contributor he would require to go to a Government. hospital, because the Government would then be recouped to some extent from the fund. I repeat that this clause may work a serious hardship upon the wives of certain contributors to the fund, and it is one which, in common justice, should receive the most careful consideration of the Government. </para>

The children, unfortunately, would be the sufferers. We should not legislate in a way that would operate harshly against innocent persons.

          <para>.- The Australian Soldiers Repatriation Act is excepted, but the War Gratuity Act is not excepted. There are many men who have not received &#39;the entire amount of the gratuity, and they have still a contingent right under that Act. Is there any reason for not excepting that Act also? </para>

        <para class="block">The reason for this and succeeding amendments is thatclause 51 of the Superannuation Bill excludes from the general provisions of the Bill any employee who has a vested or contingent right to a pension, superannuation allowance, or gratuity under an Act or State Act. Clause 57 empowers an employee who has a right to a pension or superannuation allowance under any such Act or State Act to convert to a right under this Bill, while clause 58 gives a similar right to an employee who has  a  right to  a  gratuity under any such Act or State Act. Some of the clauses intervening between 51 and 57 give an employee, who has a right to convert under clause 57 a right to receive or elect for the difference between the value of that right and the right which, but for that right, he would have under this Bill. No similar provision is made in respect of employees who have the right to convert under clause58, that is, those who have a right to a gratuity, though not to a pension or superannuation allowance. Under the New South Wales Act both classes are provided for. In New South Wales, when, in 1895, pensions were abolished, inducements were held out by the Government to contributors to cease contributing to the fund, and, if they did so, provision was made for them to receive a gratuity and a refund of their contributions. The majority of the New South Wales officers ceased contributing, and are, therefore, entitled, not to a pension, but to a gratuity. A correspondent has urged upon the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Milieu)</inline> the desirableness of the Bill being amended to permit employees who have a right to a gratuity, as well as those who have a right to a pension, to receive the additional benefits. The Statistician states that this alteration would not affect the actuarial basis of the scheme. He fur-! ther states that it would not render necessary the revision of the estimate of the cost to the Government, for the reason that the actuaries&#39; estimate was based on the assumption that no employees had any State rights, and that all wouldbe eligible to contribute to the full to the Commonwealth scheme. In view of the statement of the Statistician, and the fact that the suggested alteration is, in my opinion, equitable, and brings the Bill in this respect into line with the State Act, I recommend that the suggested amendments be made. </para>

          <para>.- Clause 51 refers to employees who have a vested or contingent right to a pension, superannuation allowance, or gratuity under any other Act. Several officers who were originally in the employ of the Tasmanian Government were transferred to the CommonwealthService with some consideration in the form of a gratuity, which was not granted under an Act, but by a resolution of the twoHouses of the Tasmanian Parliament. I should like to know what the position of such officers will be under this Bill, because the clause distinctly states, &#34; under any other State Act.&#34; </para>

            <para>- I was not quite clear as to the Minister&#39;s reply, as I was interrupted at that particular moment; but there should be no doubt as to their position. Prior to the establishment of the Commonwealth a resolution was passed by both Houses of the Tasmanian (StateParliament providing for  a  gratuity or retiring allowance to officers leaving the Service on completion of their full term, and the basis of calculation was set out in the resolution passed by the Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council. It has always been acted upon, and after the establishment of the Commonwealth was applied in connexion with officers who did not transfer. The question, I understand, raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline> is whether the claims of these persons, transferred from the State to the Commonwealth Service, will be considered, as their position is totally different from that of any other public servant who came over from a State with corresponding rights secured by Statute. </para>

          <para>.- I understand that these officers were taken overby the Commonwealth after provision had been made by resolution to grant them certain retiring allowances, and that the pensions created by those resolutions were, to be honoured by the Commonwealth. If they retired before this measure came into operation they would, in some instances, have fairly substantial sums due to them, which were supposed to be met by the Commonwealth. They are anxious to know if the consideration given them by the Tasmanian Parliament will be honoured or not, and whether their rights will be preserved to them. </para>

            <para>- No; it was not passed  in  anticipation of Federation. The resolution was passed by both Houses of the State Parliament long before the establishment of the Commonwealth, and before the passing of a State Public Service Act. That measure was passed in  1900,  but it was held up for the Royal assent, which was not given to it until the middle of  1901.  An Act had been promised for many years in Tasmania, but the promise was not completely fulfilled until  1901.  There was, however, provision made in the meantime for retiring officers by the passing of a joint resolution, of both Houses of the State Parliament. Since the Commonwealth has been established, the Federal authorities have never at any time objected&#39; to act upon the resolution referred to, and have paid retiring allowances to transferred Tasmanian officers according to thescale provided in the resolution. The question is whether any advantage would be gained by transferred Tasmanian officers from commuting theirso-called right under this clause, and whether they might do so under the clause as it stands. If they have not the right to do so, we might consider whether it is desirable to insert soma words in this clause to secure to such officers a right corresponding to that which will be enjoyed by officers transferred from the other States where Public Service Acts were in operation before the establishment of the Commonwealth. </para>

I understand that the payment of the retiring allowance to Tasmanian officers to which &#39;they referred might be stopped at any time by either the Commonwealth or the Tasmanian Government. They are payments made merely as an act of grace, and are quite different from allowances paid in accordance with legal rights given by State Acts such as are referred to in this clause.

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> will see that if we stipulated in this clause that the officers referred to should have the power of commutation of their allowances under this provision, the effect would be to make the Commonwealth permanently liable under this Act for the payment of a retiring allowance to which the Government of Tasmania might refuse their assent at any time. The Tasmanian Parliament did not make the payment of these allowances a statutory obligation, and I do not think that we should do  bo  under this measure. The officers have no legal right to the allowance, though the Commonwealth Government have hitherto recognised the justice of claims based on the resolution of the Tasmanian Parliament. </para>

          <para>. - I realize that the position is somewhat complicated. Very 80011 after the establishment of the Commonwealth, the question of the payment of retiring allowance to a Tasmanian transferred officer came up for consideration. The matter was referred to the Attorney-General of tho Commonwealth at the time, and such allowances have been paid from that time. The right, as it is called by the officers concerned, has been recognised, and payments have been made by the Commonwealth Government, as well as by the Tasmanian Government, according to the scale laid down in the joint resolution of both Houses of the Tasmanian Parliament. </para>

            <para>- That is so. The resolution I have referred to was not hurriedly passed by the Tasmanian Parliament. It was passed prior to Federation, and payments were made under it to many officers who had retired from the State Service before Federation. I have explained that the first Public Service Act passed in Tasmania was assented to in the middle of  1901,  and clearly all the officers who were transferred &#34;willy-nilly&#34; with their Departments under the Constitution at the commencement of the Federation had no rights under that first Tasmanian Public Sen-ice Act. Subsequently, Public Service Acts were passed by the State Parliament of Tasmania in  1905, 1913, 1918,  and  1920,  and those Acts have made some provision for superannuation. Since those State Acts came into force, certain officers serving under them have been transferred to the Commonwealth, and they have carried with them the rights conferred by the State Acts. The result is that Tasmanian officers who were transferred at the beginning of Federation are not in the position of advantage which is held by other Tasmanian officers who at the establishment of Federation sat back and took time to consider whether they ought to join the Commonwealth Public Service. Those officers, having subsequently been transferred to the Commonwealth Public Service, will enjoy both rights. It is desirable to promote harmony and good feeling in the Public Service, and we want to know how far these provisions will apply to officers transferred from the Tasmanian Service  who enjoy the right to a retiring allowanceunder the resolution of the Tasmanian Parliament ? We have no desire to add to the complexity of this measure in any way, but it would be desirable if, without straining the construction of these provisions, such officers could be put in an equivalent position with those who did not come over with Departments transferred under the Constitution at the beginning ofFederation, but chose their own time to come over. Transferred officers wish to know whether they will be able to commute what they regard as their right under this Bill. It may or may not be an advantage to them to do so, but they would like to know where they stand. </para>

          <para>.- This matter is one of great importance to Tasmanian officers who came over to the service of the Commonwealth with the transferred Departments at the inauguration of Federation. Some of them have already retired from the Public Service of the Commonwealth, and have been in receipt of their retiring allowances in full. To these, the Commonwealth Government have contributed their proportion. If the public servant was ten years in the service of the Tasmanian Government and twenty years in the. Federal service, two-thirds of hie retiring allowance is borne by the Federal Government, and. one-third by the State Government. It has been recognised that these Tasmanian officers have a moral right to the retiring allowance granted under the resolution which has been referred to. They want &#39;to know what their position will be under this Bill. If they may commute their allowance under this clause, they can decide whether or not they will contribute to the fund. It might pay an officer to refrain from contributing to the Superannuation Fund and rely, instead, upon the retiring allowance granted to him by resolution of both Houses of Parliament. I do not think the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> for one moment would try to get away from the fact that these are not legal rights, or that he would contend that the Commonwealth would be justified at any time in ceasing to carry out the agreement made with the States. </para>

            <para>- The Minister will, no doubt, be able to see quite clearly how exercised in their minds these officers must be. Seeing that they have a substantial sum due to them under the resolution of Parliament, they want to know whether it will be jeopardized in any way. Personally, I think it should not be. The agreement was expected to be honoured for all time. </para>

Senator Keating</inline> referred to officers transferred before a certain date and after a certain date. Tasmania is not alone in that respect. There are instances of that kind in almost every State of the Commonwealth. The Queensland Superannuation Act was passed in 1912. For the Queensland officers who were transferred to the Commonwealth at the inauguration of Federation there was no Superannuation Act, but officers who have come over to the Commonwealth Service from the Queensland State Service since 1912 possess rights under that Act. </para>

            <para>- I cannot do that. I am advised that they have no legal rights. The payments which have hitherto been made are an act of grace. For me to say that these officers have a right would be for me to say what is not true. There is a moral right based upon a resolution - not a Statute- which the Commonwealth and States have honoured up to the present. The question <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> raises is: Have these officers a right of commutation ? I object to using this Bill to give these people a statutory right which the Parliament of their own State did not give them. Any decision in this respect will be subject to the criticism of honorable senators, and the officers concerned will be able to make representations. </para>

          <para>. - I would like some indication from the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> regarding the way in which the members of the Board, more particularly the member to be appointed from the Public Service, will be selected. In my opinion, the method adopted by the Government to secure nominations from among the employees is most important. Will it be left to the Public Service organizations to make the recommendations, or will the whole Service be consulted by means of a ballot, in order that suitable nominations may be re- ,ceived by the Minister? It might be argued, and no doubt will be argued by the Public Service organizations, that they should be permitted, as organizations, to make the necessary recommendations to the Minister. It is, unfortunately, only too true, as I know - and I have had a pretty wide experience of the various Public Service organizations - that, almost without exception, they have fallen into the hands of a certain section of the community. If it is left to them to make the nominations from which the Minister will select the representatives, the nominations will be all of one kind, and there will be little choice left to the Minister. If a ballot of the whole. Service were taken, after nominations had been called for by the Government, we would get the real opinion of the whole Service and a wider and better choice from which the Minister could make his final selection. I would like to see that method adopted. Has the Government made up its mind regarding the method it will adopt ? The method of electing the representative of the Public Service is about the most important question that can be considered, if we have in view the proper working df the superannuation scheme and the necessity for giving satisfaction to the whole of the Service. I urge upon the Minister the necessity for adopting the course I have suggested, and of not leaving the matter entirely to the Public Service organizations as such. </para>

            <para>- Of course, we can alter the clause, but I would not like to say that I could do it in a few minutes. As it stands, the clause appears to be aimed to defeat creditors. I do not say that the Government desire to help pensioners to do that, but that would be the effect of the clause in operation. In other clauses of the Bill there is provision that benefits under the Act shall not be assigned or parted with. I think that if we leave out the words &#34;passed by operation of law&#34; we shall accomplish what I desire to see done, and that is, that in the event of a pensioner attempting to &#34; outrun the constable,&#34; the law may be invoked for the protection of his creditors. In view of the fact .that the community will contribute more than one-half of a very  liberal pension to be paid to public servants on retirement, I am afraid that if we allow it to be thought that pensions are going to be free, and that a man who gets out of the Service on a good pension may carry on as he pleases, we shall be establishing a very bad principle. I undertake to say that no pensions scheme in the community gives any such liberty for a man to evade a natural obligation, and that is to pay his debts. </para>

            <para>- The Minister, I think, mentioned that the climatic risks in the Mandated Territories were greater than in Australia, but what. I want to know is, could not provision be made in the regulations allowing officers to continue their contributions to the Superannuation Fund under the conditions to be prescribed. </para>

            <para>-  If they are transferred they go out of the Service. Some officers in the Mandated Territories are still in our Public Service; they are simply lent. If they definitely enter the service of the Mandated Territories they go out of our Public Service. </para>

          <para>. -  I should like the Minister to explain the third column in the schedule, &#34; subsequent increments, &#163;52 pension to member, &#163;26 to widow.&#34; I notice that the provision of &#163;13 for each child, to the age of 16 is left out. I take it this means that the widow gets a corresponding sum by way of pension up to half the amount of the husband&#39;s pension, and that the amount allowable to each child is statutory. </para>

That will probably be the last full opportunity honorable senators will have of discussing the finances. </para>
