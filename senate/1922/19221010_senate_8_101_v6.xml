I notified the Committee that I would have the phrasing of the amendment considered to see whether it would meet the desire of honorable senators generally. I have had that done,&#39; and, as a result, I think that a better way can be suggested than that proposed by the honorable senator to attain the object desired. We amended the clause by inserting after the word &#34; law&#34; the words &#34;other than by proceedings in the nature of garnishee proceedings.&#34; I now move - </para>
                <para>That the words &#34; other than by proceedings in the nature of garnishee proceedings &#34; be left out. </para>

                <para>Provided that nothing in this section shall prevent the making of an order in the nature of a garnishee order against any instalment of pension payable to a person who has been an employee. </para>
                <para class="block">If these amendments are made they will provide the protection which the Committee obviously desired should be afforded. It has to be borne in mind that there will be a class of pensioners who would not have been employees, and I am sure it was not the desire of the Committee that garnishee orders should not be available against such persons, who would include, for instance, the widow and children of a deceased employee. I take it that the Committee do not desire that the power to issue garnishee orders should operate against them. </para>

                    <para>. - I have no objection to the striking out of the words we inserted in this clause. It may not be considered by some persons right to permit the garnishee orders to be made out against widows and children of deceased employees. Though I do not altogether see why that should not be done, I shall not press that point. My only objection to the Minister&#39;s recommendation is that a garnishee order is not the only process by which these pension moneys can be attached. I would have preferred, in place of the reference to  at  garnishee order, some such phrase as &#34; processes for debt or damage issued out of any Court of competent jurisdiction &#34; as covering better the possibilities which may arise. Garnishee is one only of the courses that are adopted after a person has issued process out of some Court of competent jurisdiction. Most people object to it because it involves a lot of trouble in ascertaining the . exact sum of money owing, and, if you obtain an order for more than the debt that may be owing at that particular time, you are defeated in that particular garnishee, and another order has to be taken out and another fee has to be paid. You may have to pay a number of these fees before recovering the money. If we employed the words &#34;processes issued out of a Court of competent jurisdiction &#34; we should get over the whole difficulty. </para>

He suggested that he would have the matter further considered before the Bill was again called on. He said that I could think it over. I have just arrived from Sydney, and I have only now written out the words that I have placed on his table. I resent the statement that I suggested the words that the Minister has adopted. </para>

Clerical officers who were not appointed by the Acting Public Service Commissioner will come into the Public Service from the Defence Department; but under exactly the same conditions as regards examination. Whilst the Defence (Civil Employment) Act was in operation a Board, on which&#39; the Public Service Inspector acted, was constituted, and all the regulations, and conditions of examination were complied with as in the case of appointments to the Public Service, because it was contemplated that the officers concerned would be transferred. </para>

                <para class="block">The object of this clause is to preserve the rights of certain statutory officers at present outside the Service, who, under this Bill, will become classified officers. Honorable senators will remember that when a previous Public Service Bill was passed provision was made for the appointment of. Public Service Inspectors, and certain officers were selected either from the Commonwealth Service or were transferred from a State Service. The appointments were, I believe, for a definite period of seven years, and after the expiry of that term it was contemplated by the Government of the day that the Public Service Act would be amended, so that these persons would not have to be definitely appointed for a further term. </para>
                <para class="block">The Government subsequently appointed them as acting inspectors with the result that they ceased, technically, to be members of the Public Service. It was not the intention of the Government, however, to dispense with their services neither was it the desire of Parliament, but that having been done makes it necessary to have this provision in order to bring them into the Service. They still possess the necessary qualifications, and it is a simple act of justice. If it had not been fox unavoidable delay they would have been in the Service long ago. </para>

                    <para>. - I quite agree with the amendment; but I would like to ask the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> what action is contemplated under this measure in regard to inspectors, as the office has now been abolished, and under this amendment they will simply be retained as members of the Service. I raised this question when the Bill was in Committee, and on several other occasions, and I am afraid that I either could not make myself understood or the Minister did not agree with the views I submitted. I look upon the inspectors as the eyes of the Public Service. We are providing in this measure for the appointment of a Board of three members, who will be unable to efficiently discharge the numerous duties suggested unless they have the assistance of inspectors, particularly as the work has increased to a great extent during recent years. Do the Government intend tq have inspectors as in the past or utilize the services of those who acted in that capacity in some other way? Some were probably chief clerks, and such men will return to their oldpositions. </para>

                    <para>. - The Government have no intention of specially appointing inspectors, because the Bill provides for the establishment of a Board, and it is obvious that that body will have officers to do certain work similar to that done by inspectors in order to inform the Board. Such officers will be the eyes and ears of the Service, and they will be utilized to procure necessary information for the effective conduct of the Service. I should assume that the Board will at an early date submit to the Government a list of officers they propose to appoint for that purpose, and the Government will be bound to provide the </para>

It does not matter if they are called inspectors or not; but it is obvious that in dealing with public servants distributed over a continent they must appoint similar officers, and I would assume that after the experience the inspectors have gained it is quite possible that the Board may continue to employ these particular men. The Board have power to classify officers, to recommend new offices and the abolition of offices. It will remain for the Board to say whether these men shall be employed in this or some other capacity. TheGovernment will suspend judgment until they receive a recommendation from the -Board as to what they propose to do in that regard. </para>

                        <para>- But they will not have the same status. The present inspectors cannot be dismissed by the Minister. The Minister said that the inspectors were appointed for five years, and as the appointments are statutory they can only be altered by Parliament. This measure cannot give the inspectors the status they originally held. It will take six months before that can be done. I am in favour of the amendment, and am prepared to support it. The Minister has given me information which I tried to get, without success, for many weeks. Unless we have a strong inspectorial staff the Board will be able to do very little effective work. </para>

                    <para>. -  I do not think the Minister has quite answered my question. I gather that members of the Board on big questions are to be practically equal in power. There are other Boards on which the  chairman  can override his colleagues, and I rather favour that idea. The Chief Railway Commissioner of New South Wales can override the opinions of his two assistants. The assistants can have their full say at a Board meeting, but if the Chief Commissioner disagrees with them, his view is predominant. They can protest, and can notify Parliament that they disagree with the Chief Commissioner, but he has his way unless Parliament intervenes and decides otherwise. When we are proposing to pay a  Chairman  &#163;500 more than either of the other members will receive, we naturally expect him to be a man of superior ability. If he is a man of superior ability, he will be handicapped by two persons who are not his equal. The men on the &#163;2,000 mark may be abler than the  Chairman,  but they should not be, because the higher salary should command an abler man. There is a possibility that, if the three members of the Board have equal voting power, there will be friction. I have known Boards where the subordinate members have not only had a lot to say, but have overridden the  chairman.  That occurred some time ago with the Railways Commissioners in New South Wales </para>

I cannot be a, party to appointing a Board for three years, the members of which will in the aggregate, receive &#163;6,500 a year. As we are considering the question of economy in connexion with many of our Departments, we ought to consider it here. We ought to be very careful in making any appointments the salary of which is in excess of &#163;1,000 a year. We are too prone to give attention to economy that affects the man on the bread-line, but we seem to be prepared to pass very lightly over a clause of this sort, which proposes to give the  Chairman  of a Board &#163;2,500 a year and each of the other two members &#163;2,000 a year. I believe that one man, with the necessary authority and a reasonable salary, would be able to do the work. A salary of &#163;1,000 in the. Public Service would be desired _ by many thousands of men in this country. </para>

                        <para>- No, but they will be in the public pay, and for my argument that is close enough, and from their point  of view, I should say, would be very satisfactory. It is very debatable whether they will be in the Public Service. They will be in the pay  of the public purse, and that will get very close to the Public Service. The  Chairman  of the Board, having a casting vote, would, be able to sway the decisions of the Board, whichever way the other two members voted. It is an unwritten law .that the  Chairman  of a Board should get a little more salary than other members. </para>

He will not find many of the private banks paying less than from &#163;3,000 to &#163;5,000 a year to their general managers, and not many insurance societies paying less than from &#163;2,000 to &#163;3,500 to occupants of similar positions. </para>

                        <para>- In all Democracies there is a tendency not to pay for brains, but as a general rule they pay&#39; bitterly for .their experience in other directions. 1 invite .honorable senators to examine the Bill and see what it is that the Board of &#39;Commissioners will be required to do. They will be called&#34; upon to control a Public Service of about 24,000 employees whose salary bill comes to about &#163;5,500,000 per annum. In private  businesses  the salaries I have mentioned are paid to men controlling much smaller concerns. Honorable senators will realize, surely, from perusal of clause 16, that it is very desirable we should get the very best men possible for these positions, otherwise the whole proceedings will be a waste of money. It would certainly be waste of money, if we could not get the right men, to pay them even &#163;100 a year. It must be remembered also that the first appointments under this Bill will be for five years, four years, and -three years respectively, and -there will be -no guarantee of reappointment. That matter will rest with the Government of the day. Everything will depend upon the manner in which members of the Board carry out their duties. Do honorable senators imagine for a moment that we are likely to get men of ability, if they are outside Che Service, to make application for positions carrying, at the most, &#163;1,500 a year, without any guarantee as to a -renewal of engagement? If it is the view of the Committee - I am sure it is not - that the positions we are creating are worth only &#163;1,500 a year in the case of the  Chairman,  and &#163;1,000 in the case of the other two members of the Board, it would be far better, even at this stage, .to wreck the Bill altogether. Unless we offer adequate salaries, we. are certainly not likely to get the best men, and. unless we do that we shall be committing the worst form &#39;of extravagance. If incompetent men fill these positions, it is quite likely that they will lose this country scores of thousands of pounds. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> will not press his amendment as it has been drafted. The suggestion that the*  Chairman  of- the Board should receive only &#163;1,500 a year does not commend itself to me. Had the honorable senator submitted an amendment that there should- be only one Commissioner with a salary of &#163;3,000 a year I should have been- with him all the time, but, unfortunately, we cannot do that now. However, there is another alternative for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> to adopt, namely, to. fix a good salary for the  Chairman.,  and leave the other two positions at a much lower salary, because I feel that after all they will only be supernumeraries,&#39; and it would be much easier, subsequently, to amend the Act and get rid of these persons on the Board. This proposal for the appointment of a Board of Commissioners is utterly opposed to the recommendations of the Royal Commission. </para>

I was not in- the Senate when the Bill was under consideration or I would have spoken- then- as, I am speaking now. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> that in the Superannuation Bill there is a provision for a similar Board, the  Chairman  of which will have a deliberative vote, and other powers are given to him, and I fail to see why tha same provision could not be inserted in this Bill. </para>

                    <para>-. - I agree with a great deal of what the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has said. It would be foolhardy to, offer a small salary for a position requiring; a man. of marked ability. At the same time &#163;2,500- a year- for the-  Chairman  of a. Board of three to manage the Public Service of the Commonwealth involving the expenditure of &#163;5,500,000 is what I would: call an outside salary. We have been told, what banks and insurance companies pay- their general managers, but we know that so far as &#39; State railways are concerned some, of the Railways Commissioners are not getting, anything like &#163;2,500 a year. </para>

                        <para>- The Railways Commissioner in Western Australia gets only &#163;1,500&#39; a year, and we must remember also that a great deal of ability is required for the successful management of a large railway system. In addition, to organizing ability for the management of the general staff, a Railways Commissioner must have certain other engineering qualifications. If the South Australian Government have appointed a Railways Commissioner at &#163;5,000 a year, that only goes to show that that State has gone to the other extreme. An unwelcome feature of this Bill, in my opinion, is that it fixes the maximum salary and then the Government will advertise for the man to fill the position. I think we should have something in the nature of gradations of qualifications. This principle is observed in the Public Service itself, a man on appointment being advised that he starts at a lower level and may advance a certain distance and no further. In this case, however, we are fixing the salary at the highest grade, and calling for applicants: to fill the position. </para>

                        <para>- The salary included in the Bill should be regarded as the maximum. If we pay the salaries- proposed immediately on the appointment of the officer we shall run the risk of a misfit, and may find ourselves, left. Very often Governments- have been taken in by appointing misfits) to important positions at fixed salaries. The salary of &#163;2,500 should be regarded, as the maximum salary for the position of  Chairman  of the Board, and the person appointed to the position might begin at a salary of &#163;2,000, which would be a very excellent salary for a start. It is true, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Benny</inline> has said, that the principle of fixing the salary is adopted in the case of Justices of the Supreme Court, but they are in an entirely different category from the persons to be appointed as members of this Board. </para>

                        <para>- I agree with the honorable senator. I believe that the salaries here proposed are most liberal, if not extravagant, and they should be regarded as maximum salaries to which the persons appointed to the positions might look forward when they have proved their worth. I shall submit an amendment to give effect to that idea later on, for I cannot do so now. </para>

                    <para>.- I cannot support the amendment, for the reasons given by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce).</inline> Economy is effected, not so much by the amount of money spent, as by the way in which it is spent. If the Board of Commissioners can do satisfactorily what they are asked to do under clause 16 of the Bill for the salaries proposed the Commonwealth will get a good return for the money. This Board of Commissioners will have a colossal task to perform. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has suggested that the salaries paid should be on a sliding scale, but in my view it would be disastrous to appoint men to positions such as these on probation to see what sort of a job they would make of them&#39;. We might appoint a man as  Chairman  of the Board at &#163;1,500 a year with the prospect of reaching a salary of &#163;2,500, and the Commonwealth might lose a good deal more than the extra &#163;1,000 a year by the time such a man had learned his job. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> appears to be sanguine that we can get men to carry out what the Board will have to do under clause 16 of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- I agree to some extent with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> that the salaries proposed should not be fixed at a definite amount, and if the salary of &#163;2,500 is agreed to as the salary to be paid to the  Chairman  of the Board, I shall later on move the insertion before the amount of the salary, of the words, &#34; not exceeding.&#34; If that amendment be accepted, the Government may find it impossible to secure a suitable  Chairman  of the Board for &#163;2,000 a year and subordinate members for &#163;1,500 each. If this could be done the taxpayers would be saved a certain amount of money, and at any rate the insertion of the words I have suggested would do no harm. We know that the country has suffered greatly in the last few years as the result of the employment of incompetent men in responsible positions. </para>

I may remind honorable senators that in the War Service Homes Bill no salary was specified. Appointments were made to the War Service Homes Commission without sufficient consideration, and returned soldiers and the taxpayers have been saddled with considerable burdens as the result of the employment of cheap and incompetent men in that office. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. If we can get men on this Board to carry out the duties under clause 16, and men who  will effect the economies in the Public Service which the Government are hoping for, they will be cheap at &#163;10,000 a year. I believe that there are many men in the service of the Commonwealth to-day in high positions who are very much underpaid. If they carried the same responsibility, and did the same work outside the Service for an insurance firm, a banking institution, or a big commercial house, they would receive very much higher remuneration. There are high officials in the Treasury, the Taxation Office, and in the office of the Solicitor-General, who are men of undoubted ability, and are receiving very much smaller salaries than they could command outside the Service. I have said that unnecessary burdens have been placed on the shoulders of the taxpayers of this country as a result of the appointment to the War Service Homes Commission of incompetent officers and cheap men without the necessary experience and ability to carry out the duties of their offices efficiently. I will not support the amendment, but whilst supporting the proposal of the Government, I shall, as I have said, propose the insertion of the words &#34;not exceeding.&#34; </para>

When the matter was previously under consideration it was, I think, generally understood that the Board would cost something like &#163;5,500 a  year.  If it were proposed to give the  Chairman  &#163;2,000 a year and each of the other members &#163;1,500, I should be prepared to support that. </para>

                    <para>. -  I agree with the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> that it is not economy to appoint men to responsible positions at insufficient salaries. If the members of this Board are able to carry out the duties imposed  by  clause 16, they will be cheap at &#163;10,000 a year. I venture to say that the Government will have very great difficulty in securing an abler man for the position of  Chairman  of the Board than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan.</inline></para>

                    <para>. - I am in favour of giving the  Chairman  &#163;2,000, and the other members of the -Board &#163;1,500 per annum, making a total of &#163;5,000. A good deal has been said about the necessity to pay high salaries in order to attract super-men; but high salaries do not necessarily attract that type of man. There are plenty of people in the community, such as engineers, barristers, and even some members of the .Judiciary, who receive less than it is proposed to pay to the members of the Board, but whose responsibilities are far greater than those of the Board will be. I understand that some of the Judges of the Arbitration Court are not receiving as high salaries  as  those now proposed. The Judges are required to have a university training, and they :must reach the top of their profession before they obtain -any of the &#34; plums.&#34; The salaries I have suggested for the Board &#39;would be ample. </para>

                    <para>. -  I support the suggestion that the  Chairman  of the Board should receive &#163;2,000, and the other members &#163;1,500. That would be a good compromise, and I think it would pro vide for fair remuneration. The  Deputy  -Presidents of the Arbitration Court receive only &#163;2,000, and they certainly have most onerous and responsible duties to perform. If we want efficiency we ought to pay our officers well. I would like to see a salary fixed as high as possible, but we have to take all the circumstances into consideration. We have seen how Judges are -not infrequently selected from the ranks of the second-rate barristers. Positions on judicial tribunals have&#34; often been refused by leading .members of the Bar, because it would have meant their sacrificing several thousand pounds per annum. That is the position in South Australia, and I know that it has happened several times in Victoria. I would not like to see responsible Government positions made attractive only to men of inferior calibre, &#39;but I nevertheless maintain that the salaries of &#163;2,000 or &#163;1,500 would provide fair -remuneration. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> in reply to me, spoke as though it was false economy to decide <inline font-style="italic">&#60;m</inline> the salary before making the appointment. I would remind him that in commercial life it is a general custom to arrive at some decision as to what is a fair amount to pay before naming the salary. The Commissioner of Taxation has a very responsible position to fill, but he is not in receipt of a salary of &#163;2,000 a year. He has to be familiar with every class of business in the Commonwealth, and have all the points in connexion .with them at his finger-ends to enable him to safeguard public interests.  His  position is just as important as that of a member of this Board will -be. If honorable members had to find the money themselves, when making appointments of this nature they would take a more serious view of the matter. Some time ago I asked for a list of the appointments held in the Commonwealth where the salaries were over &#163;500 a year, and .1 received a most extensive list of salaries running up to about &#163;2,000 per annum. We are constantly creating new .Departments. The Government have appointed Judges to the Arbitration -Court at &#163;2,000 a year on a two years&#39; appointment. </para>

                    <para>.- I have no desire to hamper the selection of candidates, bub I&#39; do not see that the words &#34; not exceeding &#34; a certain sum. would hamper the selection. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> pointed out, the best men for the position will probably have to be sought after by the Government. No doubt hundreds of persons will apply, but the great majority of them will be unsuitable for the work. It will require an extraordinarily, gifted man to fill the position of  Chairman  satisfactorily. Personally, I would not limit the salary at all, if we could be sure of securing the right man. If the words &#34; not exceeding &#34; are inserted before the figures the clause would leave the Government free to select suitable men, and at the same time would prevent an unnecessarily high salary  being paid. I trust that these positions are not to be given to disgruntled or dissatisfied politicians, but there is no fear of that While the present Government are in power. I trust the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> will favorably consider my suggestion. </para>

                    <para>. - I am supporting the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> in advocating a salary of &#163;2,500 per annum for the  Chairman  of the Board, because his task will not be as light as some honorable senators imagine. If they will refer to clause 16 they will find that the Board have to devise means for effecting economies and promoting efficiency in the management and working of Departments. That has been a source of trouble and complaint in the past, and th;e duties imposed in that direction, without, anything else,, are sufficient to tax the ability of the best of men. They will also have to deal with improved organization procedure, closer supervision, &#39;the simplification of the work in each Department and the abolition of unnecessary work. A tremendous amount of detailed study will therefore be required before they will be able to arrive at the true position. Their duties will also include the co-ordination of the work of the various Departments, and that in itself is a job that would almost tax the ability of super-men. The limitation of staffs of the various Departments to actual requirements, and the utilization of those staffs to the best advantage, has also to be undertaken, and&#39; that has never yet been thoroughly attempted in any branch of the Service. That is an absolute duty imposed upon the Board by this measure, and not on the heads of Departments. They also have to examine the business of each Department and ascertain whether any inefficiency or lack of economy exists, as well as other important duties set out in the clause. I am assuming, of course, that the Government will select a man possessing the highest qualifications, and that the other two members of the Board will bo more in the nature of supernumeraries. One man is to be . the genius, and he should be paid the amount the Government propose. Later on I propose to move to reduce the salary of the two subordinate members; if we wish the job to be done well, the  Chairman  should receive an adequate salary. If we do not make a marked distinction between the Chairman; and the other members of the Board, we shall probably have three mediocre men, and there will be constant trouble and wrangling as to who is the &#34;top dog.&#34; We should provide for the payment of a fairly high salary to the  Chairman,  and remunerate the other members of the Board at a lower rate. </para>

                <para class="block">I have already explained my reasons for moving this amendment, which, briefly, are that there would be a number of applications from suitable men if the salary were fixed at &#163;2,000 a year. A practical business man is the best one for the job, and although some of the legal luminaries in this Chamber may regard the amount as inadequate, they must remember that the  Deputy  Presidents of the Arbitration Court, who have very important work to perform, receive only that salary, and the Commissioner of Taxation receives only &#163;1,500 a year.  His  duties are worrying and exacting, and the facts I have quoted absolutely destroy the arguments of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce).</inline> This man will occupy one of the most important positions in the Service. He will have enormous responsibilities. Personally I think the salary should be &#163;1,500 a year, because that would be quite sufficient for the position. Very few posts in the Commonwealth Service are paid higher than that. Fancy honorable senators having to meet their constituents and tell them that the  Chairman  of the Board will be paid a salary in excess of that paid to the Right Honorable <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> Prime Minister of Australia! The proposal is absurd. I am not saying that the Prime Minister gets enough, but there are many people who say that members of Parliament get too much. The Minister says that we shall be able to secure applicants at the lower salary, but 1 venture to say that even for parliamentary positions at &#163;1,000 a year there will never be any shortage of applicants. I am quite satisfied that we ought not to have men in the Public Service drawing a higher salary than tha* paid to the Prime Minister. </para>

                    <para>.- I recognise, as much as does any honorable senator, the importance of the duties that the members of the Board will be called upon to&#39; perform. I realize that they will be very arduous duties. We can reasonably anticipate that, after the Commission has been appointed for a very short time, we shall be able to see some definite results from its labours. The amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> ought to receive very serious consideration and generous support in this Committee. Hitherto the Public Service has been managed and administered by one Commissioner, but we have made an innovation in the hope that it will give satisfactory results financially to Australia. Wc are proposing to appoint a Board of Commissioners, consisting of three men, the  Chairman  to receive &#163;2,500 per annum, and the other two members &#163;2,000 per annum each. It appears to me that we are going a little too far. One of the most important offices in Australia is filled by the Commissioner of Taxation, and I can refer to him without making any invidious comparisons, because, up to tha present, no Commissioner under the Bill has been appointed. The Commissioner of Taxation controls and manages a large and difficult Department, and has to give his attention to very many important details.  His  salary is &#163;1,500 per annum.  It seems strange that the Government should suggest that the  Chairman  of the Board of Commissioners should receive &#163;1,000 more per annum than the Commissioner of Taxation. I do not believe in false economy. It is assumed that if we gave &#163;6,500 per annum in salaries to members of the Board the expenditure would show a considerable profit to the Commonwealth; but in making a new departure of this kind,&#34; we should be careful not to provide a salary which, by comparison with other salaries paid in Australia, must appear to every one to be very high. The suggestion that the amount should be reduced by &#163;500 Per annum is reasonable. 1 feel that for the reduced salary we shall still be able to obtain men capable of occupying the position and carrying out their obligations under the Bill to the satisfaction of the community. </para>

                    <para>.-The honorable senator overlooks an important distinction between the positions proposed in the Bill, and the one he has indicated. The Commissioner of Taxation is appointed for life, and his salary is capable  of being increased by Parliament at the instigation of the Government, any year, and probably&#39; it will be increased. The Taxation Office has only been in existence for four years. The  Chairman  of the Board of Commissioners will be appointed for five years, the next member for four years, and the third for three years. It is necessary to offer a salary that will attract men from other positions. </para>

                        <para>- Personally I would not stop at that amount; I would pay more. I have long ago come to the conclusion that the idea that we can get efficient service by refusing to pay for it, is false. I have seen some remarkable instances of it in the Commonwealth Service already. If a man is inefficient it does not matter what we pay him; even, if it is only &#163;100 a year, we are extravagant. Honorable senators who think they are going to economize by cutting &#163;500 a year off these salaries are setting about the task in the wrong way. It is proposed to hand over these duties, which are far more important than those which the Public Service Commissioner ever had to perform, to inefficient and second-rate men. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> spoke of his own experience. If that is the experience he applies to his own farm, and other farmers copy him, I am, not surprised that they have a bad time. </para>

                <para>A comparison has been made. with the salary paid to the ex-Public Service Commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan.</inline> During the last year of his office, before the war, he received &#163;1,500, the money equivalent of which to-day is &#163;2,500. Therefore, if the  Chairman  of- the Board is to receive a salary equivalent to that which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan</inline> received, he should get at least &#163;2,500. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan</inline> had not one-fifth of the duties to perform that are being placed upon the Board. Many duties are included in the Bill which were not required of the Public Service Commissioner! under the Public - Service Act. If honorable senators will read clause 1.6 of the Bill, and compare the duties there set out with those which the Public Service Commissioner had to perform under the Public Service Act, they will see that there is no comparison. The duties now are. far mere diversified, and far more important, and the Board will have a great deal to do with the expenditure of public money. </para>

                    <para>. -  I cannot support the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson.</inline> It has often struck me as extraordinary that in a democratic community like this people are shocked at salaries that run into four figures. We have seen an illustration of that in the newspaper clamour which was made when the salaries of members of Parliament were increased. We saw the folly of it when Parliament bowed to that clamour in the community and fixed a miserable salary of &#163;1,500 a year for the- War Service Homes Commissioner. We have seen the disastrous consequences- of appointing an inefficient man to carry on those great functions. It was a very expensive way to do it. It would have been cheaper to have paid an efficient man &#163;100,000 a year than an inefficient man. &#163;1,500 a year, and it would certainly have been good economy to pay &#163;5,000 a year for the right man. I believe such a man could- have been got at the price. It is false economy, to put cheap men. into big positions, and it. would be false economy to cut down the salaries of members of the Board- of Commissioners. To effectively carry out these duties we need first-class men,, and we cannot&#39; get them for second-class pay. A- comparison has been made by- one honorable senator with1 the- salary drawn by the Prime Minister of Australia, and he asked how we could justify the payment of a higher salary to a civil servant- than to the Prime Minister. My own view is that the salary paid to the Prime Minister- is a scandal to the community; and the way to justify the proposed payments to members of the Board is to increase the pay of the Prime Minister. Why it has not been done long ago I do not know, and it is only because we have men. of very high ideals in the community that we can get them to take on public life in Australia. </para>

                    <para>.- I want to say a word or two in reply to the arguments put forward, by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> with regard to the statement that I made in supporting the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson.</inline> The Minister suggested that if the amendment were carried we must, of necessity, appoint inefficient and incompetent men to. these positions. I do not know whether the Minister or the Government have in view the gentlemen who will be appointed, but probably they have,, and I want to draw their attention to the fact that, notwithstanding that the Board will have to perform a greater variety of work, than the single Commissioner, it must be patent to every one that the three Commissioners will only be able to do a certain quantity of work in a given time. I admit that clause 16 imposes a great variety of tasks on the Commissioners&#39;, but I take it that the Commissioner under the old Act had his time fully occupied, and that when the new Commissioners are appointed they will have their time fully occupied also. Having,, however, a greater variety of duties to perform, and many more problems to solve, it must take them a greater time to accomplish those tasks than it would if those tasks were simpler. The Minister suggested that the greater variety of duties required of the Commissioner would warrant the payment of the salary suggested by the Government.  I  cannot see that at all. I do not believe in underpaying any one because that may constitute false economy, but I have yet to be satisfied that it is essential, in order to get competent and efficient men, to offer a salary of  &#163;2,500  for the  Chairman  and  &#163;2,000  for the other members of the Board. The Minister also contended that it was necessary to offer a higher salary because the term of appointment will be limited to five years. I take it that if, during those five years, the Commissioners in the discharge of their duties are not up to the mark, they will not be reappointed. </para>

                    <para>. -  I intend to support the amendment in the belief that if it is carried it will make it absurd for two members of the Board, with salaries substantially lower than that paid to the  Chairman,  to have equal voting power with the  Chairman.  If the Government would alter the Bill so as to give the  Chairman  certain power over the other two members, I would not mind paying  &#163;2,000  per year to the subordinate members.Butthe Government&#39;s proposal is to give them equal voting power, and I believe that if this amendment is carried the position will be so absurd that the Government will put the Board on a proper basis. The Chairman, who will receive  &#163;2,500,  and who is supposed to be the super-man in the matter- of ability and responsibility  for the duties outlined in clause 16, would then be able to do something without being hampered by the views of the other members. In such circumstances I would not mind giving the  Chairman  of the Board an additional &#163;1,000 in order to insure the appointment of a first-class man. I object to the  Chairman  having only equal voting power with the other members of the Board. My only reason for supporting the amendment is that if the salaries of the other members of the Board were reduced to &#163;1,500, the Government would then probably listen to reason and give the  Chairman  that status which his position demands. </para>

My view is that, if the Service is to be controlled properly, there must be one man in control, with other men to discharge certain, duties of detail. The chief responsibility should devolve upon the man who is at the head, and he would be the  Chairman  of the Board. The other members of the Board should not get such high salaries. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson&#39;s</inline> amendment is a step in the right direction. </para>

                    <para>. - I take it that the clause generally is open to discussion, and I wish to direct the attention of the Committee to one feature of it. It provides that any member of the Board becoming a member of an incorporated company or limited liability company will under certain circumstances render himself liable to be found guilty of an indictable offence and subject to a penalty of &#163;500, or imprisonment for three years, or both, if the company does not consist of more than twenty-five members. In the last three or four years in New South Wales, there have been a number of companies formed, not proprietary companies, but ordinary small capital companies, the members of which do not exceed twenty-five. It frequently happens that a few of the members&#39; will hold the greater number of shares, and some may buy from others holding a few shares a sufficient number of shares to secure a controlling interest in the company. One of the members of the Board may hold a few shares in such a company, and so in all innocence may render himself liable to be found guilty of an indictable offence under this clause. I doubt whether honorable senators realized this in fixing the limit of the membership of a company under this clause at twenty-five.

Where a.ny officer of the Public, Railway, or other Service of a State, whether or not he was an officer of that Service a.t the date of the establishment of the Commonwealth, was transferred to the Commonwealth Service before the commencement of this Act, he shall preserve all his existing and accruing rights, and shall be entitled to retire from office at the time, and on the pension or retiring allowance, which would be permitted by the law of the State from which he was transferred,, if his service with the Commonwealth were a continuation of his service with the State.&#34;

                    <para>.- The question that honorable senators raised in connexion with the Superannuation Bill arises here. Officers transferred from a State Service to the Commonwealth Service would not come under the provisions of this particular clause. Will the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> accept an amendment to insert after the word &#34;law&#34; the words &#34;or by any resolution passed by both Houses of the Parliament.&#34; Is not a resolution of both Houses tantamount to a law? Members of the Tasmanian State Service who have already retired received their retiring allowance, and it was paid partly by the State and partly by the Commonwealth. I do not see why any officer in the Public Service of the Commonwealth should be penalized when officers in the same category have hitherto drawn the full allowance. </para>

                    <para>. -  I must decline this generous invitation to sign a blank cheque. I do not know what resolutions may have been  passed by the State Parliaments, and I cannot ,pledge the Government to accept any or every such resolution. If any officers have rights under the law, those rights can he established, but, , if they have no such rights, it is not for us to extend them. We cannot add to the privileges of public servants who may have had certain rights conferred upon them by resolution of theState Parliaments. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> has stated that some of these officers have had their rights recognised by the Commonwealth. I suppose it is because their rights have been examined, and have been found to be good in law. This clause preserves every lawful right of public servants. </para>

                    <para>.- There seems to be a difference of opinion between the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> and myself as to what constitutes a lawful right. A few days ago the Minister said that there was no lawful right on the part of these servants, and the payment was an act of grace. Seeing that officers who have already retired have received these allowances, which have been paid partly by the State and partly by the Commonwealth Governments, surely it is reasonable to suggest that the remaining members of the Service who were transferred from the Tasmanian Service should be placed in the same category. The new clause lays it down clearly that they have no legal claim unless the allowance has been provided for by a law of a State. It seems that the Minister looks upon a. law of a State and a resolution of both Houses of the Parliament of a State as two different things. </para>

                    <para>. -  This is probably one of the most important amendments made in another place. It is proposed to strike out the whole of the very long clause  50,  and insert a new clause. The effect of the alteration is to vest the power of promotion and transfer in all cases in the Board. Under the present clause  50  the Permanent Head has power to promote within  his  Department. This alteration has necessitated further revision in the matter of appeals against provisional appointments. The effect of the new clause is that the Board will act upon a recommendation of the Permanent Head as to the promotion or transfer of an officer. </para>

                <para class="block">The amendment was inserted in another place distinctly for the purpose of benefiting the returned soldier, and it purports to assist those who have been temporarily employed for a period of two years. It was put in hurriedly late at night, and did not receive much discussion, and it is certain that those who accepted it did not realize its effect. A short analysis of it will show how impossible it is for us to accept it in its present form. It follows the clause which deals with the appointment of returned soldiers temporarily employed. Honorable senators will notice from the wording of the amendment that it is the duties the employee has performed which are &#34;of a non-clerical character,&#34; and not the duties to which he may be appointed. If a returned soldier had been temporarily employed for two years, sweeping out the post-office, and the  officer  who was his senior reported that he had done it satisfactorily, he could be appointed to any position in the Public Service, and not merely, as the framer of the amendment thought and intended, to the General Division of the Service. There is no limitation in the amendment regarding where the man shall be appointed to. There is another point which I wish the Committee to bear in mind. There has been quite a number of returned soldiers temporarily employed in the Public Service, and some time ago representations were made to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> by the Returned Soldiers Association, pointing . out that Parliament had provided for a certain number of permanent positions, and ask- ing that returned soldiers should be permitted to qualify for appointment to them by examination. The Cabinet considered that request, and agreed to grant it. An examination has been held in New South Wales. In that State there are 160 returned soldiers temporarily occupying positions which are, or will be when the Estimates are passed, of a permanent character, and there are a further sixty-three returned soldiers who are temporarily employed in place of officers on furlough or leave of absence. An examination was held on 3rd December, 1921, restricted to returned soldiers, for permanent appointment to positions of postman, <inline font-style="italic">&#38;c,</inline> and 193 candidates passed. Of that number 132 have been appointed to the permanent Service, leaving the balance of sixty-one still to be appointed. If the clause is adopted as it stands, &#171;very returned soldier - and not merely those whom the mover of the amendment had in mind - who had been temporarily employed for two years, provided the Chief Officer said he had satisfactorily performed his duties, would be entitled to be appointed to the Public Service without examination, and the persons who had passed the examination would have to stand aside for him. . That would obviously be unjust, and it is  certainly  not desirable. The motion which I have submitted provides that those returned soldiers who are employed in the Public Service temporarily, and who have been filling positions satisfactorily, and who, in addition, have passed an examination, shall receive first preference. Following on the examination held in New South Wales, and in accordance with the Cabinet minute, preparations are being made for holding examinations in the other States. The Cabinet minute provides that the permanent positions shall be filled by the appointment of returned soldiers; that competitive examinations, open to all returned soldiers, whether they are in the Department or not, shall be held; and that those who qualify shall receive the appointments. We recognise that there is something to be said for appointing to non-clerical positions, men who for two years have been satisfactorily filling such positions, but we say that there is an order in which preference should be given. We ought to have some regard to the promises made to these men, under which they have been preparing themselves, and have passed the examinations. In the Bill itself, apart from- the amendment, we have given distinct privileges to returned soldiers, over and above those contained in the Public Service Act. We have done away with the limitation as to temporary employment. Under the present Act these men can only be employed for a period of six months, which may be extended by another three months, after which the appointment terminates. Now the appointments can be continued indefinitely. Under the present Act when a temporary servant has finished a term he cannot be re-employed until a certain interval hae elapsed, but that restriction has been abandoned in the Bill. If honorable senators will look at clause 84 they will see a number of sub-clauses which give expression to the principle of preference to returned soldiers in the permanent Service, and now we are proposing to give additional advantages by stipulating the order in which we shall pass into the General Division of the Service those who are now outside, whether they are temporarily employed in the Service or not. First we place returned soldiers who are now temporarily employed in the Public Service, who have passed, or will have passed, when the Bill becomes law, the prescribed examination. Clearly, they ought to come first. Some of these men have been employed for a year and ten months, and yet, under the amendment from the House of Representatives, the men who have passed or are preparing to pass the prescribed examination may be superseded by those who have gone up and failed. In the second order of preference we place those who are in the Repatriation or War Service Homes Departments, which are, after all, allied branches of the Public Service. In the third place we bring in the men who have not passed an examination, but whose claim is that for two years they have been satisfactorily filling a temporary position in non-clerical employment in some branch of the Service. Fourth, and last in the order of preference, will be those who are neither in the Public Service nor in the Repatriation or War Service Homes Departments, in a temporary capacity, but who have passed the prescribed examination. Clearly those are entitled to consideration also. If my motion is carried it will give effect to the principle which was thought to be embodied in the House of Representatives&#39; amendment. Paragraph c of the motion includes the amendment; but, in front of it, as entitled to first preference, are placed the men already temporarily employed in the Service, who have passed an examination. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable senator speaks as if clause 83 deals only with temporary employment. It is quite true that it does deal with temporary employment, but we are now adding something by providing for the &#34; appointment &#34; to the Service of certain returned soldiers. Honorable senators will see that clause 37 deals with &#34; appointments &#34; on probation, and clause 40 with the age for &#34; appointment.&#34; In several clauses of the Bill there is reference to &#34;appointments &#34; to the Public Service, and as amended this clause will deal with temporary employment and &#34;appointments&#34; to the Service. Were it otherwise, the words we are now seeking to insert would not be required, because we have already provided for temporary employment. Having in the first part of the clause dealt with, persons who are already temporarily employed, we now proceed to say that in the making of &#34; appointments &#34; to positions of a non-clerical character, a . certain order of preference shall be observed. In the .Bill, this word &#34; appointment &#34; is used in a number of clauses as having the same meaning, and, surely, in this clause it should have the same meaning as in other portions of the Bill. If we insert the suggested amendment, we shall be making a laughing-stock of the measure, and we shall be obliged to go back over quite a number of other clauses to qualify the word &#34; appointment &#34; by adding the words &#34;of a permanent nature.&#34; </para>

Practically every man employed by the Repatriation and War Service Homes Departments is employed in a clerical capacity. </para>

The amendment I am now suggesting will&#39; remove any possible doubt there might be in the minds of honorable senators on this point. In reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> I should like to say that the returned soldiers  themselves are not asking for what he suggests shall be included in the amendment. They have never asked that they should have the right of appointment to the Clerical Division without examination. They recognise that it would be unreasonable to expect that. It must be remembered also&#39; that if we pass any of these men into that branch of the Service, they will not only be eligible for those positions, but will also have a right to promotion and increments, and to pass from grade to grade. It would be distinctly unfair to those returned soldiers who have already qualified,  or who are qualifying to pass an examination, to allow other men, performing non-clerical duties, to enter the Clerical Division without being required to pass an examination. </para>

In interpreting the Bill, a Court would interpret the meaning of &#34;appointment &#34; in its ordinary sense unless there were some definite provision limiting its application to a permanent appointment, and the Court would not be influenced by the fact that in a number of other clauses the word was used relatively to a permanent appointment. </para>

I should like the guidance of the Chair in the matter. I agree that it would be better that my amendment should follow clause 84, but the amendment of the House of Representatives which we are considering is an amendment of clause 83. We cannot accept that amendment as it stands. What we require to do is to negative the House of Representatives&#39; amendment, and substitute for it the amendment I have proposed as an addendum, not to clause&#39; 83, but to clause 84. I have to thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> for his suggestion if we can give it effect. I draw attention to the fact that the House of Representatives has amended sub-clause 8 of clause 84, and we could accept their amendment of that clause conditionally upon the addition to the clause of the words of the amendment I have proposed.

                    <para>.- The existing Act provides that deductions may be made from the salaries of officers who are unable to assure their lives, because they are technically known as &#34; bad lives.&#34; In order that they might make similar provision they have paid in certain sums, which have been allowed to accumulate on retirement or death-. Such sums would be paid to them or to their representatives with interest. As we have now passed the Superannuation Bill, in which it is provided that it will not be necessary for public servants to assure their lives, these deductions will no longer be made, and it has been necessary to make some provision for the disposal of the money. </para>

                    <para>. -  I understand that this clause provides for promotions or appointments in the Department to be made by the Board instead of by the Permanent Head of a Department, and, personally, I am very pleased that such a desirable amendment has been submitted. When the Bill was under consideration at an earlier stage quite a number of honorable senators spent considerable time in endeavouring to convince the Government that such an amendment was necessary, and it is rather interesting to find that the Bill has been returned to us in this form. The Departments will not in future be as water-tight as they have been in the past ; but I think the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> should give some reasons why there has been such a complete change of front. When the Northern Territory Representation Bill was under consideration I said that the Government cared little how members spoke, but were concerned more with their votes. In another place this proposal was accepted on the voices, and it would be interesting if the Minister would explain why the Government have changed their policy in this regard. </para>

                    <para>. -  It could be said that this clause, as it stands, is almost a model of perfection in the matter of instituting a means for regulating promotion in the Public Service, and it is time that merit in the man was recognised. In addition to a candidate for promotion having merit and diligence on his side, he must also have a satisfactory record as to good conduct. I am anxious to know in what particular sphere this qualification must be observed. Has his conduct to be exemplary both inside and outside the Department? We can easily imagine that there are some black sheep in a social or other sense, and I should like to know whether there are social offences which a person might be guilty of and still be allowed to remain in the Service. If a public servant were guilty of bigamy, would his services still be retained ? He might also be guilty of some of the offences aired from day to day in the police Courts, and we should be informed whether good conduct refers merely to that period during which he is employed, or whether it extends to his private life. I would like to see it extended so that his private life would also be covered, because honorable members who find their way into this and another Chamber are placed on a pedestal and viewed from every conceivable angle before they can convince a majority of the electors in their constituency to send them here. Not only in the interests of the Service, but in the interests of the men themselves, they should be worthy in every way of the positions which they occupy. </para>

                    <para>. -  I wish again to refer to the question of the salaries proposed to be paid to- the members of the Board of Commissioners. I do not persuade myself that I shall be able to control a majority of the Senate at this stage, but I wish to draw attention to what I regard as the very extravagant salaries that we have decided to pay to these officers. I find, on looking up the Public Service Report, that there are only thirteen men in the Clerical Division who receive over &#163;700 a year; in the Professional Division only nine receive over &#163;800 a year, and in the Administrative Division only four receive over &#163;1,000 a year. I therefore think that my language in describing these appointments as &#34; extravagant &#34; is quite justified. Outside the Public Service, there are men who are giving their time and their energies, and are devoting their capital, to the production of the wealth of this country, and of those, in the whole of the Commonwealth, only 22,000 are paying income tax on incomes of over &#163;1,000 a year. When the Commonwealth took ever the State Service, the total amount paid in salaries was &#163;1,439,938, and in 1920 we had improved our position at the expense of the taxpayer to such an extent that we were paying &#163;4.639,859. I believe it is time we called a halt, and commenced to take stock of the appointments we have created. Personally, I have no time for a Board. I would rather have an official head of some business experience, who would be capable of taking hold of the position. What we want is not a technical expert, but a man of unquestionable organizing ability. If we gave such a man &#163;2,500 a year, and did without the other two members, nobody would complain. We are about to put on the taxpayers of this country an additional burden of &#163;6,500 a year to pay the salaries of members of an administrative Board. In addition, there will be huge expenses for the typists and officers of the Board. It is time we ceased to talk of economies, and started to practise them. I believe in the principles and ideals of tha Bill. I have supported it right through, but I take this opportunity of again protesting against paying these high salaries, or, to use an Australian expression, &#34; greasing the fat pig.&#34; While we are placing these men in &#163;2,500 and &#163;2,000 a year jobs, we are talking of others who are on the bread line at &#163;3 or &#163;4 a week, to whom we ought to give more attention. It is those who will have to carry the added burden. When men who are on the bread line see these extravagant appointments made, dissatisfaction must be created. The three members of the Board will decide the conditions applicable to men receiving &#163;3 or &#163;4 a week. The Board will not achieve the objects which many honorable senators think it will achieve. The members of the Board will be able to unload their responsibilities from one to the other. The experience of the Senate with regard to Boards has not been satisfactory. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not intend to allow the remarks of the honorable senator to go without a. few words in reply, because he is playing to the gallery, especially to the press gallery. A pseudo campaign of economy has been going on for a considerable time, and the honorable senator&#39;s remarks are addressed to the particular section of the community which uses the term &#34; economy.&#34; Some time ago, when the campaign was at its height, the Government decided to appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into the Public Service, and it did not, as its critics said it would, appoint men who were under the control of the Government, but it took the advice of its critics and  appointed business men. There was then much talk about business men. It was said that what was wanted in the Public Service was some fresh air, and that the Service ought to be overhauled by men who were accustomed to handling big business. Politicians were, of course, barred. They could not be expected to be competent to deal with that class of thing. We got the biggest business men we could find. They were men who had made a success of business, and were such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> would now hold up for our admiration. The first member of the Board was <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson, a leading member of the Melbourne Chamber of Manufactures. He is a man who stands at the head of the business world of Melbourne, and if the critics had been asked to name a man who would be competent to overhaul the Public Service, they would probably have selected him.

Their instructions were to show the Governmenthow it could effect economies, and how it could get efficiency.

                <para>The question of salaries that should attach to administrative officers of the Commonwealth Public Service is one of considerable difficulty, owing to the fact that each officer&#39;s duty in itself embraces entirely different functions and responsibilities. For instance, there is no similarity between the duties of, say, the Secretary to the Prime Minister and the Commonwealth Statistician, or, say, the Chief Electoral Officer and the Secretary to the Treasury. </para>
                <para>It is suggested by the officers concerned, amongst other things, that there should now be a classification as follows: - </para>

                <para>There can be no doubt that (a) and (b) call for a higher rate of remuneration. ... It may be said, speaking generally, that our view is that the salaries at present provided are not in accord with the duties expected to be performed now, whatever may have been the case at the time of such appointments. ... It seems to us, further, that if the Public Service is to be made attractive to men of capacity, the salaries of those at the head should be sufficient to attract and retain such services. Apart from any other aspect, economy in administration can only be effected through the capacity of those intrusted with this work. </para>
                <para class="block">The whole tenor of their reply to the Prime Minister is a criticism of low salaries paid in the Public Service, and advocacy of higher salaries. The Government and Parliament adopted the recommendations of the Economies Commission. They are embodied in this Bill, and now <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson,</inline> this high priest of economy, denounces the Bill as extravagant, although, as I have said, it. bears the <inline font-style="italic">imprimatur</inline> of gentlemen constituting the Economies Commission. Not content with the report, the Government submitted a draft of the Bill to the Commission, and they approved of it, saying that it gave effect to their recommendations. Two of the biggest business men in this city, and men with all the qualifications for the management of big businesses, have given their advice. Their criticism was that salaries iri the Public Service were not high enough in view of the responsible character of the work involved, and yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> now gets up, and in the name of economy, denounces the Government for having practically adopted the recommendation cf the Economies Commission. No doubt, the honorable senator will get a pat on the back from the Melbourne press, which has been mouthing economy for the last two or three years, but when they get the medicine which is prescribed by the very men who, they declared, should be called in to advise the Government, they refuse to take the dose. No doubt, the honorable senator will get their commendation; but, as I have pointed out, this Bill is an epitome of the advice given by the Economies Commission, and if, is intended to secure economy and efficiency in the Public Service. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not think that I would have had much to say upon this important subject but for certain reports that have been recently received from the State of Western Australia as to the general position of the Commonwealth in relation to the State of Western Australia, and as one of the representatives from that State I deem it my duty to take advantage of this opportunity to remove what I consider to be a very gross misrepresentation on the subject. I have always made it a practice during the twenty-one years I have been a member of this Senate, to allow the State authorities to deal with their own affairs without any adverse criticism. If I could not say something favorable of my own State, I have been silent, but when there is continual misrepresentation as to the attitude of the Federal Parliament, I think it is my duty to say a few words to remove any misapprehension that may exist in the minds of the people so that truth may prevail. </para>

                    <para>A few weeks ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> provided the Senate with an opportunity to discuss the important question of the delimiting taxation as between the Federal and State authorities.  His  motion had a most sympathetic reception in this Chamber. Those who spoke on the subject recognised that Western Australia was not in a very favorable financial position, due principally to the fact that for a considerable time past the gold-mining industry there has been on the down grade. Unfortunately, that is largely accountable for the financial troubles of the western State at the present time. It is a natural consequence of continued gold-mining operations in all countries of the world, because gold is a diminishing quantity. </para>

Apart from the fact that Western Australia has been dependent, very largely, upon the success of gold mining operations, the State Government have an enormous territory to administer. Western Australia in area comprises one-third of the entire continent, and with a population of only a little over 300,000, necessarily the cost of administration is a severe strain upon their resources.

                            <para>- I think I shall be able to show the honorable senator that the Commonwealth has not suffered in any way in respect of my State. If we recognise this outstanding fact as being responsible, in part, at all events, for the present position of Western Australia, it will be admitted that, unless that State is prepared to cut down its area and throw on the shoulders of the Federal Government the responsibility of holding the &#39; greater portion of the western seaboard, her position will be very serious indeed. The word &#34; secession &#34; is an ugly one to any person who has regard for the national aspirations of the Commonwealth, and there never was a time when the national spirit was so strongly, in evidence&#39; as during and since the war. Australia occupies a prominent position &#39;as a nation, and, to my mind, it is unthinkable that any portion of the Commonwealth should think of cutting adrift. </para>

                            <para>- It is certainly talked of by certain people, who have convinced quite a number of others, who do not realize that it would mean either insolvency or repudiation to Western Australia. Recently, in conversation with some citizens of my State, I learned that there is a general complaint that, so far as reports of the Federal Parliament are concerned, the people only get &#39; one side. They see practically nothing in the press of what is being done in this Parliament, although, there may be column after column published of the most trivial debates in the State Parliament. Sometimes one would almost require a microscope to find any news concerning doings in the Federal Parliament. In this respect, the people are being carried away by misrepresentations, and, therefore, it is the duty of Federal members to place on record the other side of the question. I intend this evening to quote some statistics which have been compiled for me by the Commonwealth Statistician&#39;s Office and other Federal Departments, and, therefore, anything that I may have to say will have official backing and should carry some weight. One of the principal complaints in Western Australia, and one of the most frequent arguments used against Federal authorrity, is that the people are taxed to a greater extent than are the people in the other States. The very reverse of that is the truth. I propose to quote figures showing the amount of Customs and Excise taxation paid <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> in each of the States. That is the fairest way to enable us to decide whether taxpayers in Western Australia or Victoria, or any of the other States, are carrying the greater load. The following figures were compiled by the Commonwealth Statistician&#39;s Department, and are based on the Customs and Excise revenue received in each State. The records of Inter-State trade are not available. We know that since the bookkeeping clauses of the Constitution ceased to operate no record has been kept of Inter-State trade, and no doubt if we had the figures of that trade slightly different results would be shown. Both State and Federal authorities agreed that it involved unnecessary expense to continue the record of those figures. I find from the figures supplied to me showing the approximate amount of taxation paid by each taxpayer in each of the States towards the Customs and Excise revenue that the amount paid <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> in New South Wales is far and away the highest, being for last year &#163;7 ls. 8d. The <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> amount paid in Victoria is &#163;6 9s. 2d.; Queensland, &#163;3 9s. 6d., a very substantial drop; South Australia, &#163;5 10s. 3d.; Western Australia, &#163;4 15s. 3d.; Tasmania, &#163;2 <inline font-style="italic">2s.</inline> lid.; Northern Territory, &#163;1 2s. 4d. </para>

                        <para>The undermentioned figures (except those in regard to Customs duties) have now been furnished by the Commissioner of Taxation, who explains that the statistics kept do not show what portions of the income tax, the war-time profits tax, and &#39; the estate duty assessed in the Central Taxation Office are applicable to each State. The figures regarding income tax and those in the answer to question 2 are therefore approximate only. The Customs figures relate only to the duties collected in each State. The goods are not traced into the States in which they are consumed. Therefore it is not possible to say how much duty is paid by the consumers in any State. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">From those figures it will be seen that Western Australia does not now occupy the position, which it once did, as a revenue producer. At one time the State contributed very largely in duties, particularly on stimulants and narcotics, because of the relatively large male population in the early days of the goldfields, and the consequent use of those commodities to a great extent. Those days have passed away, and Western Australia &#39;is no longer paying the enormous sum in the case of- Customs and Excise duties that at one time was received from that State. Strange to say, whenever those advocating the secession of Western Australia refer to the revenue, they always quote what the State paid before Federation, as if it was still, in the heyday of its prosperity, and still contributing the percentage <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> of revenue which it paid during the boom of the goldfields days. It will appear to any reason-able person that to hark back to times past for such figures is a very childish way in which to support a case. </para>

                        <para>The amount already expended on the construction of this building (exclusive of cost of acquisition of site) is &#163;220,000, and there will be further approximate expenditure of &#163;50,000, </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">There has been considerable expenditure in other directions, such as the acquisition of sites (inclusive of the land required for the Henderson Naval Base and the General Post Office, Perth), &#163;420,000; Fremantle Military Barracks, &#163;36,000; Quarantine Stations, Albany and Fremantle, &#163;25,000 ; Military Hospitals, Fremantle, &#163;16,000: buildings, &#38;c., for Department of Repatriation, &#163;67,000. The expenditure on works, buildings, &#38;c., generally (exclusive of the foregoing), such as post-offices, drill halls, rifle ranges, &#38;c., and general repairs and furniture, amounted to &#163;762,500. The amount contributed by the Commonwealth to Western Australia <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> of the State&#39;s population, was &#163;13 4s.11d., which is above the average of the various States. </para>
                    <para>Now I wish to give details of postal expenditure in Western Australia, showing how well that State has been treated. It benefited throughout the twenty-years&#39; period, from 1901-2 to 1920-21, according to Treasury figures, as follows: - The excess of revenue oven expenditure for the whole Commonwealth was &#163;3,076,597, or 11a. 2d. per head of the population. Had Western Australia not been part of the Commonwealth it would have had to bear the loss of &#163;6 8s.10d. per head, and the other States would have enjoyed the excess of &#163;1 0s. 3d. per head of population. Instead of this, Western Australia is on the same footing as the other States participating in the excess of &#163;3,076,597, equal to11s. 2d. per head of the population. </para>
                    <para>The expenditure classified as New Works in the Treasury accounts for the twenty-year period amounted, for the whole of the Commonwealth, to &#163;12,138,562, or &#163;2 4s. per head of the population, and of that amount &#163;1,494,116 was spent in Western Australia, equal to &#163;4 9s. 2d. per head of the population. </para>
                    <para>The expenditure in other States was &#163;10,644,446, or &#163;21s. 2d. per head of the population. Therefore, Western Australia has escaped the necessity of making good a loss of &#163;2,159,177, made in that State between 1901-2 and 1920-21, in working the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department (exclusive  of  New Works expenditure). Western Australia has participated on aprorat&#226; basis in the benefits derived from a profit of &#163;5,235,774, made by the rest of Australia in working the Postal Department from 1901-2 to 1920-21. </para>
                    <para>Over the period under review &#163;1,494,116 (&#163;4 9s. 2d. per head of the population) was spent on New Works votes in Western Australia, whilst the expenditure for the rest of Australia represents &#163;21s. 2d. per head of the population. Had the same amount per head been spent in New Works in Western Australia as was spent in the rest of Australia, the New Works expenditure in the western State would have been &#163;689.898, instead of &#163;1,494,116. To summarize, Western Australia has escaped paying the loss on working the Postal Department in Western Australia of &#163;2,159.177: it has participated <inline font-style="italic">pro rat&#226;</inline> with the other States in the profit made in those States, Western Australia&#39;s share being &#163;189,138;and the amount spent on New Works in Western Australia in excess of that spent in the rest of Australia on a population basis, amounts to &#163;804,218, a total of &#163;3,150,533. </para>
                    <para>The Chief Accountant of the Postal Department has submitted the following statement of the working results in Western Australia as compared with other States, from 1901-02 to 1920-21 (as per Treasury System of Accounts) :  - </para>
                    <para>Prior to 1912-13 the accounts of this Department were not kept on a commercial basis, and the Treasury figures are the only ones available on which to show the benefit the State of Western Australia has derived, as far as the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department is concerned, through federating with the other States. In order to make this comparison, the total expenditure for the period 1901-02 to 1920-21 has been taken, and deduction made for the expenditure which is classified in the Treasury accounts as new works. Comparing the balance of the expenditure with the revenue of the Department gives the following results: - </para>

                            <para>- No doubt the Minister could add considerably to the figures I have quoted, because there are quite a number of items that I have not referred to at all. Western Australia has nothing to complain of, so far as Federal expenditure is concerned. It has certainly had a fair deal from this Government and this Parliament, and there is no occasion for .people in the western State to talk of secession. The drawbacks from which Western Australia is suffering are in no sense attributable to Commonwealth legislation. This  Parlia-ment  has no power to restore the enormous output of gold that Western Australia h,as known in the past. </para>

Various works, buildings, and railways that once produced profit and paid for losses elsewhere, are now lying idle, and represent so mush wasted capital, but we in the Federal arena are not to blame for that so much, perhaps, as is the State Parliament. We never hear any complaints, however, against the State Parliament. The figures I have quoted show that the Commonwealth Parliament has treated the western State fairly, and even generously. </para>

                    <para>A word of wholesome criticism would do no harm to those who advocate secession. Prior to the  accomplishment  of Federation there were fears expressed that the powers of the State Parliaments would be so diminished that they would not be of more importance than those of glorified municipal councils, but in, the matter of economy the States ought to see if their own Houses are in order before they find fault with the Federal authorities. About the first thing done in Western Australia on the establishment of Federation was the building of a new Parliament House, much more luxurious and expensive than the Federal authorities have ever attempted. When I enter the Parliament House in the Western State, and note the grand scale on which the building has been constructed and equipped, I feel that I belong to a very simple and modest Parliament indeed. There is certainly an opportunity for the practice of economy in that direction, and it is a matter that rests with the State authorities. It is said that when a. community wants a holiday it at once institutes a. race meeting, and it may also be said that when the Parliament in Western Australia wishes to kill time and spend money, it appoints a Royal Commission. Commissions have been set to work there on a multitude of subjects, and they seem to be getting in one another&#39;s way. There is now a Commission &#39;on the question of secession, and the evidence adduced so far is certainly not edifying. Such men as our .past Federal Treasurers, Lord Forrest, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, have been held up to ridicule. Those men have been depicted as robbers, who inflicted one injustice after another upon the State of Western Australia. We must recognise the absurdity of statements of that nature. At the gathering in Perth we had&#39; the Gilbertian spectacle of a one-time advocate of secession - of Albany in the south withdrawn from the State of Western Australia - giving evidence of this kind; and presiding over the gathering, was a gentleman who is an advocate of secession of Carnarvon in the north. If the Commonwealth ever had an economical Treasurer it was the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner. As to the late Lord Forrest, no man had a better record of service to his own State. He certainly looked after  Western Australia when he was Treasurer. I have quoted sufficient from authoritative sources to show that Western Australia has been treated even generously, and if that State has anything of which to complain, this Parliament cannot be held responsible. </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para>It may be a somewhat singular action to move in this direction, but as this measure is of great importance to the commercial community, it is advisable that the Bill should not only be circulated, but that some explanation of its provisions should be given, so that those who are particularly interested will have an opportunity of reviewing it, and will be prepared to make any representations they may wish, when the new Parliament will be able to proceed to pass it with as little delay as possible. </para>
                    <para>This is the second time this Bill has been introduced in this Chamber, and the third time it has been before the Federal Parliament. It was first introduced in 1912, by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> then Attorney-General, but was only read a first time. It made its second appearance  in 1914, when it was submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> and when it reached Committee, and was considered as far as clause 179. Since then it has undergone some change, but except in a few instances which I will deal with specifically later, not of a substantial nature. I propose, however, to discuss at this stage the main features of the Bill, and the desirableness of placing this measure on the statute-book. The power of the Commonwealth Parliament to legislate on the subject-matter of the present Bill is contained in section 51 (xvii) which gives this Parliament power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to bankruptcy and insolvency. </para>
                    <para>At the present time bankruptcy and insolvency are under State control. Each State has its own laws, &#39; which correspond in principle, more or less, with those of the others. Some, however, give greater facilities than others in the settlement of debts, without recourse to bankruptcy. For example, Victoria is the only State which has made provision on the lines of the English Deeds of Arrangement Act 1914. New South Wales has now provision for compositions or schemes without bankruptcy. It is considered that in order to make any system of bankruptcy law complete, it should include provisions for all those matters, and the present measure accordingly contains appropriate provisions. Again, in the case of bankruptcy under State law, the investing in trustees, &#38;c., of property of the bankrupt in another State is attended with great inconvenience. The bankrupt is now required to execute all the necessary conveyances, transfers, &#38;c., but under a Federal law all property of a bankrupt in the Commonwealth may Be vested in the Official Receiver or trustee by virtue of the sequestration order or the appointment of the trustee, as the case may be, and no other legal formalities are required. Again, the effect of a Federal bankruptcy law will be to obviate the necessity for considering the question of domicile in the respective States. All that will be necessary under the Bill is proof of Australian domicile or certain specified residence. </para>
                    <para>The scheme of the Bill follows closely the lines of the English Bankruptcy Act 1914, and the English Deeds of Arrangement Act 1914. Under the Bill, how over, no receiving order is made as a preliminary to bankruptcy. The course of proceedings under the Bill is, briefly, as follows: - </para>

                    <para>In addition to compositions and schemes of arrangement after sequestration, provision is also made for compositions and schemes of arrangement without bankruptcy. These provisions follow closely the provisions of the South Australian Insolvent Act 1886 and the West- - eni Australian Bankruptcy Act 1898. Provision is also included for the making of Deeds of Arrangement. The English and Victorian laws have been followed in this respect. </para>
                    <para>It is not proposed at this stage to make a detailed comparison of the provisions of the Bill with those of the English and State Acts. If necessary any. points of difference in any particular matter can be explained when the Bill* is in Committee. I mav, however, state that a concise comparative statement of the leading features of the English and State Acts, and also a table showing where similar provisions to those in the Bill may be found in the English and State Acts, have been prepared by direction of the Attorney-General and will be circulated among members. An important departure has been made in this Bill from the Bill introduced in 1914. In the 1914 Bill the clause relating to the avoidance of preferences followed the English provision, and in fact the provision of all the States except New South Wales. That provision was briefly to the effect that certain transfers, payments, &#38;c, in favour of any creditor, with a view of giving that creditor a preference, should be void. The New South Wales provision is that the transfer,. &#38;c, is void if it has the effect of giving a preference to a creditor. In the former case it would be necessary to prove the intention of the bankrupt, often a difficult matter and involving much time and expense; whereas in the latter case it is comparatively simple to prove that a creditor has, in fact, been preferred. </para>
                    <para>The provisions of the Federal law will apply to all debtors, including married women, foreigners, and persons having privilege of Parliament, and will, as regards priorities of debt&#39;s, &#38;c, bind the Crown. The Bill will not, however, apply to corporations, partnerships, associations, or societies registered under any Act of the Commonwealth, or a State which provides for the winding-up thereof. </para>
                    <para>The administration of the Federal law will be in the hands of the Attorney-General, who will have power to delegate his powers under the Bill. </para>
                    <para>The permanent officials for the purposes of the Bill will be an Inspector-  General in Bankruptcy, and such Registrars,&#34; Deputy Registrars, Official Receivers, and other officers as are necessary. For the purposes of the Bill the Commonwealth may be divided into districts (not necessarily corresponding to the States and Territories). There is to be a Registrar for each district, and such Deputy Registrars as are necessary. The Official Receivers will be the officers who will have, subject to the provisions of the Bill, control of the estates of bankrupts. One Official Receiver will, of course, deal with several estates. </para>
                    <para>The Courts on which bankruptcy jurisdiction will be conferred are such Federal Courts as Parliament creates for the purpose and such State Courts or Courts of a Territory as are specially authorized to &#39; exercise that jurisdiction. No new Courts are created by the Bill. </para>
                    <para>The Courts invested with bankruptcy jurisdiction under the Bill will have that jurisdiction throughout the Commonwealth or any specified district, and proceedings may be transferred from Court to Court or from place to- place. Any question of law arising in any bankruptcy proceedings may be referred to the High Court for its opinion. With the exception, of certain specified matters, the jurisdiction of a bankruptcy Judge may be exercised in chambers. </para>

Where a sequestration order is made against a member of a partnership the Court may authorize the trustee of the estate to commence and prosecute any action in the name of the trustee and the bankrupt&#39;s partner. Partners may take proceedings or be (proceeded against under the Bill in the name of the firm. </para>
                    <para>If a debtor dies after presentation of a petition, proceedings shall be continued as if he were alive. The Court may stay proceedings under a petition, and, when there are more respondents than one, may dismiss the petition against any one of them without prejudice to the effect of the petition as to the others. Where the bankrupt is a contractor jointly with other persons, those other persons may be sued without the joinder of the bankrupt. In proceedings under the Bill a corporation may be represented by an authorized officer, a firm by any member thereof, and a lunatic by his committee or <inline font-style="italic">curator bonis.</inline> A petition may not be withdrawn without leave of the Court. </para>
                    <para>A creditor&#39;s petition must be verified by affidavit, and must be served in the prescribed manner. The Court, if satisfied with the proof of the debt of the creditor, and the service of the petition, and of the act of bankruptcy, may make a sequestration order, and the debtor then becomes bankrupt. If the Court is not so satisfied, or is satisfied that the debtor can pay his debt&#39;s, or that an order should not be made, it may dismiss the petition. Where the debtor denies that he is indebted to the petitioner to such an amount as would justify the petitioner in presenting a petition against him the Court may stay proceedings on the petition, but may for just cause make a sequestration order on the petition of some other creditor. On the presentation of a petition the estate of the debtor will be immediately placed in the hands of an official receiver, who is required - </para>

The Court, before giving its approval, may require the bankrupt to be publicly examined, and, in any case, must hear a report of the trustee as to its terms, and as to the conduct of the bankrupt and any objections made by or on behalf of any creditor. </para>
                    <para>If the Court is of opinion that the terms of the proposal are unreasonable, or unlikely to benefit the creditors generally, it must refuse approval, and if it is of opinion that an offence against the Bill has been committed by the bankrupt, it may refuse approval. The Court will have power to annul the composition or  scheme if default is made in any payment under the composition or scheme, or if it appears to the Court that the composition or scheme cannot proceed without injustice to the creditors or the bankrupt, or that the approval of the Court was obtained by fraud. If the Court approves the composition or scheme it will have power to annul the sequestration order and vest the property in the bankrupt or some other person. The acceptance of a composition or scheme will not release any person who would not be released by an order of discharge. The provisions of the Bill as to compositions and schemes after sequestration follow the provisions of the English Act and the New South Wales, South Australian and Western Australian Acts on the same subject, and those of the Victorian Act relating to compositions and schemes without insolvency. </para>
                    <para>The provisions as to the public examination of the bankrupt are not now compulsory. The Court has a discretion which is intended to be exercised only where it is absolutely necessary in order to ascertain in full particulars of the conduct, trade, dealings, property and affairs of the bankrupt. Thus, in many cases, where the whole of these matters are clearly ascertained by the official receiver in the course of his investigations, a public examination will be unnecessary. </para>
                    <para>Further, the bankrupt is expressly charged with the duty of assisting in the administration of his estate. He must attend the first meeting of creditors and give such information as the meeting requires; deliver to the official receiver all books,&#38;c., relating to his estate; and do such other things as are required, as. provided in clause 74. </para>
                    <para>One of the acts of bankruptcy provided by the Bill is failure by the debtor to comply with the requirements of a bankruptcy notice under the Bill. Any person who has obtained final judgment against the debtor may serve a bankruptcy notice on the debtor. The notice must be in the prescribed form-, and may be served on a married woman, even though no execution can issue at law on the judgment. </para>
                    <para>If after a bankruptcy notice is served on a debtor the Court is of opinion that the debtor has absconded, or is about to abscond with a view to avoiding payment of the debt or avoiding bankruptcy proceedings, &#38;c. , the Court may order his&#34; arrest. The debtor may also be arrested if, after presentation of a petition, it appears that he is about to remove, conceal, or destroy any goods to prevent the trustee obtaining possession df them, or any books or documents which may be of use to his creditors ; also if he fails, without good cause, to attend any examination, ordered by the Court. </para>
                    <para>In addition to the examinations provided by clauses 66 and 67, the trustee or any creditor who has proved may at any time apply to the Court for the examination of the bankrupt or his wife, and any person known or suspected to have in his possession any of the estate or effects belonging to the bankrupt. </para>

                    <para>An attempt has been made to collect together in the Bill all provisions as to priorities. Clause 82 shows the actual: order of distribution of the estate, and contains references to the clauses in which provision is made for special charges or postponement of payment. In the English and State Acts the payment of wages has early priority. This is the case under the Bill, but a new exception is included as regards members of the bankrupt&#39;s family. The provisions as to priorities also apply in the case of compositions and schemes after or without sequestration, and in the case of deeds of arrangement. Special provision has been inserted in clause 120 by which the Court may, where the liabilities do not exceed &#163;300, order a larger rate of dividend to be paid to certain creditors, for example, the butcher, baker, &#38;c. </para>
                    <para>The principle of relation back, which was not contained in the 1914 Bill, has been included in this Bill. This principle is common to most systems of bankruptcy law. Under the Bill the bankruptcy will relate back to the first of the Acts of bankruptcy within three months next preceding the presentation of the bankruptcy petition. </para>
                    <para>The English Act has been followed as regards the property of the bankrupt which is divisible among his creditors. As regards property not divisible several matters have, however, been added. These include certain policies of life assurance and for annuities and endowment, goods hired under a contract of letting and hiring, and chattels, &#38;c. , in respect of which bills of sale, stock mortgages, and liens on crops and wool have been registered. </para>
                    <para>Goods against which execution has been levied or which have been attached remain, subject to the Bill, part of the property of the bankrupt divisible among his creditors, unless the execution or attachment is completed before presentation of a petition. </para>
                    <para>The usual provisions are made for the avoidance of settlements made by a bankrupt within certain specified periods before bankruptcy. Any settlement, not being in consideration of marriage, or <inline font-style="italic">bond fids</inline> for value, or a settlement made on the wife and children of the bankrupt, of property which has accrued to the settlor in right of&#34; his wife after marriage, shall., as against the trustee in bankruptcy, be absolutely void if the settlor becomes bankrupt within two years, and voidable if he becomes bankrupt within five years. </para>
                    <para>Any covenant or contract made in consideration of marriage, for the future payment of any money, or for the future settlement of any property, to or on the wife or children of the settlor, in which money or property the settlor at the date of the marriage had no interest, shall bo void if not executed at the date of bankruptcy. The persons entitled under the settlement may, however, be entitled to claim a dividend out of the estate after all other claims are satisfied. Further, all payments of money or transfers of money made in pursuance of any such contrast or covenant shall be void unless made under certain specified circumstances. </para>
                    <para>Every conveyance, &#38;c, of property, every payment made, every obligation incurred, and every judicial proceeding taken Or suffered by any person unable to pay his debts as they became due, in favour of any creditor, having the effect of giving that creditor a preference over other creditors, shall be deemed fraudulent, and be void as against the trustee in bankruptcy. The terms of the New South </para>
                    <para class="block">Wales Act have been followed in this provision in preference to those of the Acts of the other States and of England. This phrasing is considered preferable, as it will obviate the necessity for proving intention to prefer. </para>
                    <para>Certain <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> dealings with the bankrupt before sequestration are, however, protected, provided they took place without the other party knowing of any available act of bankruptcy. </para>
                    <para>Upon the appointment of a trustee, all the property of the bankrupt vests in him, and the trustee is required to take possession of all property capable of manual delivery, such as books, documents, &#38;c. As regards property of the bankrupt vested in him, the&#34; trustee has all  such  powers in relation to that property as the bankrupt would have had but for his bankruptcy. </para>
                    <para>Upon a new trustee being appointed, the property will pass from the old trustee to the new trustee.  Further, more than one trustee may be appointed, and they will then hold jointly, but, if the creditors so direct, may exercise their functions separately. The trustee will have power, subject to certain specified limitations, to disclaim any onerous property. </para>
                    <para>Generally the trustee has very wide powers of dealing with the property of the bankrupt. He may, amongst other things, for example, sell any of the property by public auction or by public tender, transfer any stock, shares in ships, &#38;c, in the same manner as the bankrupt could before bankruptcy; compromise any debt not exceeding &#163;100; and generally use his own discretion in the management of his estate and its distribution. In addition, he may, amongst other things, with the permission of the creditors or the committee of inspection, or by leave of the . Court, sell by private contract all or any of the property of the bankrupt, bring or defend actions relative to the property of the bankrupt, mortgage any part of the property of the bankrupt, and make an allowance out of the estate for the support of the bankrupt&#39;s family. </para>
                    <para>Having realized any property of the bankrupt, the trustee must then, with all convenient speed, proceed to distribute it in the manner provided by the Bill, The first dividend will ordinarily be distributed within four months after the first meeting of creditors, and subsequent dividends af intervals of not more than six months. When all, or as much as possible, of the property of the bankrupt is realized, the final dividend will be declared. The bankrupt is entitled to the surplus after all the creditors have been paid in full. </para>
