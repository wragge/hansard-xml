                            <para>- The answer is : -  1 and 2. The memorandum signed by the then Assistant Minister and the State Minister for Repatriation provided for a loan of only &#163;800,000 during last financial year. When the formal agreement, in accordance with this memorandum, was prepared and submitted to the South Australian Government for approval, they contended that an error had been made in the memorandum, and that the contemplated . loan should be for &#163;1,000,000. The Commonwealth agreed to increase the loan as requested, and continued tu advance moneys to the South Australian Government in good faith; but when the agreement was engrossed and submitted for signature, the South Australian Government held it. up for weeks, and subsequently submitted an entirely new agreement. In view of this action, it is not thought unreasonable to require the completion of the agreement before further advances are made. The new agreement submitted by the South Australian Government has been referred to the Commonwealth. Crown Law authorities. </para>

                    <para>. - I listened carefully to the reply by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearoe)</inline> to the second -reading debate, and I am sorry to say that he said so little that he was unable to remove my fear that this clause will work an injustice to country workers who, by reason of their avocation, may have to travel considerable distances while earning their living. I object <inline font-style="italic">in toto</inline> to the two provisos. The Minister hinted that there were some reasons why they should be inserted, but the only suspicion of anything I heard in the rally that took place between him and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was that something had happened at Ballarat. We have heard a good deal about double voting, impersonation, and electoral corruption at the 1913 election, but. after a Royal Commission, which had been appointed, had travelled tens of thousands of miles making inquiries into the allegations, the verdict was that not a single Australian had been found guilty of impersonation. </para>

Really the Minister has said nothing upon the point I raised, and I still see a danger to itinerant country workers through the operations of these provisos. There is no doubt that the simpler we make the approaches to the polling booth the better it will be if we wish to apply the principles of a pure Democracy. </para>

                        <para>- To me it makes confusion worse confounded; it appears to remove the need for the first proviso, and to take away from the returning officer the power given to him. I have not heard from the Minister any  sound reasons for the proposal. In the conduct of a Federal election, especially for the House of Representatives, where 40,000 electors are concerned, a case of impersonation in Melbourne, or four or five at Cairns, would not have the slightest effect on the result. No- Australian is so anxious to fulfil his duty to his country as to invite the penalties imposed by the principal Act. Such irregularities do not take place in any numbed, and I cannot see the need for such proposals, which will confuse the elector, and give the returning officer too much power. </para>

                    <para>. -  I do not understand why I should be lectured by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MacDonald</inline> because he was absent when I made my remarks on this clause. The honorable senator seems to be under a delusion about it. The clause has nothing to do with impersonation, nor has the section of the Act that this clause amends. What the amendment is intended to do is to prevent persons from voting who have ceased to live in the division for which they are enrolled and have before the commencement of a period of twenty-one days before the issue of the writ for the election, become entitled to enrolment for some other division. The reason for fixing the period of twenty-one days is to make it clear that the change of enrolment cannot take place after the issue of the writs. An elector who secured enrolment, more than twenty-one days before the issue of the writs would not be guilty of a violation of the Act. It is to prevent a number of electors concentrating on one election and influencing the result. It will not apply to a person who is temporarily absent from a division, and who intends to return to his place of residence. It will not affect an elector who is absent from a State or a division for three months for the purpose of transacting business in another State or another division. It represents an attempt to keep our rolls pure, and to prevent the chance winning of an election by the transference for that purpose of electors who have no <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> intention of living there. </para>

Sub-clause 2 is prohibitory in its nature, and the operative words are that &#34; a group of candidates shall not be formed unless each of the members of the proposed group notifies the Commonwealth Electoral Officer for the State in the prescribed manner . . . &#34; According to my interpretation of it, the result of it in its present form might easily be different from what is intended. Three men, having already decided to form a group, a fourth man, not with the object of getting into the group, but to prevent the proposed group being formed, might demand to join it. We must then have regard to the mandatory words, &#34; a group of candidates shall not be formed.&#34; The result of the fourth man proposing to go into the group of three might be that the Commonwealth Electoral Officer for the State would not be able to form a group, because the proposing parties would not have the consent of all the  proposed  parties to the group. There is nothing in the sub-clause to relieve  its  prohibitory nature. It says that under these circumstances &#34; a group of candidates shall not be formed.&#34; While the fourth man could not get into the group, he might make it incapable of being formed. </para>

                    <para>. - This ready acceptance of the amendment by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> proves that the measure, as brought in, has not been too well considered. We have a very important and radical proposal put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Garling,</inline> and it is accepted by the Minister , in a. hasty fashion. Sufficient has been said on the second reading to indicate the far-reaching importance of this innovation in our electoral system. There are. several features of the clause as it stands, and in the clause as new proposed to be amended, that should not commend themselves to us. In the first place, the object is to reduce to simplicity the method of electing candidates to this Chamber; in other words, to diminish the number of informal votes. I have a return before me. It shows that under the old system, as practised in 1917  -  that is, simple majority rule, the average number of informal votes for the whole of the States was 3 per cent. In the case of the House of Representatives, when the simple majority was still in force, the average was 1.6, or practically 1&#189; per cent. Preferential voting has since then been introduced for both Chambers, and the result has been that while there has been a very substantial increase in the informal votes in the case of the Senate, there has also been a relative increase in the case of the House of Representatives. Although we are not endeavouring to remedy the defect in regard to the House of Representatives, we are certainly trying to patch up the case in the Senate. South Australia stood at the top of the list under the old system, while New South Wales was at the bottom of the list, having the lowest percentage of informal votes. The law was altered before the last election, and I find that, although New South Wales was the most enlightened State from the point of view of correct voting when it had a small problem to deal with, it showed itself to be the most ignorant State in the Commonwealth when it had to deal with the abstruse problem, of choosing three candidates. When we changed the law in order to give the people a more effective means of expressing their will in the choice of Senate candidates - in other words, to wipe out the minority candidate - the informal votes increased from 3 to 8 per cent, in the case of this Chamber. In the other House, in 1917, with the simple majority device, the average number of informal votes for the Commonwealth represented 1&#189; per cent. Preferential voting was introduced for the other Chamber, but the informal voting increased to 3.6 per cent., sustaining me in my contention that when we introduced preferential voting for both Chambers, the same degree of ignorance - or, to water it down, let me say the same want of enlightenment - was virtually as manifest in the case of one Chamber as in the other. It is now proposed, however, to leave the other Chamber alone. While we are engaged in trying to create a simple and effective means for the electors to express themselves at the ballot-box in regard to the Senate, why is something not done in the case of the other Chamber? For the simple reason, that we cannot group the candidates for the other Chamber, because in that case it will not help in the least. The deduction from this reasoning is that when we introduced this system for the purpose of giving the electors a more perfect means of expressing their will at the ballot-box, we naturally complicated the system in a manner that the device now proposed will not cure. The amendment submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Garling</inline> bristles with difficulties. The sub-clause, in its present form, stipulates that a group of candidates shall not be formed unless certain things are done; but the amendment moved by the honorable senator provides that a group shall include the names of those candidates only who comply with certain provisions, which proposal the Minister has accepted. The position now is that a group shall only include those candidates who have submitted their names to the Commonwealth Electoral Officer for the State, and the question has been asked as to what is to keep some other candidate from claiming his right as a citizen. </para>

                <para>This is merely a dignified way of adopting the ticket system, and an endeavour has been made to create the impression that we are introducing something quite new. We had sufficient brains, originality, and initiative to discover the ballot system, which was copied by the United States of America, and we are now borrowing from that country one of their political discards. This Chamber consists of broadminded, independent men, representatives of the States, and at our own instigation we are lowering its dignity by advocating such a system. Let us imagine the humiliating position which will arise when the candidates have to be rounded up into a branding yard, and informed that they will be in A, B, or C pen, as the case may be. </para>

Since that time I have given the matter the consideration which I think it deserves, and I am more convinced than ever that the system is one which the Senate should not adopt in any circumstances. Under the Constitution, the States were given equal representation in the Senate, and the most suitable men have been selected to effectively carry on the work of this Chamber. </para>

                        <para>- On some occasions. In reading the debates I have been astonished to find that when the grouping system was last before this Chamber, the majority opposed to the proposal was so great that at the eleventh hour the Government withdrew it. Honorable senators, who in the past have done everything possible to prevent its introduction, have now turned right around and are supporting it. &#34;With <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> I am compelled to ask what is behind it all ? Have some honorable senators had a little more information or enlightenment? Or is it that there is some political move behind this Bill, and that that is what accounts for a proposal to complicate the ballot-paper and make it more difficult to understand ? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator may think so, but my experience is that the unfortunate, unthinking individual has always to pay for what lawyers regard as simplification. Those who have a right to express an opinion claim that 50 per cent. of the electors of the Commonwealth are not attached to any party ; and I contend that the choice of the electors in elections for the Senate should be wide enough to enable them to select the best men available in the different States. When the electors are called upon to choose one candidate from group &#34; A,&#34; another from group &#34; B,&#34; a third from group &#34; C,&#34; and perhaps also an independent candidate, will any honorable senator contend that this proposal is not an incentive to the electors to cast a block party vote? </para>

We know that in the Labour party there are three or four sections. There are the Industrial Workers of the World, the Australian Workers Union, the Bolsheviks, and so on ; and these are sections to whose ideals even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> will not subscribe. I regard this proposal as one of the most dangerous interferences with the ballot-box that has been submitted for our consideration. I am free to admit that, in view of- the present position of politics, a man should have the indorsement of aparty. </para>

                            knows my brand. I have already said that I am privileged to represent the intelligent electors in my State, who will have an opportunity later on of deciding whether their choice was a wise one or not. At the moment I am here as a representative of South Australia&#39;; .and, while I am not to be dictated to by any party, I am prepared to give effect to the ideals of the party of which I am a member. One of these ideals is that the Senate, being the States House, should be above all parties. That is the attitude which the Country party has always adopted. I hope that the Senate will take up a similar attitude.

The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> quoted a case in which party politics were recognised by the Crown; but the King knows no party, and never should know any party. And to use the machinery that belongs to the King for party purposes is, in my opinion, wrong. </para>

                        <para>- One would think that they came here without the indorsement of any political party, that they are here not so much because of the grace of God, the intelligence of the electors, or the fact that they were members, of  a  political party, but because of some virtue inherent in themselves. I remember the last elections very well. I remember that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilson,-</inline> as the honorable senator was then, ran as a candidate in South Australia with the brand upon him of the National party, and the brand also of the Farmers party, and the honorable senator claimed that although he was not actually a member of it, he was still such a good chap that he might also have the brand of the Labour party. He was exceedingly well branded, and carried more brands about him than any other senator who was elected to this Chamber. </para>

                        <para>- When the next election comes along at which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> is a candidate, I do not think they will be asked to vote for &#34; Wilson, the free and independent candidate, who stands hurling defiance a&#163;. all parties.&#34; They will very possibly be asked to vote for &#39; &#39; Wilson, the indorsed candidate of  the Farmers party and . the National party,&#34; and any other party that the honorable senator can induce to brand him. I always listen to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> with pleasure, but an honorable senator who is always railing so much against parties and against the attaching of party names to candidates should be consistent. We are all very glad to know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has been returned again and again to this Chamber, not because he is Patrick Lynch, but because he has been the indorsed candidate of the party that has been able to secure the greatest measure of support in Western Australia. </para>

Senators Lynch and Wilson have no objection to that. The elector will mark his ballot-paper in accordance with the &#34; how -to- vote &#34; card. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has always indorsed that. Everything is right up to that point, but the moment it is proposed that the names of candidates should be grouped together on the ballot-paper in the way provided in the Bill we are told that evil must follow. </para>

                        <para>- I know that. The proposed grouping will be of great assistance to the elector, and&#34; it should insure an intelligent vote. That is what we want. We cannot shut our eyes to the fact that parties exist. Where, then, is the harm in grouping candidates according to the parties under which they are nominated, and having their names placed in order under the group system? This principle will not remove the right of any elector to vote as he pleases, nor will it operate as an instruction that an elector must vote for the nominee of any organization. He will be entitled to vote just as he pleases, and to exercise the rights he enjoys to-day. At present, if an elector wishes to vote for all the candidates of his party he has, practically, to jump from top to bottom of the ballot paper. The first man of his choice, as the nominee of his party, may be at the top of the ballot-paper, the second may be eighth or tenth on the list, and the third may be number twenty in .alphabetical order; and as some electors suffer from extreme nervousness in the ballot-box, it is probable that they find it difficult to remember and pick out the names of all candidates for whom they wish to vote. This proposed group system is the only solution of that difficulty, and if it violates any principle of electoral justice, it certainly is news to me. I cannot see that any harm will be done by its adoption. On the contrary, I think that it will be of very great assistance to electors, and if we adopt it, I believe we shall get a truer reflex of the desires of the majority of the electors than is possible under the present system. </para>

                    <para>, - Technically, the debate may be pertinent to the issue; but actually it appears to me to be very wide of the mark. I have no desire to reflect too severely upon some of the remarks that have been made this afternoon ; but I am afraid that the debate has not carried us very far towards the elucidation of the point at issue. The question is: Will the proposed alteration in the law assist or hinder the electors? All this talk about the indorsement of candidates and control by outside bodies is quite beside the mark. If I thought for a moment that any of the existing rights of an elector were to be taken away, interfered with, or destroyed, by this proposal, I would be as hot against it as any honorable senator in this chamber. But I cannot find in it anything that will interfere with the existing electoral privileges. The proposal to group candidates aims at giving information to electors which will enable them, more easily, perhaps, to give effect to their desires, and thus to determine more definitely who shall represent them in this chamber. </para>

                    gave us some interesting information yesterday. He pointed out that the number of informal votes cast at the last Senate election was in the vicinity of 180,000. This is very important, because only a few years ago a difference of 4,000 votes one way or the other throughout Australia would have altered very materially the complexion of representation in this chamber. I- refer to the election &#39; when the Labour party carried all before them, and monopolized the seats in this House, on a majority, I think, of about 8,000 votes over nominees of the Liberal party. Because there is such a large percentage of informal votes under the existing law, surely it is the duty of the Senate to try and simplify matters ?

                        <para>- At the last election the number of informal votes cast for candidates for the House of Representatives was about 70,000, and for -this Chamber about 180,000, in the former case the invalid votes representing - about 3 per cent, of the total number of votes cast, and in the case of the Senate election about 8 per cent. Therefore it is the duty of this Parliament to simplify the system of voting as much a3 possible, in the interests, not only of the electors, but of the Commonwealth, in order that this Parliament may be truly representative of the people. Anything we can do in that direction should be done. The mistakes at the ballot-box are made, not only by illiterate electors, but also by the educated section of the community, because, in many cases, they are not close students of political problems, and so it is desirable to do what is possible to simplify the working of our electoral machinery. </para>

                    <para>. - I cannot understand why some honorable senators work themselves up into such a terrible state of indignation over such a simple proposition as the proposed grouping of candidates on the ballot-papers. There is nothing very serious about the proposal, but it will help to make our voting system clearer, and in that sense it will do a very great service. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> has remarked, mistakes are made &#39;by educated as well as by illiterate persons. I have in mind a case in point. At the first Federal election the candidate for the House of Representatives was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kirwan,</inline> the editor of the Kalgoorlie <inline font-style="italic">Miner,</inline> while I, also a resident of Kalgoorlie, was a candidate for the Senate. On one occasion the acting mayor of Kalgoorlie, a professional gentleman, and one who presided at political meetings, asked me what I thought of my chances. When I replied that I thought that I had a very good chance, he said, &#34; Look here, you are building upon false hopes. You cannot expect to beat Kirwan for &#39;the House of Representatives.&#34; This incident, I think, demonstrates that errors or mistakes are not confined to the illiterate, and as for bringing in the party machine, as has been suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson,</inline> I defy that honorable senator or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> to point out in what way the proposal will aggravate party politics. </para>

At the time I was not able to say definitely just what happened, but since then I have consulted <inline font-style="italic">Hamsard,</inline> and I find that I did not even speak in support of the proposal then, and certainly did not vote for or against it, because the Minister withdrew the Bill.

                        <para>- According to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> which I have consulted, it did not. The Minister withdrew it. In any case, the point is immaterial, and the proposal now before the Committee is not so fundamentally important that its rejection would be a terribly serious matter. I have said that I am in favour of the group system, because I think it will help to simplify the working of our electoral machinery. Of course, if there is a general desire not to clarify the operations of the electoral law, we can retain &#39; the ballot-paper in its present form. I cannot see- that there can be very much objection to the amendment. We know what the fate of independent  candidates has been. It has become a byword in Australia that the &#34;independent&#34; cannot be depended upon. That statement fits very well some of the so-called independent members that I have known. </para>

That is a necessary corollary, and a necessary inherent element in the system. The necessary increase in the numbers and percentages was practically the same for both Houses of Parliament.

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Garling&#39;s</inline> imagination must be particularly acute if he can hope to dispel the ignorance of the electors by saying that Brown is a Socialist, Smith a Nationalist, and So-and-So a Country party candidate. We are crediting the average elector with an amount of ignorance that I am sure he does not possess. It is quite plain that in single-member electorates the grouping system will not help the candidates, and proof of that contention is found in the fact that the Government (have failed to introduce it. The preferential system must of necessity involve the casting of informal votes. It is a natural element of the system by reason of its complications. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> could guarantee that the 180,000 odd informal votes would be appreciably reduced,: I would vote for the grouping system. I have to consider what is happening side by side with the necessity for reducing that vast number of informal votes. I have to consider what is going to happen to the independent candidates of this country. </para>

Surely we have not arrived at a time when we are&#39; going to so specially construct our legislation as to make it harder for the man of independent mind than for the branded man to get here. A man will be penalized for his independence. I challenge any honorable senator to deny that that will be the effect of the proposal. The Senate will not agree to it with my voice, or on my advice.

If he met men in the market-place or the public haunts of men where high politics is talked, what answer would he give to the question, &#34; What are you ? &#34; He would say, &#34; I am a member of the Federal Senate.&#34; He would be asked, &#34; Whom do you represent ? &#34; Would it occur to his mind to say, &#34; I .am a member of the National party, or a branded party&#34;? Not at all. I venture to say that his first thought would be, &#34; I represent New South Wales in the Federal Senate.&#34; Every man- jack of us would say the same. We would say that we represent the particular State from which we come. The proposal before the Senate is to put the State beneath the party status of the individual. Ought we not to be ashamed of ourselves for introducing this for the first time into our electoral legislation ? </para>

                        <para>- It was beaten in a most humiliating way last time. Are we to stain the pages of our electoral law by recognising the party system? I realize that the party system is an indispensable evil in our political life; but, while we cannot abolish it, that is no reason why we should encourage it. We shall be encouraging it if we put upon it the imprimatur, not only of Parliament, but also of the Government and the people of the Commonwealth. Consider the ballot-paper, for instance. The letters A. B. C. would be only camouflage. The system should be called by its proper name. It is the Yankee ticket system, which, as I have already said, on the authority of Viscount </para>

If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline> in reply to questions abroad, said he did not represent New South Wales, but represented the National party, he  would be asked, &#34;Who is the National party?&#34; &#34;Where do they come from?&#34; He is intending now to affix his name to a proposition that will lower the status of this Chamber. That is what I am so anxious to guard against. I do not want this Chamber to be made the brawling cockpit of political advocates or votaries. I want this Chamber to be retained true 10 name and type - a States&#39; House, composed of States&#39; representatives, without any distinctive qualifications, political or otherwise. As for independent candidates, I am afraid that we are allowing the proposal to go through too hurriedly. I asked what would become of a citizen of this country who wanted to include himself in a group, and I had the answer &#34;Yes, he could&#34; from one quarter and &#34; No &#34; from the Ministerial side of the chamber. Let us suppose that a political party selects three men, and that an attache of that party says, &#34;I wish to stand also.&#34; Suppose the fourth man wants to be included in the party, who is to be the arbitrator in his case ? </para>

                        <para>- We are getting enlightenment now. The political freedom of the fourth man will depend upon the whim or choice of the other three, who naturally want to shut out all competition with themselves. The Ministerial bench is silent; it does not answer my question; it will not speak for love nor money.I am getting advice from all round the chamber, but not frrm that quarter. Honorable senators should not be led into experimental by-paths, and be induced to adopt a rejected Yankee notion. Are we to say that in future no man of independent opinions will ever arise on the political horizon? When an independent candidate does come forward in the future, as he has done in the past, where will he find himself? </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. There is a proposal somewhere in the Bill that the names of candidates in groups are to take precedence. If, for instance, my friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> stands as an independent candidate, his name will be somewhere near the bottom of the list, because the initial letter of his surname is one of the last letters of the alphabet. But another candidate, who happens to be one of a group, may have the same initial letter, and yet find himself in the top group. </para>

                        <para>- Contrast that with the position in New South Wales, where the voter would have to choose between, perhaps, eighteen candidates. Obviously, the ballot-paper containing the larger number of names would be more confusing to the elector. There were a number of groups among the candidates in New South Wales at the last election. </para>

                        <para>- No. But it was necessary to number at least seven of them correctly. The elector had the right to vote the full ticket, and even if he had had seven correct, but had made a mistake with the fourteenth, his vote would have been informal. No comparison between Western Australia and New South Wales can be used as a reasonable argument that the proposed system would bring about more informal votes than the  existing one. I am surprised at the contemptuous manner of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> in referring to &#34;Yankee Land.&#34; It is not altogether what one would expect from a man with &#39;the dignity and intelligence of the honorable senator. I think the mighty American Republic should be referred to in language worthy of that nation and worthy of the honorable senator. </para>

                        <para>- There is no similarity. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has pointed out the inequality in the numbers of informal votes in connexion -with the elections for the Senate and House of Representatives respectively. I would remind him that in numbers of contests for the House of Representatives there are only two candidates, and the electors have only two votes to cast. I favour the grouping system, and if we accept the present proposal there will be nothing on the ballot-paper to indicate the name of any party. </para>

                        <para>- After his attack on the party system, I must assume that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> will run as an independent candidate at the next election. Owing to his intellectual qualities, this high-minded man, who is too big for parties, will be afraid . that he may be placed at the bottom of the ballot-paper. I give him this advice : He should run with another independent candidate in Western Australia, equal in intelligence and capacity to himself, but he should choose a man with the name;, preferably, of &#34; Aaron.&#34; Then I think the initial letters of &#34;Aaron &#34; would place that gentleman and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> near the top of the list. The proposed ballot-paper would simply have the letters &#34;A,&#34; &#34; B,&#34; &#34; C,&#34; &#34; D,&#34; &#38;c., for as many parties as were in the field. Certainly it would mean an alteration of the ballot-paper. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon,</inline> of course, owing to his initial being near the end of the alphabet, would find himself near the bottom of the list, but the proposal would <inline font-style="italic">da</inline> no more injury to candidates than is done under the present system. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not know of any proposed legislation that needs closer scrutiny than suggested alterations of the Electoral Act, which controls entirely the representation of the people in the two Houses. Therefore, any proposal to drastically amend the provisions of this Statute should be considered with the utmost care. Unfortunately, through no fault of my own, I was absent from the chamber during the debate on the second reading of this Bill, but since my return to Melbourne I have endeavoured to make myself acquainted with the arguments put forward by the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> who introduced the measure. The more alterations we effect in the system of voting the more difficult we. make it for the electors to record an intelligent vote at the ballot-box. Whenever ah alteration has been made, we have found that the people have been confronted with difficulties not previously experienced.- During the last election a new method was adopted in relation to the Senate elections, and people are looking forward to its continuance. It is now proposed that a ballot-paper shall contain the names of the candidates grouped in parties, although , there will be no indication on the paper as to which parties the groups represent. The explanation given by the Minister is that the grouping system will insure a more intelligent vote being recorded, but with that contention I do not agree. A great majority of electors know exactly how they intend to vote when they reach the&#39; polling booth ; but there are others who do not, and consequently they will have to rely on the daily newspapers for their guidance. The newspapers have never been behind in indicating the parties to which the different candidates belong, and the political organizations also see that every elector is furnished with a list of the candidates representing a particular organization. Consequently, everything is done to see that the elector has every opportunity of ascertaining to which party each candidate is attached, and the proposal submitted and accepted by the Minister will not make the ballot-paper  any easier to understand. But the greatest objection to the proposal is the exclusion from the groups of some candidates capable of serving their country with equal ability, and who would in all probability have gained the confidence of the people in ordinary circumstances. If they are excluded by an organization which holds a&#39; pre-selection ballot, we are not giving the electors that reasonable choice that is due to them. </para>

                        <para>- Of course not, and it means that a candidate belonging to the same organization who feels that he has as much  ability  to represent a State as any of the other candidates will not have the opportunity of being included in a group. In such circumstances, a  candidate would not be able to secure the same support from the electors as one who is in the group, because his name being on another portion of the ballot-paper will suggest that he has not been approved by the organization to which he belongs. That is not giving candidates a fair deal. The electors should be given a free choice in regard to the selection of candidates to represent them in this Chamber, and if their rights are curtailed it will not be in the interests of good government. After all, we must recognise that the electors are the masters of the situation, and we have to abide by their decisions. There is quite a number of illiterate electors, so far as political ideals are concerned, and there is also a number of educated men, business men particularly, whose political ideas are confined entirely to their own personal interests. During the last election campaign, I heard a prominent business man openly admit- that he had taken a ballot-paper and marked all the names from top to bottom, because he was heartily tired of elections. With men of that type voting, the group system will not insure the recording of intelligent votes. </para>

                    <para>- We have been driven into it, because the Labour party is organized and armed to the teeth. During my political career I have found that if I had not a strong political organization behind me I would not have been elected, particularly to the Senate. The voting for this Chamber is to a great extent on the ticket system, and to suggest that the electors know every candidate would be perfectly absurd. During&#39; my experience I have found that the electors have to be informed right up to the election day of the names of the candidates for whom they are to vote, and the womenfolk even carry the names into the booths on a slip of paper concealed in their gloves. I fought one election and was beaten, although I had splendid meetings. There were 46,000 electors in the electorate, and when the contest was over I said to my secretary, who was a particularly able man, that I must have addressed at least 20,000 of that number. He informed me, however, that he had kept a very careful note of the attendances, and that I had not addressed more than 2,000. It was somewhat depressing to realize that such a small number had taken the trouble to leave their work and amusement to hear what I had to say. Great credit is due to those who sacrifice their personal interests to serve on party committees, and who devote a good deal of time in attending meetings, studying the possibilities of candidates, and listening to dreary speeches. The grouping system which is incorporated in this measure is an excellent one, and will provide electors who do not wish to go into details with the information which they require. The organizers for the Labour party are, I think, more enthusiastic than any others. </para>

                        <para>- That is not so, and if the secret history of the Labour party were disclosed it would be found that that party has at its disposal ten times more money than we have. The supporters of Labour have always said that we have large sums of money at our command for political purposes, but those who were once in the Labour ranks and who are now on our side have changed their opinion. On one occasion I was assisted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Agar</inline> Wynne and the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Simon</inline> Fraser in collecting funds for a Victorian campaign, and we raised only &#163;5,000, which is a very small amount when compared with the millions raised by the Labour party. Naturally the Labour party won that election. But I do not. say that money had much to do with it. I do not believe that there is direct bribery on either side. Some money must be spent in the conduct of elections, and, in my view, it is the duty of a man to contribute a certain amount of money to the political organization to which he belongs in order that it may be in a position to put the political situation before the electors in such a way as to enable them to form an intelligent opinion. I do not regard the spending of money in that way as bribery and corruption. I hope that the grouping system will be adopted because it is what the electors desire, and will make matters much more simple for them on election day. </para>

                    <para>. - I have already said that I intend to vote for the grouping system as indicated in this clause. The percentages of informal votes cast at the last two elections are certainly instructive. In  1917  the percentage was  3,  and in the election of  1919  it had increased to  8.8  per cent., or nearly three times. The lower percentage in  1917  is probably accounted for by the fact that at that election the ballot-papers had to be marked with a cross in front of the name of the candidate for whom the elector intended to vote, in accordance with the practice which had been in force for a very long time. The election in  1919  was conducted on a new system of marking the ballot-papers, and probably the great  number of names that were placed in front of the electors was responsible for a great many of the informal votes. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has said that in this clause we are doing something to assist the Senate elector, and not the elector for the House of Representatives. That is so; but the elector for the House of Representatives does not require to be assisted in this way. That is proved by the figures of informal votes for elections for the two Houses. At the last election the percentage of informal votes for the House of Representatives was only 3.6, whilst the percentage for the Senate was 8.8. The system of grouping will not do an injustice to any candidate or any party, but it will help the elector in making his choice. </para>

                <para>A great deal has been said about placing the names of independents at the bottom of the ballot-paper. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has pointed out, I have, through no fault of my own, had my name appearing at the bottom of the ballot-paper at practically every election. It has seemed to me that that is hardly fair, and that if our system were not being altered as now proposed, it would have been wise to provide that candidates should ballot for the order in which&#39; their names shall appear on the ballot-paper. I hope the clause will be carried. I intend to vote for it. </para>

                    <para>. - There is one reason for the increase in the number of informal votes which so far has not been mentioned. It is possible for an elector, under the existing system, to mark a ballot-paper in such a way as to record votes for three candidates and yet&#39; record an informal vote. The elector is at present required to vote for a sufficient number of candidates to fill the vacancies to be filled, plus one. He may vote for two candidates who are subsequently returned, and give his third vote for a candidate who has no chance, and his ballot-paper is rejected as informal. I contend that the wish of the elector, as indicated by his vote, should be given effect. There are practically three separate elections in the case of an election for the Senate provided for on one ballot-paper, and the elector&#39;s votes for the candidates for whom he has voted should be regarded as formal. Ballot-papers have been rejected because of a technical informality which was not, in my opinion, a real informality. In filling the first vacancy and counting and distributing votes, it is often found that for the first two candidates there is a distinct indication of the wish of the elector. Under the old practice, if an elector distinctly marked his intention on the ballot-paper it was given effect to, and if it had been possible under the existing system to give effect in every instance to the wish indicated by the elector, a number of ballot-papers that were rejected as informal would not have been rejected, because they were perfectly valid for, perhaps, two out of three candidates.I do not yet see how the difficulty is to be overcome, but possibly the officers of the Department may be able to guide us in the matter, and in the multitude of statutory rules may suggest one that will meet the difficulty. </para>

                        <para>- I think we should meet this difficulty in some way or another, because, when the electors have indicated their preference for three candidates, they believe they have voted for three persons to fill the three vacancies, and that they have therefore done their duty. I have gone carefully through lists in South Australia, and have found that the percentage of informal votes varies in different divisions and subdivisions. It will be found that it is not ignorance nor education that determines the matter, but. where electors are most easily organized there are fewer informal votes. In my opinion it is not right that, where two men out of three receive a vote that would be valid if the election for the Senate were regarded as an election for a single electorate of the House of Representatives, they should be deprived of the votes recorded for them because of a technical informality in the indication of the voter&#39;s preference for other candidates. </para>

                    has said that the effect of this clause will be to simplify the ballot. &#39; I think that it will complicate the ballot very seriously. An honorable senator has only to put fourteen or fifteen names on a list, and group them, and he will have to admit that this proposal must complicate voting very seriously, except for those who intend to give an absolute block party vote.

                <para>In speaking previously, I said  mo3t  emphatically that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie did assist to defeat a proposal similar to this three years ago. Many other honorable senators have held a similar view until quite recently. Yesterday <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie accused me of everlastingly introducing the personal note in this Chamber. I say the honorable senator&#39;s statement was inaccurate and entirely uncalled for.. I may have, unfortunately, a forcible way of putting my arguments, but I have refrained as much as any hon.orable senator can from being personal. If, to quote what an honorable senator may have said or done on a previous occasion is to be regarded as introducing a personal matter, the limits of debate in this Chamber will be very seriously confined. An Electoral Bill was introduced in the Senate in 1919, and honorable senators will find the following at page 13443 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for 16th October of that year : - </para>

                        <para>- I shall allow other honorable senators to be the judges in this matter. I have no intention of delaying the Senate. I think I have made myself quite clear. I am opposed to the proposal, because it is a very serious step for the Senate to take. The objections raised on the former occasion stand to-day. Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> has not changed his position. This proposal will introduce party politics into the ballot-box, and attempt to force people, per medium of legislation, into one or other of two parties. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> quite properly drew attention to the position in which a fourth man might be placed if, without the indorsement of his party, he attempted to get into a team for the Senate elections, and I want to put the issue in a personal way in order to make it effective. Let us suppose, for instance, that my friends Senators Newland and Benny are candidates for the next election, and agree that they will not have me as a third man in the team. What will be my position? Are we going to allow two candidates to determine a question like that? </para>

If there is any grouping on that ballot-paper, it is the grouping of Drake-Brockman, Gorman, and Graham. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has- no&#62; objection to such grouping. It is proposed, in the Bill that the ballot-paper shall read Drake-Brockman, Lynch, Pearce, Gorman, Graham, Needham. Some of them would have the letter &#34;A&#34; in front of their names. Where is the terrible trap for the unwary elector in that arrangement ? Where is .the serious! injury? Suppose <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> were there as an independent candidate. What terrible fate would befall him?  His  fate would be that which has befallen him &#39; at practically every election.  His  name would be placed below all the other names. That, however, has been going on for years, and no one has shed tears for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon, Senator Wilson,</inline> or myself. A proposal is now put forward to get away from this accidental placing of the position of the names on the list. The accident of the first letter of his name determines the position of a candidate on the ballot-paper, but that is considered to be no injustice. Why should we humbug ourselves? We know very well that the great majority of the electors of this country want to vote for a party. It is not that they put a party above the State, but that they believe that their party is going to serve the interests of the State best. That is why it is not logical to say that because one believes in a party one is therefore against the State. If we did not consider that our party was for the advantage of the State, we would not support it. </para>

                        <para>- I will explain to the honorable senator what party influence counted for in the war&#39; Party influence stood in the way of what certain honorable senators conceived to be their duty, and they left their party; but they had no sooner left it than they saw at once that if the cause for which they stood was to survive, they must have a party to advocate and uphold it. Soon after their departure from the party which stood between them and their duty to their country, they associated themselves will&#39; a party which enabled them to express themselves with force and power in this country. It is certain that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> myself, and others who left our party at that time, conscientiously believing that to be the right course to follow, had not taken subsequent action to associate ourselves with another party, the party we had left would have had control of this country during and after the war. We cannot fight unity with disunity, nor organization with disorganization. Therefore we are only humbugging ourselves when we shut our eyes to the fact that the great bulk of the electors of this country want to express themselves through party organizations. </para>

                        <para>- My reply is the Western Australian ballot-paper. There is more reason why the names of Drake-Brockman, Lynch, and Pearce should follow each other than that Gorman and Graham should follow Drake-Brockman. They follow each other now because they happen to be accidentally the next in alphabetical sequence. In the electors&#39; eyes and the electors&#39; opinion, there is more association between Drake-Brockman, Lynch, and myself than there is between Drake-Brockman, Gorman, and Graham. Therefore, the proposal will meet the convenience of the electors, and will assist them to arrive at the judgment they desire. The arguments that have been used against the group system can be. employed with equal effect against the alphabetical system. If those arguments are sound, we ought not to continue the alphabetical system, but should ballot for positions on the ballot-paper. </para>

                    <para>. - My attitude towards this part of the Bill is that of a man who sees the necessity for clarifying the issues before the electors. This &#34;tinkering,&#34; as it has been called, with the electoral law is only a process of experimentation. &#39; We have not reached such a perfect stage that we can say we have no need for experiment. I do not agree with those honorable senators who have criticised members because they have departed to-day from the attitude they took up three years ago. They have changed their views because experience has shown that it is necessary to clarify the issues before the electors. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps the honorable senator did. I was not referring particularly to him, for more than he have referred to the attitude of others. I think I may fairly state what my experience was during the last election to indicate how essential it is that the candidates representing a certain policy should, as far as possible, be collected together, so that the electors may not make a mistake. My statement may be contradicted. I ran fourth in the final result, and was defeated. When the elections were over, the party to which I belonged had a scrutiny made of many thousands of the ballot-papers to see  whether they could find anything to indicate why Senators Cox and Duncan, who were numbered 1 and 2, and Garling, who was numbered 3, were not all elected together. They found thousands of instances in which electors voted 1 for Cox, 2 for Duncan, and 3 for Gardiner. I would not think much of that had I followed somewhere near j but the examination further disclosed that after the name of Gardiner appeared a number of names of candidates who were what we might term the &#34; also-rans.&#34; My name was finally bracketed at the bottom of the list with ex-Senators Grant and&#39; McDougall, who were the other candidates in the Labour interest. Had a few only made that mistake one would not have thought much of it, but when it is found - and I am able to support this statement by the testimony of the men who made the scrutiny - that thousands voted in that fashion, one can only come to the conclusion that the electors were not sufficiently educated regarding the personality of the candidates, and that they mistook the name of Gardiner for Garling. In instances like this we ought to do all we can to enable the electors to cast their votes as they intend to cast them. The system of grouping will in my opinion assist them. Who can say that it will give any violent twist to our electoral system, or that any attempt is being made to bring in anything pernicious? I would not vote for the proposal if I did not &#39;believe that it would be a step in the direction of clarifying the issues before the people. If it were merely a matter of party, of seeking to get a party stranglehold on the politics of this country, I would not favour it; but anything that we can do we should do to clear the issues before the electors, to make plain to them the duty before them, and to acquaint them with the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the men who have been nominated to support different issues and policies that the electors believe in. </para>

                    <para>. - I would not have spoken again but for the fact that an honorable senator placed in a false position must continue to correct statements that are incorrect until he has made his position quite clear. When speaking yesterday on the second reading of the Bill, and when referring to the grouping system, I was challenged by <inline font-weight="bold">&#39;Senator Wilson</inline> as to whether I was not responsible for the de-&#39; feat of the proposition when it was before the Senate on a previous occasion. Being challenged when I was on my feet, I could not give a definite denial, but I said I did not. think so. I could not remember whether a division had been taken, but I knew my general attitude on the question. I knew that I was in favour of grouping. I gave a qualified denial. I think most honorable senators, if not all, with the exception of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson,</inline> would have accepted my denial, but he would not accept it. Apparently be pored over it all night, and carried it about with him until he spoke again today. When he was speaking to-day I again denied the incorrect statement. That, however, did not satisfy him. He said he had read it in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and was going to make a great exposure of me. When an honorable senator conducts himself in that manner, and will not accept the statement of another honorable senator when he is wrong, it is necessary to repeat the denial. Undoubtedly he was wrong in saying that I was responsible for the defeat of the proposal. There was no division upon it. Constant repetition of a statement that is inaccurate will not&#34; raise any honorable senator in the estimation of the members of this Chamber. He refused to accept my statement that I did not vote or speak against it, or do anything to defeat it., When&#39; a public man keeps repeating an inaccurate statement, and tries to ram it down one&#39;s throat, he fails to command respect, and in future I do not intend taking notice of anything he may say. </para>

When they want to send their officers to examine the ballot-papers, they will not have so much difficulty under the proposed system. * The simple fact is that, after the election, this political organization in New South Wales had the opportunity to examine the ballot-papers. This is not the first occasion on which I have heard of the matter from an authoritative source. </para>

It is a most extraordinary piece of draftsmanship, but I cannot blame the mover, because I know the dangers associated with drafting an amendment in a hurried &#34;manner within the chamber. I ask honorable senators to study the verbiage of this provision, and endeavour to ascertain what it means. Does it mean that there are to be two classes in each group, one of which shall be obliged to notify the Electoral Officer, while the other will be informed by some mysterious means, and not called upon to notify the Electoral Officer in any way? A sub-clause drafted as this is is not creditable to the Government now fathering it or to this Chamber. </para>

I came out as an anti-Socialist candidate, and after two years of service I am asked to which party I belong. Let honorable senators ask the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gardiner)</inline> if I belong to his party. Since I have been here I have been a candid critic of the Government because it is my duty as a public man to investigate the legislation introduced; but notwithstanding my criticism, I do not think it can be said that I have failed to support their policy. Since this Bill has passed the second-reading stage, I have given its provisions very careful consideration, and have sought the advice of very reliable authorities. I ask honorable senators to consider the position under the grouping system of a candidate who has received the support of three parties. Can three parties indorse his candidature? </para>

                    <para>. -  The carrying of this clause on the authority of the statement which came from the Ministerial bench will impose another disability on candidates, as well as on the electors. It will place the fate of any man who intends to be a candidate for the Senate in the hands of three or four people. I positively object, on the part of potential candidates, as well as on the part of the electors, to such a limitation of their freedom. I am not responsible for it. The responsibility rests on the Government and the majority who vote for it. It represents another disqualification for intending candidates, and limits the choice of the electors to the selection of those who, under this provision, will have the fate of candidates in their hands. </para>

                    <para>. - This clause appears to make some attempt to regulate the procedure with regard to the lodging and forfeiture of deposits by candidates, and, therefore, it is very important, particularly to  a  candidate who may be in danger of forfeiting his deposit. Paragraph i. reproduces word for word the verbiage of the Act as it stands; but paragraph ii. deals with the position of group candidates, who, as I shall point out, are to be placed in a specially privileged position. We are providing that if a candidate other than  a  group candidate polls less than one-tenth of the average votes recorded for the successful candidates, he shall forfeit his deposit. But not  so  in the case of  a  group . candidate, because the lowest nominee of  a  group will be. assisted by the number of votes polled by the highest candidate in that group, and the number of votes credited to him will be lifted up to the average of the group. All candidates should be placed on the same level. Why this attempt to penalize the independent man? I object to the proposal, which is only additional evidence of the pernicious system which is sought to be ingrafted upon our electoral machinery. I am opposed to it from A to Z. Why should any differentiation be made between any of the candidates? The Government, having taken one false step by carrying a proposal for the group system, must now take another step by extending special privileges to candidates of  a  group. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad that, at last, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> sees the light: The second paragraph of the clause under notice is the second false step, and I want some enlightenment upon it; otherwise I shall move to have it struck out. What has the independent candidate done that he should be penalized in this way.? We have it on the best of authority, that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> himself, that he is in the Senate by virtue of the fact that, in the alphabetical arrangement of candidates&#39; names at the last election, he was placed before Sena-tor Garling; the suggestion, of course, being that the electors of New South Wales, being jaded and tired, or perhaps too full of politics, &#34; dropped their bundle,&#34; so to speak, and said, &#34;Oh, here is Gardiner. We will have him; he will do.&#34; But, of course, there is another side to that argument. and it supports what I am contending, namely, that an intelligent community will always find their man when they want him, even if he has a Hebrew character for. the first letter of his name. Unless I get some satisfactory explanation for the insertion of paragraph ii., I shall oppose it entirely, for the simple reason that if a man goes through the ordeal and becomes a candidate - and by the action of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> in supporting the group scheme it will be much more difficult in the future than it has been in the past - he should not be further penalized. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> is arguing against any forfeiture of deposits at elections. If he is in favour of that course he will not object if ballot-papers are loaded almost to any extent, and naturally he will not only vote against the clause, but should go. further, and vote the original section out of the Act, thus doing away altogether with the necessity for any deposit. We have to face the fact that political parties exist, and if there are three or four vacancies to bc filled, the respective parties will nominate candidates to fill them. It is obvious that, under , the preferential system, the electors voting the party ticket will do so in the order of their individual choice, with the result that one candidate of a group or party may get very few first preference votes, but a great many number two and number three preferences. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Garling</inline> could recite a very interesting experience of the operation of the Act as it stands, for I understand that, although he was runner up at the last election, he forfeited his deposit. The intention is to deter candidates who have no earthly chance of election from putting the country to  unnecessary expenditure merely for the sake of advertisement. I have heard of a man who did not address a solitary meeting, but, nevertheless, he submitted himself as a candidate, and got his name placed on. the ballot-paper. He did not expect to win, and, indeed, did not want to. When he was asked why he nominated, he replied that he was a barber, and that it was a good advertisement for him, as it brought him a good deal pf extra business. Parliament, in its wisdom or unwisdom, according to the view taken, has decided that in certain circumstances a candidate shall forfeit his deposit. This provision was inserted in the Act to deter people who have no earthly chance of election from nominating and putting the country to useless expenditure. The amendment does not put a person who is a member of a group at any advantage over the person who is running independently; but as the party man&#39;s vote is divided by three or four, according to the number of names on the ticket, and as he suffers by that division, it insures that the actual vote he gets shall be dealt with in precisely the same way as the actual vote of the independent candidate. The proposal made in the Bill is the only way in which we can accomplish that. It puts the group man on an equality with the independent man, but it does not give him an advantage. Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> much as he might dislike the group or the party system, would not penalize a man because he runs on a party ticket and is included in a group. </para>

An instance in support of what I say was furnished by the elections in New South Wales. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Garling,</inline> who got 300,000 votes, did actually forfeit his deposit.

                        <para>- I am glad to hear that. I thought it possible that only the powerful machines would be able to get the money back. No members of our party lost their deposits, because we knew too much about the Act. We saw the danger, and gave each candidate enough first preferences to save him. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Conroy,</inline> who ran as an independent, did not lose his deposit, but, as we all know, candidates who got hundreds of thousands of votes did. I favour the abolition of the deposit. I quite realize the inconvenience that is caused by a very large number of candidates coming forward, and that the reckless, careless man, the one who is out to advertise his business, or to make a fool of himself generally, is a very great source of annoyance. At the same time, why should an independent candidate who wants the people of this country to have an independent representative, who sees evil in the party system, and who starts out to convert half-a-million electors to his view, lose his deposit because he does not convert them, at the first attempt ? He has two powerful party machines arrayed against him. Why make him pay a penalty of &#163;25? He is honest, straightforward, everything desirable in a political contest, but because he lost, through no fault of his own, but through the lack of intelligence on the part of the electors, he is penalized. If we were to penalize the electors for nob voting for him there might be some sense in it. The system of requiring a deposit creates a property qualification. What is &#163;25 to a wealthy man who, perhaps, has no more&#39; ability than the man who is out only to advertise hi3 business? What is &#163;25 to a man with thousands of pounds a year income? He gets more than &#163;25 worth of satisfaction out of the fact that he is a candidate for Parliament. He gets all the interest that one gets when, in the real fight, and while the penalty is nothing to him, it bears heavily upon a man who has not &#163;25 to spare. If we are a free people, and if wc so frame our Electoral Acts that every elector has a right to sit in the Senate by the fact of being an elector, I can see no good reason for putting a penalty on a man whom the electors do not estimate at the same value as he estimates himself. We say that the humblest, the most uneducated, the most unfitted to exercise the franchise, may exercise it without let or hindrance. I agree with that principle; but when we come to the question of electing members of Parliament, if one does not get a sufficient number of votes, he has to pay a penalty. Could not we discover a more acceptable way of doing it even under the present Act? I think that a better system than saying that a man must get one-tenth of the winning first preferences would be to strike out all reference to first preferences, and require him to get a percentage of the votes, whether in the first, second, or third count. In the last election in New South Wales, a candidate who had 6,000 votes on the first count, and hundreds of thousands on the other counts, lost his deposit. That might occur again. It cannot occur with group candidates, but it can with others. I realize that this Bill will not get the consideration that it ought to get from the Committee, because we are acting in accordance with fixed principles that do not provide much scope for altering the Act. What is the position in regard to how members will be elected? What will be the position six months hence, when we go to the country? We shall then find the National party deep in their dugouts, well entrenched, and well supported. We shall find attacking them from the open country two organized parties, and a lot of independents. If we want to get them out, and this Bill is passed, there will be a simple way of doing it. The Country party and the Labour party will have to say, &#34; We have only to combine our votes. We have no need to ask the Labour man to vote for the Country man, or the Country man to vote for the Labour man, but we have only to say that, after giving our first preferences to our own men, we will give the second preferences of the Country party to the Labour party, and of the Labour party to the Country party.&#34; As a Labour man I say that we are prepared to do it. </para>

                        <para>- It has never been tried, but it will be tried. There are some States in which it would mean good-bye to the Country party, and some in which it would mean good-bye to the Labour party, but it is an absolute certainty that it would be good-bye everywhere to the National party. We are not wise in passing an Electoral Bill which, by the method of counting, leaves it to outside organizations to so affect the will of the people. Reverting to the question of the loss of the deposit, I say that as there are three vacancies the first, second, and third votes should all count to the candidates when it comes to a question of deciding whether they have had sufficient support to save them from forfeiting their deposits. The system of taking the three ballots as if they were separate and distinct is wrong. When this proposal was before the Chamber on a previous occasion, I opposed it. I opposed the principle of forfeiting a deposit because the electors do not sufficiently appreciate a good man. Whether he is a Nationalist, Socialist, Labour man, Independent, or anything else, it is not his fault if the electors do not vote for him, and why should he be penalized for it? I know that, particularly in an election like that for the Senate, where the constituencies are very large, and the printing bill very heavy, an unlimited number of candidates would be a serious matter; but while &#163;25 penalizes the poor man, it is no restriction on the rich man. It penalizes those without cash, and does not interfere in the slightest degree with those who have money to burn. That is not the way we should deal with people who want seats in this Chamber. Instead of shutting out competition the Senate should invite it. We want some of those splendid men of whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> spoke - those independent-minded men who are on pedestals, and will not come down to the level of party organizations. We get them here only when they are astute enough to be shining models of independence, after they are safely in their seats. Before they get here, they are very docile party men, who submit to party discipline, march in the party ranks, and keep right iu step with the party. When they are here, they will have no dictation from outside organizations. I believe that the logical thing to do is to wipe out the deposit. Its absurdity is proved by its effect at the last&#39; election. Some of the candidates who forfeited their deposits went very near winning. Having had such shocking examples of the evil of a clause of this kind, it would be better for us to wipe it out. </para>

                        <para>- I agree to a very great extent with the view pub forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> especially in regard to the differentiation that he made as to the penalty to be imposed. Under the previous clause, which provides for the group system, it would be possible for three Nationalist candidates to combine and form, a group, while another candidate who failed to get in that group would be penalized more severely, even though he might be a Nationalist also, in the event of his not receiving one-tenth of the average number of first preference votes of the successful candidates. The Minister referred to the possibility of a candidate in a group obtaining a very small percentage of the average number of first preference votes. That might be so, but the same thing would apply equally to any other candidate outside the group. No organization has ever urged the electors that No. 1 votes should be given to Brown, No. 2 to Jones, and No. 3 to Robinson. The organizations simply ask the electors to vote solidly for their particular parties. </para>

Why should the man outside of the group be penalized? If it can be shown that the two candidates are on exactly the same basis, my objection to the clause disappears. </para>

                    <para>. - The ground for the objection raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> exists only in his own mind. Take the first paragraph of the clause, which provides for a case where the total number of votes polled in a candidate&#39;s favour as first preferences is more than one-tenth of the average number of first preference votes polled by the successful candidates in the election. Suppose that I had been elected, together with Senators Cox and Duncan, at the last election. For convenience sake I shall refer to the candidates as A, B, and C. Approximately the following would have been the number of votes polled:- A, 200,000; B, 10,000 ; 0, 6,000- a total of 216,000.&#34; On dividing by three, the result is 72,000, and the unsuccessful candidate who wishes to save his deposit must poll one-tenth of that number, or 7,200 votes. Then take the second case, where the name of the candidate is included in a group. Assuming that No. 1 candidate receives 200,000 votes; No. 2, 10,000; and No. 3, 6,000, we have exactly the same total, and the unsuccessful candidate will lose his deposit only if he fails to get 7,200 votes. We really have the same position in each case. I suggest, however, that one-tenth is rather too high a proportion for the unsuccessful candidate to be required to poll, and I would prefer making it one-fifteenth. I have used figures which approximate the number of votes polled by Senators Cox and Duncan and myself in the first preference. I secured just under 6,000 first preference votes, and if a similar result were experienced at the next election and I were unsuccessful I would have to get 7,200 votes in order to save my deposit. That is a fairly large number, bub, if we made the proportion one-fifteenth, it would mean that the unsuccessful candidate would have to secure 5,000 first preference votes, or lose his deposit. </para>

                    <para>. - The example cited by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Girling</inline> was within an ace of being elected is not <inline font-style="italic">apropos</inline> of the position under this clause. I flatly dispute the statement that  a  group candidate would be placed on an equality with an independent candidate. I can show from returns from Queensland and other States that the group member is raised by thousands above the actual number of first preference votes by reason of the averaging system. While <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Garling&#39;s</inline> argument may be right in the case of New South Wales, owing to the electors not being able to distinguish between &#34;Gardiner&#34; and &#34; Garling,&#34; if the electors had voted as they should have done, and as  they did vote in the other States, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Garling</inline> would have been here instead of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> in the first instance.I have before me a  Queensland return showing that the candidates in  a  group were not placed on an equality with those not attached to  a  group, and otherwise known as independent candidates. There were six candidates in the field. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Adamson</inline> polled 144,000 first preference votes, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> 3,500, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Thomas</inline> Glasgow 16,000. Adding those votes together we get a  total of about 164,000, and that number, divided by three, gives us a sum of over 50,000. According to the records <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> received only 3,531 first preference votes; but under this proposal the figure on which the forfeiture of his deposit would be considered would be 50,000. If he had been an independent candidate, the matter would have been decided upon the actual first preference votes polled, but because he happened to be a  member of the group his total number was increased to 50,000 by dividing the total number of the first three elected candidates. </para>

                        <para>- Then let us take the case of the defeated candidates in Queensland, and it will be found that the position is the same. In the case of a group member his effective number of first preference votes is not determined by the actual number he polled, but by the average number polled in a group. In other words, the figure is reached by taking the highest, lowest, and intermediate, and dividing the result by the number of candidates in the group. </para>

                        <para>- But he was elected. Let us consider the figures of ex-Senator Ferricks, ex-Senator Turley, and ex-Senator Maughan, apart altogether from the Nationalist group. In round figures ex-Senator Turley received 4,000 first preference votes, ex-Senator Maughan 4,000, and ex-Senator Ferricks 129,000, making a total of 137.,000, which, divided by three, gives an average of over 45,000 votes for the three candidates. According to the proposed system ex-Senator Turley would receive, not 4,000, but 45,000 votes. </para>

                <para class="block">When it is a question involving the forfeiture of the deposit of a candidate in a group, the actual number of votes polled is not considered, but the average number polled. In the case of ex-Senator Turley, ex-Senator Maughan, and ex-Senator Ferricks, the . average number is 45,000, whereas if ex-Senator Turley had been an independent candidate, and had polled 4,000, his total would have been taken at 4,000, because he would not derive any benefit from the averaging of the total of the votes polled by him and his two colleagues. There is, therefore, an unreasonable discrimination between a candidate in a group and one who is standing as an independent. </para>

He claimed that there was no differentiation between a candidate outside a group and one included in a group in the forfeiture of deposits. He quoted certain figures which I shall use to show that he was quite wrong in his contention. I shall make his figures apply to Group &#34; A,&#34; which we will say represents the Labour group. </para>

                        <para>- But I shall do so to enable the honorable senator to follow me more readily. Let us assume that Group &#34; A&#34; on the ballot-paper represents three candidates nominated by the Labour party. The first candidate, who will be termed &#34;A,&#34; receives 200,000 first preference votes; candidate&#34; B &#34; receives 10,000 ; and candidate.&#34;C&#34; 6,000, making a total of 216,000 votes. The average is therefore 72,000. The next group, &#34; B,&#34; is nominated by the Nationalist party, and the first candidate D receives 150,000 first preference votes; the next candidate E 46,000; and the third candidate F 5,000, making a total of 201,000 votes. The average in that case would be 67,000. </para>

                        <para>- But you must have them. Candidate F in Group &#34;B&#34; receives 5,000 votes; but when the question of forfeiture of deposit arises, candidate F would be credited with 67,000 votes, which is the average of &#39;the group. Lower down on the ballot-paper, there may be two candidates G and H, probably representing the Nationalist party, who were not in the group; and although G gets 7,000 votes and H,say, 500 less, these two independent candidates would forfeit their deposit, while candidate F, with 5,000 votes, would not forfeit his, because he would receive the benefit of the average figures. In view of this, how can <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Garling</inline> contend that a man outside a group is in as favorable a position as one within a group? I have quoted the honorable senator&#39;s figures. </para>

For the reasons given, I oppose the clause. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like the clause to be put in paragraphs. I am in favour of the first paragraph, though, as. I have already said, I think it might be amended with advantage. Whilst retaining that paragraph, I should like to have the second paragraph rejected altogether, because I do not think it right to differentiate in the matter of liability to forfeiture of deposit between candidates in groups and independent candidates. </para>

                (Western Australia) f9.5&#93;. - In this clause we come to another gem of this exotic that ia proposed to be implanted in our legislation. The clause defines the way in which groups and the names of independent candidates shall appear on the ballot-paper. I should like to know whether it makes any provision for a possible attempt by one political party to secure the inside running as against other parties. It occurs to me that a political party may try to turn this clause to1 its own advantage at the expense of the other parties. As men who have gone through the rough and tumble of politics we can say, without being mealy-mouthed about it, that occasionally advantage is taken by political parties, but we are here to see fair play between candidates. It occurs to me that candidates whose surnames begin with the letters, A, B, or C, may be described as men of high alphabetical potentiality, and they will have a splendid chance under this Yankee innovation, which has been discarded by America, not only as individual candidates, but also, as members of a group. We have had the Gardiner and Garling Example of a community that cannot vote intelligently, notwithstanding all the money spent on education in New South Wales. That State is suggested as the exemplar for the other States of the
            </para>
            <para class="block">Commonwealth, and yet the. introduction&#39; of this Bill is itself a confession that the people of New South Wales ore unable to understand the difference between Gardiner and Garling, The theory of this clause .is that those whose .surnames begin with the first letters of the alphabet, have the best chance because of the position in which their names will appear <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> the ballot-paper. Of course, . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is an exception to this theory,&#39; because the electors of Western Australia/ went down the alphabet, and picked his name out from the bottom. But in these matters Western Australian candidates deserve, of course, to be placed in a class by themselves. The theory that underlies this innovation in our electoral law is that it is a big thing for a candidate to be -first in alphabetical &#39; order on a ballot-paper: The electors of this country are so tired and jaded that in tobogganing down the alphabet from A to Z they find themselves unable to stand the strain, and can seldom get down as low as the Vb and the W&#39;s amongst the Vardons and Wilsons. It is possible that a political party mav have amongst its candidates persons named Anderson and Absolom, and others named Vardon and Wilson, and the party will give serious consideration to the high alphabetical potentiality of those whose surnames begin with the- -letter A, in view of the way in which, under this clause,, the position of a group on the ballot-paper has to be decided: If the surname of a candidate begins with a letter far down in the alphabet, his name will be represented by a high number. If it begins with A, B, or C it will be represented by the numbers 1, 2, or 3. The numbers represented by the names of all the candidates in a group are added together, and the sum is &#34;divided by the total number of candidates. It will be seen that if there is a small dividend and a big divisor, the result will be a small quotient, and a political party by a selection of a sufficient number of candidates whose surnames begin with the&#39; letters A or B, may thus manoeuvre their group into the first position. I hope that I am as clear as one can expect to be in. an effort to explain this complex .and cryptic proposal. </para>

                        <para>- If I think it does make a difference it is because I am guided by the reasoning,  of  the men who induced the Government to put forward this proposal. As I have said, the theory is that  Voters  become brain weary before they can <inline font-style="italic">go</inline> down the full list of candidates, and, as they did in New South Wales, they vote for Gardiner when they desire  to  vote for Garling, because the voting power of New South Wales was shown to be in favour of Garling rather than of Gardiner. In none of the other States would such a thing occur, because the  electors  oast their votes intelligently,, with tie result that for the time being all the Nationalist candidates in those States were returned. As both Senators Gardiner and Garling are here now, probably neither will dispute the truth of what I have said. I have drawn attention to the possibilities, and I do not know whether the Government have in mind any proposal to meet the situation. </para>

                <para class="block">It is my intention to submit an amendment, which, to some extent, . strikes  at  the principle of the group system. I  have  already stated that I only support the  system if it is  going to clarify the policies of parties and <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of candidates in the eyes of the electors. I cannot see how clarification will be achieved by simply placing an alphabetical &#39;letter against the name of a candidate. Frankly, the group system is going to be a group of parties or organizations, and  it  should be our duty to make  it  clear that  we  go before the electors as candidates of particular parties or organizations. I fail to see how this  will  be achieved by designating the groups with the letters &#34; A,&#34; &#34; B,&#34; &#34; C,&#34; and so on. The marking of ballot-papers  in  this  way  was, I believe, designed to meet possible, criticism against the introduction of the party system,&#39; but  as  criticism has already been directed at . the Bill on the ground that it will exalt the party system, why not be frank, and provide for candidates&#39; names to appear on the ballot-paper as the nominees of the National party, Progressive party, the Labour party, or any other party which can exist as a political organization? The use of the letters of the alphabet is simply a lame way of hiding the fact that candidates are seeking election as party men. Having stated my attitude, I move - </para>

At  present  I fail to see any objection. I have already heard an argument against it to-day, but I cannot see the force of it, having regard to the fact that what I am aiming at, and what the Bill intends to provide for, is to make clear to the electors what the various groups in the field are there for. </para>
