                        a member of the South Australian Parliament, made the statement that he was passing through Melbourne one day at the end of last week, and called at Federal Parliament House. According to the report of this speech he claims to have done a certain amount of logrolling, and as a result was very pleased to be able to inform the South Australian Parliament that the Public Works Committee would probably recommend that the Commonwealth Government should construct a line from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs. I wish to state that the Public Works Committee had completed their inquiry into this work a week previous to.

The only way in which the Commonwealth Government is concerned in the voluntary wheat pools is that it has agreed to guarantee the Commonwealth Bank to the extent of any advances which it may be decided to make to the wheat pools at the rate of 3s. 8d. per bushel, the extra 8d. to cover all handling charges be-, twecn the railway siding and the ship in respect of all wheat delivered to a voluntary pool for the season 1922-23, and it has no power to fix the price, at which -wheat is to be sold locally. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire, first of all, to direct attention to the aggregate balance-sheet of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. It is desirable, in the interests of the country, that the figures of the balance-sheet of the Bank should be placed before the people, because they are the owners of the Bank. According to the balance-sheet, the total assets of the Commonwealth Bank amount to &#163;86,995,780 9s. It -has occurred to me that it would probably be interesting to know how this enormous amount of the people&#39;s money is being utilized. The small array of figures supplied in the aggregate balance-sheet of the Bank is all the information which the public are given on the subject. I find that, in the enumeration of the assets, coin, bullion, and cash balances represent &#163;6,145,318 12s. 8d. It is obvious that the Bank must keep a considerable amount of coin on hand, and that item of the balance-sheet is readily understood. The amount represented by Australian notes is &#163;8,047,213. The amount on short call in London is &#163;19,325,000. I believe that at present a great deal of that money might be much better employed in Australia than in London. Until recently there was an advantageous market in London for the employment of money on short call, but that market has completely collapsed, and the sooner a great deal of the money which the Commonwealth Bank has at short call in London is brought back to Australia to help Australian industries and enterprise the better for this country. I find that there is ah amount of &#163;25,179,15618s.1d. representing &#34; Investments, British, Colonial, and Government securities.&#34; It seems to me that that&#39; is an extraordinary amount of money to have in such investments. I thought at first glance that the words &#34; Government securities &#34; must cover Commonwealth Government securities, but the next line of the balance-sheet shows that the amount invested in the Commonwealth Government securities is &#163;9,696,564 16s. 2d. We may assume, I think, that the words &#34; Colonial securities &#34; cover investments with the State Governments, but just what is covered by the words &#34;British, Colonial, and Government securities.&#34; I do not know. </para>

                            <para>- I should think they would come under the heading of &#34; Colonial securities.&#34; We are left to guess, and the people have no idea how their money, amounting to nearly &#163;87,000,000, is being invested. There are fixed deposits in other banks amounting to &#163;929,000. That is quite <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> and legitimate, and that money is being used to assist industries generally in Australia. &#34;Bills receivable in London and remittances in transit&#34; are shown as amounting to &#163;2,212,175 12s. 2d. That is also an ordinary Australian practice. &#34;Bills discounted, loans and advances to customers, and other sums due to the bank.&#34; total &#163;14,459,387 14s. 5d. That refers to direct loans to municipalities, local governing bodies, and private individuals. We can say, therefore, . that only about &#163;17,000,000 out of nearly &#163;87,000,000 is really used in Australia, so far as I can gather from the figures, after having been over them several times. That does not seem to me to be a legitimate use of the money that is collected and utilized by the Commonwealth Bank. A great deal more of its money ought to  be invested in mercantile work in Australia. The private banks,&#34; owing to various circumstances, have had quite enough to do. In our great industries labour has had to be paid, and there has been nothing coming in at all. If the Commonwealth Bank uses only &#163;17,000,000 out of nearly &#163;87,000,000, it shows that a great deal of Australian money is not being devoted to the assistance of Australian enterprise. I thought I would bring the matter before Parliament to see if more information could be obtained. </para>

                    <para>The profit and loss account consists of three lines. On the credit side the profits for the half-year are shown at &#163;208,932 12s. 8d. That amount, according to the charter of the Bank, is divided between the reserve fund and the redemption fund, each receiving &#163;104,466 6s. 4d. The Commonwealth Bank pays no taxation, whereas the New Zealand Government have received over &#163;3,000,000 from its bank in that way. The Bank charges high rates for advances, and the Government have been much worse off from that point of view than if there had been no Commonwealth Bank at all. I hope that the Government will see that the charter of the Bank is altered, so that the people shall have some say as to how this large sum of money, nearly &#163;87,000,000, is to be utilized. Year after year enormous rates are charged, and the Government never receive one shilling in taxation. If it were not for that fact, it might be possible to reduce income taxation to the extent pf ls. in the &#163;1. </para>

                            <para>- If the Commonwealth Bank had to pay taxation, as an ordinary bank does, it would result in several million pounds being paid into the Federal Treasury. The present arrangement has existed for nine years, and the Government have never had any assistance in this direction. I have done my duty in having called attention to the position -for the second time. It is becoming obvious that something ought to be done. </para>

                    <para>An important feature in regard to private banks is the fact that behind .the directors are the shareholders, who are individually anxious to see that those banks are well managed. In the case of the Commonwealth Bank, the people are the shareholders; and what does the Bank bother about the people? It produces a balance-sheet consisting of thirty or forty lines, and that is all we are told of its workings. That is decidedly wrong. I suggest that the Government should try to absorb some small bank or some large bank, and then they would get, not only a good directorate, but there would be shareholders at the back of them, and the result would be that the management of the institution would be thoroughly watched. Even to appoint three directors in the place of the one director now employed would .not altogether meet the case. Three directors would be quite independent, and they would have to deal with a Treasurer who would be up to his neck in other work. If the Government absorbed another bank, on the same lines as the Amalgamated Wireless Company has been absorbed, they would have the advantage of shareholders taking an interest in the Bank&#39;s management. </para>

                            <para>- The Government have not wiped out the shareholders in the Wireless Company. We should keep the shareholder who has the actual personal stake in the Bank. If there were a number of shareholders who were personally interested, they would attend meetings, and take the trouble to see that the Bank was run on open lines. The balance-sheet of the Commonwealth Bank may be quite satisfactory, but I object to the lack of information in it. I am accustomed to reading balance-sheets, but I cannot understand what is meant by &#34; Government securities.&#34; Are they Argentine, Russian, or Chinese securities? Shareholders would soon find out what they were, and why the sum of &#163;19,000,000 was kept in London. They would want to know why so much money was invested outside of Australia, and why only &#163;17,000,000 was invested in trading and municipal enterprises in the Commonwealth. </para>

As I have already said, those who are really the shareholders in the Commonwealth Bank should have a voice in its  management, as has been provided in connexion with the Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, which company has, to some extent, been absorbed by the Government. Although we have a controlling interest in that company, there are outside shareholders who will naturally do their best to see that the undertaking is effectively and economically managed. </para>

                    <para>I have taken a good deal of interest lately in freights ruling between Australia and other countries, and have made an effort to get them, reduced. The shipping companies) complain .that freights are high because the port and other charges imposed are excessive. In perusing the figures, I find that &#163;166,638 was expended last year in connexion with lighthouse services, and, as this amount is contributed by the shipping companies, the freights charged have necessarily to be increased to meet that expenditure. The State authorities also impose charges, which, are passed on by the shipping companies to the primary producers and others who have to export their products. The number of lighthouses around the coast is comparatively small considering ou|r extensive coastline, and a certain amount of expenditure is, of course, justified. . </para>

The health of the community must be carefully protected ; but it has always been understood that, under the Constitution, the Commonwealth was to intervene only in the event of an epidemic extending beyond the limits of one State. Personally, I do not care whether the matter is under the control of the Commonwealth or State authorities ; but there should be no overlapping, involving needless expenditure. It has been suggested that a Royal Commission should be appointed to inquire into our Health Department. </para>

But it is the duty of the Government, as the custodian of the people&#39;s money, to see that the work performed is necessary, and that the expenditure is not excessive. I think I have shown the necessity of some investigation being made to ascertain if the estimated expenditure is necessary, and if the present overlapping could not be avoided. </para>

It is not possible for me to answer his question, because, as every parliamentarian knows, the Budget, accompanied by the Appropriation Bill, is the last measure that the House of Representatives will allow to pass from its hands. The honorable senator has had many opportunities of discussing the Budget-papers, and he has not availed himself of them with avidity. I have not seen any one killed in the wild rush to discuss them. I am unable to say when the other House will pass the Appropriation Bill, and, therefore, I cannot say when it will be here. </para>

                <para class="block">I think honorable members will agree that this Bill invites discussion in Committee rather than on the second reading. The bulkiness of it is accounted for because it is a consolidating as well as an amending measure. There are eight Income Tax Assessment Acts on the statute-book, and the Bill represents an effort to bring them within the limits of one Act. It might have been thought that it would have been better to bring forward the proposed amendments apart from the consolidation of the existing Acts. Had that course been followed - and I admit it is the usual course- it would have been extremely difficult for  honorable senators to see the effect of the proposed amendments. They would have found it necessary, in certain cases, to refer to the whole of the eight Acts to see where the amendments fitted in, and what their effect would be. The Government thought it better to bring down a consolidating Bill and include in it the amendments. In the main the measure consists of consolidating provisions, but there are a limited number of amendments to the existing law. I propose, briefly, to outline these amendments, leaving the more detailed discussion of them to the Committee stage of the Bill. I may say, in passing, that most of the provisions in the Bill are founded on the report of the TaxationCommission, which, for many months, inquired into the subject of taxation in the Commonwealth. </para>
                <para>The first proposal to which I shall refer is that which provides for the introduction of what is called the averaging system in relation to incomes which are taxable. There are many schemes which come under the heading of averaging, and after considering the merits of them all, the Royal Commission made a recommendation which, practically, is embodied in the Bill with, however, one proviso. The Commission&#39;s &#39; recommendation was that there should be an averaging of the rate, the taxpayer paying upon his income for the year, but at a rate determined on the basis of an average of five years. The Government attached a proviso to cover cases where it is obvious that the averaging system would adversely affect the taxpayer with a falling income. The man with a falling income would certainly be adversely affected by the averaging system, whether the averaging was of the rate or the income, although he would be affected in a somewhat different degree. It is proposed, whilst applying the averaging system, that it shall not affect any taxpayer whose income is falling, until such time as his income commences to rise, when it will immediately operate. </para>

                        <para>- I can. say, in regard to this or any other measure, that I have never discovered a means by which we can legislate to give absolute mathematical equity to every one. We cannot follow the thing to too fine a point, and, even if we could, the system would become so complicated that no . one would know where he stood. The averaging system is already in operation in Australia as applied to one special tax, and there appears to be no reason why we should have two systems in vogue, one for one class of taxpayer, and another for another class. Therefore, it is proposed to apply to all taxpayers the system which is now in operation for primary producers. </para>

                            <para>- I can do it without much hesitation or preparation. It is an advantage, I submit, to men with fluctuating incomes to know that, as with rental and other charges, they have to meet a fixed obligation; It is equally an advantage to the&#39; Treasurer to know that his income is fairly constant. Once we get into the swing of the averaging system the Treasurer&#39;s income will tend to an equilibrium. It will, no doubt, rise and fall  somewhat, but probably not to the extent that it does now. </para>

                    <para>The next provision of the Bill to which I desire to direct attention is the proposal relating to the valuation of live stock. Honorable senators will recollect that there was a considerable outcry some time ago with regard to this matter, and to meet it a reduction was made in the fixed prices at which live stock should be taken into account. It is now proposed that the taxpayer shall, within, a maximum and minimum figure, be allowed to fix his own valuation, but once having fixed it, he will be required to adhere to it. The House of Representatives has accepted an amendment which / seems to provide another option. I am not at all certain that it will be either workable or advantageous, but it is in the Bill as sent to this Chamber. </para>
                    <para>The Bill also makes an alteration in regard to the method of valuing trading stock. It offers the option to the trader of taking his stock into account at cost, market value, or replacement value. </para>

                    <para>The Bill does not propose to make any alteration in regard to the taxation of companies. The present system follows the dividends distributed by companies into the hands of shareholding recipients, and levies upon them according to the rate which the individual taxpayer pays. In this case, the Government&#39;s view of the matter is supported by the finding of the Royal Commission. Many people are, perhaps, attracted by the simplicity of the alternative system of levying solely upon the company, and are inclined, I think, to overlook the inequity of that system. &#34;Under it, the man receiving a small income would be called upon to pay in excess of the amount for which he was liable, whilst the man with the bigger income might escape the burden thrown upon the shoulders of the man with the smaller income. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, they are to be taxed. Another matter affecting companies is in regard to the &#39;section of the Act which places in the hands of the &#39;Commissioner power to interpose when he thinks that a reasonable proportion of profits has not been distributed to the shareholders. The present law has been found to be seriously defective in that it does not carry out what Parliament intended should be done. Let me illustrate what I mean by saying that if the profits distributed by a company amounted to 50 per cent., and the &#39;Commissioner thought that 60 per cent, was a fair and reasonable proportion to distribute, he could interfere, but a legal decision holds that if his view was upheld he would be bound to levy a tax upon the whole of the profits. That was not thought to be the wish of Parliament, and Parliament is now to be afforded an opportunity of altering the law. This Bill provides that if a company distributes two-thirds of its profits no questions will be asked, but if it distributes less than the proportion the Commissioner will have power to interpose and require the company to demonstrate that the proportion distributed in relation to capital is a fair and reasonable one. If the case goes against the company, and if it is held that it has not distributed a reasonable proportion, the extra tax collectable will be levied, not upon the whole of the profits, but upon that amount which it is decided would be a fair and reasonable distribution. </para>

It is a question as to who should be taxed - the shareholder who had not received the dividend or the company which had retained it. The existing law says that the tax should be paid by the shareholder who has not received the dividend, but this Bill proposes to tax the company that retains the dividend, and I think this will be regarded as a considerable improvement on the existing law. </para>

It has been held that when a man sells his whole business concern, lock, stock, and barrel, no matter what profit he may have made on the deal, he is not taxable. I have been in this position myself, though certainly it was before the days when Federal income taxation commenced to trouble us. I took up an area of grazing country, stocked it with a small number of stock, and for four or five years allowed natural increase to remain undisturbed. Then I sold out on a walk-in-walk-out basis. As the law now stands, I would not have been taxable on the profit I made on that deal, because my returns would have shown no annual profits; but under this Bill it is proposed that profits made in that way shall be subject to tax, and I venture to suggest1 that  this  is an eminently fair and reasonable proposition. </para>
                    <para>Another important provision - I say this unhesitatingly - affecting a large number of taxpayers is the decision&#39; to raise the limit of exemption to &#163;200.&#39; I should like to say, with regard to this provision, that it will relieve about 200,000 taxpayers of the necessity of furnishing returns, and that the loss in revenue to the Government will be about &#163;600,000; but it is obvious that as these returns are furnished in the main by the smaller taxpayers of the Commonwealth, the saving in administration costs, including clerical work, will be considerable. </para>

                            <para>- I think it arises from the fact that superannuation payments are regarded as a means by which the poorer members of a community may be enabled to make provision for their old age, whereas life assurance is, I think, regarded as a means of thrift practised more by those who are in more comfortable circumstances. It is quite obvious that there was an inequality in the law which allowed a man receiving &#163;1,500 a year in salary to get the benefit of the exemption, because he was included under the heading of a wage-earner. </para>

The Government proposal does ease the burdens of many taxpayers. If it were possible, nothing would give me greater pleasure than to move for the repeal of income-tax legislation altogether. </para>

It is the desire of the Government to make the taxation burdens fall as lightly upon the people as possible, and, whilst honorable senators could no doubt suggest many ways in which the load could be further lightened, I am entitled to ask them to regard this measure as a whole, and not to be led into the belief that we could widen its provisions without endangering . the financial proposals of the Government. </para>

I am reminded that one reason why the provision with regard to exempting superannuation payments does not also include&#39; life assurance premiums is that contributions to superannuation funds are, as a rule, compulsory, whereas life assurance is optional. No doubt that was the reason why the originators of the income-tax legislation had in mind when this legislation was introduced about seven years ago. </para>

                            <para>- I can only remind the honorable senator that there is cm the statute-book a law which he helped to pass, and which fixes the exemption at &#163;50. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell,</inline> I might personally appreciate a higher exemption myself, but I think the proposal in this Bill is not unfair. </para>

                            <para>- That may be said of every tax. Another clause of the Bill deals with calls of mining companies. Only a slight alteration of the existing law is proposed; but I direct the attention of honorable senators who are concerned with the interests of the mining industry to clause 16 <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> (ii). Yet another proposal is to enable! losses made in one business to be deducted&#34; from any source of income otherwise obtained. Under the existing law a taxpayer may deduct losses in one business from profits made in another business in -which he is engaged; but ibis Bill proposes to permit losses in any business to be deducted from any other income, irrespective of the source from which it is obtained. </para>

                    <para>The Bill contains a provision to reduce the present inequality of taxation on partnerships, on the one hand, and individual companies, on the other. Under the existing law a company pays the company rate on the proportion of profits retained in its business, whilst the individual pays tax on the whole of his profits, whether he puts them again into his business or not, and as the individual rate is higher than the company rate he is penalized to that extent. Provision is contained in the Bill to permit in the case of individual companies 15per cent, profits being taxable at the company rate if left in the business. The intention is to remedy an existing provision of the law which is regarded as unfair, and this Bill will put individual and partnership companies on the one footing, and, therefore, the consent of honorable senators to the provision can be readily relied upon. </para>
                    <para>There is another proposal which is more one of form than of substance. It deals with the limit of time within which it is possible to amend assessments. Under the existing law the Commissioner has power to give time for- the amendment of assessments, and in practice, with the approval of the Treasurer, he. has limited the time to three years. That is not a statutory limitation, and this Bill provides that it shall be the statutory limit except where fraud is suspected. </para>
                    <para>It has been found desirable to provide for the exemption from payment of the tax of certain visitors. Honorable senators will remember that Australia received an advertisement which was not of a flattering character, when some time ago an attempt was made to collect income tax from certain journalists who travelled out here with the Prince of Wales. That at- &#39; tempt was strictly legal, but it is now sought under this Bill to provide for exemption from payment of the tax in &#34;the case of visitors of that kind the members of visiting cricket teams, and those who come out here on what in Continental countries would be called diplomatic missions. </para>
                    <para>An. important alteration of the existing law is proposed to deal with cases of fraud, because though in many cases no reasonable man could doubt the committal of fraud, it. has been found in practice extremely difficult for the Department to secure a conviction. The reason for this is that the information upon which a conviction could be secured remains in the possession of the accused&#39; person. To meat this difficulty it is proposed, on the advice of the Solicitor-General, to include in this Bill a provision, taken from the Customs Act, under which the averment of the prosecutor stands unless refuted. That would mean, that in such- a case as I have indicated, where the taxation authorities have reason to believe that fraud has been committed, they will be able to make the averment, and the accused person will be called upon to disprove it. Under the existing law, in such a case, the Department has to call upon the accused person for the evidence, which he alone possesses, in order to prove its case. </para>

                        has availed himself of opportunities to make allegations against people. We have to consider the real position. The Department knows that it is being defrauded, and the papers and evidence necessary to prove that are locked up in the safe of the man it accuses. It is proposed in this Bill to permit the Department to say to such aman,.
                        <inline font-style="italic">&#34;You</inline>
                        are committing a fraud, and that allegation must stand unless you go in the box and produce papers or evidence &#163;o disprove it.&#34; If that course is not followed, an accused person will not subject himself to cross-examination, and will not produce papers or evidence. The result in such cases is, under the existing law, that although the taxation authorities have- the clearest knowledge that fraud has been committed, they are unable to secure a conviction.

                            <para>- There are many things in this world about which we are quite certain, although we cannot prove them. This provision is not novel. As I have said, it is in operation under the &#39;Customs Act. When it was first proposed to include it in that measure, I am not sure that I was not one who took the startled view of the matter that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> has taken, and was alarmed at such a departure from the good old British tradition. </para>

                            <para>- No. I have mounted in experience. I wa3 disposed at that time to consider that the proposal represented the letting go of one of the sheet-anchors of the Constitution, and I am not certain that I did not, in a feeble way, attempt to sketch some of the dire results which would follow. No such results have followed the operation of the provision in the Customs Act, but, on the contrary, because of it, some very useful work has been done in the interests of common honesty. I commend the proposal to the Senate for the reasons I have set out. </para>

                            <para>- The living wage is &#163;4 per week,- and there are many men earning that wage who are raising three and four children. If it cost them &#163;1 per week for each child the man and his wife would have nothing left to live on. It is easy for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> to say that the amount allowed should be &#163;1 per week for each child, but it would be just as easy for me to say that the honorable senator is hard-hearted, and . that the amount ought to be 30s. There must be some reason in these matters. Governments do not levy taxation because they want to do so. The community must find the revenue necessary to carry on the government of the country; and in easing the taxpayers the Government have gone as far as they can in this Bill. </para>

                        <para>.- This clause deals with the individuals, companies, and associations who have to pay income tax. I regret that I missed an opportunity on the definition clause to direct the attention of the Committee to a matter of some importance. There are organizations and associations established in Australia, not with a view to making a profit, but with a view to engaging in certain forms of snort, recreation, and instruction. These organizations have hitherto been subject to income tax. I refer especially to bands, bowling clubs, and institutions of that kind. A case was brought under my notice some time ago where a number of men who had combined to establish a band in a certain district had made a small profit in one year. Notwithstanding the fact that they had heavy engagements to meet from previous years, they had to pay income tax on the profit they made. In the same way an association of bowlers was called upon to pay income tax at the rate of &#34;2s. 8d. in the &#163;1, which applies to companies and associations, although they had incurred heavy losses in previous years. I have only bad the Bill in my hands for a few minutes. </para>

                        <para>-This is the first time that the averaging system has been applied to taxpayers generally. It is quite novel in that sense, and, perhaps, not readily understandable at the first glance. I call attention to sub-clause 4, which, says that the first average year shall not be earlier than the year beginning on the 1st July, 1920. Does that mean that for the financial year commencing on the 1st July, 1922, the average is to be ascertained by taking the average for the two years only? The supposition is that we are averaging for five years. </para>

In other words, it does not apply to the case of a man whose income is derived from property or investments. Will the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> make it clear whether I am right or wrong in drawing that conclusion? I do not see why a distinction should be made, because losses are just as likely to arise in the case of a man who is dependent on his investments - in such enterprises as mining or ordinary commercial undertakings as in the case of a man who derives his income from the carrying on of a business. </para>

                            <para>- Another point is that, notwithstanding the fact that an explanatory memorandum has been circulated showing the difference between the Income Tax Assessment Act and the present Bill, it would appear from sub-clause 6 that the losses that a man may make in carrying on his business are not to be taken into account in averaging his income for taxation purposes. I should certainly gather from sub-clause 6 that the losses made in a number of years are not to be added together and then deducted from the total income so as to arrive at the average income over that period. But in the first of the examples circulated, given under, the heading &#34; Business incomes,&#34; we find that the  average is to commence with the first year showing a loss, and that that loss is to be taken into consideration with,_ say, the next year&#39;s loss, and the next two years&#39; profits; but I gather from subclause 6 that that is not intended. Will the Minister make it clear whether we are giving the taxpayer as much consideration as the examples distributed appear to indicate ? </para>

                        <para>.- Sub-clause 6 deals with the case of a taxpayer who is carrying on business, and during anyone year in the averaging period of five years does not earn a taxable income. Why is it that allowance is not to be made for the year in which the income does not reach the exemption level ? I take it that the averaging system has been adopted to grant relief to taxpayers who in certain years suffer hardship as the result of decreased income. Take the case of the man in receipt of a small income, who receives, perhaps, only &#163;30 or &#163;40 above the exemption figure. If he were out of employment for six months of the yean, his income would be reduced below the exemption, level, and that man should be permitted to include that year&#39;s income in arriving at the average over the five years&#39; period. Otherwise the man on a small income would reap very little advantage from the averaging principle. </para>

                            <para>- This Bill ought to have been circulated long ago; but it was distributed less than a fortnight ago. When I received a copy I spent the greater part of two days upon it; but to what extent it was altered in another place we did not know until it reached this Chamber. We are dealing with a very important principle, and <inline font-style="italic">primd facie,</inline> it seems to be of very great advantage to the taxpayer; but we are not sure upon that point. The proposal might be &#34; loaded &#34; for all we know. I have not had time to read this clause through carefully yet. Sub-clause 6 begins: &#34;Any year in which the taxpayer was not carrying on business.&#34; The word &#34; business &#34; is defined as including <inline font-style="italic">&#34;any</inline> profession, trade, vocation, or calling.&#34; There may be other . means of employing one&#39;s time, and acquiring income, that might come under, the term &#34; business.&#34; It is not a question merely of receiving no taxable income, but of not receiving taxable income, and also in the same year not carrying on business. If we are to confer the privilege of averaging we should take such a year into consideration. Two matters are jumbled up in this sub-clause. It commences: &#34; Any year in which the taxpayer was not carrying on business, and was not in receipt of a taxable income, shall not be counted as an average year.&#34; I have read the memorandum on the Bill very carefully, but I think it is somewhat out of line now, on account of the alterations made in another place. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foil&#39;s</inline> point seems to be that if a man has not received an income in any one year which in ordinary circumstances would be below the taxable amount, that income should be taken into consideration in estimating the average. </para>

                            <para>- A man may be physically or mentally incapable of conducting his business. A professional man may be suffering from over-strain and ordered by his medical adviser to leave his work for many months, and I should think, in such cases, the income for that year, however small, should be calculated in averaging the income over a period of five years. There are numerous cases in which men are not carrying on business for the whole or portion of a year owing to circumstances entirely beyond their control. I know of instances where men have been ordered to leave their work, and have been compelled to borrow money to get away and restore their health.. Their medical advisers have said, &#34;What is the use of saying you have not the ready cash? If you do not go, you will die.&#34; Diminished incomes during such periods should be calculated in averaging the income over a period of years. I do not think it is fair, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foil&#39;s</inline> criticism of the clause should be met by some amendment. It is, however, practically impossible to deal with the matter fully and accurately in such a hurried way. </para>

Does it mean that a man must be physically carrying on business, and in receipt of a taxable income? I- hardly think . the provision is intended to go to &#39;that extent. </para>

I submit, therefore, that the statement that &#39;this Bill has now been brought under the notice of honorable senators for the first time is unjustified. I admit that the measure is complicated, but, curiously enough, the provisions we are now discussing - with the exception of the exemptions and the averaging system. - have been the law for years. Honorable senators are doubtless aware that this is a consolidating measure, and they cannot say that it is the first time the bulk of the provisions have been brought under their notice, and that it is unfair for the Government to ask the Committee to proceed to discuss it now. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable senators know the state of business, and are doubtless as anxious as I am to get on with the- Bill. If it is considered necessary to postpone the consideration of certain clauses I am prepared to agree to such a suggestion; but it must be admitted that as many of the provisions have been law for years there is no justification for debating them at this juncture. I do not know if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Garling</inline> is anxious that this clause should be postponed. </para>

                        <para>. -  I can quite agree with the statement of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> that this is a consolidating measure, . and as such I welcome it. There are, however, several clauses which are new, and as amendments have been made in another place since the Bill was first circulated we should have sufficient time in which to consider them.  I  fully expected that the debate on the second reading would have been continued after the Minister had concluded his second reading speech, and as I was at the time engaged here at the table in other parliamentary work  I  did not have the opportunity of speaking to the motion. Had I done so,  I  would have referred to the fact that in the main this is a consolidating measure. But clause 13 introduces a new principle, and I sincerely trust that provision has been made for a genuine averaging system. The criticism offered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. Foll</inline> seems to suggest that sub-clause 6 is not what we have a right to anticipate, because lean years should be taken with the good ones in arriving at an average. I agree with the Minister that there is no necessity to discuss many of the clauses, as they have been the law  foT  some time; but before the measure leaves this Chamber the point raised by the honorable senator should be cleared up. </para>

                            <para>-  I cannot follow the clause as&#39; it is worded. I am not only concerned with the position of professional men, but am thinking of the smaller taxpayers who, owing to some misfortune in one particular year, may not be able to bring their incomes up to the taxable rate, in which, case they would not receive the benefit of the averaging system. They could not include a year in which their incomes were below the taxable rate. As there appears to be considerable difference of opinion concerning the clause, I trust the Minister will agree to its postponement. </para>

I gather that the Government has at last succeeded in pleasing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> at one and the same time, and if it has never done anything else, that is an achievement of some moment. The Bill is the annual measure for imposing the rates of income tax. The schedule to the Bill sets out the rates of tax on the various, classes of income.  The rates are based, as in all previous years, upon the scales of rates imposed by the original Income Tax Act of 1915. The super taxes subsequently imposed on those rates, aggregating slightly over 70 per eent., have been reduced by the Bill. The Bill gives effect to the Government&#39;s decision to reduce the rates of income tax all round by 10 per cent. It does so by reducing the combined super-taxes to 53&#189; per cent., and proportionate reductions, as nearly as possible, have been made in the rates on - </para>

Those are briefly the provisions of the measure, which, I believe, will find ready acceptance at the hands of honorable senators. </para>

                        <para>. - I intended to address the Senate very briefly on the measure with which the Committee was dealing a few moments ago, and I do not think that my remarks will be altogether out of order in connexion with the Bill we are now discussing. I should regret very much if they happened to be out of order, and I will try to make them in order by alluding to the rates of income tax. I do not suppose that. I can discuss the question of general assessment, or the effect of taxation upon industries in too general a way, but I wish to emphasize my view that, in regard to one industry, the rate of tax should be of the most nominal kind. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, in addressing himself to the Budget last evening, alluded to the decadent state of the mining industry in Australia. The mining industry differs from all other Australian industries, and I think it may be said that, without exception, it has been most valuable in regard to Australian settlement, and yet it cannot be compared with any industry which can be reconstituted. Mining deals with a wasting asset, and it is true that never in the history of the exploitation of Australian resources has the mining industry been so depressed as it is at present. It is in a decadent condition; prospecting has practically ceased, and if you approach a capitalist and ask him to invest any money in a . mining venture, he will look at you as if you contemplated a robbery. There must be in Australia a multiplicity of latent mining resources. There must be many fine fields yet to be discovered. Seeing that mining enterprise, if not altogether dead, is nevertheless languishing, any Administration which wishes this continent to progress and to see revivified the spirit of enterprise which was manifested two decades ago, and at an early stage in Australian development, should take into consideration the question of relieving the mining industry of its disabilities. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that very, very nominal rates of income tax should be levied on incomes derived from the exploitation of the mineral resources of this continent. I will not further transgress in respect to the Standing Orders. My remarks particularly refer to metalliferous mining, which differs in its incidence and in the erratic nature of the deposition of ores from all other kinds of mining. It differs from coalmining and from oil-mining. I think that only a nominal rate should be imposed upon incomes that may be fortuitously derived from metalliferous mining, because metalliferous ores are a wasting asset which can never be restored. </para>

                        <para>. -  During the second reading, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> you referred to metalliferous mining as being something in the nature of a gamble. I quite agree with that point of view. The position of the mining industry has been seriously jeopardized by the heavy burden placed upon it under the Tariff, and, if possible, we should now undo some of the harm then done. Unless we can do something to ease the burden on the industry in my State, there will be little prospect of the financial position of Western Australia improving in the near future. Recently we had a statement as to the position in Tasmania under the Commonwealth. If the people of Western Australia had come to this Parliament seeking relief from the enormous burden placed upon the mining industry in the Tariff, and owing to the reduction of the&#62; gold output, we would have been able to put forward a very good case indeed. I do not know in just what way relief may be afforded under this measure, but I feel that something should be done. At present there are only a few good mines in operation in Western Australia. </para>

                            <para>- This  clause refers to the tax on prizes in lotteries, and, undoubtedly, metalliferous mining, and especially gold mining, is a highly speculative enterprise, or gamble; &#39;at the present time. &#39; However, if I am out of order I shall have to resume my seat, but  I hope something will be done in the near future to afford relief. </para>

                    <para>SenatorFOLL (Queensland) &#91;5.21&#93;. - This . clause deals with the &#39;taxation of prizes won in lotteries, and I think this is a suitable occasion to expose the inconsistency of the Government in regard to sweepstakes and lotteries generally. The Postmaster-General&#39;s Department, as has been said times out of number, declares it to be illegal for remittances to Tattersall&#39;s, in Tasmania, to be carried through the post, but if a person happens to be fortunate enough to win a prize, the Government regard the amount as income, and take their proportion of it by way of taxation. The clause also aims at the Golden Casket lottery, in Queensland, organized for the benefit of Queensland hospitals. I am not going to deal with the merits or demerits of that method of raising money for charitable purposes. It is a debatable question. Nevertheless, money is raised in that manner in Queensland, and the Federal Government levy a tax of 12&#189; per cent, upon prize winners, whilst other art unions conducted anywhere, provided the prizes do not take the form of negotiable bonds or other negotiable instruments, to quote the language of the clause, are not affected at all. I do not altogether object to the holding of art unions, provided they are for a good purpose, but I think it would be far better if the necessary revenue for the maintenance of hospitals were raised by direct taxation. </para>

I want to direct attention to the inconsistency of the Government in attempting to discourage people from subscribing toTattersall&#39;s sweep and the Golden Casket lottery, in . Queensland, and then levying a tax of 12&#189; per cent, on the prize winners. </para>

                            <para>- Then there is every reason Why the honorable senator should support the clause. The thing he really objects to is the provision in the Post and Telegraph Act, passed many years ago, preventing the carrying of letters through the post to certain institutions. If we levy a tax on a man who works hard for &#163;250 or &#163;300 a year, surely we should also place a tax upon another man who may be fortunate enough to win &#163;1,000, or the value of that attractive &#34;gold brick&#34; which is offered in Queensland ? Here is a proposal to levy a tax on certain cash prizes. I fail to see how the honorable gentleman or any other honorable senator can object to it. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> feels that there is something wrong with the Post and Telegraph Act, the proper course is to take action to amend it. </para>

                <para>My reason for this amendment is that it has been the practice since the decision of the High Court in Western Australia to treat all &#34;walk-in-walk-out&#34; sales of leasehold as capital. If a man sells a freehold it is capital, undoubtedly, and I can see no difference between selling a leasehold and selling a freehold. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> will see that profits made on the sale of mining leases are exempted from taxation under this clause, and profit on the sale of a freehold is exempt from taxation. I cannot see &#39;why a man making a profit, on the sale of a leasehold should be taxed. I have tried to grasp the reason for taxing such a profit, because I must admit that the Treasurer has met us in every possible way. The Bill represents a monument of studious effort on the part of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> to meet taxpayers in every way he could. Still, this is a matter which requires some further attention. If we consider the cattle industry at the present time, no one can doubt that leaseholders of grazing properties, particularly in Queensland, are in a most deplorable position. If one of them sells his pastoral  lease and makes a profit on it, he is taxed upon that profit, but if he makes a loss on the sale he is not permitted to deduct that loss from his income. My amendment would put the matter on an equitable basis. Leaseholders have been harshly treated under this provision. They have had tremendous struggles to keep going, and I cannot see why they should be treated differently from other leaseholders. Many of them have spent a great deal of money on the improvement of their leases, and they get very little consideration for their improvements. Under the Queensland law a fence is supposed to have lost its value entirely in fourteen years. I should like to hear what the Minister has to say on the question, but I believe that Crown lessees can make out a perfectly good case for such an exemption from taxation as I propose, where they make a <inline font-style="italic">bona fide &#34;</inline> walk-in-walk-out &#34; sale of their leases. I quite understand that we could not permit trafficking in the sale of leases and allow deductions in those cases. A man who makes a business of buying and selling leases as a speculator would not be entitled to the benefit of the exemption I propose, but where a man buys a leasehold for <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> pastoral or agricultural occupation, and on selling it again makes a profit in the ordinary course of his business, that profit should not be taxable. I do not see why a man who takes up a leasehold for pastoral or agricultural purposes should be placed in a different category in this regard from a man who buys a freehold to use for the same purpose. </para>

                    <para>. - The explanation is a very simple one, and one which will appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn.</inline> The reason why the differentiation is made is that the leaseholder is granted an allowance for amortization.  If  he has a twenty years&#39; lease, he is allowed to deduct a certain amount each year, and at the end of twenty years those sums would amount to the full value of his lease. He cannot have &#39;it both ways. Having been allowed what is practically the purchase price of his leasehold, he is in such a position at the end of that period that the lease has cost him nothing. </para>

                    <para>. -  I am sure the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> need not take umbrage at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> - Brockman&#39;s suggestion that this provision is incorrect in its present form. In the Bill originally circulated this proviso came immediately under the word &#34; or;&#34; which is on the bottom1 line of sub-paragraph ii of subclause <inline font-style="italic">e,</inline> and that naturally led to confusion, and the belief that that proviso applied only to what we might term paragraph ii of sub-clause <inline font-style="italic">e.</inline> The mere fact that the draftsman or the printer moved the word &#34; provided &#34; one inch into the margin does not overcome the fact that the word &#34; paragraph &#34; has been wrongly used. What is being dealt with is in subclause <inline font-style="italic">e</inline> of clause 16, to  which these words are a proviso. It is not a proviso to paragraph ii of sub-clause <inline font-style="italic">e,</inline> but intended to &#39;be a proviso to sub-clause e of clause 16. If the Minister will agree to amend the paragraph to make it a sub-  paragraph of the sub-clause it will cover the point mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman,</inline> and will not lead to any confusion, which naturally follows from connecting the proviso with paragraph ii of sub-clause <inline font-style="italic">e.</inline> The proviso in its present form&#39; is not sense, and as it is worded conveys the impression that the proviso will govern that sub-paragraph, instead of that relating to the first paragraph of the sub-clause. </para>

A little earlier in the day we had a very pronounced  declaration from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap,</inline> who urged very strongly that the mining industry should be placed in a separate category because of the special disabilities and handicaps attaching to it.

                        <para>- That might be considered from the stand -point of putting an additional tax on freehold land, but the proposal now is to exempt from taxation leasehold lands used for pastoral purposes. The Government cannot accept the amendment, and I do not think it ought to be inserted in the Bill. To say that there is an element of risk in the grazing industry in Australia, is to say what we all know to be true. &#39; Many members of this Senate have taken those chances, but, on the whole, the industry is not of the same speculative nature as mining. There is a degree of difference in the element of chance that enters into it. I can see no reason why the man who makes a profit from the sale of a lease and who, having been allowed to recoup himself year after year for the proportion of the purchase money he paid for the lease, should not be charged on the profit. </para>

                    <para>.- The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> has not given his support, or the support of the Government, to the amendment because, he says, a pastoral lease is not in the same class as a mining lease. He has said that mining is under a cloud. I do not suppose, however, that there is any more .disastrous state of affairs in the Commonwealth at the present time than that which exists in the cattle industry. </para>

A leasehold has always been regarded as part of a man&#39;s capital, and I cannot see why . it should be separated from his ordinary capital. A freehold is not separated in this way, and why should a leasehold be ? If a poor fellow makes a profit on the sale of his lease, he is taxed; but if he owns a freehold, which goes on for ever, he is not taxed. </para>

                        <para>- Because it is his capital. When he buys a lease on a &#34; walk-in-walk-out &#34; basis, he pays for a going concern, which consists of so much leasehold land, so much stock, and so much, improvement. Those have always been treated as his capital, and the High Court held that they were capital. Suddenly, I cannot understand why, we propose that a man who possesses a leasehold shall be told, if &#39;he sells it, that some part of it is income. A case similar to this was before the Queensland Parliament some time ago, and the members  there  thought it so inequitable that they amended it. A leasehold in Queensland is now treated as capital, and not as income. The Bill is an endeavour on the part of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> to meet the taxpayers in every way he can. but in the clause under discussion I think there must have been an oversight. I cannot see why a leaseholder, even if. he is allowed to write off a part of his lease as an expiring asset, should be required to separate his lease from his  other capital. </para>

                    <para>. - If a man should buy <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> freehold property, say, for &#163;10,000, hold it for a few years, and sell it for &#163;15,000, the difference between &#163;10;000 and &#163;15,000 is not subject to taxation unless he is a land jobber; but if he should purchase a leasehold property for which he pays &#163;10,000, and which he subsequently sells at &#163;15,000, he pays taxation on &#163;5,000. The sum of &#163;5,000 as regarded as an accretion of capital in the case of the freehold, but under the Bill it would not be regarded as an accretion of capital in the case of a leasehold. All the amendment aims at is to place freehold and leasehold properties on the same footing. Personally, I cannot see why that should not be done. Suppose there are two men both engaged in the pastoral industry. One of them goes on a block of land which is freehold, and the ether takes a block which is leasehold. In some parts of Australia a man cannot acquire freehold. That is the Commonwealth policy with regard to the Northern Territory, and in the State of Queensland he cannot acquire freehold  from  the Government. Yet it is proposed to place men who are compelled to take leasehold&#39; in a worse position than men in Victoria who can acquire freehold. </para>

Why should a man, who, from choice or compulsion, it does not matter which, carries on a pastoral, business on a leasehold, be in a worse position from the point of view of taxation than a man who carries on an identical business, on identical land, and makes identical profits, on a freehold ?

                        <para>- It may be an argument for levying a tax on freehold, but why treat leasehold and freehold differently? If the argument is strong for granting an exemption to a freeholder, it is still stronger, in my  opinion, for granting an exemption to a leaseholder. The profit on a sale would be an accretion of capital in both cases. Why should it be an accretion of capital in respect of a freehold, and not in respect of a leasehold? </para>

The clause, therefore, would only apply to a minority of leaseholders. If we adopt the amendment and put leaseholders and freeholders on the same footing,, we would be compelled to withdraw the provision which enables them to deduct a sum every year for depreciation. They cannot be allowed to have the benefit both ways. </para>

                        <para>- I think it is in section 25. Let us assume, for the purpose of argument, that a freeholder and leaseholder respectively invest &#163;10,000 in a property, &#39;and realize at &#163;15,000,, the profit in each case being &#163;5,000. In the case of a leasehold there would be a rebate allowable of &#163;1,000 a year for the depreciation of his lease, the holder of the lease in this way recouping himself for the whole cost of the lease; but in the case of the freeholder there would be no deduction. If this amendment is carried, the leaseholder will still expect a rebate or exemption equivalent to the depreciation of the lease. It is obvious, however, that he cannot have it both ways. He cannot expect to be treated as a lessee and also as a freeholder when he comes to realize on the lease. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> admitted that the majority of the leaseholders are not men who sell at a profit. Therefore only a small minority would, in any case, experience any benefit under this amendment. If the adoption of this amendment means, as I contend it ought to mean, the death of the present system under which leaseholders are allowed to make annual deductions, the majority, say 75 per cent., of the leaseholders, would lose what benefit they now get, in order that 25 per cent, of the leaseholders may be allowed a refund in the case of a sale. Leaseholders who do not sell at a profit would lose the benefits of the present Act. </para>

                    <para>. - If the Minister&#39;s premises were sound his argument would be an excellent one, and I would be found voting with him. Unfortunately for him, they, are not sound. He has put up a very plausible plea for the retention of the clause based on the claim that leaseholders are allowed an annual deduction in respect of depreciation in the value of their leases. That ia perfectly correct and just. It should be so. But let us go back to the beginning of things. A freeholder at the end of any taxing period is still a freeholder. He has the property, whereas a leaseholder at the end of his period has nothing. </para>

                        <para>- That is because the freeholder at the end of his period has the full value of his property, whereas the leaseholder has nothing. We ask by this amendment that the freeholder and the leaseholder, in respect of sales, should be placed on the same footing. If the leaseholder sells his lease, and makes a profit, he should be in the same -position as a freeholder who sells his freehold at a profit. In other words, the profit accruing to the lessee, as well as to the freeholder, who sells, should be regarded as an accretion to capital. There is the whole position in a nutshell. </para>

The bulk of the land available and suitable for leasehold, purposes in New South Wales, Queensland, and in my own State is already taken up by various lessees, &#39; so evidently the idea which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> has in mind is notapplicable. </para>

                    <para>. -  This is a very interesting subject, and while the discussion throws little additional light upon it it increases one&#39;s anxiety to know more about the proposal. As I understand the matter, the Bill proposes to tax the profit of a lessee on the sale of his lease. That means that that profit is regarded as income and not as capital. I take the case of a lease for which the lessee in the first instance pays nothing. He proceeds to) improve his lease by expending money on water conservation, the sinking of wells, the making of roads, the building of sheds, and so on. Then he has to stock the lease. The stock are regarded as tangible assets. Let us assume that his lease runs for thirty years. At the expiration of that term the lease would be worth nothing to him. All he would have would be the residual value of the improvements he had made plus the value of his tangible assets. If after his lease had run for fifteen years a man came along and desired to purchase the lease, is the lessee on selling it to be held liable to taxation for all he receives in excess of the residual value of his improvements plus his tangible assets? If since his taking up the lease it has acquired an added value, the Department, in my opinion, does wrong to tax the leaseholder on that value, because that increment of value is added to the leasehold only in the same way that an increment of value may be added to a freehold. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> reminds us that a lessee is given an allowance annually, but that is only in respect of improvements and in proportion to the unexpired term of his lease. </para>

                        <para>- If during his occupancy of a lease it acquires a value over and above the value of the improvements made upon it plus the value of the tangible assets, then by all rules of ordinary experience and of natural, justice the owner of the lease is entitled to that added value. It is the property of the lessee and of no one else, and when the lease changes hands by way of sale that increment of value should not be taxed as income. The Government propose that it should be taxable as income. The question we have to consider is whether that is fair or just. I can understand a lessee selling out at a loss. Many leases have been sold for much less than the tangible assets plus the value of the improvements. There is nothing for the Taxation Department to levy on in such cases, and I say that where there is an added value to a lease by natural justice it should be regarded&#39; as the property of the leaseholder. Why should it be regarded as income liable to taxation when in the case of a freehold an added value is regarded as capital, and is not liable to taxation ? </para>

                        <para>- The decision of the High Court in the Western Australian case exempted leaseholders from this taxation. It is suggested that  a   leaseholder is given a great concession in being permitted to write off a certain amount for each year of his lease. If, for instance, a man pays &#163;10,000 for  a  lease of ten years, he is allowed each year to write off &#163;1,000.  His  improvements or machinery for carrying on his business wear out, and something has to be allowed for depreciation. As the term of his lease becomes shorter, it is of less value. In the circumstances, the allowance to which the Minister has referred cannot be regarded as a concession. It is a mere matter of justice that the leaseholder should be able to write off so much each year as the term of his lease runs out. The Minister has said that the men on the land are a grasping lot, but what the Government are giving them under this Bill is an extra tax. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister has said that the more we give the men on the land the more they want, and he was referring to the fact that the land tax on leaseholds had not been enforced. I should like to give the Committee the history of the land tax on leaseholds. Some members of this Parliament who are now on our side were members of the Labour party supporting the Government that imposed that tax. I get information from all kinds of people. There are seventy-five members in another place. At the Caucus meeting of the Labour party the decision to tax&#39; leaseholds was carried by a very small majority. There were forty-six members of the Caucus, twenty-four voted one way, and twenty-two against the taxation of leaseholds. When the matter came up for consideration in the House, we had only about thirty members, and if twenty of the Caucus members who had voted against the taxation of leaseholds had voted with us, the vote would have been fifty to twenty-six against the proposal. Instead of that, the Caucus members voted solidly together, and&#39; the vote on the proposal was forty-six to about thirty. That shows how absolutely unjust that tax was originally. It has not been imposed because it was based on the freehold value. The value of a leasehold was assessed in that way, and the provision was found to be absolutely ridiculous. I knew of one lease that would have been sold for less than the tax on it amounted to. Rack rents such as caused all the disturbance, in Ireland were to be allowed for, and in Queensland, where the big leases are, the Government took every shilling they could get. </para>

                    <para>. - I think it does not matter to honorable senators whether this is a new . provision or not. This is a consolidating measure, and comes before us as a new Bill. I had no hand in the passing of any former Bill of the kind which recognised the right to tax as income the profits referred to here. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> stated the matter clearly, and I propose only to deal with an interjection made by the Minister in charge of the Bill. I ask honorable senators not to assume that, because the Minister&#39;s view has been expressed in such strong terms, the provision means exactly what he himself believes it does. Clause 25 provides that a deduction shall not, in any case, be made in respect of any wastage or depreciation of lease, or in respect of any loss occasioned by the expiration of any lease, provided that, where it is proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that any taxpayer (being the lessee under a lease or the assignee or transferee of a lease) has paid any fine, premium, or foregift, or consideration in the nature of a fine, premium, or foregift for a lease or a renewal of a, lease, the Commissioner may allow the deduction set out in the clause. </para>

                        <para>- A fine, foregift, or premium is that premium or sum of money that is often paid, such as on the transfer of a hotel licence. This clause cuts down the deduction mentioned by the Minister to a mythical sum in the case of the transfer of pastoral properties. There is no deduction at all that honorable senators have to take into consideration in dealing with this matter, and they should not be led away by the statement that a man cannot have it both ways. Fines, premiums, and foregifts very rarely, if ever, come into consideration in the case of the transfer of pastoral properties. Let me give a simple illustration of the difference between leasehold and freehold and how respective holders will be affected by this Bill. On tha Mildura side of the River Murray the orchards are all held under freehold, whereas on the Curlwa side of the river the properties are leasehold. It does not matter to the Mildura man what profit he makes out of the sale of his freehold, but the leaseholder on the other side of the river who sells out has to include in his income any payment received by him- upon the assignment or transfer of his leasehold property, -less - what never happens in these cases - any fine, premium, or foregift, or any amount paid by the lessee for assignment or transfer of the lease. </para>

                        <para>- It is proposed to exempt pastoralists on leasehold property from being assessable in respect of such receipts. There is a subsequent provision that in respect of premiums, fines, or foregifts it shall be competent for the lessee to deduct every year the total amount so paid, divided by the number of years for which he is entitled to the holding. The words used are the same in both cases. If there is any equity in the amendment, I do not think it goes far enough, because there are not only pastoral lessees who have to pay on obtaining a lease, but there are people in metropolitan districts who have to pay very large sums in order to obtain the transfer of, say, hotel leases. Sometimes as much as &#163;10,000 and even more has to be paid for the balance of a current lease. Sometimes large residences are leased and converted into apartment houses or flats, and when the leases change hands substantial sums are paid for the good-will. Surely cases of that kind should be treated as analogous to the transfer of pastoral leases. The amendment would result in invidious distinctions. </para>

I do not intend to support a measure under which such men will be taxed in the manner suggested, particularly when returned soldier settlers, amongst others, are placed at a disadvantage in consequence of the different policies which are in operation in other States. </para>

                    <para>. - I want to reiterate, in spite of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Garling</inline> has said, that my presentation of the case was a perfectly correct one. My contention was that a man was allowed a rebate in each year in respect of a proportion of the amount paid for leasehold land. If he did not pay anything, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Thomas</inline> Glasgow interjected, he would not be entitled to any allowance. But if he had paid something for good-will he would be entitled &#34; to deduct in his income tax return each year an amount representing that sum, which would be arrived at by dividing the total amount he had paid over the number of years during which he had held his lease. </para>

                    <para>.- I am very glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> has mentioned this matter, as the amendment sought to be introduced . in sub-paragraph ii of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> is very important, and one which is likely to have a serious effect upon the trading and manufacturing community. Under the existing Act, a manufacturer or trader makes up his income tax return after taking stock of the goods in his warehouse or manufactory. In taking stock, the ordinary practice would be to take that portion which had depreciated since he purchased it at what he considered to be its real value, and the balance of the stock at actual cost price. Although the chance of moving an amendment on this point has been lost, those who agree with me may be able to make out a sufficiently good case to secure a recommittal of the Bill. I have explained the ordinary methods of taking stock, so that a manufacturer  or trader can make up his income tax return accurately. Now it is proposed that a trader., in making up a return, shall estimate the whole of his stock at cost price. </para>

                    <para>. - I cannot recall a provision in the Act which is more elastic and more favorable to the taxpayer than this clause. It says to a trader, &#34; You shall have the option, with regard to your stocks, of returning them either at cost, at the market selling value, or the replacement value of each article.&#34; This does not mean that he must select one of these methods and apply it to the whole of his stock. If he had &#163;1,000 worth of stock which had depreciated, he would return it at cost, but if it had appreciated he would, no doubt, exercise the option given to him under the clause. In this way skilful merchants, like my friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline> would soon be able to see what a great concession is given to them in the clause. </para>

                    <para>. - I would suggest to the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> that, in view of the great shortage of houses in all the capital cities, some modification of paragraph / is called for. This provides that if a man builds a house, and thus assists to relieve the house shortage, he shall be at once met with an impost- of &#34; 5 per centum of the capital value of land and improvements thereon owned and used or used rent free by the taxpayer for the purpose of residence or enjoyment.&#34; Every one who, at present, builds a house is faced with the probability, upon the return of normal conditions, of a very severe loss in his capital, and on top of that he has to submit to this impost. In view of the necessity for relieving the shortage of houses, every encouragement should be given to persons to exercise thrift and provide themselves with homes of their own. A good way of accomplishing that would be to delete the- clause. </para>

                    <para>. - The question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> goes back to times gone by. Senators who were members of this Chamber when the first Income Tax Bill made its appearance, will remember the battle royal which raged on this point. There has been a lot of discussion on it, and it is quite easy to say, &#34; Encourage men to build their own homes.&#34; It seems to me that the proposal in the Bill is entirely equitable. Take the case of two men, each with &#163;3,000. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott,</inline> with &#163;3,000, would proceed to buy a house. The- sum of &#163;3,000 would, indeed, be modest for such a house as he would desire, but let us suppose that he invests &#163;3,000 in a house. I put &#163;3,000 into a farm, which is a working proposition. I am taxed on the income which I make out of the farm. I might put my money into an investment and get 6 per cent., or &#163;180 a year, and I would be taxed on that. I need a house to live in, but no allowance is made for what I pay as rent. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott,</inline> however, by becoming his own landlord, thinks he should escape- paying a tax on what is, unundoubtedly, the interest he receives for his money. It is true that he does not receive the interest in cash, but he is his own landlord. He does not receive . &#163;180 return for his capital, but if he rented a house to live in he would have to pay that sum for it. I can see no reason why a man who puts his money into a house in which he lives should not pay the same tax as a man who builds a house which he rents to another. This provision has been in operation for a long time, and I ask the Committee not to alter it. </para>

                    <para>. - This clause represents a complete departure from the very equitable system that has been followed in the Department for a considerable time. I refer to sub-clause 4 <inline font-style="italic">(a),</inline> which deals with live stock, and reads as follows: - </para>
                </talk.start>
                <quote>
                    <para>The expression &#34; trading stock &#34; does not include live stock, which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, are ordinarily , used as beasts of burden, or for breeding purposes. </para>
                    <para class="block">The present practice is to exempt from the operations of the tax, in the event of the sale of a property as a going concern, the normal nock and to treat as income so much of the sale proceeds as represents the average value of the stock that has been sold from year to year by the pastoralist while carrying on the property as a going concern. In the event of a complete sale of the business as a going concern, or on its winding up, the rest of the stock are treated as the normal flock or capital, and rightly so. I submit that any other method of dealing with this matter is &#39;altogether inequitable. Therefore, very strong reasons should be given by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> before we make such a complete departure from the established practice. An attempt has been made during the last couple of years, in the case of the resumption of pastoral properties in New South Wales, for the purpose of soldier settlement, and in the case of the sale of station properties in Western Australia, as well as in a number of other cases, to treat the whole of the proceeds of the stock at the time of sale as though it were part of the income and not as realization of capital. The position is clearly stated in a decision in a case in which Robert Newman, a Western Australian pastoralist, appealed against an assessment bv the Commissioner of Taxation. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Newman</inline> carried on business as a pastoralist and sold his property, including the live stock and plant as a going concern. The Commissioner of Taxation for that State made an apportionment of the purchase money in respect of the live stock, and assessed the vendor on that amount as income derived from the carrying on of the business. The case came on appeal before the Supreme Court in Western Australia from the Lower Court, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Burnside, in giving judgment for the pastoralist, used these words - </para>
                    <para>The appellant contends that where a business is sold as a going concern the resulting price is capital, and I think he is right. Income is something that recurs, that comes at intervals that may be annual or at lesser periods of time, but once the sale of the business, whatever its nature may be, is completed, there is an end of the income; there can be no more income from that business. In my opinion, it makes no difference whether the purchase price is derived from the chattels or from the whole property. The sale of a business out and out, such as this, has, to my mind, the same effect as would arise in the case of the death of the owner, the land and chattels passing to his executors. There could be no more income; the executor could not be charged with receiving income, because the goods and the chattels forming the estate became his property. I agree with the passage quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pilkington</inline> from Levinson&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Income Tax Act,</inline> page 47, that . where a business is sold as a going concern, the resultant price is always capital. </para>
                    <para class="block">The matter went on to the High Court, and I quote the following from the concluding words of the judgment, given by the Chief Justice - </para>
                </quote>
                <quote>
                    <para>Now, applying that statement to the facts stated in this special case, it is clear, in my opinion, that the transaction out of which the &#163;16,000 arose was entered into, not in the course of carrying on the business or for the purpose of carrying on the business, but for the purpose of putting an end to the business. That being so, I am of opinion that neither the &#163;16,000 nor any part of it comes within the provisions of section 16 of the Act, and that the decision of the Full Court of Western Australia was correct. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">The opinion was that that disposal of property was a realization of capital. In this clause we are going to reverse altogether the equitable system that the Federal Income Tax Department, in contradistinction to the Income Tax Department of the States, has been following for some years past. It is a practice that has met with general approval everywhere as being eminently fair that, in the event of the sale of a business as a going concern, and having regard to the fact that the live stock for the carrying on of the business is part of the capital, the taxpayer when rendering his return at the end of the year following the sale should only be called on to render as part of the income of the business that part of the sale proceeds &#39;as represents the average value of the stock sold in the course of the business during preceding years - I believe the term is fixed, at ten years. We are asked to depart from that principle. I submit that good and sufficient reasons have not been given by the Minister for the adoption of this course. </para>
                <para>There is one other matter to which I desire to draw attention, and that is dealt with in sub-clause 5, which states that any taxpayer dissatisfied with the decision of the Commissioner, Assistant Commissioner, or the  Deputy  Commissioner may require the Commissioner to refer his case to a Board of Appeal. I should like to know whether, in the event of a case being referred to a Board of Appeal, the decision of that tribunal will be final. </para>

It is easy to quote cases showing that here and there the law may operate harshly. The Department has had experience of cases in which properties have been sold on the walk-in-walk-out basis for two years running, with consequent loss in income tax revenue, because properties known to be revenue producing have by this means evaded payment of the tax. Surely the Committee is entitled to consider cases of this nature, and to provide safeguards against their occurrence. </para>

                    <para>- The sales may have been quite <inline font-style="italic">bona fide.</inline> But it is a fact that properties producing income have by this method evaded payment of income tax. I have already quoted my own experience, and I have shown how I could have evaded the payment of income tax. Some years ago I acquired a property, stocked it, and for about five years I sold off only the male stock, allowing the female stock to remain and gradually increase. At the end of five years I sold for cash on a walk-in-walk-out basis, and took my profit in a lump sum, and under the existing law I could have evaded payment of income tax in respect of my profits on the sale. Would that have been fair ? Undoubtedly it would not. I was a citizen receiving the benefits of citizenship; I was making money each year, and, merely because I refrained from collecting it each year and collected it as a lump sum at the end of five years, I would have escaped my obligations as a taxpayer. I say that that would not be right. I ask the Committee to enable the Commissioner of Taxation to levy tax on profits made on these &#34; walkinwalkout&#34; sales. Under sub-clause 4 there is a proposal which discriminates. </para>

                        <para>- That is quite true, but, if a profit is made on selling them, why should not the man who makes the profit pay tax? Why these special pleas that this and that taxpayer should be allowed to escape taxation ? These Bills are not introduced for the purpose of enabling people to escape their obligations, but for the purpose of distributing the obligations of the taxpayers equitably and fairly. A proposal to enable a man, by a little manoeuvring, to secure a profit and avoid paying income tax on it is one which, I hope, will not be entertained by the Committee. I therefore ask honorable senators to support the clause as it stands. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister&#39;s&#39; plea is not based on existing circumstances, because he suggests the possibility of a man being able to entirely escape taxation in the case of a &#34; walk-in-walk-out&#34; sale. Thai would be possible only if we made such a provision in our Income Tax Assessment Act as was interpreted in the case off the Western Australian Act, which would allow all moneys received from the sale of stock to be treated as capital. I am not making any such plea. I ask the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> why we should not continue as we have been doing for some years past, and, when there is a winding-up sale, levy tax only on the number of stock sold equal to the average sales of the previous years. If that course were followed, the man would not escape taxation, but he would be asked to pay only what is a fair thing. </para>

                        <para>- I should be sorry to do so, but I received the impression from what the Minister did say that he Suggested that I was endeavouring to differentiate between those who have and those who have not. My remarks apply to small, as well as large, graziers. His observations were, in any case, unnecessary as a reply to what I had said, because I did not suggest that the Commissioner should not take any part at all of the value of the proceeds of a sale of stock, but that he should tax only what would represent a surplus over and above a normal flock. Let me give some illustrations to show what might happen under this clause. A pastoralist has on hand 20,000 sheep, consisting of 10,000 ewes and 10,000 wethers and their average cost, as accepted by the  Commissioner,  is 20s. per head. A drought ensues, and he loses his 10,000 ewes, and either gets no lambs or else loses the ewes and the lambs; but he is enabled to keep his 10,000 wethers. Owing to drought conditions he sells out, and he is enabled to sell these 10,000 wethers at a price of 30s. per head. If the method prescribed by the Bill is followed, this will be the result: The 10,000 ewes and lambs having been lost, and their realization or loss having been treated as a capital realization or loss, there is no deduction for the loss. The proceeds of the 10,000 wethers not being exempted in this clause as in the case of breeding ewes, are liable to tax, and as the 10,000 were sold for 30s., or a profit of 10s. per head, the taxpayer will be liable for tax on a profit of &#163;5,000. </para>

                        <para>- I am aware of that; but I am dealing with sheep. I cannot take sheep, cattle, and other kinds of animals together. The true position in the case I have submitted as an illustration is as follows: - On the debtor side -20,000 sheep at 20s., or &#163;20,000; and on the creditor side - sale of 10,000 at 30s. per head, &#163;15,000; loss by death of 10,000, &#163;10,000, showing a loss on the whole transaction of &#163;5,000. So that we arrive at the position that instead of mat - ing a profit of &#163;5,000, this man has made a loss of &#163;5,000, but he will be taxed on an assumed profit of &#163;5,000. Then let us assume that this person does not lose the ewes, but on the sale of the property as a going concern sells the ewes in the middle of a drought at a greatly depreciated price, but obtains a good price for his wethers. Assume that the 10,000 ewes were sold at 10s. per head, and the 10,000 wethers at 25s. per head, the position then would be: - On the debtor side- 20,000 sheep at 20s., &#163;20,000; and on the creditor side - sale, 10,000 at 10s., &#163;5,000; 10,000 at 25s., &#163;12,500, showing a loss of &#163;2,500. Under the Bill, however, the Commissioner would deal with the matter as follows: - Loss on sale of wethers (10,000 cost 20s.)&#39; sold for 10s., &#163;5,000. This is not considered, as ewes are not included in the expression &#34; trading stock.&#34; Profit on sale of 10,000 wethers at 25s., &#163;2,500, which under the Bill would be subject to taxation. </para>

                        <para>- He gets a deduction not of the original cost, but of some fancy figure fixed year by year for  deduction purposes, whilst he has to render in the accounting of his sales the full amount he. receives, and not the average amount for. which the stock would be sold in a series of years. These are cases which might occur at any time, and are quite likely to arise in. actual practice. It may be pointed out that many stations are purely breeding propositions, and they carry practically no. wethers. Other stations carry up to 40 per cent, of wethers,, as the country is not suitable for carrying more than, a certain proportion of breed ing ewes. The clause, if adopted, will mean that, there will be a grave discrimination between taxpayers, and that in many instances persons who make losses on realization will be taxed as if they had made profits, whereas others will be allowed deductions on account of part of the stock sold. I therefore urge upon the Committee that there is no good reason why we should not limit the operation of this clause so as to secure what the Department has been content to secure for some years past, and what has been absolutely fair. My proposal is not to allow a man to escape just taxation, but to insure to the Department, in the event of the sale of a business as a going concern, that there shall be returned as income all proceeds of sheep sold in excess of the number of sheep held as the normal flock in average years. The Bill proposes to hit these people very hard, and it differentiates between the class of country on which wethers can be carried and that on which ewes can be carried, whilst there is no reason for the differentiation. The Department adopts fancy methods of dealing with stock-owners, as . though they kept a grocer&#39;s or a draper&#39;s shop, which are quite inapplicable to the pastoral industry. I move - </para>

                    <para>. - The proposal of the honorable senator if carried into effect would undoubtedly result in a number of taxpayers avoiding the payment of any tax whatever.  I  will give, an illustration of a property &#34;with a normal carrying capacity of, say, 5,000. We will assume that the taxpayer has  been making a profit and paying tax on from &#163;700 to &#163;1,000 a year. If at the end of the next year, eleven months of which may have expired, he sells on a walk in walkout basie, he will escape all taxation for that year. He would only need to have the number of stock that represented the normal carrying capacity of the property, and in that case he would dodge his responsibility to the Treasury. </para>

We should give justice to all classes, whether rich or poor. I regret that the Minister has insinuated that there is a desire on the part of some honorable senators to benefit a particular class. The Minister stated that if a man carried on a property for a number of years, and sold out in the eleventh month of the following year, he should be called upon to pay the tax. I shall concede that ; but . when the man sells he has to pay a tremendous tax on the transfer of the land, and if the property is leasehold he has to pay tax on what he gets for. the transfer of the lease. </para>

The buyer of a station tries to make the seller value the sheep as high as possible, because the seller has to pay the tax on that ; and the buyer tries to get the land valued as low as possible in order to reduce the tax that he has to pay. I remember a man having to contribute as much as 40&#39; per cent, in taxation after selling a station. </para>

                        <para>- I am only pointing out that it is not likely that the small shareholder is to be saved from paying income tax because the Commissioner may refund it. We are holding out a false hope to many people who are paying no tax at all, and who after receiving a small dividend will find that an amount has been deducted to cover the particular tax imposed under paragraph c of sub-clause 2, and will thus, in effect, become taxpayers though their total incomes exempt them from liability. </para>

Companies are earning profits which are disclosed, and the Bill provides that the Commissioner shall know who is receiving those profits. The Commissioner will levy a tax upon a recipient according to his income. If the companies making a large measure of profit do not disclose the names of the persons to whom the profit is paid, it is only fair that we should tax the company. </para>

It provides that, although a company is charged, and later it is discovered that the individuals who obtained the profit from the company are known, the Commissioner will allow them a rebate. in excess of the amount which otherwise would have been charged. </para>

If we do not include this provision, what will happen? The company will pay the whole amount, and the shareholders&#39; names will not be disclosed, which will be unfortunate for the small ones, but fortunate for the large&#39; holders, because the flat rate will be paid by the company and distributed <inline font-style="italic">pro rata</inline> amongst all the shareholders, with the result that those with a small income will be paying 2s. 5d. in the &#163;1 instead of the proper rate of ls. in the &#163;1. </para>

                    <para>. -  The provision affects largely the co-operative companies which export their surplus from time to time and retain in their own hands portion of the proceeds to equalize the price of the produce furnished by the whole of their shareholders. The honorable senator means to say that the provision could be applied equally to other co-operative produce. On that point I would not be prepared to argue against him. The provision was put in the Act when this question was very much to the fore, and it has remained there ever since. As it is in, I trust the honorable senator will allow it to remain. </para>

                    <para>. - Certain possibilities have been brought under my notice by some business men in regard to this clause. They have noted that it deals with &#34; taxable income,&#34; which means &#34; the assessable income after deducting all the deductions allowed by the Act.&#34; This means that where a company has been called upon to make extraordinary expenditure in a particular year, which expenditure is not allowable as a deduction under the Income Tax Act, such expenditure will not be taken into account in calculating the company&#39;s ability to declare a dividend. Take a concrete case: A&#39; company&#39;s profits, according to its profit and loss account, are &#163;20,000. In arriving at its profits, however, the company has deducted - </para>

                <para class="block">Although the company&#39;s profits are actually &#163;20,000, the Commissioner must assume them to have been &#163;23,500, and he would proceed to apply the clause on that assumption. Should he decide to take action owing to an inadequate dividend having, in his opinion, been declared, he would assess the shareholders on their proportions of the disallowed items. This, in my opinion, would be absolutely opposed to equity. The clause should, it is thought, require the Commissioner to consider whether a company has not distributed to its members or shareholders at least two-thirds of its actual profits. Has the Minister had. that position placed before him? </para>

                        <para>- They may be. If this provision was being enacted for the first time I should be satisfied with the word &#34; outgoings &#34;, but the words &#34; and expenses &#34; have been in the previous Statute. There is only one inference that a Court could draw from the alteration. It would assume that Parliament intended to vary the meaning. I think it would be very much safer in the interests of the taxpayer to stick to the previous wording, and thus have the advantage of any rulings that have been given. The alteration would not be likely to cause the other House to waste any time. </para>

                        <para>- Well, what is the difference between a trading loss and a loss of capital necessary for the carrying on of a business? If machinery gets damaged and out of repair, the cost is an allowable deduction, but losses of capital through storms are not so treated. I am certain there would be no difficulty in getting an amendment to the Bill if this principle had general application. Storms of the nature to which I refer only occur in the tropical area of the Commonwealth, where it is necessary to encourage settlement. </para>

More than once there has been a strong protest against the levying of income tax upon capital, but it is claimed that, while capital shall not be taxed, losses of capital shall be deductible from income taxation. The thing is not compatible. </para>

                <para class="block">This paragraph provides for the exemption of State and Federal land taxes and State income tax payments, and I think it is only fair that a deduction of the Federal income tax paid in the previous year should also be included. My amendment will have that effect. The taxable income is the net income of  a  taxpayer. It cannot be contended that the amount paid by way of Federal income taxation is part of any man&#39;s income. It really should come under the same heading &#39;as expenses incurred in the carrying on of a business. Provision is made for deducting State and Federal land taxes, and it is only right, in my opinion, that the State and Federal income tax payments should also be deductible. </para>

                    <para>. - I  do not think the Committee will be disposed to indorse <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foil&#39;s</inline> proposal. Viewing the amendment from the financial side it would at once withdraw from the field of taxation a sum amounting  to  &#163;16,000,000, as that is the amount which was collected as income tax last year by the Federal Treasurer. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> says, in a light and airy fashion, that &#163;16,000,000 should be regarded as a deduction. I submit that if the Treasurer were in  a  position  to  get along with such a reduction in revenue  as  the honorable senator&#39;s amendment would involve, it would be far better for him  to  propose  to  reduce the rates of income tax. We have already proposed a reduction of 10 per cent., but if we could give up more revenue it would be more business-like to do  so  by  a  further reduction  of  the rate than by permitting amounts paid  as  Federal income tax  to  be regarded  as  deductions. </para>

                        <para>- No;, what I say is that the taxable area would be reduced by that amount. I say that it would be far better if the Treasurer could forgo the revenue which would be lost by the adoption of the amendment to lower the rate of tax. In that case, the reduction would fall more equitably on various taxpayers. </para>

                    <para>. - . The figures given by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> may at a glance appear to be very effective. That is the usual custom of Ministers in charge of a Bill, and a private member putting forward a reasonable amendment has little chance of receiving any consideration. The amount of &#163;16,000,000 referred to is spread over a great number of taxpayers, and the reduced amount of taxation that would have to be paid if my amendment were agreed to would not be so great as the Minister has suggested. The Government have met taxpayers who have to pay land tax, which I quite agree with,  but I say that even if my amendment did involve the loss of revenue which the Minister suggests, I would still be of opinion that it ought to be accepted. The sooner we take active steps to further reduce taxation in this country, the better it will be for taxpayers generally, and also for men who are out of work as a result of the heavy taxation imposed by State and Federal Governments. I regret thai when I stand up in this chamber in an endeavour to obtain some slight reduction in the amount paid in taxation in this country the Minister in charge of this Bill should treat my proposal as though it were a jest. I am going to advocate here, and also in the country when the elections take place, a reduction of taxation, irrespective of the Government policy. I hope that the Minister will not consider it a subject for jest when an honorable senator submits a sound proposal for the reduction of taxation. </para>

                        <para>- It is hard to say, because the tax is collected1 at varying rates. Let us take it at1s., and that would be less than the average, and the honorable senator&#39;s amendment would mean a loss of revenue amounting to &#163;800,000 a year. This Bill proposes to forgo &#163;2,500,000 a year, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> says, &#34;Let us knock another &#163;800,000 off the revenue.&#34; 1 could  as  easily . propose, on the eve of an election, further remissions of taxation, but we have to be practical, and the country cannot afford to give up &#163;800,000 of revenue in addition to the &#163;2,500,000 which it is being asked to give up under this Bill. It is easy to make proposals for the redaction- of revenue which would be received with a certain amount of favour outside, but we have a responsibility to the country, and unless the honorable senator can show how we are  to  get along without the revenue which would be lost by the adoption of his amendment, I assume that honorable senators will not support it. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to be able to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poll&#39;s</inline> amendment. Every one would like to see a reduction of taxation. We have to recognise that Australia has incurred very heavy obligations in the last few years, and we have to meet them. I am very glad that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> has been able to submit proposals to lighten the burden of taxation. I think that we should be content with what he has proposed. To include . payments by way of Federal income tax in the list of statutory deductions would, as pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. Millen, involve a loss of revenue to the extent of &#163;800,000 at least, and I personally believe that the loss would amount to over &#163;1,000,000. If we accepted the amendment we should have to devise some means of making good the loss of revenue which it would involve. The Treasurer, according to the Budgetpapers, is sailing fairly close to the wind after providing for the reduction in taxation proposed by this Bill. He hopes to be able to make ends meet, but the margin he anticipates is so small that we must very seriously consider any proposal to remit taxation in addition to the remissions provided for in the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- Attending the actual sittings of the Senate and speaking is only a fractional part of an honorable senator&#39;s work. We are now tired, and I do not think there will be very much difficulty in finishing the Bill expeditiously when the Committee resumes to-morrow. </para>

                    <para>. - The Committee knows the position Ministers are in. Time waits for no man, and there is an obligation on honorable senators to dispose of the business as quickly as possible, to enable Parliament to rise at the end of the week. I have no objection to an adjournment now, but if a similar request comes to-morrow night at this time it may not be possible to grant it. It will depend on the state of business. I very much doubt if we shall be able to adjourn as early as this to-morrow night. </para>
