              <para>- I admit that Ihave gained some experience. The man who goes through life without gaining something from his experience makes but very little use of his brains. I do not deny the fact that since I have been connected with the land I have to some extent modified my views with regard to protective duties. But I never was an extreme Protectionist. I never supported excessive protective duties to my knowledge, but have always taken a careful and moderate view of each duty proposed. I might be called a moderate Protectionist. I would point out that the charge of fiscal inconsistency is such a common charge that there has never been a member of the Senate against whom it might not be made. Ihave never known either a Free Trader or a Protectionist who has not slipped on some little item or another, and against whom the charge of fiscal inconsistency might not havebeen made, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> is included, as the quotation read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> last night proves. </para>

              <para>- It is an argument that is quite in accord with the Standing Orders, and I propose to continue to address myself to the measure if the Leader of the Senate will permit me. The Bill which was submitted  by  the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Earle)</inline> was quite  consistent  with the principle of assisting native industries. Whether they  are  assisted by duties or by bounties,  the  underlying principle is the same.  In  each case the desire is to assist  and  foster native industries. In the circumstances, there was nothing inconsistent  in  my action in supporting the measure.  I  believe that I took up a reasonable  attitude  on the second reading of the Customs Tariff Bill, and I then enunciated  the  principle that was going to guide  me  throughout the debates on the Tariff schedule. </para>

            <para>- I regret  that,  at this stage of the Bill, it is necessary  for  me to speak in this way. The Tariff  was  quite an open question so far as  the  Government were concerned. There  was  no attempt to tie down supporters to vote one way or the other in respect of any item, and, accordingly, I resent  the  statement, made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> last night that in supporting this Bill  we  are making a sort of death-bed repentance, and that we have changed our opinions because we heard the rattle of the ballot-box. I have, on all occasions, done my &#34;bit&#34; for the farming industry. I can. prove that my attitude has been consistent throughout on the question of Customs duties and bounties. In my second-reading speech on the Tariff, I said- </para>

            <para class="block">It is only  in  a  general way  at  this  the  second-reading  stage  of  the  Tariff  that  we can define our attitude. I propose to approach the  framing  of the Tariff so  that  our  industries  may be developed  to  the highest capacity. I think it will be accepted as a general  principle  by Free Traders and  Protectionists  alike, that big and  important industries employing  large  numbers  of persons and which receive no aid from the Tariff ought  not to  be  hampered  by any attempt  to  foster very much  smaller  industries. </para>

          <para class="block">I argued that tools of trade were generally recognised by both Free Traders and Protectionists as articles that should not be taxed. I took up that attitude all through the Tariff debate. I have had a considerable experience in the business of framing Tariffs in this Chamber. Eight through my attitude has been quite consistent and reasonable, and I have always been able to satisfy my constituents on this point. I just hate to introduce the personal note into our proceedings. My presence in this Chamber is a standing proof of that. Therefore, I resent <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch&#39;s</inline> remarks. I could understand a political opponent hurling taunts at another opponent, but I cannot understand one&#39;s own political friend, and particularly one coming from the same State, taunting supporters of this Bill - which shifts a burden of taxation from the shoulders of the farming section to the broader shoulders of the whole community - with death-bed repentance or with inconsistency because they hear the rattle of the ballot-box. I take this opportunity to make my position clear. </para>

        <para>As honorable senators will note, this clause provides for the numbering of the ballot-papers, and it has been struck out in the House of Representatives. The reasons actuating the Government in dropping the proposed numbering of the ballot-papers were these: We still think it would be an improvement to have the ballot-papers numbered to obviate any difficulty that may crop up in a closely contested election; but, as honorable senators are well aware, there is the contingency of a general election in consequence of the situation in another place, and the Commonwealth Electoral Officer has notified the Government that, unless considerable time were allowed, serious difficulties would arise in connexion with the printing of the ballotpapers. He made careful inquiries as to the labour that would be involved in numbering the ballot-papers, and ascertained that this work would take a considerable time. The ballot-papers, assuming clause 12 were retained, would have to be numbered serially, and very carefully checked. Altogether, it is a much more cumbersome process than merely printing the ballot-papers, and the Chief Electoral Officer would be unable to get them printed in time in the form proposed if an election were held at comparatively short notice. In the circumstances the Government thought it would be too big a risk to take. It was decided to withdraw the proposal from the Bill, with the full intention, later of bringing it forward again when the circumstances will be such that we shall have time to make sure of having the ballot-papers printed. We did not feel justified in taking a risk of not having the : ballot-papers ready for an election. </para>

        <para>This was a proposition put forward by the Electoral Department to overcome a difficulty that had arisen, and was disclosed in one of the cases of disputed elections that came before the Court. The proposal was to omit the word &#34; shall &#34; and insert the word &#34; may &#34; in regard to certain classes of votes. Objection was taken in the House of Representatives thatthat would give too much discretion to the Returning Officers, and the House felt that it would take the risk of possible difficulties that might arise, if there was a disputed election. It omitted the word &#34; may,&#34; and went back to the word &#34; shall.&#34; The electoral officers think that it. would be better to have the word &#34; may,&#34; but Parliament takes a different view. </para>

        <para>That this Bill &#39;be now read a second time. </para>
        <para>The object of the measure is to bring the Senate Elections Act of 1903 into line with the amending electoral legislation of 1918-19. Honorable senators will remember that since the Senate Elections Act of 1903 came into force, we have passedlegislation that alters the system by which the counting of the ballotpapers was conducted, because we have introduced preferential voting, and we have three counts or four counts, according to the number of vacancies. Therefore the 1903 Act for the filling of casual vacancies is not now consistent with the present system of counting ballot-papers and deciding an election. The language of the present Senate Elections Act is not consistent with that employed in later electoral legislation, and is liable to lead to considerable confusion, and, indeed, did occasion the lodging -of a petition by exSenator Mulcahy, after the Senate elections held in 1919. The Court, whilst upholding the position taken up by the Electoral administration in the Mulcahy petition, indicated that it would be advisable to ask that the Act be amended. </para>
        <para>The Bill deals with the filling of casual vacancies, as to which there is no satisfactory law forthe guidance of the Electoral administration, where in an election there are such vacancieswith differing unexpired periods of service. In a Senate election, to fill periodical and casual vacancies, there would invariably be three periodical vacancies, and there might be one or more casual vacancies. A casual vacancy might be for the period ending on the 30th June next following the date of the election, which might, for the sake of brevity, be described as a short casual vacancy, or it might be for three years after the 30th June next following the date of the election, herein referred to as a long casual vacancy. For example, <inline font-style="italic">e.g.,</inline> the term of a senator who was elected at the election held on the 5th May, 1917, will expire on the 30th June, 1923, and that of a senator elected on the 13th December, 1919, will expire on the 30th June, 1926. If the seat of one of the senators elected for a State on the 5th May, 1917, or the seat of a senator elected for a State on the 19th December, 1919, becomes vacant, or if in any one State both of these contingencies arise, it will be necessary at the next . general election for the House of &#34;Representatives or the next election of senators, whichever first happens, to fill these casual vacancies, as well as the periodical vacancies which will occur by effluxion of time, on 1st July, 1923. </para>
        <para>It is obvious that in filling three periodical vacancies and one short casual vacancy, if a candidate who at the time of election is a senator, is fourth on the list in order of success, he cannot be declared elected to fill the casual vacancy terminating on the 30th June next following, inasmuch as (although defeated at the elections) he is a senator until that date. Therefore the Bill provides, in proposed new section 9 (1), that a short casual vacancy shall . befilled by one of the candidates elected to fill a periodical vacancy, namely, the -first &#39;candidate not being at the &#39;time of the election a senator, who is elected in accordance with the provisions of section 135 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. If there are more short casual vacancies than one, they will be filled successively in the same way by one of the candidates (not being a senator) elected to fill one of the periodical vacancies. </para>
        <para>Where a long casual vacancy is to be filled, it is proposed that the candidate, whether a senator at the time of election or not, who next after the periodical vacancies have been filled first receives an absolute majority of the votes at the scrutiny, shall be elected to fill that casual vacancy, but -subject to the condition that if he be a senator at the time of the election he must have lodged with the Commonwealth Electoral Officer at the date of nomination a form of resignation to take effect only if he is elected to fill the casual vacancy. This provision is necessary in orderthat an elected candidate who is a senator at the date of election may fill the vacancy as from that, date, it being properly considered that a senator cannot at one and thesame time fill two vacancies. In the filling of a long casual vacancy a senator candidate is thus given the same opportunity as a candidate who is not a senator, provided that he shall have lodged -a conditional resignation on or before nomination day. </para>
        <para>The Law officers have considered it advisable to include in the Bill (clause 7) provisions to meet the possible, though extremely improbable, contingency of a Senate election in which the number of candidates does not exceed the number of the vacancies, and the whole matter to be determined is the question as to which candidates are to fill - </para>
        <list type="loweralpha">
          <item label="(b)">
            <para>the short casual vacancy (or vacancies) ; and/or </para>

            <para>the long casual vacancy (or vacancies) . </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para>The second principle of the Bill is that long casual vacancies are filled in turn by the fourth, fifth, &#38;c, candidates; with the proviso that a senator candidate will not be in the running for a long casual vacancy unless he has lodged with the returning officer a conditional resignation of the balance of his current term. Of course, when a senator candidate is thus elected for a long casual vacancy, his resignation of the tail-end of his current term will leave a short casual vacancy which cannot be filled at that election. That vacancy - if the period is long enough to make it worth  while - can be filled under section 15 of the Constitution. </para>
        <para>One other adjustment has , to be made. Section 82 of the Electoral Act provides that, where no more candidates are nominated than there are vacancies, there need be no poll, but the candidates nominated shall be declared elected. This provision requires- some modification, to- provide for a- poll being taken ire every case when that is necessary to determine the allotment of the. casual vacancies - long or short. </para>
        <para>Now I come to an illustration-. Let us assume that there are retiring senators, and that there are one &#34; short casual &#34; and one &#34;long casual&#34; vacancy; that Allen and Brown, the two retiring senators, are both candidates; that Campbell, Dolton, Edwards, Frost, and Green, all non-senators, are also candidates; and that the result of&#39; the poll is - </para>

It would make no difference if Campbell already held a &#34; casual &#34;&#39; place by appointment. Thus Campbell would be able to take his seat at once, and would hold it until 30th June, 1929. Allen and Brown would take their seats on the 1st July, 1923. The &#34; long casual &#34; vacancy would go to Frost, who would take his seat at once and hold&#39; it until the 30th June. 1926.

        <para>The system is applicable to all possible combinations of &#34; long casual &#34; or &#34; short casual&#34; vacancies; and&#39; to every possible order of election of senator and nonsenator candidates. It gives the fullest  effect to the votes, of the majority, both as to &#34; short casuals &#34; and &#34; long casuals.&#34; Where there are only &#34; short casual &#34; vacancies to be filled, a party need not run any other candidates than the normal three. Where there are &#34; long casual &#34; vacancies to be filled, a party can run extra candidates to make up the number. If the party has a majority and votes the full ticket, its three highest will get the three six-year seats and any &#34; short casual &#34; vacancies there may be; the next in order will get any &#34; long casual &#34; vacancies there may be. </para>
        <para>I recognise that it is very difficult for honorable senators to follow an explanation of a Bill so involved as this, and therefore I have no objection, if honorable senators wish it, to adjourning the debate so that they may obtain copies of my speech from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and examine it. The Government has no desire to get other than a just and workable system. I would ask the Senate, however, to put the Bill through quickly so that it can go to another place early next week. I would impress upon honorable senators that there is considerable risk in what may happen in regard to casual vacancies if an election should occur before we pass this Bill. </para>

          <para>- We would be thrown back upon the Senate Elections Act of 1903, which did not contemplate the system of counting which we now have, and did not contemplate preferential voting, which led to the difficulty in Tasmania. I therefore wish to impress upon honorable senators, and especially upon those who will retire at the coming election, that the law as it stands should be amended so as to make sure that the difficulty to which. I have referred will not recur. </para>

          <para>.- I understand that the object of the Bill is to give the House of Repre sentatives, a representative from the Northern Territory who shall have a voice but not a vote. I want to say immediately, so that there may be no time lost in stating my opinion, that I am unhesitatingly against the proposal. I cannot see any rhyme or reason in it. I know that there are people who say that taxation without representation is a principle that is opposed to all ideas of British justice, but there is such a thing as riding even a principle to death. Seeing that this is the main reason which has been given in support of the Bill, I think it would not be amiss for the Senate to know exactly how much taxation the people of the Northern Territory pay. In the Budget-papers I find that &#163;91,000 was paid in general administration. In addition to that, Australia has to meet an interest bill on loans of another &#163;90,000. Then there is a loss on the working expenses of the railway to Katherine River amounting to &#163;30,000. In round figures, there is a total loss of &#163;210,000 a year. I am not quite sure that it would be fair to debit the Northern Territory with the whole of the loss on the Port Augusta to Oodnadatta railway. My case is so strong that it is not necessary to be unfair, although the railway is obviously some advantage to the people of the Northern Territory. There is a&#39; loss on this railway of &#163;141,000 a year, and the working expenses alone are &#163;53,000. In another part of the Budget the loss on the Northern Territory is set down at &#163;218,000. What are the receipts as against that ? There are general taxation, &#163;43,951; and railway receipts, &#163;14,370. Included in the receipts from general taxation is an item of &#163;7,600 earned by the Post Office. I think it is hardly fair to designate the Post Office receipts as taxation, for they represent payment for services rendered. I am sorry to say that we are making the Australian Post Office a tax-collector. We are charging more than we ought for postage. In the Northern Territory, however, the Post Office is not a tax-collector, because, while it costs &#163;25,000 to run, the people there pay only &#163;7,600 towards it, the balance of &#163;18,000 being contributed by the people of the Commonwealth generally. I think it would be legitimate to deduct the &#163;7,000 from the &#163;43,000. If the Post Office in Australia incurs a loss the people of the Commonwealth have to make it good, but if there is a loss on the Post Office in the Northern Territory, it is not the people of the Territory, but the people of the Commonwealth, who have to meet it. The working expenses of the railway are &#163;30,000 a year, apart from interest, and the revenue is &#163;14,000. It is not fair to reckon that &#163;14,000 as taxation, because it is payment for services rendered. Those services might have been rendered by a private company. It cannot be said that the railway in the Northern Territory is a tax-collector when the working expenses alone, apart from interest, are &#163;30,000, as against a revenue of &#163;14,000. Other items of revenue are Customs and Excise, &#163;4,500; Territory taxation - 1 do not know exactly what that means - &#163;20,000; land and income tax, &#163;9,000; and miscellaneous, &#163;9,000. Ignoring the Oodnadatta Railway, the Budget shows a deficiency of &#163;218,000. If the people of the Territory are paying about &#163;40,000 for services rendered, and the people of Australia outside the Territory are paying &#163;218,000, plus the &#163;40,000, in order to make up the deficiency, the people of the Territory ought to be satisfied, and if they are not, I know of nothing in the heavens above, in the earth beneath, or in the waters under the earth that would satisfy them. </para>

            <para>- Before the adjournment I was dealing with the question of taxation without representation, and had shown that the people of the Northern Territory have little to complain of, seeing that the bulk of the expenditure on the Territory was paid by people in other parts of the Commonwealth. If there is anything in the  argu-ment  that there should not be taxation without representation it applies with greater force to Papua, and I should like to know why the Government do not bring in a Bill to give the people in that Territory representation in this Parliament. In the Budget-papers the cost of government in Papua is &#163;115,000, of which the people in that Territory contribute &#163;85,000; the only amount which they receive from the Federal Government is a donation of &#163;30,000 a year. I have not made any allowance for the amounts which are being spent in an endeavour to discover mineral oil in Papua, the expenditure on which is quite apart from ordinary administrative costs. If taxation and representation should go together the people of Papua have a greater claim to representation in this Parliament than those in the Northern Territory. </para>

            <para>- I believe they have, but on that point, perhaps, the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> will give s some information. It is some years since I have been directly associated with Papua; but if I remember aright they have a Council, a majority of the members of which are Government officials.

If the Council is constituted as I have suggested, and the Government wish to give effect to their policy the members of the Council are naturally supposed to support the Government. </para>

            <para>- When I was a Minister, an Ordinance of which I did not approve was submitted, and, consequently, it was not adopted. If that practice still prevails the Minister has full control. I would not hesitate for a moment in assisting to give to the people of the Northern Territory a Council similar to that in Papua, and that should be the first step in &#39;the direction of granting the people of the Northern Territory representation in this Parliament. Arguments have been adduced from time to time concerning the representation of American States in Congress, and it has been said that some representatives cannot vote. If taxpayers of the Northern Territory are to have representation in this Parliament, the people of Papua, even though they have a local Council, should also be given a similar privilege. Papua is much further away, and honorable senators have not the time, or the opportunity, to visit even the Northern Territory, quite apart from journeying to Papua. We are continually receiving information concerning the Northern Territory through the press, and from various other sources, but we obtain very little detailed information concerning Papua. I do not think we should be asked to discuss Bills in this Chamber which have passed another branch of the Legislature until we have had an opportunity of perusing the speeches which nave been delivered on them in that Chamber. This is a Chamber of review, and it appears to me that we should have that privilege. </para>

            <para>- We ought . to have the opportunity. In this instatnce, however, the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report is available. I believe I  am  justified in saying that the most ardent supporters of the measure in another place - the Government supporters were not particularly keen, and there certainly was not a very enthusiastic speech delivered by the Minister who introduced the Bill - were the members of the Labour party. Those who gave the measure their support, however, condemned it because the proposed representative would not have a vote, and they very pointedly asked what was the use of a representative attending Parliament if he could not vote. If we. wish to relieve the discontent which prevails, we shall have to adopt other measures, because I do not think representation without a vote will be regarded as satisfactory. If the people of the Northern Territory will be contented with this they must have very little of which to complain.

            <para>- My point is that what the Leader in any Parliament wants to know is how a member is going to vote. An honorable senator may say what he pleases, but it is only when a division is likely to be very close that he is carefully listened to. Very little attention will be paid in another place to a representative of the Northern Territory there who has a voice but no vote. He will be listened to only as were the words of the dukes of Edom. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> as a Cabinet Minister of long standing, will admit the truth of what I say. </para>

        <para>Before the transfer of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth the residents had the right to vote for two members of the South Australian Parliament, and the fact that on the transfer of the Territory to the Commonwealth they lost that privilege of parliamentary representation was the cause of some discontent. About 250 people in the Northern Territory had the right to return two members to the South Australian Parlia ment, whilst at the same time South Australian constituencies containing 20,000 or 30,000 people could return no more than three representatives. I certainly should have opposed that, but if the people of South Australia did not consider it unfair it was a matter for themselves to decide. I think the time has come when mere area should not be considered a basis of representation. We know that there was a time in English history when persons represented what <inline font-style="italic">were</inline> called &#34; pocket boroughs,&#34; in which there were only a very few votes. That time is past and gone. We have moved with the times, and people should now be the only basis of representation. We are invited to believe that if the Northern Territory is represented in another place by a voice and not by a vote, conditions in the Territory will be improved, and great things will be accomplished. There are problems to be solved in the Territory. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> admits that, and has said that he does not know what he might not be able to do if he had at his disposal the money which has been wasted there. It is suggested that the proposed representative of the Northern Territory will only have to make a speech in another place, and its problems will be solved with the aid of a dictionary. I am against the Bill. I believe that the people of the Northern Territory have no claim to what it proposes. </para>

            <para>- So do the people of Papua and of Canberra, and it is not proposed that they shall be represented in this Parliament. Will the honorable senator contend that the people of Washington are discontented without parliamentary representation? The people of Canberra pay taxes, and I should say that they pay into the revenue a sum equivalent to the expenditure from revenue in the Federal Territory. Why should they not be given representation as well as the people in the Northern Territory? I have already said that, in my opinion, the people of Papua have a better claim to. representation than have the people of the Northern Territory. I opposed a measure similar to this when it was introduced in the Senate. That measure proposed the representation of the Territory in the Senate by a senator without&#39; a vote, and honorable senators by -an overwhelming majority threwout- the  proposal and decided that such representation should not be granted to the Territory in this Chamber. </para>

            <para>- Technically, no doubt the Minister is right; but I believe that not a single member of the Senate was of opinion that the Northern Territory should be given the representation then proposed. If residents of the Northern Territory are entitled to be represented in this way in the House of Representatives, the contention can be urged with equal force in favour of their representation in a similar way in the Senate. Every one knows that the amendment submitted on the previous Bill dealing with this subject was intended to shelve the measure and prevent any one coming into this Chamber from the Northern Territory. </para>

          <para>. -  I do not view this proposal to give the Northern Territory a voice in the House of Representatives with any great enthusiasm. At first I was rather inclined to agree that if the House of Representatives desired a representative, with a voice and without a vote, for the Northern Territory in that Chamber, that was its business and not ours.

        <para>We may with advantage consider the history of British colonization and the course which has been followed in the gradual development of various British territories throughout the world, and their evolution until they have secured the fullrights of self-government, as a guide to what we ought to do in dealing with the Northern Territory. Broadly speaking, it may be said concerning the evolution of a British Colony that in the first instance it has represented a small settlement of British people, who were  without any representation in the British Parliament, which was at the same time the source of all government in the Colony. As time went on, Councils were established in the various British Colonies. They were nominated by the Crown. They passed various Ordinances which, when they received the approval of the Crown, became law in their respective communities. As time went on again, and the population increased, whether by fresh arrivals or because of the number of the nativeborn, a greater measure of independence was granted to the Colonies. They were given mixed Councils, partly nominated by the Crown and partly elected by the people. The next stage of the evolution was the establishment of local Parliaments, generally consisting of two Houses and a representative of the Crown. In some Colonies the Upper House continued to be a nominee Chamber appointed by the Crown or its representatives, and later by the Crown on the recommendation of the local Executive. So the process of evolution went on until the Colonies reached the full status of selfgoverning communities. That process of evolution has been found to work very satisfactorily in the various British Possessions throughout the world. </para>
        <para>I view the position of the Northern Territory in its connexion with the Commonwealth as being very much the same as the position which Western Australia occupied in its relation to Great Britain at the time of its establishment as a separate Colony. The process of evolution to which I have referred has worked out very satisfactorily in Western Australia, and I ask honorable senators why should not a similar process of evolution in our Colony of the Northern Territory - for that is virtually what it is - be followed by equally satisfactory results? What I suggest, therefore, is that instead of providing this &#39; voice for the people of the Northern Territory in the Federal Parliament, if the time has arrived for the first step in responsible government in the Territory namely the establishment of a Council, that step should be taken if we are satisfied that the people are ready for it. Person ally, I believe they are. In due course of time, by this process of evolution, the Northern </para>

        <para>It is well, before honorable senators make up their minds on this matter, that they should understand just what is the constitutional position with regard to the representation of Territories of the Commonwealth. The Constitution was framed to permit in due course of time the establishment of new States in Australia and the admission of Territories into the Commonwealth, and that these Territories, as they became States, should have the same representation in the Federal Parliament as the original States, representation for the Lower House, being, of course, on a population basis. If we consider the position of the Northern Territory at the present time we shall find that it has no claim at all to representation on a population basis.

        <para class="block">This matter is left entirely to the discretion of Parliament. It is necessary, I think, that honorable senators should realize this when dealing with the Bill, and deciding if a representative is to be allowed from the Northern Territory at all. I ask honorable senators to look at it from this point of view : Suppose Parliament were fairly evenly divided, with a slight majority in each House, on the side of the Government. So long as the predominant party took an honorable view of the situation, there would be no danger, but if party interests were placed before honour, as has been illustrated in Australia already, unfortunately, and a Government determined to place the policy for which it stood on the statute-book without due regard to the general welfare of the community, they would move for the introduction to this Parliament in either House of a sufficient number of members from the Territory to secure their tenure of office for an indefinite period. That possibility must be contemplated, because it is allowable under the Constitution. Of course, the Minister may tell us, and he would be perfectly correct from a legal point of view, that a Parliament with such a majority could, at any time, whether we allowed this Bill to pass or not, introduce a measure to bring about this contingency. </para>

            <para>- It is one of. the possibilities to be contemplated if we have an evenly-divided Parliament, such, as has occurred before in our history, with a slight predominance in. power on one side. There would be a great, temptation for the predominant party to. insist on the Government passing a short enabling Bill giving the power of the vote to the representative of the Northern Territory.. It would take a very strong man, and a man of very high ideals, leading his party to resist that temptation. Let us remember what has happened in Queensland recently. The upper Legislative Chamber in that Parliament, which had been a check on legislation passed by the lower House, has been swept , away. . </para>

            <para>- As the honorable gentleman has reminded me, the Legislative Council of Queensland had the indorsement of the people, and still it was abolished. Then, recently the opposing parties in the Lower House, have been so evenly dividedthat the Ministry found it extremely difficult to carry on; so they looked round for means to retain their power, and resorted to the expedient of passing a Bill authorizing the use of proxy votes for those supporters who were unable, through sickness, to attend the sittings of the House. If the Queensland Government had been in possession of the Territories that are being administered by the Commonwealth Parliament they could have introduced into that Parliament any number of voters by the simple expedient outlined in this Bill. In view of what has happened there lately, do honorable senators think they would have hesitated in such circumstances? I donot think they, would. I believe that if the sameparty were in power, under similar conditions in. the Federal&#39; arena they would not hesitate either. Therefore, I say that honorable senators should consider carefully before they put into the hands of any unscrupulous Government an opportunity to do this. We should hesitate to make the temptation too great; for it would be a temptation to any unscrupulous Government, with a representative in another Chamber without a vote, to pass a simple measure giving him a vote without all the delay of having to go through the form of an election. </para>

            <para>- That would be possible. Once a Government had the necessary legislation  through Parliament they could introduce nominated representatives from Canberra, the Northern Territory, Papua, New Guinea Territory, Nauru, or any of the Territories under the authority of this Parliament. In that way an unscrupulous Ministry might almost secure perpetual tenure of office. That is the danger as I see it. </para>

        <para>In introducing the measure, the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> made a great point of the fact that there should be no taxation without representation. That is an excellent cry, and often a very popular one, but it is not always observed. Is it to be suggested, for instance, that we should give representation in the Australian Parliament to the natives of New Guinea ? </para>

Can it then be said that the natives are not taxed for Commonwealth purposes? Of course they are. Surely it is not suggested that for that reason those natives should have representation in the Commonwealth Parliament. To. carry the cry &#34;No taxation without representation &#34; to its logical conclusion,, we should have- to give- the natives in the Pacific representation, in this Parliament. </para>

          <para>. - I. intend to support the Bill. I was rather surprised at the remark of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> that one reason why residents of the Northern Territory should not have . a vote was that they only paid &#163;43,900 odd in taxation, and that the Federal Government were making a loss on the Territory. The honorable senator&#39; should know that the men pioneering any country . always make a loss, just as the Government must expect to make a loss at the outset in the development of that vast stretch of country. Although there are only 4,706 people in the Territory at present, exclusive of the aborigines, we must bear in mind that those people are suffering great hardships. Most of them are producers, and their case is not comparable with that of residents of a place like Canberra. They are occupying an area of 523,620 square miles. There may be some difficulties in the way of granting them a- representative with the power to. vote; but it is most unfair that, while the pioneers in that country should be developing it under great disadvantages in the shape of lack of transport facilities and the high cost of all the materials necessary to their livelihood, we should both tax them and disfranchise them. Prior to 1911, they had a vote; but since the Commonwealth took control of the Territory they have been disfranchised. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The cost of developing such a huge area is enormous. Those best qualified to judge have stated over and over again, at deputations to honorable senators and others, that one of the burning questions in the Territory, and the cause of much of the industrial unrest there, is the fact that the people are taxed but are given no voice in the country&#39;s affairs. Messrs. Vestey Brothers are by far the largest employers of labour in the Territory. Next to them, I was the largest employer. My people, in developing a property there, spent &#163;100,000 odd, and employed fifty white people for thirty-five years, all of whom, subsequent to 1911, were disfranchised. The Territory is so far away from the Seat of Government that honorable senators cannot keep in touch with it. I maintain that a representative of that country should at least be allowed to sit in this Parliament to voice the requirements of those people. We in the capital cities in the southern parts of Australia are not in a position to know the urgent needs of those who are pioneering the Territory. I see, of course, the difficulty in collecting the votes, and I hope that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> will make very careful provision in that connexion. </para>

Some honorable senators have referred to the amount of money already spent in the development of the Territory. I maintain that there has never been sufficient money expended there. It has been a case of &#34;out of sight, out. of mind.&#34; More has been spent annually at Canberra. The people most concerned have expressed themselves as dissatisfied because no representation is at present afforded them.

          <para>.- I shall oppose the Bill. I believe that there should be no taxation without representation, but in the application of the principle all the circumstances should be taken into consideration. The number of people in the community that seeks representation must bear a due proportion to the population in the community that has representation. Is it fair that a small community of 4,700 people should have one member in the Commonwealth Parliament, whereas South Australia, with half-a-million people, has only seven? It would be altogether out of proportion to give the Northern Territory such representation. It is all very well to speak of the hardships of the people. I admit that they are &#39; labouring under great difficulties. Surely 4,000 people are not entitled to arrogate to themselves a proportion of representation such as that ! </para>

            <para>- It seems to me that the Northern Territory has no more right to separate representation in this Parlia- ment than the Mandated Territory of New Guinea or the Federal Capital Territory of Canberra. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DrakeBrockman&#39;s</inline> suggestion seems to be the common-sense way of dealing with this difficulty. Let us adopt a variation of parliamentary government, as it is carried out all over the British Empire. A Resident Governor ought to be appointed, with a Legislative Council and a House of Assembly. These should be small bodies. If that course were adopted the people of the Northern Territory, having an opportunity to control their own affairs in peace and security, would be much more satisfied.

They abolished the Upper House in that State almost before the ink was dry on the referendum to the people.

          <para class="block">In submitting this motion I desire to thank the Government for having, in the first place, given me the opportunity to have an inquiry made by a Committee of the Senate. The Government felt that a case had been made out for an inquiry, and they had no objection to a Committee being appointed by the Senate to investigate the claims of Captain Strasburg. I have to thank the Government again for now giving me the opportunity of moving the adoption of the report, and for going out of their way to do it. I shall be very brief, but I think it is due to the Senate that I should put a few facts before it. The Committee was appointed by the Senate on the 3rd August. It met, examined witnesses, and reported back to the Senate on the 18th August. If that does not establish a record, at any rate it shows a considerable degree of expedition and a care for economy in expenditure by the Committee. The Committee did not call witnesses unnecessarily after it thought that it had sufficient evidence before it. The claims of Captain Strasburg for a gratuity arose from the fact that for six months in Rabaul he gave valuable service to the Commonwealth as a member of the Expeditionary Force.

        <para class="block">Captain Strasburg, unfortunately, could not receive that commission. Although for nearly thirty years - for twenty-five years at least - he had been a naturalized British subject, he was not a natural-born British subject, and only natural-born British subjects can get commissions in the Royal Naval Reserve. That he was a member of the Expeditionary Force was borne out by the documentary evidence of every officer under whom he served, and by the documents submitted to the Committee. One document signed by the late General Holmes - who was  Colonel Holmes  in charge of the expedition at one time - gave a certificate that the claim put forward by Captain Strasburg was for services which had actually been performed. There was no evidence except that document, but the Committee was placed in a fortunate position, immediately that document was tabled, in that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cox</inline> recognised the -writing in the signature as that of the late General Holmes. In other correspondence, and in every reference to Captain Strasburg by every officer, he is designated &#34; ActingLieutenant Strasburg.&#34;  Colonel Watson,  who was at one time in command, in statements to the Defence and Navy Departments, referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Strasburg</inline> as  &#34;Acting-Lieutenant Strasburg.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Livesay,</inline> of the Naval Department, in giving his report, stated that Captain Strasburg was still on the books of the <inline font-style="italic">Berrima,</inline> and was retained in the service atRabual after the <inline font-style="italic">Berrima</inline> had left. <inline font-weight="bold">Major Heritage,</inline> who was the military commander of the expedition that captured several vessels - the capture of those vessels was due to the navigating skill and knowledge of the waters possessed by Captain Strasburg - said :  - </para>

          <para class="block">Captain Strasburg fulfilled the conditions set out in those two paragraphs. He was a member of the Expeditionary Force which went to New Guinea, and that has been acknowledged by every officer who served there. That he was borne on the books of the <inline font-style="italic">Berrima</inline> is . proved by records of the Naval Department, and further by the statement on the cover of the report he is referred to as &#34; J.Strasburg, Acting Lieutenant,R.A.N.R.,&#34; under date of 18th August. I do not wish to weary honorable senators by unduly debating this matter, but I think the report and the information I have given during the brief time at my disposal proves that he has loyally and faithfully . performed the duties allotted to him. The Navy Department took the view that, as it did not gazette Captain&#39;. Strasburg as a lieutenant, he was not a member of the Forces; but that is not sufficient. If it had been endeavouring to prove that he was not a lieutenant it would have succeeded, but it could not prove that he was not a member of the Forces. He did all he was capable of doing, and performed his work in an exceptional manner owing to his knowledge of the waters and his ability as a navigator. He gave valuable information to the authorities, and that was admitted by every officer under whom he served. The documents which have been quoted in the report bear out all I have said, . and the recommendation of the Committee is to be found in paragraphs 9 and 10, which read - </para>

          <para>I agree with the findings contained in paragraphs 1 to 8, inclusive, and 10. I am unable to concur in the opinion expressed by the majority . in paragraph 9. In my view, as Captain Strasburg was not a member of the Naval Forces, he is not eligible for a war gratuity under paragraph (c) ofsection 3 of the War Gratuity Act 1920, but I consider him morally entitled to receive an amount equal to the war gratuity. </para>

A majority of the Committee hold that he is eligible, and every member of the Committee admits that he is morally entitled to a gratuity. In view of the consideration shown me by the Government in supporting the appointment of a Committee. and also in giving me the opportunity of moving the adoption of the report, I have no desire to delay the Senate longer; but I feel sure that honorable senators, having regard to the information submitted, will not place any serious obstacle in the way, if the report is adopted, even at this late hour, of justice being done to Captain Strasburg. </para>

            <para>. - I merely desire to say that the Government have not the slightest objection to this motion being carried, and, further, that they are prepared to pay the amount which would be due to Captain Strasburg as a war gratuity if he were legally entitled to a gratuity, but not as a gratuity. The Committee has found, on excellent evidence, that he was either legally or morally entitled to it, and the Government therefore are prepared to pay him an amount equivalent to what he would have received as a war gratuity. In reading the report, however, I had to consider to what extent the Government might he involved if the amount were paid as a gratuity, and to ascertain what effect it might have apart from this case. Up to the present it has not been possible to complete our inquiries, but the Government will make the money available as an allowance. I must leave it at that for the present, as we shall have to determine the result of the inquiries now being made. Captain Strasburg will, however, get the money. We have to consider how many others may claim to have been members of the Forces. Personally T do not say he was not a member of the Forces, but that is a legal point which could not be settled *by the Committee. Although the Department may have used the term &#34;Acting Lieutenant,&#34; it is quite obvious that its use was ultra-legal, because, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> pointed out, Captain Strasburg could not hold a commission, and therefore no undue weight should be attached to the use by the officers of the term &#34; Acting Lieutenant.&#34; The main point, I imagine, is as to whether Captain Strasburg will get the money to which he would have been entitled as a member of the Forces, and, as I have already said, the amount will be paid. The manner in which it will be paid, however, must remain in abeyance for a few days. </para>

            <para>In the absence of any definition of the &#34;Naval and Military Expeditionary Force&#34; in the _ Act, I  should  certainly be disposed to advise that he waa a member of the Forces, even though he was not a member of the Military or Naval Forces.
