                        <para>- I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs if he is aware of the fact that a request was recently made by a firm producing marble in Queensland to the Tariff Board for an increase in the duties on marble, and that the Board replied that an increase could not be granted, because the price then being paid for imported marble was higher than the price paid for the local article? Is the Minister further aware that the statement has been made by the Queensland firm that owing to a substantial drop in the price of Italian marble, requests for the local article have fallen off ? As these statements are in direct contradiction, will the Minister have the question of an increase in the duties on marble brought once more under the notice of the Tariff Board, with a view to their further consideration ? </para>

                            <para>- A statement appeared in a section of the Melbourne press which was certainly of a very alarming character. It was said that, during the trouble about the <inline font-style="italic">Biloela,</inline> people were going about with loaded revolvers in their pockets, and that additional police had been brought from the country into Darwin. A full statement of what appeared in the press was telegraphed to the Administrator. He has replied that the statement is misleading, mischievous, and absolutely inaccurate. Three additional policemen were brought into Darwin, but that was in order that they might be sent into another part of the country to capture aboriginals who had murdered two men on a cattle station. The Administrator reported that there was no disorder, nor was there any threat of disorder, in Darwin. </para>

                    <para>. - It will probably assist honorable senators to readily grasp the meaning of the message from the House of Representatives if I point out its purpose and effect. The Senate made a series of amendments, one consequential upon the other, in clause  51,  and subsequent clauses, in which the words &#34; references or&#34; were put in before the word &#34; appeal.&#34; It is now found on further consideration by the draftsman that this creates an ambiguity. The House of Representatives accepts the idea covered by our amendments, and the proposals it now submits represents merely better draftsmanship. The purpose of the amendment made by the Senate in clauses  51, 52,  and  53,  dealing with appeals to the Board, was to include also references to the Board. It has been pointed out by the draftsman that if our amendments were allowed to stand, a reference to the Board would also connote a reference to a Court. Another place, while avoiding that difficulty, has inserted such words as will give effect to the desire expressed in the Senate.  I move  - </para>

It appears that, owing to the hurried manner in which the alterations were made, there was a possibility of certain anomalies creeping in. I am quite satisfied that what has been done in another place will more effectively meet the situation. The amendment will insure that both references and. appeals shall be governed by the clause which enables the appeal to be taken further. </para>

It is desirable that we should have the power of registration over these foreign companies, because that is one way in which we may keep a watch over some of the trusts that are operating notably in the meat trade. It enables the Government to get necessary information, upon which, at any time, if necessary, action may be taken. This Bill simply keeps the regulations alive for another year. </para>

                <para class="block">This is  a  simple measure, the purpose of which is to continue the principle of bounty payment for the production of oil from shale for another year, and to increase the amount of bounty on the production of smaller quantities. It is hardly necessary to discuss the question at any length. We are all fully seized of the importance to Australia of the production of oil. Unfortunately, so far,  science has not solved the economic problem of extracting oil from the enormous shale deposits in Australia at a cost which meets the commercial requirements of the country. I am still hopeful, however, that, eventually, science will succeed. We all realize what a tremendous advantage it would be to Australia if we could discover large supplies of liquid oil in this country, but we must also remember that liquid oil, like all other mineral deposits, is not inexhaustible, and that the time must come when we shall have to depend upon the production of oil for power purposes in some such manner as is indicated in the provisions of this Bill. It is. therefore, very desirable that we should keep in mind the necessity of prosecuting the experiments for the extraction of oil from shale. .The Shale Bounties Act of &#39; 1907 provides for the payment of bounties on crude oil at the following rates: - On oil produced in any one year, up to 3,500&#39;,000 gallons, 2&#163;d. per gallon; over 3,500,000 and up to 5,000,000 gallons, 2d.; over 5.000,000 gallons and up to 8,000,000 gallons,  1¾d.,  and over 8,000,000 gallons, 1-Jd. The period of the bounty when first enacted was for four years, and the amount provided under the Act in any one year was &#163;67,500, making a total of &#163;270,000. Under the Act passed in 1921 the period for the payment of bounties was extended for one year until 31st August. 1922. The total amount of bounty paid from the inception of the Act in 1917, until 30th September, 1922, was &#163;113,000, representing a total output of 12,000,000 gallons of crude shale oil. ,The average annual amount of bounty paid has been &#163;22,000. This Bill proposes to extend the period until 31st August, 1923, and to increase the rate from 2id. to 3|d. per gallon on crude oil up to 3,500,000 gallons. The bounty rate for quantities produced over 3,500,000 gallons will remain as at present. The Tariff Board have fully investigated the cost of producing oil, and the facts show that a rate of 3&#163;d. per gallon is necessary. The works are employing up to 420 men, and as the industry is of great importance to Australia, I trust honorable senators will support the proposal. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. it has not only produced oil, but another liquid that is known to a good many, the name of which I need not mention, but which is duly appreciated over a thirsty world. This industry should be encouraged. The internal combustion engine is now being extensively &#39;employed, 0and without it we could not have had flying machines, submarines, I might also say motor cars, and no one would wish to go back to the day when we had to do without these progressive agencies. The shale oil industry was first established in Australia in 1862 to work one of the richest shale oil deposits yet discovered. There is a great lack of knowledge on the art of some concerning  the  extremely rich deposits in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- That has been our  experience, although the men who have been controlling the indus. try in New South Wales have been closely associated with the business in Scotland, and not only understand how to conduct it economically, but also how to handle the by-products, which are of considerable value. Under the Premiership pf the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid Free Trade was introduced. That was the first cold blast the industry had to withstand, and it perished as soon as Protection waa withdrawn. When honorable senators have the opportunity they should visit the property at Joadja and see the ruins of a once thriving town; and I am sure they could not but be impressed with the &#34;enormous size of the retorts, and the means of treating and handling the shale. It is in a most beautiful spot in Hew South Wales, and is not sufficiently appreciated.. It is not very far from the well-known Moss Vale. It is worth a visit. even for a holiday, if only to see something out of the common. That is not by any manner of means the only place where shale oil has been produced in New South Wales. At Joadja Creek the deposit is extremely thin. It decreases in parts to 4 inches of shale, and, consequently, the cost of mining is very high. Shale is thicker in other localities, but nowhere is it so extremely rich in oil as in this particular place. I speak as a practical miner, who was engaged in this industry in the Old Country. Shale exists in, probably, every State of the Federation, and it is only a question of whether it is sufficiently rich in oil contents to be a commercial proposition. For these reasons I heartily support the proposal that we should do all in our power to encourage the industry. </para>

                    <para>We know that in recent years much activity has been shown in sinking oil wells. Unfortunately, we have not met with much success in that direction. That question is too big for me to be able to say whether the industry is likely to be a success;- but the mining of shale provides a sure and certain supply of kerosene and its many by-products. The vital consideration is whether it is possible to make a commercial success of mining the deposits. I dare say that in the course of time cheaper methods of handling will be discovered, although I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that men who have been connected with this industry all their lives have spent large amounts of capital and devoted much time to trying to treat the shale with new retorts and. the most modern appliances. There is no industry that I can recommend to honorable senators as being more deserving of encouragement. </para>

                            <para>- Let me direct attention to one incident which has been of very great concern to the motor trade in Queensland. The Acetate of Lime Factory . erected on the Brisbane River during the war period to produce high explosives from molasses, which is a by-product of the sugar &#39; cane, installed a power alcohol plant. T think I am right in saying that the whole of the requirements of the Government for internal combustion engines were supplied by the plant. In addition to the interesting developments that were made by the plant at the Cannon Hill factory, a market was found for a waste product of the sugar cane which, at the present time, is being poured into the sea to the extent of&#39; thousands upon thousands of gallons. It is to be deplored that such a valuable by-product is not being utilized. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company are making power alcohol in Sydney from molasses, but on account of the  unfortunate situation of many of the sugar mills, much molasses cannot be sent from Queensland to Sydney, and the company have to obtain it from overseas. When the Acetate of Lime Factory was in full working order in Queensland, a contract was let to a firm of shippers in Brisbane, and a boat was fitted up to bring the molasses from North Queensland and deliver it to the Acetate of Lime Factory by gravitation. The factory made some valuable experiments in the production of power alcohol, besides using up a valuable by-product of the sugar industry. It was shown, both by tests made by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and the motor trade, that power alcohol could compete more than favorably with petrol in driving internal combustion engines. It was stated, as a result of tests, that there was less carbonizing, and greater speed and power per gallon were obtainable, from power alcohol than from petrol. I have taken the trouble to work out some figures regarding the quantify of molasses available in Queensland for the manufacture of power alcohol, and I have ascertained that at the present time there is being turned into the river and sea enough molasses to manufacture 200,000 gallons of power alcohol. I think this industry should come under the provisions of a bounty. When I said that the industry had not received the encouragement it deserved, the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> interjected a remark about the prospectuses of companies. I may remind him that some very substantial prospectuses have been issued of companies floated recently for the production of oil, including shale oil, especially in Tasmania. The difficulty regarding the production of power alcohol is that it is necessary to denature the spirit in order to render it useless for human consumption. That was a difficulty the Customs Department had to face. A certain formula, was submitted by the Bundaberg Distillery Company. The company were manufacturing rum in very large quantities. They found that the quantity very much exceeded the demand, and consequently they had to turn their attention to the manufacture of other commodities. They were also manufacturing methylated spirit, which has a limited market in Australia, with the result that to-day they are turning out more than they can sell. The Bundaberg Distillery Company has been giving its attention to the manufacture of power alcohol, and the. manager recently told me that he had been negotiating with the Customs Department to obtain a formula in order to make the spirit proof against human consumption, but he was unable to get any such formula that would make it possible to manufacture the spirit at such a price as to compete with petrol. </para>

I brought the matter under the notice of the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers),</inline> and as soon as I got him interested he had it looked into by the chief chemist in the Department. Then some satisfaction was obtained. It was not until a number of Queensland members waited on the Minister at Parliament House that we were able to make any progress at all. A number of formulae were submitted, and there was every indication that they would answer to the requirements of the Department, but the Department adhered to its expensive formula. The Minister was sympathetic, and afterwards we induced the Department to accept a formula. I think there is now a fair chance of producing power alcohol economically. </para>

                            <para>- The molasses that have been wasted are badly needed for the&#39; feeding of stock all over the Commonwealth. The Bill represents a praiseworthy effort to put Australia on an independent .footing in the matter of oil supplies. At present we are de. pendent upon the mercies of two foreign corporations. There is the Standard Oil Company of the United States of America, and that equally bloodless cormorant, the British Imperial Oil Company. Although every other commodity has come down in price, oil is 400 per cent, dearer than in pre-war times, and those foreign corporations, are getting the benefit. One of them has given the utmos&#39;t trouble to the Australian authorities when they endeavoured to make the company contribute its fair share of income tax by reason of the profits made by it in this country. </para>

                    <para>There seems to be at least one inconsistency in the Bill. According to the Minister&#39;s statement an allowance of 2&#163;d. in the past has been inadequate, yet the present proposal is to extend that bounty for only another year. What is required is an extension of the period of payment, rather than an increase in the rate. People who put their money into oil ventures want to know how long the Government assistance will continue. What is required is continuity, but the bounty is to be paid for another twelve months only. That is a short-sighted policy, and it is a contradiction of the very intention of the Government, who say, on the one hand, that the bounty is insufficient, and, on the other hand, that they will cut it down- to twelve months. I would prefer to see the old bounty continued for a longer period. People would be more likely to embark capital in this enterprise if they could depend on the payment of the bounty for five years. I hope that- before twelve months are over the Government will see the necessity of extending the period for the payment of the bounty, because it seems to me that it is somewhat of a contradiction to raise the rate of bounty and at the same time provide that it shall operate for a period of only twelve months. People will calculate the cost of an enterprise of this kind on a cash basis, and I hope that before twelve months have expired the Government will come forward with a more matured policy, and that, even though they should reduce the amount of bounty they will extend the period over which it will be paid. </para>

                        <para>. - I welcome this measure and the proposed increase in the rate of bounty as an instalment of a policy that has been shaping itself in my mind for some time for the development of our varied mineral resources. There is some force in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has said, and provision might be made for the payment of the bounty over a more extended period than is proposed in this Bill, but I have no doubt that if the offer of the bounty leads to substantial development in the exploitation of shale deposits, the Legislature will have sufficient sense to continue the bounty year by year if that should appear to be the most satisfactory way of assisting the industry. The possibilities in the exploitation of shale are very great throughout Australia, especially in New South Wales, and more particularly in the State I have the honour to assist in representing. A substantial attempt is being made by a private company to exploit the shale deposits of Tasmania at present. They are very close to the seaboard, and no difficulties of transport are presented. It is merely a question of the discovery of a satisfactory process. As a mining proposition there is no doubt that the exploitation of the shale seams will be successful. That the shale contains oil, and up to  50  gallons per ton, is beyond all doubt. The problem is to instal a process that will be satisfactory, in view of the peculiar nature of the shale in Tasmania. It differs from similar deposits in other parts of the world, so much so that scientists have called the Tasmanian shale &#34; Tasmanite.&#34; There is something in the composition of the Tasmanian shale which differentiates it from what is ordinarily called disodile. There are millions of tons of this shale awaiting exploitation. I welcome this Bill as a genuine effort on the part of the Administration to assist in developing the varied oil resources of the continent of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- There are certain reasons for that. It is not a matter of money, but of the protection of the community. We do not want to place in the hands of thoughtless people something which might lead to disaster. When the difficulty to which I have referred is overcome, there is little doubt that power alcohol can be produced on a commercial basis. </para>

                            <para>- I recognise the value of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foil&#39;s</inline> contribution to the debate, and I assure him that the national importance of the matter to which he has referred will not be lost sight of. It is not a question of bounty, but of the difficulty of denaturing the spirit. I differ from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch&#39;s</inline> suggestion to extend the time over which bounty should be paid. Every one interested in this industry knows that any Government which may happen to be in power must recognise the value of continuing the industry by the payment of a bounty if that is shown to be necessary. It would be unwise for the Government to undertake to pay the bounty for five years whether the industry required it or not. We are hopeful that science will solve the problem of the economic treatment of oil-bearing shales. If that can be done, and if within twelve months oil can be produced at the current rate of value, why should the Government continue to pay the bounty for another four years, when it would not be required? </para>

                    <para class="block">Commonwealth, and the States have arrived at an agreement for sharing the cost and the responsibility. The Commonwealth will provide &#163;115,000, and the States &#163;85,000, the States bearing that amount of expenditure on a population basis. The State Governments will, further, be responsible for assembling and preparing the exhibits, and placing them on board ship. From that point the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government commences. There will be a Commission controlling the Exhibition so far as our portion of it is concerned. The Commonwealth will be represented by the Prime Minister and two of his colleagues, and the States by the Premiers, with five gentlemen selected from outside, so it should be a thoroughly efficient and representative body. Not only is it desirable that we should take the fullest advantage of this rather unique opportunity to display Australian products, and in that way get an advertisement, but it is thought that our representation at the Exhibition will be a very useful aid to those efforts which we are all desirous of making to promote our trade with the world at large. I may add that it is intended during the six months that the Exhibition will be open to arrange that the cafes or refreshment rooms associated with it supply meals of Australian products. In this way we shall bring home to the visitors in a practical form the excellence of the products of this country. </para>

            <para>I wish to reply to a question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> in which he asked that a statement be made regarding sulphur. An announcement has been made in another place by the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers),</inline> and I hoped to be in a position to make a similar statement in this Chamber. It is not, however, practicable to give the full particulars at this juncture, but the honorable senator will be able to peruse the full statement, if he so desires. I may, however, say that the duty provided in the 1921 Tariff on sulphur is in effect. Applications have teen received for permission to import sulphur for manufacturing purposes free of duty for use where sulphuric acid is not suitable, and these applications are being considered by the Tariff Board. The Tariff Board is also considering the question of sulphur for superphosphate manufacture in Western Australia, as there is no sulphuric acid produced in that State. </para>
            <para>I desire to take this opportunity, which will probably be our last meeting before Christmas, to express the hope that honorable senators will find the Christmas holiday an entirely enjoyable one, which will, of course, imply that they will overcome any difficulties which may present themselves between now and then. We have had a very strenuous session, particularly during recent weeks, and I venture to say there has been camaraderie in this Chamber during the whole time. Not one angry word has been spoken, and that is, I think, indicative of the spirit, which always prevails in this branch of the Legislature, and the spirit in which we separate on this occasion. I desire to express, sir, on behalf of the Chamber, its recognition of your conduct as its Presiding Officer. You have occasionally, with concern to us, called us to order, and, might I say, not before we have deserved it. We have probably felt the rebuke at the time, but no one can say that you have erred, and if at all, it has been on the side of courtesy and leniency. It is due to you and to your conduct in the chair that unpleasant incidents have been avoided, and we can look back, as you can, with every confidence in your Presidency in this Chamber. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap,</inline> as  Chairman  of Committees, has, on several occasions, taken your place, and to him also has fallen a good deal of responsible work.  His  efficiency in handling it has accelerated and not in any way retarded business. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> should go out of public life - which, for our sakes and the sake of the electors, God forbid - he can hand down to his children as an heirloom the record which he established last night in dealing with the Appropriation Bill, and concerning which he need have no qualms of conscience. </para>
            <para>I desire also, on behalf of the Chamber, to express our thanks to the officers of the House. </para>

                        <para>- It is a matter of doubt if we should not offer them an apology rather than an expression of thanks. They have had a very difficult duty to perform. Their burdens which would have been light if confined to this Chamber have been very heavy indeed when taken in conjunction with the work entailed in the two branches of the Legislature. The Senate, I am sure, extends its appreciation to them for the manner in which they have stood up to a very difficult job. </para>

                    <para>. -  As this is the last opportunity I shall have for some time I desire to say a few words on a very important matter which I endeavoured to introduce last night. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> congratulated the  Chairman  of Committees <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Bakhap)</inline> on the manner in which the Appropriation Bill was disposed of, but I think the  Chairman  of Committees was a little too expeditious and passed the Bill at a speed which seems to have staggered at least one leading light in the journalistic world. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I do not intend to delay the Senate for more than a few minutes, but I desire to say that the problem of the Northern Territory is a vital one. It is regrettable that the report of the PublicWorks Committee was not presented to Parliament until the last moment, but for that the Government cannot be blamed. It is unfortunate, however, that we shall not have an opportunity of dealing with it. The Leader of the Government in the Senate said he had not read it, and having regard to the rate at which we have been working for the last few days, it has been impossible for honorable senators to study it. The point that may not have been grasped by South Australian senators is that the bulk of our population is around the coast. That is so palpable that if we travel 250 miles inland we soon get to the edge of settlement. In the Northern Territory the spread of population will be around the coast, so the State which would naturally be expected to develop that portion of Australia would be Queensland. </para>
                <para>Railway access is the second most important factor in the settlement of the Northern Territory. This is a question that has been agitating the minds of the people in Queensland for the last ten years. The most rational railway extension would be a line through Queensland to Mataranka. Railway connexion between Queensland and the Northern Territory was favoured by Lord Forrest, and at the present time I understand the Queensland Government are willing to extend the line from its present terminus to Camooweal if the proposal of the Public Works Committee is carried into effect. I regret that we have no proposal from the Government for such a connexion. We have large ideas about immigration and development, and I submit that Western Queensland is as suitable for that purpose as any other part of Australia. We have in the city of Melbourne newspapers which are continually telling us what to do ; but, so far as I can see, their outlook is limited by the River Murray. </para>

                        <para>- I like to be reasonable. I make one exception to my statement about the metropolitan press of this city. The evening paper has, in some respects, shown an Australian spirit. It has enunciated a principle which I believe in and have written about recently. It has said that in our financial outlook for the next few years we ought not to be possessed too much by the spirit of economy, and should not consider that our only hope of financial security lies in cutting down every penny of expenditure. I believe, with that journal, that we should &#34; spend money bravely &#34; where it is obvious that we will get a fair return. I submit that one way to spend money &#34;bravely,&#34; and in a spirit of true economy, particularly in view of our large immigration and developmental ideas, would be to connect the Northern Territory by railway with Queensland, and open up the western area of Queensland. If a line was taken from Camooweal down to Eromanga and Hungerford, it would open up 30,000,000 acres, 5,000,000 of which could be closely settled, as closer settlement is understood in the western part of Queensland. We had a Bill before us the other day dealing with immigration. </para>

It would not do to place there a Liverpool clerk or a Glasgow factory hand; but for people who know something of farming, those areas are suitable for closer settlement. An alternative proposal is for a line through Boulia to Birdsville, and in this I notice the Public &#34;Works Committee has indicated a belief. I have read carefully a condensed report of the Public Works Committee&#39;s report, and it suggests to the mind of the reader that the direct North-South line does not find full favour with the Committee. </para>

Lord Forrest, when he was in the Federal Government, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook considered that a railway connexion between the Northern Territory and Queensland, apart from the north-south or east-west routes, was so much in the interests of the Northern Territory, as well as of Queensland and the rest of Australia., that it should be provided. It would have pleased me if the Government had come down with some proposal in that direction. I realize that they have been under a disadvantage through the report of the Public Works Committee only reaching Parliament within the last few days of the session. I understand that the Queensland Government are anxious to have the Camooweal connexion made, and are prepared to extend the existing railway system to that point, in order to open up the gulf country to the north. </para>

                <para>As a new and comparatively young member of the Senate, the duty of speaking to-day on behalf of the Opposition has fallen, no doubt, on somewhat unworthy shoulders. I regret that my leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gardiner)</inline> is not present. He has been ill, we know, and I think that it is illness that prevents him from being present this morning. I am sure that honorable senators will sympathize with him. Having had to act as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s deputy</inline> during his absence, I wish to thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> for the courtesy and consideration you have at all times extended to me. I came into this Chamber having read about and witnessed parliamentary proceedings often enough, but I have now come to the conclusion that an ounce of practice is worth more than a ton of theory. It is much easier to tell the other man how to do a job than to do it oneself. Although you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> may have seemed a little bit harsh at times, no doubt the fault has been all my own, and I appreciate the help you have extended to me. Whilst I have endeavoured to hit hard, I have always tried to give fair treatment to opponents. I may have been somewhat cutting in my remarks at times- </para>

As one of the new members of this, the first Parliament that I. have been connected with, I appreciate the kindness I have always received from the members of the &#34;Government, and also the officers who assist Ministers. This good feeling and cooperation makes parliamentary life a great deal happier and lighter than it would be under other circumstances. I am fortunate in not having to face the electors this year, as my friend <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator MacDonald)</inline> must. I do not remember having had any brushes with the honorable senator. We all, wish him all sorts of good luck personally, but from a political point of view I hope he &#34;hits a fence,&#34; because I do not agree with the ideals he advocates. The experience he has gained during the short time he has been a member of the Senate will, no doubt, be of very great value to him. I have made many friendships among honorable senators, and I hope that they will be life-long, irrespective of political beliefs. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> have been most courteous and helpful to one who is prone, at times, to infringe the Standing Orders. Instead of being severe on me, you have&#39; tactfully put me on the right course. I think every honorable senator has appreciated the kindness and assistance of the members of the Government and the officers, and  I  wish them - although the festive season is some distance away - the compliments of the season. </para>

I am quite safe in assuring <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that the Senate- as a whole, and every member of it, heartily reciprocates his good wishes, because they would be quite as emphatic in the expression of good wishes to him.

                <para>As  President  of the Joint House Committee, I wish to join in the expression of appreciation by the Leader of the Senate to the staff of the Senate and to members of the refreshment-room staff, who, although at great inconvenience during late sittings, have always been prompt to attend to our wants. The whole staff, have displayed diligence, and have been of material assistance to honorable senators in the discharge of their parliamentary duties with the least possible inconvenience and in some cases with enjoyment. Personally, I have to thank officers of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff and other officers of the Senate for their unfailing courtesy to me and the valuable assistance they have rendered me on every occasion in administering the affairs of the Senate and of the Parliament. </para>
                <para>In conclusion, as many members of the Senate and of another place are about to face the periodical contest to which all parliamentarians must look forward, I express my hope that the casualties will be very few. I like to see old faces on the re-assembling of Parliament. &#34; A fellow-feeling makes us wondrous kind,&#34; and when a member of the Parliament has rendered good service to the country the electors should appreciate his efforts by returning him again. Every, honorable senator and member of another place who must go to the. country will carry with him nothing but the best wishes from me. I hope that after the strenuous contest which must ensue, the following festive season will be as happy as we could wish, and will be enjoyed by all to the fullest possible extent. </para>

                    <para>.- As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. Millen has specifically and very kindly referred to  myself, I, as the officer subordinate to you, sir, in this Chamber, wish to add a few words to those which have fallen so happily from your lips. I have had a good deal of experience of the officers and attendants, and I must say that I indorse everything that has been said regarding them. It was my good fortune, when I first entered this Chamber, to make the acquaintance of the then  Clerk  of the Senate and his assistant. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boydell</inline> and to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Upward.</inline> I would have made but a sorry  Chairman  of Committees had it not been for the loyal assistance and advice given to me from time to time by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Monahan,</inline> who has been promoted to the position held by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boydell.</inline> In a lesser degree I am indebted to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. U&#39;Ren,</inline> who carries out the functions which were intrusted to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Upward</inline> whenIfirst entered this Chamber. I am very much indebted to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. Millen, who was my political leader when I first came here, and who has led &#39;this Chamber for a considerable time with conspicuous ability. He has set us all the example of never permitting anything that may be said in the heat of parliamentary debate to rankle in our bosoms. He has referred very happily, and finely, to that spirit of camaraderie which undoubtedly exists amongst members of this Chamber which represents the nation in the highest and, I hope, the best possible form. If I have shown, as undoubtedly I have, some shortcomings in filling the position which the Senate thought fit to confer upon me a year or two ago, let it be said I have only followed the example of, I think, a very great individual who is said to have nodded sometimes. If Homer nods sometimes, even a poor  Chairman  of Committees may be permitted a similar privilege. </para>

These criticisms are well within the province and competence of representatives of the electors of Australia, but honorable senators who are also members of the legal profession consider the work of the Parliamentary Draftsmen of the highest order of merit. I feel sure that I am properly, if unworthily, echoing the sentiments they conveyed to me. </para>
                <para>I think with yourself, sir, that there will not be very many vacancies in our ranks after the elections. I have expressed a similar hope on previous occasions, but this time I speak feelingly, because I have to put on my armour, in common with many of my brother senators, and go forth to battle in the vast forest of blue pencils. I hope that we shall come through the conflict triumphantly, and will for years to come be in a position by the exercise of our mental faculties to assist the nation to get the best out of life. I hope that we shall see Australia flourish increasingly, that it will add to its population, and will each year become of still greater importance in the councils and ways of the world. If unfortunately some of us should fall by the wayside I hope it will be shown that the electors have sent men to this Chamber who are philosophers as well as senators. I hope we shall follow the advice of Kipling, and whether we are successful or unsuccessful, will face the issue in the spirit which the poet recommended - </para>
