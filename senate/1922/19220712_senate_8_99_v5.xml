                            <para>- I have not seen any press references to the matter, but from other sources I think I knew what is in the honorable senator&#39;s mind. The South Australian Government have been negotiating with the Commonwealth Government for the carrying on of the work of building WarService Homes in that State, and have asked for an amount larger than that which the Commonwealth Government believe should be given to that State for the coming year. The Commonwealth Government propose in their Estimates to make available a lump sum for the building of War Service Homes, the amount to be apportioned to the several States on an enlistment basis. South Australia will get her quota. </para>

                        <para>. - In trying to do justice to this rather time-honoured institution, the Address-in-Reply, I must confess, as one who has had a little parliamentary experience, that I have had conflicting opinions &#39;about it. At one time, I thought it was something of a parliamentary superfluity to spend time in discussing subjects which, in the natural order of things, would come before Parliament either in the hammering out or materializing of Bills, or in the very many opportunities that present themselves to the inventive minds of members of Parliament under our present procedure. I thought that it would be well to abolish the practice, bub I am one of those who believe that we can live and learn; in fact, we can learn as long as we are alive and sane. I am. afraid there is very little hope for any one who thinks that there is nothing left- for him to learn in regard to this particular function of Parliament - the presentation of an address to  His  Majesty&#39;s representative in Australia - but it serves one useful purpose that appeals very much to my mature judgment. It provides an opportunity for members of this Parliament, and of every other Parliament which indulges the practice, to express their opinions freely, voluntarily, and unguardedly on the many public acts of administration that have happened in the interval since Parliament was last called together, as well as on important public events of vital concern. A few things have happened since we were assembled here last year in regard to which I think the Government will be very much the better for some friendly advice. We have only this means, short of the rather drastic action of moving a no-confidence motion in the Government, which we, as supporters of that Government, cannot do without appearing in a not very creditable light, of expressing our opinions. Therefore, we have to appear, according to our lights, as candid friends of the Government in giving utterance to our views on the many events that have occurred since we last met arising out of legislation, administration, or any other cause. </para>

Unfortunately, after six months&#39; experience of the new Tariff, instead of finding it a panacea for all political evils, our fears, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake Brockman</inline> has rightly said, rather than our hopes, have been fulfilled to the utmost. We see now the spectacle of important works like those at Broken Hill closed down. This is the principal manufacturing enterprise in this country, but the Tariff does not keep it going. Why ? </para>

                            <para>- If you give a. dose of medicine to a patient, and he does not improve, the remedy is to give him a  double dose, and kill him. I believe that, under any circumstances, taking the present temper of public bodies, and of the public into account, the evil cannot be remedied by Tariff legislation. On the other hand, the consequential and relative effect is that while we have not succeeded in encouraging our secondary industries, we have put a crushing burden upon those engaged in , the primary industries of this country. That result was predicted by the few intelligent members of this Chamber when the Tariff was before us. The Speech from the Throne stated that primary producing is regarded as the main source of the stability and prosperity of this country, but we find that the main source as thus defined has been systematically and vitally struck at as a result of the passage of this Tariff. Mere words are no help. It is about time that we asked ourselves whether the Government was warranted in bringing down such a drastic piece of legislation. In the first place, it did not encourage secondary industries, and in the second place, as I and others predicted, it has had a vital and deadly effect upon that most important element in the industrial community, namely, the primary producer. I could see all this when, it was coming. </para>

                    <para>Amongst the throng of ladies and gentlemen - for the supporters of the Tariff had enlisted the other sex under their banner as importuning lobbyists - who were in this chamber when the Tariff was being discussed, and within twenty-five paces from where I now stand, I saw Messrs. Cuming  Smith&#39;s  chief  representative,  who told me that the price of fertilizer would not be&#34; raised above its then price of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> 2s. 6d. I had hardly reached Western Australia before the news came through that the price had been raised to the present price of &#163;6 12s. 6d. That is an example out of many that I could quote of the inducements that were held out to members of this Chamber in order to secure ill-considered votes to bolster up industries already established and sufficiently protected. These votes had the effect of putting a crushing burden upon those who were already over crushed. I cite that as an example, and pass on. I only say that as the result of the play and inter-play of opinion on this subject the public of this country will be so re-awakened as to acknowledge that an extra and an unduly excessive burden has been placed upon the primary industries of this country without any correlative advantages having been derived. Why have we any respect for the policy of the Government when we know that they were warned of its effects, and when it does not agree with the policy determined by the electors of the Commonwealth when they voted the Government into office? </para>
                    <para>Other things besides the Tariff have happened. The Ministry has been reconstructed. All Ministries have to undergo that; but in regard to this particular reconstruction, all I can say is that I congratulate, if I may. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> on his elevation to Ministerial rank. In regard to those Ministers who have been relieved of their responsibilities, all I can say is, keeping in mind what has been done and said since tha war period&#39; and before, and the amount of fidelity that has been shown to the Government, and particularly to its&#39; Leader, that if that gentleman is responsible for the change, he has a strong weakness for ignoring the ordinary claims of common gratitude. I am aware that political exigencies sometimes call for changes; but I do not think that -where such _ a marked degree of loyalty has been dis&#39;played under most trying circumstances, those men should have been tossed overboard, and new loves and new associations brought in, or sought to be brought in - people whom we know made their loyalty depend upon the toss of a coin, or abandoned their allegiance and were openly hostile to the Government. If the Leader of the Government or the Government itself is going to discard the old associate who went with them through the dark jungle, where enemies were on every side ready <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> pounce upon them like a garrotter in, the dark, and to cast aside a faithful ally, they are running counter to the maxims - fidelity and gratitude - that govern ordinary civilization to-day. I hope that there is another side to the picture although I cannot see it - and that, instead of adopting the cute and cunning method of indulging -with smiles,  wooings,  and preferment those whose fidelity and loyalty were not only questioned, but had not any existence, consideration will be shown for those who have been most faithful allies during the most critical time in the history of the nation. </para>
                    <para>Looking at the position of the Senate in regard to the reconstruction of the Cabinet, we find that this Chamber has at present two Ministers with portfolios. The other portfolios, which are the allimportant ones, are held in the other Chamber. Whoever is responsible, whether the head of the Government or the Government themselves, is acting in a way that must have no other effect than that of casting an unwarranted slur on the Senate. At the initial stage of Federation, there seemed to be a desire to place this Chamber in a somewhat inferior position, notwithstanding the coequal position with the House of Representatives that the electors of the ! Commonwealth deliberately said it should occupy. When the Parliament first assembled in 1901 there were in it a number of leading political figures from, the various States, such as ex-Premiers and others, whose claims, .1 suppose, had to be recognised in some shape or other, with the result that the other Chamber received the lion&#39;s share of the representation in the Cabinet. If the world is to be told that the Ministry should be composed of members of both Chambers, and that some sense of fair play should be recognised, I desire to know why the Senate has not its relative proportion of the portfolios. It may be argued that the members of another place are superior, but I repudiate that suggestion absolutely. I claim that the members of this Chamber are quite the equal to - no better and no worse than - those of the Hons&#169; of Representatives. </para>
                    <para>For some time after the inauguration of Federation, the Senate was given only meagre representation in the Government. The Fisher Ministry put a third Minister in this .Chamber in an honorary capacity. This Administration said that it would be fair to allot three tenths of the Ministerial representation to the Senate. Then the Cook Administration came along and recognised that arrangement as equitable. Later on the Government had thrown on them the great responsibility of discharging many new functions arising from and in consequence of the war. New portfolios were added; but did they come here? No. They are in the other Chamber. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and it is a dying Department. It was once an important one, but it is coming to its dissolution sooner or later. Within a few years there will be no Minister for Repatriation. I desire to cast no reflection on either of the honorable gentlemen who have occupied the office, because I am on tolerably good terms of independent relationship with both of them, but by general consent the two portfolios which have been flung at this Chamber are the least important in the Cabinet. Who is responsible for this treatment of the Senate ? The blame must be laid at the door either of the Government or the head of the Government, because this Chamber has had nothing to do with it. If we leave out of consideration for the moment the Department of Repatriation, the either Department represented here does not come in contact with 80 per cent, of the population. Take the Post and Telegraph, the Customs, the Works and Railways, and the Treasury and Defence Departments - all these come into touch with almost 90 per cent, of the people. The Repatriation Department, even at the height of its activity, had not the same ramifications as the other Departments I have mentioned. </para>

                    <para>If it is to be understood that the Senate is deserving only of the least important portfolios, I say no more; but if it is contended that this Chamber receives its fair share of representation, I flatly disagree with the proposition. When the Fisher Ministry were in power, they had less solid support in the Senate than the present Government have. _A similar remark applies to the Cook Administration. Although the Cock Government had not as large a following in this Chamber as have the present Government, the Senate&#39;s share of the portfolios was not disturbed. The present Government have practically no opposition in this Chamber, and that is the reason, I suppose, why they have assigned to the Senate the least important portfolios in the Cabinet. The Senate deserves well, not only of the Government, but of its critics, because, unlike any other second Chamber in the world, it springs from the people, is the people&#39;s own creation, and, notwithstanding what shallow or interested critics may say, true and undiluted public opinion is here refreshingly uttered. One set of critics say that the Senate ought to be dissolved because it is failing to fulfil its functions. Another set would have us believe that it has outlived its usefulness, and has ministered to no essential constitutional function, being, therefore, so much of a legislative excrescence. Strangely enough, those two classes of critics belong to widely different sections. These two sections of radical extremists and extreme reactionaries are not represented here, and that accounts, possibly, &#34; for their ailments. Take the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> whose utterances are typical of some of the press criticisms throughout the State. Reading that paper on occasions, one would really be led to believe that this Chamber, in some ill-defined way, was not deserving of that popular acclaim, recognition, and applause which its nature and essence warrant. </para>

                    <para>Let me now take the other class of critics - those who declare that the Senate has outlived its usefulness. These radical extremists are to be found in the ranks of the Official Labour party. I do not forget that there was a time when their slogan was - &#34; Preserve the Senate. Keep it intact with all its powers.&#34; They have since become inveterate in their hatred and strong in their determination to demolish an institution which once they were so anxious to preserve. Why? I will tell honorable senators the reason after I have dealt with another matter. There are critics also who say that the calibre of the men now in this Chamber is not equal to the calibre of its members in days gone by. I am not prepared to dispute that statement very strenuously. I admit that in the early days of Federation the Senate attracted to it men, big men, from all the States. But that does not keep me from saying also of the men now in this </para>
                    <para class="block">Chamber, that although they may not be able to reach the Himalayan heights attained by those earlier legislators to whom I refer, nevertheless they are of a type just as necessary in the country&#39;s progress and development as are the others. No city is composed of high towers and spires alone. The flat roofed buildings in between are just as essential for the true development and adornment of a city as are the more ornamental class of buildings. While we have had towers and spires m our public life, I do not forget what happened when these  high-statured  men were in charge. In their time they were, no doubt, the right men in the right place. But I want to say just a word or two as to what took place then. </para>
                    <para>Honorable senators know as well as I do that while this high statuary among  our public men had untrammelled sway in the several States, we became possessed of a disjointed railway system which the mediocre men of the present day are trying to unravel from its hopeless tangle. In addition .to that disjointed railway system there grew up an aggregation of estates, east and west, north and south, with a result that our inland towns  were  absolutely strangled in their development until the small men came along, and by virtue of the legislation which they enacted these townships in the far interior of this continent sprang into prominence and prosperity for the first time in their history. We had also an area of  slumdom  in many of our capital cities. This, it may be said, was the work of &#39;the big men. At all events, as a result of the intrepid spirit of those pioneers who came over 12,000 miles, we established here a white dependency of the British Empire, but when those big men were in charge, self-interest predominated, with the result that the introduction of black men from the east and yellow men from the north seriously threatened the ideal that had been set up for this country. It took the so-called small men to rectify these grave errors in administration by the spires and towers in the earlier political world of this country. They must be judged by their work just as we, of the present generation of legislators, must be judged by the manner in which we discharge our duties. </para>
                    <para>It may be said also that, while these big men were in control, there was a very largo expenditure of public money without rhyme or reason. _ They flooded this country with borrowed money for ill-advised and ill-digested schemes, with the result that in the early nineties an unduly inflated system of credit collapsed, and we had a devastating experience of unemployment. Without perhaps being too modest, it may be said that the mediocre men at present are engaged in endeavouring to unravel the industrial, economic, and domestic tangle which resulted from the legislative actions of these big men in the political world in days gone by. I am dealing with this question in a non-party spirit. These critics, who never get down to very definite particulars, declare, some of them, that &#39;the Senate is not doing justice to its charge. I refer to the press element particularly. But I should like to know why. the press, which so unmercifully criticises the Senate, has little or nothing to say concerning the position of Second Chambers in the respective States. Take Victoria. Why does the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> never inveigh against the Legislative Council in the State Parliament? That Chamber is almost as secure in its tenure as are Lenin and Trotsky in the political life of Russia to-day. An election is rarely contested, candidates merely waltzing to position as a matter of daily routine. Yet the press of this State is as silent almost as mummies in an Egyptian tomb concerning anything the Legislative Council may do. </para>
                    <para>All thi3 leads to the conclusion that self-interest is at the bottom of the varied criticism of the Senate. There is no more effective remedy for real or imaginary grievances than an element of self-interest. In the case of the Second Chambers in the State Legislatures, silence on the part of the press indicates that the opinion of the press is more clearly reflected in those Chambers than in this Senate. </para>
                    <para>It is said that the Senate has failed to be a States House. This involves cue of two impossible conclusions; either that the Senate should yield to each State something more than that State&#39;s subscription to the common pool, or there is a kind of Pandora&#39;s Box external to the whole scheme, from which fresh honours may come. Since the same small cry comes from all the States, the argument breaks down in six different places; but there is no Pandora&#39;s Box. </para>
                    <para>But long after its critics have ceased to trouble this vale of bitter tears, the Senate will live and prosper, and embed itself more firmly in the hearts of the people than any other institution I know of in this country. It is the only Chamber that will hold the scales evenly between the conflicting sec-tions in our social order. Therefore it ill-becomes any of its critics, from the Prime Minister and the Government downwards, to do anything that will reduce the Senate in public estimation, and by that means infuse a pernicious or poisonous influence in the body politic concerning the representative institutions of the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para>The financial position, is the first to be considered in the stereotyped maxim of the economists who say that &#39; &#39; finance is government and government is finance,&#34; and I am certain that that still holds good, notwithstanding the fact that economists do not  agree  with each other on many public questions. The financial position of the country, as far .is the Central Authority and the position of the States is concerned, is a matter that calls for careful and urgent attention. The Federal system, as we know, is one that has to be carried out. It is one that we cannot ignore unless there should be some untoward or unthought-of upheaval in this country, and nothing can upset the Federal system which at the present time is a part and parcel of our form of government. What has happened since Federation? Although the Federation was called into existence to- take over  certain  functions performed by the States, and to carry out other functions created from time to time, the Central Authority has been calling more and more to its aid both financially and morally all the resources of the Commonwealth, to the impoverishment and reduction of the status of the States, which are undoubtedly an indispensable integral portion of  the  Federal system. The States as such, and I have heard them described as political organizations that can be dispensed with, must continue to function. They are vastly different from what States were originally under the Constitution of which our own is a model. They do not exist merely as the custodians of law and order in the community, and bear little resemblance to States as contemplated when the American Constitution was adopted. Rightly or wrongly, the popular conception of the States and their powers has changed greatly. The function of the States in early days was merely to preserve the ring and to let those individuals within the ring have free play according to their individual judgment. The States here, according to the latter-day conception, are vastly different, because they not only keep a ring, but step down from the parapet and enter the ring themselves by functioning in the interests of the community. They engage in numerous undertakings, from running steam-ships on the north-west coast of Western Australia - as the Western Australian Government are doing - conducting hydro-electric works, as has been done in Tasmania ; and controlling tramways, as is being done in Sydney. These undertakings have had unstinted and unqualified public approval. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. &#39; The American and Australian States are functioning in a way that was never dreamed of, and our governmental system is working in a manner vastly different from what was intended, or even thought of some years ago. It is therefore about time we revised the relationship between the Central Authority and the States. Some may say, &#34;Let the Commonwealth go on absorbing everything into its insatiable vortex,&#34; as if it were driven by a huge vacuum pump, but what would happen then? We would have to begin <inline font-style="italic">de</inline><inline font-style="italic">novo,</inline> by a process of slow devolution, to undo the work we have already done. </para>

                    <para>Having said so much by way of preliminary concerning the relationship between the Commonwealth and the States, let us consider what has happened in a financial sense, because finance is the keynote to success in both spheres. We could make one financially opulent to such an extent that the other would starve and die, and that is what is happening in Australia. When the Commonwealth was inaugurated in 1901, the fathers of Federation went to some pains to compile a list for the purpose of showing the electors that a Federal system could be conducted for an expenditure of about &#163;300,000 a year in addition to the expenditure involved for acquired services. But what is the position ? I have figures to show that the spending power of the Commonwealth during the early days of Federation for all services was in the neighbourhood of &#163;3,900,000 in round figures. The next year it was about &#163;3,900,000, or even better than the previous year, and the Commonwealth waa apparently living within its means. What happened after that? Biting storms came and the good resolutions of the past were severely frostbitten. The Commonwealth went gaily on levying upon the resources of the people - upon which the States were also levying - and the position now is that in the financial year of 1920-21 no less than &#163;35,000,000 was raised by the Central Authority as  compared  with &#163;3,900,000 in the first year of Federation. The expenditure on war services and on money required for services arising out of the war are excluded from this, and the amount of &#163;35,000,000 represents the total of ordinary expenditure. </para>

The Trans-Australian railway is not responsible for as much as some would imagine. The historical fact must not be overlooked that the construction of the Transcontinental Railway was an inducement held out to the people of Western Australia to join the Federation. The railway itself is but a pre-Federation promise duly honoured. They were promised that if they entered the Federation that practical bond of union would be carried into effect before many years. The construction of the line was admitted to be necessary also as an adjunct to the defence of the Commonwealth. I might make a reference also to the Federal Capital in this connexion. It is well, perhaps, to remind the people of the good old &#34; Mother State,&#34; which I am sometimes inclined to think should be called the &#34; Mother-in-law &#34; State, because she is very troublesome unless she has her own way; that New South Wales was given the Federal Capital, not by the Convention that drafted the Commonwealth Constitution, but as the result of something that happened afterwards. It was secured by a kind of gratuitous windfall to keep her quiet. It was understood that it was the one thing that would satisfy New South Wales, and so it was given to her. I am not against it, and my vote will be given for the transfer of the Seat of Government to Canberra as soon as possible. </para>

We have to ask ourselves now, how the State authorities have fared during that time. I have the figures from the Budget papers, and propose to put them on record. I find that the revenue of the State of New South Wales in 1901 was &#163;11,000,000, and in 1920. the latest year for which I can obtain figures from the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Tear-Book</inline> it was &#163;28,000,000, which shows a very substantial increase. In Victoria the revenue in 1901 was &#163;6,900,000, and in 1920, &#163;15,800,000. In Queensland in 1901 the revenue was &#163;3,500,000, and in 1920, &#163;11,200,000. In South Australia the revenue in 1901 was .&#163;2,400,000, and in 1920, &#163;6,500,000. In Western Australia the revenue in 1901 was &#163;3,300,000, and in 1920, &#163;5,800,000. In Tasmania in 1901 the revenue was &#163;826,000, and in 1920 it was &#163;1,800,000. </para>

                            <para>- What I am concerned about, and what I apprehend honorable senators are concerned about, is the relative rates of increase in revenue of the States on the one hand as compared with the Commonwealth on the other. We must know that if we are to understand what is taking place in one sphere of government as compared with the other. I find that the average rate of increase of revenue for the whole of the States in the period mentioned was 150 per cent., .as compared with an increase of 792 per cent, for the Commonwealth. In other words, whilst in 1901, when the hymeneal banns were first published and the union of the States consummated, for every &#163;1 raised by the State authorities then, 50s. is raised to-day, as compared with &#163;9 raised by the Commonwealth. We have double laud taxation, double income tax, double death duties, and, I believe, a double entertainment tax. No doubt, for the Central power has &#34; caught the double &#34; all right. I do not know to what sources of revenue the Central Authority will not yet reach out. It may enter the spheres of Road Boards and other minor State instrumentalities, and may yet put on a wheel tax or a dog tax. </para>

                    <para>Let me now compare results in the Commonwealth and in the States for the last four years. I have referred to the financial aggrandizement of the Central Authority, and over the last four years,, as shown by the Budget, the Commonwealth shows a surplus of &#163;4,500,000. That may be considered a very creditable position for the Central Authority to occupy. What has been happening in the States during the same period? In New South Wales there is a deficit of &#163;1,760,000 over the four years; in Queensland, a deficit of &#163;544,000; in Western Australia, a deficit of &#163;2,712,000 ; and in Tasmania, a deficit of &#163;116.000. Victoria is the only State of the six which, over the period of four years, shows a surplus, and it amounts to &#163;116,000. It will therefore be seen that, over the four years ending 1921 - right up to date and &#34;right ofl the hob&#34; - whilst the States grouped as such, show a deficit of &#163;4,558,000, the Central Authority shows a surplus of &#163;4,500,000. These figures show an enormous ugly gap, representing a difference of &#163;9,000,000 between the financial position of the States on the one hand and the Commonwealth on the other. </para>
                    <para>Let us now ask ourselves how we are getting on, and what are the effects of the position. Is the Commonwealth going to impose any more taxation? I believe not, because public opinion has been aroused by remonstrances coming from time to time from various persons, including myself, and by other forms of protest. If the Federal Authority will not be stopped in its impositions upon the taxpayers in any other way, it will, in the last resort, be stopped at the ballot-box, which will indicate unmistakably the unwillingness of the taxpayers of this country to stand any further imposts. </para>
                    <para>In the last Federal Budget the position of the Commonwealth in the matter of taxation was compared with that of New Zealand. I do not know whether that was quite a fair comparison, but I noticed that no comparison was made with Canada. According to the last Budget statement, taxation here amounted to &#163;9 odd per head. We were not told what was the position in Canada, but I think I am right in. my recollection of the Canadian Budget when I say that taxation there at the same time amounted to something in the neighbourhood of &#163;7 per head. That was not quoted in our Budget. </para>
                    <para>The Central Authority of the Federation has been taking to itself every available source of revenue, and the people have been called upon to stand the strain. It is questionable whether it is a wise policy for the people of this country to permit the financial resources to be drawn upon to such an extent for the purpose of aggrandizing the Central Authority, whilst at the same time the effect is to correspondingly impoverish the State authorities to the disadvantage of the people for whom they function. </para>

                            <para>- That is true; but the different authorities function in different ways; but the trouble is the Commonwealth is &#34; flush,&#34; and the States &#34; stony-broke &#34; in comparison. On the one hand the Commonwealth can treat lavishly the people for whom it must function, because of the unreasonable power of financial extraction possessed by the Federal Authority as against that possessed by the State Go- &#39;vernments. I can give honorable senators an idea of the effect upon the people for whom the State Governments are particularly called upon to function by a quotation which will be found on page 213 of the report of a New South Wales Commission appointed to inquire into the conditions of the agricultural industry in that State and methods to improve the same. The condition of the inland people in New South Wales and in other States is very hard, indeed, and they can scarcely live and prosper whilst the State Governments are unable to come to their assistance financially because the Federal Government is placing itself in a position of positive financial opulence. Let me quote from the report of the Commission to which I have referred. </para>

                        <para>Everywhere the farmers who gave evidence emphasized how vitally they were affected by the character of the roads or by the need of railway communication. In many cases pathetic stories were told of extreme hardship to settlers and their families in the case of unbridged creeks and streams. On the South Coast, one witness, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bate,</inline> told of a district lying near the ranges, on the waters of the Upper Tuross River and its tributaries, where the road journey necessitated crossing a stream seven or eight times in order to reach the nearest town. Children going to school were naturally taking great risks where there were unbridged streams, and settlers were isolated in wet seasons for considerable periods. </para>

I am endeavouring to point out to honorable senators how impossible it is for the State Governments bo come to the rescue of inland industries, particularly because the fountain of revenue is nearly dry, and they cannot impose further taxation. The people engaged in primary production are handi-capped in consequence. </para>

                            <para>- Victoria is a compact and highly-developed State, and I am speaking of States that have yet a great deal of pioneering work to do. New South Wales, Queensland, and particularly Western Australia, are in that position. The Central Authority is reaching out its tentacles to get the last farthing from the taxpayers, and the State Governments are left without funds to build bridges, make roads, and provide railways and proper schools for the benefit of settlers. We should give the State Government&#39;s some chance to expend money in this way. </para>

                            <para>- We should reduce our taxation and give the State Governments a chance to get in some revenue to enable them to carry out their obligations to their people. The matter cannot be any more clearly explained than that. We see it quite plainly; it is as clear as the noonday sun. The States are ministering to the wants of settlers far and wide, and when a very ordinary requirement is asked for the invariable reply is,&#34;We have not the money.&#34; It is the same when a road is wanted. </para>

                            <para>- That interjection will not drag me off the track. I am referring to a State where men have to carry water 10, 15, and 20 miles, to my knowledge, because the State Government has not the money to make provision for an adequate water supply. If honorable senators are satisfied to let the Central Authority continue getting the last farthing - if there is a last farthing left - let them vote accordingly, and dry up the only fount from which relief can come. I will neither vote for it nor approve of it. What satisfaction is it to the man in the back country who has to cart water 20 miles to be told that the Federal Authority has a surplus of &#163;4,500,000 ? When he cannot get a water supply, and when his produce is bogged in the creek, what is it to him to know that the Federal Government has a balance of &#163;4,500,000 when the State Treasury is empty. Is there any blame attaching to&#39; him if he takes refuge in language? How will it help him to get his provisions out of the creek? I am crying a halt to all this sort of thing. The Government and its Leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> who has the final say in these matters, ought to give a lead to the people of the country, and show how to make ends meet. I am not here to find fault with the Government, of which I am a supporter. Honorable senators may laugh. Something has been said about laughter and what it indicates. </para>

                    <para>I am not here to find fault with the Government unless I am prepared to give a remedy for the acts which have resulted in this lop-sided financial condition. The remedy is to begin at the start, and not to indulge in wild-cat schemes or &#39;respond to popular clamour. The Government must live within their revenue and save money. I am asked where to begin. The task is so appalling that I do not know where to begin, but I may cite the civil servants for a start. I know the ground I am standing on, and I have always had to run counter to the opinions of others. It is nothing new to me to have to come out and say unpleasant things, especially when I know that those unpleasant things are the truth. Money that should not be spent is being paid to public servants. A Commission was appointed to inquire into the basic wage and other things. Certain recommendations were made, and Parliament was appealed to. The Commission inquired into what a normal family could barely live upon, and figures were put forward based upon items of household expenditure that every man knew to be incorrect. It was said that an overcoat should last three years. Mine has lasted ten years, and I hope it will last another ten. There were ties at 4s. 6d., and this class of boots and the other class of boots. I never paid such a price as 4s. 6d. for a tie in my life. That is the Commission upon whose advice the Government acted. These doctrinaires appointed by the Government brought in a report for the guidance of the Government. It was scouted with derision by every man of sense in the land. Nobody believed it to be practicable, and the Government itself said so, But it did not stop the Government  shouting  . &#34; Something must be done.&#34; The Government said, &#34; We have a report, and although we do not believe a word of it, and it is absurd from A to Z, we must do something.&#34; There was a clamorous body of public servants who appealed, appealed, and appealed for more consideration. I have only received one appeal from the Western State. This is apparently because there is nothing more to be got. They appealed for justice, justice at the expense of every poor devil who has to fight the battle of life in an infinitely more thorny way than men in the Civil Service. In 1920, these gentlemen appealed, by all the rules of the game, to arbitration to settle absolutely and finally every dispute they had. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Starke was the man who sat and heard the thing from A to Z. He listened to a catalogue of grievances of the civil servants, and he immediately, as a result, increased their substantive wage by something like &#163;500,000. He made increases upon the already existing increase, in respect of allowances and other considerations, amounting to &#163;300,000 odd. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister must not speak too soon. The facts are set out on page 23 of the Acting Public Service Commissioner&#39;s report for last year. The order in the laughable drama was this : The civil servants had already taken advantage of the only means that are available to other bodies of labour in this country. They had their case put before the Court in a most exhaustive way, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Starke said they should get increases of, roundly, &#163;500,000 in the substantive wage. They were to get &#163;150,000 to pay off arrears, and &#163;311,000 as an annual charge. No sooner was the award on the table of this Chamber - I believe that the attendants had not wiped the first dust off it - than the Government came down and said, as a result of what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington</inline> had reported, &#34; Something must be done.&#34; What was that &#34;something&#34;? The Government made a statement in the other House, through the mouth of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline> Many statements are made through the mouth of that gentleman, and he said, on this occasion, &#34; Something must be done.&#34; He got a resolution passed by the House to the effect that &#34; something must be done.&#34; The result was to give the public servants living allowances and other allowances amounting to &#163;450,000, making a total of &#163;981,000 for the year. I want to say, in contradiction of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> that no State in the Commonwealth did what the Commonwealth did in respect to these allowances. </para>

                            <para>- And they are now reducing it, and the Commonwealth is not. If you except New South Wales, which did not grant a child allowance, but did give some sort of allowance, the position is that no other State did it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is not so fond of pointing to precedents of the Official Labour party in other matters as he is in this. The Commonwealth Government based its action on the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington,</inline> which the Government did not believe in. We have these extra increments of &#163;450,000 given to a body which had just left the Court with an award, which was placed on the table of this Chamber. When this money is given on top of that granted by the award, we are entitled to ask, &#34; What does the Government mean?&#34; It is quite true that the civil servants are not going to suffer at my hands. I want to see them amply rewarded, and that can be said just as well by a candid friend as by one who would reward them at somebody else&#39;s expense. I do not think that the public servants of this country want to be put in a specially cared for and coddled position at the expense of the community, but side by side with that it must be borne in mind that there are in the Service to-day extremists of a kind who are never satisfied, and who have carried the Service with them in making extortionate demands to which this Government has lent a too pliant ear. Half a million pounds has been granted to the Public Service in a year. That cannot be said of any State except New South Wales, where the Official Labour party were in power; but what they have done in New South Wales they are now undoing. </para>

If we were going to give an advantage to civil servants, and at the same time lever every other body of workers up to the same level, it would be making progress; but while we only raise one &#39;little section, at the expense of every other section, we are making no headway at all. I would like to see a wise policy enacted that would give all workers a fair chance of equitable advancement on their merits. I know how words can be twisted, and as a final remark say that: The tribunal that is good enough for other sections of labour ought to be good enough for the public employees; but&#39; the Government has taught the Public Service that it is not. I can never agree with that, cost what it will. </para>

                            <para>- If I demanded one, then there was something needed that should not be denied. The Commission referred to was agreed to by the Senate and the Ministry, but, so far, has not been appointed. It was one for the purpose of inquiring into the different activities of the Commonwealth, and ascertaining where one industry was getting advantages over another. It would be more useful than any other Commission yet appointed, and I shall return to that subject on another occasion. &#39;Such a Commission would ask what warrant there was for one privileged set of workers or employers being in a particularly fortunate and favorable position at the expense of others. I want to know why the coal-miners have been making &#163;2 a day, while the metalliferous workers in Western Australia and other States, who are always referred to by the coalminers as &#34; comrades,&#34; cannot earn any such wage. Why did not the present Government tell the coal-miners to go to the Arbitration Court? If the Government had had any pluck they would have done that; but instead of that they appoint Commissions, with the result that all the industrial elements have been saddled with the extra cost, to the detriment of an overwhelming majority of the workers. What was the effect of the inquiry? Simply to put up the price of coal. That could have been found out from a kindergarten. In New Zealand, it is noticed that 150,000 tons of Welsh coal was imported. </para>

                    <para>Behind the back of the Arbitration Court the Government appointed a Commission in connexion with the seamen&#39;s dispute. I went so far as to offer my own services as an engineer in order to bring those men to their common sense. The effect of the awards in the maritime disputes has been to keep freights up to an exorbitant extent. Yet this pliant Government have ignored their own Arbitration Court, allowing arrogant and selfish unions to obtain terms that they would not get from a self-respecting and independent-minded Administration. Coal has been a prohibitive price ; but the miners in Western Australia are not earning more than 15s. a day, if that, because the economic conditions cannot and will not permit of higher wages being paid. Otherwise it would mean shutting down the Kalgoorlie fields. Because the price of base metals will not allow of an increased cost of working the mines, these arrogant unions are taking advantage of the position to the detriment of their fellow industrialists. I am not opposed to any workers getting a fair wage. I will pit my sympathy for the workers against that of any honorable senator; but this Government have made themselves a willing and plastic tool in the hands of big &#39; unions, who, engaged at strategic (points in key industries, are able to obtain special tribunals and receive a wage that the industrial position does not warrant, whilst smaller unions have to go to the Arbitration Court. The result is that the field of industry is thrown into confusion, and one contributing factor is the pusillanimity of the present Government. </para>
                    <para>Being an island community a.t the very end of the earth, and being dependent on the cheapest possible means of communication with the rest of the world, Australia is in need of cheap freights. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Archibald</inline> Hurd, that leading naval authority, has pointed out that the tonnage laid up recently in British ports is about 4,000,000 tons, and in the United States of America 2,250,000, making the total amount of shipping  idle in British and American ports 6,250,000 tons. Freights, according to this authority, are as low as they were in 1913. We have a Commonwealth steamship service, but what are we getting out of it ? All I can say is that it has furnished another example of how this Government have yielded in flabby fashion to overbearing unions. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Havelock</inline> Wilson protested against the action of these same unions here, did .the Government render any assistance? The men had their way on that occasion, but the Government have at last taken a firm stand, and I am glad of it. The freight from Australia for case stuff is, on the author itv of the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce, 95s. to the United Kingdom, and to America 105s. These rates are 100 to 200 per cent, more than in the pre-war period, and the freights to Eastern countries, from Java to the northern parts of China, show an increase of from 200 to 300 per cent. There was a sorry position created to a large extent by the Seamen&#39;s Union, and Australia has suffered to the extent of the Government&#39;s inaction in that connexion. The Government should take the Commonwealth Line, and register it in London, and if the fight must come, let it be now. The Australian Line of steamships should remain on the ocean, the possession of the people, and should not be owned and controlled by one microscopical section. If the Government say that primary production is the keystone to the success of the Commonwealth, let them back their statement up by action. Failing that, they should be hurled from power with all the obloquy that such an unspirited  attitude demands. </para>
                    <para>I welcome the belated action of the Government in appointing a Commission to make inquiries into Commonwealth Departments, in order to see whether savings can be effected. It is better to do that late than never, even at the eleventh hour, and even before the elections. It would have come with better. grace if the Commission had been appointed immediately after the Economies Commission had presented its report. I welcome it as an instalment of what is going to be done. </para>

I am not a sycophantic supporter of the Government, and never will be. The opinions I hold are my own, and whether they bring me well fare or ill fare matters not to me. I am quite content to plough my own furrow, and to criticise the actions of the Government whenever and wherever I may feel inclined, and leave to the electors alone the task of saying whether I have dome my duty or not. In the present instance&#39;, I can only hope that the Government will mend their ways in these respects otherwise they will deserve to forfeit the confidence of the people. </para>

                    <para>Coming now to the Governor-General&#39;s Speech itself, I must say that I agree with hardly anything that appears in it, because, from my point of view, I do not see how we can- provide the money for the various proposals outlined in it. In the first place, we have to remember that. next year, the Commonwealth and &#34;State Governments will be called upon to renew about &#163;38,750,000 of loan money. This is an enormous sum. Some people have the idea that those who invest in loon securities will renew them when they fall due, but it must not be forgotten that a great many people invest in loan securities at under par, and expect to be paid at par when the loans mature, so as to reinvest their capital in other securities at under par in order to get an advantage in the principal in tha,t way. Therefore it would appear that a great deal of Australian loan money falling due next year will not be available again, and we must give some thought as to where the necessary new money is going to come from. I have examined the position to see what is left in the way of possible taxation,  and I find, according to the report of the Royal Commission on Taxation, that in Western Australia, on a taxable income from personal exertion of &#163;7,766, the State tax is 108. Id. per &#163;1, and the Commonwealth, taxation cm the same income is 102.375d., making a total of 210.475d., or, say, 210&#189;d., leaving to the taxpayer only 29Jd. out of each &#163;1 of taxable income. I understand that if the income is derived from property practically nothing is left for the taxpayer. Other countries are becoming alive to the situation. In Canada, for instance, the ordinary expenditure has fallen from &#167;357,000,000 to &#167;324,000,000, and capital expenditure from $48,000,000 to $16,000,000, and I may add in passing that the Canadian pension list, estimating $4| to the &#163;1, amounts to about &#163;8,000,000 per annum, as compared with the Commonwealth pension list of &#163;13,000,000, notwithstanding that our population is considerably less than that of Canada. Of course, everybody would like to advocate an increase in pension payments, but the fact that I have just mentioned is  worth  remembering. </para>

                    <para>Every honorable senator, except perhaps our Labour friends, will approve of the Government immigration proposal, though it will necessarily mean the expenditure of a large sum of money. I notice that the Premier of Western Australia <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir James Mitchell),</inline> who appears to be very energetic in this direction, has arranged to bring out 25,000 immigrants per annum. South Australia in fifty years has settled on the land 21,000 farmers, so I should think that a very large sum of money would be required to finance <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Mitchell&#39;s scheme. We are all agreed, I think, that we must insure a larger population for Australia. I am afraid our Labour friends take a short view of this project, though perhaps it is natural for any man who is in precarious employment to look askance at any scheme that will bring more men to Australia because of the fear that it may mean less work. We do not want to do that. We want to bring out more people in order to insure that there may be more work for everybody. For instance, houses must be built for the newcomers, and in other directions their settlement in Australia should lead to more work; instead of restricting employment. At least, I hope so. </para>
                    <para>The next paragraph in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech refers to the necessity for the continuous representation of Australia in the United States of America, and intimates that a measure will be introduced for the appointment of an Australian Commissioner. That will probably mean another &#163;25,000 or &#163;30,000 a year for the Australian taxpayer. A Commissioner, with his retinue, will cost a very considerable sum of money. I should like to make a suggestion which was made to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly,</inline> formerly a member of another place, that instead of having a </para>

It is becoming more and more important that a member of the Government &#39; should visit the Old Country every year and confer with the Imperial Government upon matters which so vitally affect Australia. These visits must have very beneficial results. We want always to look upon Australia as part of the Empire, and therefore a member of the Ministry should, once a year, visit England to discuss, with British Ministers, matters of common concern. It would be easy for a Minister, in the parliamentary recess, to go or return <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> the United States of America and Canada, and in that way also keep in touch with the people there. This course would not cost nearly so much as would the appointment of a resident Commissioner in the United States of America. </para>

                    <para>Reference is made in the Speech to the appointment of an Income Tax Board of Appeal, and the only objection I have to offer in this direction is that such a Board will involve the expenditure of more money. </para>
                    <para>Provision has also been made for entering into an agreement -with the Amalgamated Wireless (Australia) Limited, and the services rendered will doubtless be of benefit to the Commonwealth, the Government having invested &#163;500,000 in the venture, which gives them a controlling interest in the company. </para>
                    <para>It is also intended to undertake additional and necessary extensions in the Postal Department, and. although &#39; the outlay will be somewhat heavy, the work will be of a reproductive character. Special arrangements have been made whereby a largely increased amount of loan money will be made available, so that a continuous and progressive policy may be undertaken, extending over a period of years. Desirable as such arrangements may be, it must not be forgotten that this means further outlay. Such proposals would, I think, be generally acceptable if we had the money, and I want the Government to look carefully into that phase of the question. The paragraph further states that in order to secure the economic expenditure of this money and .the most modern system in equipment, a special expert Advisory Board will be constituted. Honorable senators will see that this means the appointment of another Board, and one naturally wonders when the creation of such Boards will cease. </para>

Necessary as the undertaking may be, we have to consider whether the time is opportune for embarking on such an extensive and costly work, when money is urgently needed for immigration and extensions in the Post and Telegraph Department.

                        <para>The  Royal  Commission estimates that the cost involved for providing a main trunk line by the conversion of the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge lines in Victoria and South Australia, and in other places, following route A, would be &#163;21,600,000. </para>

                            <para>- No. Additional costs would be involved for the items I have mentioned. Assuming that the work would he completed within five years, as provided for, these items will involve the expenditure of an additional &#163;3,000,000; so that the cost, on completion, if the work were finished in the time specified, would be approximately &#163;24,600,000. The total tonnage of goods and live stock carried over the Victorian railways during the year 1920-21 was approximately 7,273,000, and the total tonnage of goode and live stock transferred at Albury, from both directions, during a typical year was approximately 325,000. </para>

                            <para>- I presume the total tonnage of goods includes coal. The figures I have quoted represent 4.3 per cent, of the Victorian goods carried; and, if we deduct the tonnage of New South Wales goods, the percentage would be about 2.&#39; I do not intend to oppose the scheme, but I think we should have, at least, a population of 10,000,000 people before we embark upon such a colossal undertaking. It would be better to wait until conditions are more normal, as in the present circumstances the cost would bo considerably inflated owing to the excessive rates being charged for material and the somewhat high wages prevailing. </para>

                            <para>- Where the States took the matter in hand there wis no confusion. So far as I know, the epidemic waa thoroughly well handled in Victoria, and there was no confusion here, whatever may have been the case in New South Wales and some of the other States. I object, at all events, to the appointment of another Royal Commission. Let the Government take some responsibility. If they desire to improve 00-ordination, let them do so. The appointment of another Royal Commission to deal with the matter merely means putting it off for a further two or three years. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has mentioned, our very respected Leader has coordination and Royal Commissions on the brain. Yet the honorable senator was unable to secure the appointment of the Commission for which he asked. </para>

                    <para>I think honorable senators will agree that from beginning to end the Governor-General&#39;s Opening Speech suggests further expenditure. No one has more respect for our Leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> than I have. I cannot forget the magnificent work he did during the war, work which no one else could have done <inline font-style="italic">sp</inline> well. I do hope that he will now devote his boundless energy to trying to get us on an even keel financially, otherwise I am afraid that we are in for&#39; terrible times. I was a witness of one financial crisis in Victoria, when the banks closed, and I never want to see another. Civil servants were dismissed in hundreds, and people who had been well off were almost begging for bread. I hope that every effort will be1 made to set our finances in proper order, otherwise we shall have here the great distress which has been experienced in other countries. </para>

I hope that when his Budget comes along, we shall see the effect of his handiwork He is too manly to say a word in his own defence, and in submitting his Budget he never said that the Estimates were those of his predecessors and not his own. I am most hopeful that in the honorable gentleman we shall find a man who will deal with our affairs in a business way, and I trust that he will receive the assistance of the .Prime Minister in doing so. </para>
                    <para>Before resuming my seat, I may mention that I earned a certain amount of notoriety because of a few remarks I made some time ago on the Northern Territory. I take a great interest in the Territory, because I have done a great deal of pioneering work in the past. We are there up against an almost impassable barrier. It is quite clear that the great hopes we had when we took over the Northern Territory from South Australia are doomed to disappointment. I was a member of another place at the time of the transfer, and I tried my best to prevent it, because I felt that if the Territory were left to South Australia it would at any rate be economically managed. </para>

                            <para>- In the carrying out of ordinary public utilities it is very difficult for a Government to avoid wasting money, but  in carrying  out pioneering work we must always be prepared to find that some money is wasted. I am getting tired of hearing that we are keeping the North empty. I find that a very similar problem is confronting the people in Western Canada. If honorable senators will refer to the report in <inline font-style="italic">United Empire</inline> of an address by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> D. Cornhill before the Royal Colonial. Institute  in London, they will find that there is an important economic problem to be solved on the North Pacific coast of Canada. That country is as great a source of danger to Canada as the empty Northern Territory is to Australia, because the North Pacific coast is equally exposed to the millions of Asia, and the country is rapidly being taken possession of by Japanese. </para>

The rainfall is nothing, like that of Java or of the east coast of Queensland, where there is sufficient rain all the year round to keep things going. I have been informed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunt,</inline> the Commonwealth Meteorologist, that there are five solid dry months in each year in the Northern Territory. During May, June, July, August, and September not a drop of rain falls there. The grasses become parched, and if any crops are sown they are very difficult to maintain. The expenditure of an enormous amount of money in water conservation is necessary there. The rivers extend over flats, and honorable senators can imagine what working in such country would mean for white men. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-style="italic">The</inline> honorable senator has probably not grown cotton himself, but I once, planted 50 acres of it. At present an effort is being made to carry on the cultivation of cotton on mixed farms in Queensland. The cotton is a sort of side line, and the crop is gathered by women and children, and in that way the labour difficulty is overcome. I do not think that its cultivation can be carried on on a large scale. I put in 50 acres of cotton on one of our stations, and while it came up nicely, a drought came on and not a single plant survived. They are doing the best work in cotton growing towards the coast, where the rainfall is more settled. I think there is a good chance of the industry succeeding there, but I doubt whether it will succeed in the Northern Territory. There are summer rains there, and the result will probably be that the cotton will get &#34;balled&#34; - that is to say, it will get into balls and it will then be impossible to use it. People have an idea that cotton is grown in a hot country, but, as a matter of fact, it is grown in latitude 30 in the United States of America and in about the same latitude in Egypt. The equivalent position in Australia would be a little north of Sydney. If we can grow cotton in latitude 124-. which is the latitude of Port Darwin, we shall surprise a great many people. I am very  hopeful  that the industry may succeed, but the possibility of its failure is a matter that has to be considered. We have to find other tropical products which will support a large working population. Personally I cannot think of one indigenous product that will support a population. We have to take account of the rainfall. </para>

                            <para>- Cotton may be worth trying, but the point I want the world to know is that the proposition we have before us in the Northern Territory is different from that in any other part of the world. The Northern Territory is not like .Java,, It is not even like eastern Queensland, where there is now a great amount of settlement, but where it is still debatable whether the white man&#39; can succeed. From what I have heard of the Northern Territory - and I have had friends there for years - it&#39; is little short of downright cruelty to put white men there to cut down the scrub and civilize the country. One of my friends told me that he went up one of the rivers in a boat, and that when the mosquitoes rose from the mangrove in the evening the noise was like an express train passing. </para>

                    <para>I want to see this country settled for the white man and the white woman. How are we going to do it? Will honorable senators give us a scheme? It cannot be done with the cattle industry. That industry is ideally adapted to the country, but a great amount of the work is done by black boys. There is not a great deal of country fit for sheep in the Northern Territory. There remain the coastal industries and mining. As to the prospects for -mining, I know nothing. There may be mines there, but I am told not. I do not believe that cotton can be grown except on mixed farms. The only possible way to develop this Territory, I think, would be to get a big concern, something like the Canadian-Pacific Railway, to take it up. We must really know by this time the mess that Governments always make. of such work. It is only necessary to look at what the Queensland Government has done in trying to establish cattle stations. They put &#163;1,500,000 into the venture, and their losses, even after paying no rental for their Crown leases, and no taxes to the shire councils, amount to &#163;200,000.- There is a drought there now, and what their losses are going to be this year is not yet disclosed, but I think they would be pleased to get out by writing ofl &#163;1,000,000. I think if anybody would give them &#163;500,000 he could have the stations. </para>

                            <para>- T - That is so, and there is some excuse for the Government this year. The Commonwealth Government ought to make up their minds that by present methods they will never settle the Northern Territory. The only way- in which we could induce a company to take up the task would be to give concessions of some sort. The first concession I would suggest would be half the land. They would certainly deserve this if they could make the land valuable; it is absolutely valueless now, and we should be giving away something which is of no value to us, and is a positive danger. The proposal to run a railway to the Northern Territory to protect the country is a most ludicrous idea. The railway would provide the only possible means that an army would have for getting from the Territory and invading the civilized parts of Australia. No nation in its senses would ever land an army in the Northern Territory. They would not be able to feed it for a week. </para>

He said that South Australia was willing to take the Territory back, and cancel the contract. I remember those arguments in the other House years ago. How dreadful it would be, they said, to give up such a splendid asset ! Those arguments have been used in other than political circles. Having been granted half the land, the syndicate could be allowed, under proper rules and regulations, to carry out the preliminary work by employing kanaka labour, as was done in Queensland. Thus the country could be made fit for white men to live in. They might be allowed to get a certain amount of black labour from New Guinea, if it could be obtained there. </para>

When the measures referred to come before us, I hope and trust that they will receive careful consideration, and that the Government will see that we have the necessary money available. A great many of these things are most desirable, but have we the money for them ? My opinion is that we ought to concentrate on immigration, the development of the Murray valley watershed area, and one or two similar things which will give us a rapid return in filling up the continent and settling our empty spaces. I hope, even yet, that we are going to see a reduction in taxation. It will be a welcome surprise. I feel sure that if the finances of the country are well handled, as I hope they will be now, we shall achieve something in this direction. I am sorry that I cannot more heartily commend the programme of the Government as outlined in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech; but it may be that when the various measures are submitted  they will present themselves to us in a somewhat different aspect. </para>

                        <para>. -  Honorable senators have referred to the services that I was able to render to the Commonwealth at the Limitation of Armament Conference at Washington. I thank them for their kindly remarks as to my work there. It falls to my lot to reply to some of the things that have been said by way of criticism of the Government and the Governor-General&#39;s Speech by those speakers who have preceded me. I was particularly struck by the speech delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> the burden of which seemed to be1 that if the Commonwealth would repeal a number of its Taxation Acts, and allow the State Governments to re-impose the taxation - which, of course, they would do - and allow them to spend the money, &#34; everything in the garden would be lovely.&#34; But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> went further than that, and, using a word which he is quite familiar with, &#34;lambasted&#34; the Government for a lot of things for which, it seems to me, the Senate is just as responsible as the Government. It is no excuse, nor even an attempt at an excuse, to say that this Chamber, especially since the last election, has most strenuously asserted its right to deal in the most independent fashion with any legislation introduced by the Government. I have never seen any slavish following of the Government in this House. I have never seen a Government treated so independently as this Government is treated by this Chamber. The fact that all but one member of this Senate was a supporter of the Government was never any guarantee that measures were safe. </para>

                        spoke to day as if the present Government were solely responsible for the Tariff. It is a matter of history that the Tariff on the statute-book to-day is not the one that was introduced bv the Government. It is a very much higher one, and, from the Protectionist point of view, therefore, very much improved. In lecturing the Government that the Tariff was too high, the honorable senator was really administering a rebuff to this Chamber and&#39; the other House. There were no slavish supporters of the Government in the framing of that measure, and
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline>
                        was certainly not one. Did he ever cast a. vote on the Tariff out of loyalty to the Government? Every vote he gave was cast in a way which he conscientiously believed to be in the interests of the. State he represents. Will he refuse to concede to other honorable &#39; senators credit for the same conscientious discharge of their duties that he would claim for himself? When the honorable senator attacks the Tariff as an imposition on the people, he is inferentially condemning the Parliament, and especially this Chamber, which had the power to alter the Tariff - a power which not only
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline>

                            <para>- Yes. Let me apply the test which the honorable senator himself has adopted. He referred to the Post and Telegraph Department as one of the big Departments represented in the  other Chamber. He said that the test to be applied was the number of people with which the Department came in touch. Applying that standard to the Department over which I preside, the Home and Territories Department comes into touch with more people than any other, excepting, perhaps, the Post and Telegraph Department, because through the electoral law it has to do with every adult in the country. So the Department that has to administer the electoral law is one of the most important. </para>

                            <para>- It is the standard set by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline> The Leader of the Government has not lessened the number of portfolios in this Chamber. The number is exactly, as it was last session, and it represents an increase over the number in earlier periods in the history of the Commonwealth. It will be found by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> that the relative importance of portfolios has varied ever  since Federation. If he will come down with me some day to the building in which the Home and Territories Department is housed, he will notice that, in the early stages of Federation, this Department was given to senior Ministers in the Cabinet. The Department has certainly had a chequered career, and that may be some solatium to the honorable senator whose feelings have been wounded. Of the other Departments, can anybody say that there has been a more important one in the last few years - possibly with the exception of the. Treasury - than the Repatriation Department, which has been dealing with one of the greatest problems Australia has had to face, and which, in the absence of the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen),</inline> I am free to say has been most efficiently administered ? I am sure it has added prestige to this Chamber that such an important portfolio has been allocated to it. Although it may be said that the activities of this Department will decline, it cannot be stated that they are declining at present. </para>

                            <para>- No: but I have often wished I could share my work with more Ministers. We have adopted in our Constitution two distinct principles. We have the American system and to it we have added the British system of responsible government. Where ever we find a Government responsible to one House, they will naturally strengthen their position in that House as much as they can. This Government are like all others; they have the instinct of self-preservation, and if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> were at the head he would keep a strict eye on the position of the Government in another place, because he would know that the life of the Administration depended, not on this House, but on another place. </para>

                            <para>- I have had experience of two Departments, and I can say that the Commonwealth Service compares unfavorably with most of the State Departments in regard to pay, the number of people employed, and more particularly the manner in which the public servants are housed. When I returned from America recently, I naturally wanted to see what my new Department was like, and I spent a few days in inspecting the conditions under which the officials were carrying out their work. These conditions I found to be a disgrace to the Commonwealth Government. If any private employer housed his servants under such conditions he would be held up as an example of meanness and unfairness from the point of view of health and sanitation . </para>

                            <para>- I have read the annual report of the Taxation Commissioner, who complains that, while he has asked time after time for a certain staff, the Government have not made the number of appointments requested. Why should honorable senators lend themselves to an attempt to make the taxpayers - who, I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn,</inline> are already hard-hit - believe the infamous lie emanating from the press about money being wasted in every direction. I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> -where a saving could be effected in Commonwealth administration. The only indication he gave us of increased expenditure which he considered we could have saved was in regard to the cost of living allowances which were added to the salaries of Commonwealth public servants who were at the bottom of the ladder. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> waxed satirical at the Government for having paid those allowances, which, I may remark, were not based upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddingtons</inline> report at all. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> will do the Government ample justice by looking up the matter he will find, in the statement by the Prime Minister, that the allowances were based on figures furnished by the Commonwealth Statistician, not on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington&#39;s</inline> report at all. The Commonwealth Government deliberately avoided making the allowances on the basis of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington&#39;s</inline> report; and they were approved, not by the Arbitration Court or by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington,</inline> but by this Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator is now referring to the child endowment. In regard to the cost of living allowance, we simply took the difference in the cost of living between the time the basic wage was determined and the cost of living in 1921. There is, therefore, the high cost of living allowance and the child endowment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> did not differentiate between the two. </para>

                            <para>- I am not blaming the honorable senator. I am merely pointing out that this was the only Commonwealth expenditure which, in the opinion of the honorable senator, could have been avoided. Then he also suggested that if we had repealed the authority to pay the allowance, this course would in some way benefit the States. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> assumes that this Government, apparently because it is a Commonwealth Government, must of necessity be extravagant; and that a State Government, because it is a State Government, must necessarily be economical; and if Federal expenditure can be reduced and the money so saved handed over to a State Government, it will be spent more economically, and particularly in the interests of the country districts. Well, I have recently been looking over my file of the Western Australian newspapers - I dare say <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has also - and I have noticed reports that while country people have to cart water great distances, and while the State Government cannot build bridges because, so we may assume, of Federal expenditure, the State Government recently committed itself, without the consent of Parliament, to heavy expenditure for an extension of a city, tramway system, under State control, to a suburb that is already connected up with the city by a speedy ferry service. If, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> suggests, State Governments are economical, it is rather extraordinary that in Western Australia, which has a deficit  of &#163;250,000 this year, a work of this nature should be sanctioned. </para>

                            <para>- I shall come to the actions of a Labour Government presently. I am keeping the worst examples till the last. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> hold out any hope that if we cut out this child endowment and saved whatever it costs, say &#163;100,000, the Western Australian Government would build bridges in country districts rather than expend money that may be available on works such as the Como tramway ? Judging by the past the Como tramway scheme would have the strongest pull. Clearly, then, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has not much to choose between the Como tramway and child endowment expenditure. </para>

                    <para>I turn now to the State of New South Wales. I well remember, during the war, going to Sydney and finding there, at a time when the British Government were appealing to the Commonwealth Government to restrict expenditure, and at a time, too, when we were being bombarded by the various State Governments to obtain money for urgent public works, that one of the &#34;urgent&#34; public works in Sydney was the widening of an already good and wide roadway through Moore Park! <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MacDonald,</inline> by interjection, invited me to say something about the shocking example set by the Queensland Government, but I am afraid that words would entirely fail me to do justice to that subject.. When I think of the money that has been wasted in Queensland. and in the other States, judging by the comments in the various reports by the Auditors-General, I do not think there is encouragement for the taxpayers from the point of view advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline> The very fact that a State Treasurer would have more money to spend, assuming that Federal expenditure were cut down as suggested, would, it seems to me, lead a State Government into such wild extravagances that the taxpayers&#39; load would be rendered much heavier. </para>
                    <para>The basic wage allowance and child endowment policy, after all, are an endeavour to deal out substantial justice to the lower-paid branches of the Public Service. I do not think that, if we examine what was paid at the time, it can be regarded as too extravagant. I - admit that the conditions under which salaries and conditions are determined in the Public Service is anything but satisfactory. The time has arrived when the whole system should be reviewed, and one of the paragraphs appearing in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech has behind it that intention. At present the Public Service Arbitrator and the Public Service Commissioner, are both empowered to fix salaries and allowances, and at various times the Government, under public pressure, or because of absolute necessity, have been obliged to do something also in the way of rectifying what were at the time real grievances. It is obvious that under any such a system the results must  be  more or less haphazard in their nature. The system of determining salaries and allowances has to a certain extent got out of joint, and it will be the duty of the Public Service Board to straighten out these difficulties. Honorable senators will note that these measures, the Public Service Bill, the Superannuation Bill, and the Public Service Arbitration Bill are significantly bracketed together. I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> and the Senate that the Government have a definite policy in this matter. The difficulties cannot be dealt with piecemeal. The Senate will have an opportunity at a later stage to consider  the policy of the Government. I feel certain that honorable senators will realize that the Government are dealing with the matter in a manner that will do justice to the Public Service generally, and lead to greater efficiency and economy. </para>
                    <para> I think that upon reflection <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> will regret having made some of his statements this afternoon, especially the charge that the Government are ignoring the Arbitration Court and bringing it into contempt. That w,as an extravagant and altogether unmerited criticism of the action of the Government. In connexion with arbitration, the Government acted only when the Arbitration Court had failed ; not because of any inability of the Judge to deal with matters in dispute, but because the law did not allow for or could not cover the particular industry or dispute in question. Those who have studied the history of the arbitration law of the Commonwealth must admit - whether they believe in arbitration or not is beside the question - that the position of the Arbitration Court, as it has been interpreted by the High Court, is absolutely unsatisfactory. We are nominally in possession of certain powers in connexion with Inter-State disputes, but we have not the same powers as a  State &#39; Parliament, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> knows that. </para>

Has <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> forgotten the seamen&#39;s strike? Does he forget so soon how one State Government, at the very crisis of that fight, was prepared to compromise? Does he remember the request made by the State of Tasmania that communication with the island State must be opened up, even if it meant submitting to the seamen&#39;s demands? I remember, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has apparently forgotten, how the Premier of that State, proposed to man a steamer, under the terms demanded by the union. In other words, he, on behalf of Iris Government, was to surrender, and it was left to the Commonwealth to carry on the fight. In was the Commonwealth that saw it &#39;through. </para>

The only action we have taken has been in the interests of shippers, because we have placed Commonwealth steamers in competition with others. It is generally conceded that, however high freights are to-day, they would be even higher if the Commonwealth vessels were not in the trade; and I do not think we can logically blame the Seamen&#39;s Union for the high freights prevailing on overseas steamers, because the members of that organization are controlled by the union in Great Britain. The Government are just as anxious as

                        appalled me by saying at the outset of his speech that he agreed with the first paragraph in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech, but that he could not agree with any of the others.  His  criticisms, however, of many of the paragraphs were more favorable than his forecast indicated. The honorable senator referred to the expert Advisory Board proposed to be appointed in connexion with the Post and Telegraph Department, and although it is not within my province to explain the nature of the Board, I ask him., as a business man, to consider whether several million pounds sterling should be expended on technical work without the approval of expert authorities. The money is not to be spent on ordinary postal services, but on the extension of telephone exchanges and the installation of the latest telephonic and telegraphic appliances.

As the Post and Telegraph Department is constituted to-day, the adviser to the Minister is the secretary to the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department, who is not a technical man; and any advice given to the Minister from expert officers must circulate through different . channels, and this may or may not reach him. The Postmaster-General wishes to be assured that the money is being spent in the right direction, and additional works involving the expenditure of large sums of money should be undertaken on the advice of experts in the particular line involved. </para>

                        <para>Regardless of the time in which the actual work of unifying the gauges may be commenced, it is of the utmost importance that if a decision to unify the gauges is to be made, it be made promptly. It is also of as much importance to decide what is to be the standard gauge. These two questions having been decided, it will be possible, and very desirable, that officials of those railway systems which are to be changed begin immediately to adjust their plans for construction..... </para>

                    <para class="block">Many of the critics of this proposal use the arguments adduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> this afternoon, who said that if there were only so many thousands of tons of goods carried between Victoria and New South Wales last year, and that tonnage represented only a small percentage of the total tonnage, the question was hardly worth considering. I am astonished at any one who has given the matter full consideration submitting such arguments. Of course, the tonnage transferred is comparatively small. How could it be otherwise? The cost of loading and unloading in the transfer of goods from one gauge to another is prohibitive, and the use of different gauges is the surest way to prevent the development of Inter-State trade. That is the explanation of the smallness of the figures representing that trade. Do honorable &#176; members forget what happened not so very long ago? I am certain that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> does not forget that when there was a drought in the Riverina district of New South Wales, and fodder was urgently required from Victoria to keep stock alive, as a result of our brilliant railway system, every one of the terminal railway stations on the Murray was absolutely congested with trucks loaded with fodder. They could not be unloaded and loaded quickly enough to enable the fodder to be taken to the starving stock, and it is estimated that in that year stock to the value of over &#163;2,000,000 perished in the Riverina district alone. That stock might have been kept alive if the fodder could have been run straight through into the drought-stricken areas, and distributed quickly. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, as the result of our iniquitous difference of railway gauges. Any one who travels from Sydney to Western Australia, and notices the hindrances and absolute barriers to InterState trade imposed by the breaks of gauge must agree that the system we have adopted is the greatest deterrent to the development of Inter-State trade that one could invent. It would appear almost as if the several States had deliberately invented the existing systems to prevent Inter-State trade. I say that this is an urgent question, and whilst it means the raising and expenditure of money, I ask whether there is any business man in the community, who, finding his business hampered by unwieldy or unworkable machinery, would hesitate to&#39; substitute a workable system if he were in a position to do so. </para>

We have practically the same adult franchise for both, and yet with the single exception of Tasmania, although the door has been open to all the States for years, none of them have adopted the uniform rolls. I think it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> who, when Minister for Home and Territories, secured the passage of a Bill providing the machinery to enable the State Governments to cooperate with the Commonwealth Government in this matter. Only one State has done so. </para>

                        painted a very serious picture of our financial position. It must have made us feel that we shall have to be careful and watch our steps. But .the honorable senate* will agree that Australia is a young country, and is in only the initial stages of development. It is a rich country, and needs population. We cannot develop it without the expenditure of money, and it is rather a costly country to develop. With the exception of the Murray River we have no great natural highways, such as the Mississippi, in America, and to make even the Murray available for navigation all the year round, large sums of money must be spent. The test of true economy is not the amount we spend, but the manner in which and the object on which we spend money. It may be true economy to spend large sums of money in the development of a country like Australia.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline>
                        will be amongst the first to admit that the expenditure to-day in conserving the precious waters of the River Murray and making them available for the thirsty but fertile lands on its banks, is true economy.

                            <para>- Before dinner I was dealing with the question of how to reconcile the policy of true economy with the policy of properly developing the country, and it was very <inline font-style="italic">a propos</inline> that during the dinner adjournment honorable senators should have had an opportunity of hearing a very interesting lecture, and seeing pictures which indicate what a tremendous responsibility rests upon this Parliament in respect of this vast heritage of ours. How can any one living in the great cities, and knowing little or nothing of the country out back, fully appreci-ate  the difficulties of the Government? How can they realize the great cost of administration and the immense liabilities that have to be met to insure effective development? I say again that there is a true economy which is reconcilable with expenditure, and I give an instance in the Federal Capital Territory. I quite believe that if a firm of accountants were asked to investigate the Commonwealth accounts, &#39;and were to report as to the cost of government from Melbourne, Sydney, and Canberra, they would be able to show that this country could be more economically governed from Canberra than from either of the other two cities I have mentioned. The Government will be the landlord in Canberra. We shall own the land values, and shall receive any accretion that comes from the development of the Territory and the growth of population and Government Departments. I have had an opportunity of residing for three months in a city that is absolutely a political city. I refer to Washington, which exists purely as an administrative centre. It is not a manufacturing city in any sense of the term, and any one who visits it and sees it for himself must realize that if the land on which it stands belonged to the nation, practically the whole expenses of the central Government could be met but of the returns from land values. It is a city of over 300,000 people, and the land values have increased enormously, but, unfortunately, they belong to private land-owners. In the Australian Federal Capital Territory that will net be so. There are good reasons why, under Federation, the Federal Government should be housed and situated in&#39; Federal Territory. But even from the point of view of economy, I do not regard the transference of the Seat of Government to Canberra as being in any  Way  opposed to the true principles of economy, provided that the establishment of the Capital is carried out in a proper way, that money is not wasted, that the buildings are constructed in accordance with the requirements of the time, and that due arrangements are made to take full advantage of private enterprise by allowing it to do its share in the work. The policy of this Government is as soon as the buildings to be erected at the Capital are sufficiently developed, to invite private capital to come in and play its part in the development of the city. That will relieve the Commonwealth Government of a large amount of expenditure, and every &#163;1 expended in that way will go to increase revenue. </para>

                        dealt with another of our problems, namely, the development of the Northern Territory. He did not take  a  very hopeful view of the future of that part of the country. I am a student of affairs&#39; in connexion with the Northern Territory, but I have never visited it, and therefore I do not pretend to be an expert regarding its possibilities or its productive capacity. I have made it my business, however, to read as many as I can of the many reports that have been supplied to the Government regarding the land and possibilities of the Territory, and I have informed my mind in every possible way of what can be done. I am free to admit that the Commonwealth has not been very happy in its administration of the Territory, but I do not pretend to fill the part of critic of my predecessors. Whatever I may propose may, perhaps, fail also; but I do say that a large amount of money has been, wasted in  tha  Territory. I only wish that I had available one-tenth of  the  money that hae been wasted. With it I could do the things which I believe are absolutely necessary, and would give the Territory some little chance to get its natural development. It  is  a rather sin-gular thing, looking back over the history of the Territory, to find that  the  one industry that has accomplished something, the one industry that has demonstrated&#39; that it can bo carried out  Successfully -  the pastoral industry - has had the least assistance.

                        larger amounts of money have been spent on mining and agriculture than  have  been spent to assist the industry which the Territory has demonstrated  cun  bo successfully carried on there. . Let me give honorable senators a few facts as I have had thom collated for my information. Since the Commonwealth Government assumed control of the Northern Territory in  1911,  nearly  &#163;240,000  has been expended on the encouragement of  the  mining industry. Of that amount the following was granted by way of subsidy : -  &#163;7,000 to miners; amount&#39; repaid, &#163;1,000. &#163;850 to prospectors, amount repaid, &#163;210. f 2S.700 to mining companies; amount repaid, nil. &#163;10,500 for the sinking of shafts. f3,720 for Government returned soldiers prospecting party.
                    </para>
                    <para class="block">Although this money has been spent to assist mining in the Territory, it has to  bc  admitted that mining to-day is at a very low ebb. The assistance has been distributed in a manner which, in other parts of Australia, has been considered to be the best for developing industries. The Government have granted subsidies to approved prospectors for surface prospecting; granted subsidies on the  &#163;1  for  &#163;1  basis for underground prospecting; given loans to miners&#39; syndicates or companies to enable them to purchase land; made free assays and determinations of all samples sent to the Government laboratories; erected crushing, concentrating, and cyaniding plants for treating gold, tin, wolfram, and other ores; provided diamond drilling for coal, gold, copper, silver, and lead; made or repaired roads leading to a number of mining fields ; and sunk wells on the roads and. at several mining  fields.  Two  steam  tractors have been purchased for haulage purposes, and  1-J  miles of tram line and forty-five trucks were- purchased by the Government for loan, hire, or sale to miners. In order to prove where payable gold would be found in the reef of the Enterprise Mine, a sum of  &#163;10,500  was expended in sinking a shaft to a depth of  260  feet, and cross-cutting to the extent of  280  feet. Prospectors have been granted the loan of horses, camels, buggies, harness, riding and pack saddles, tents, and other camping equipment, tools, &#38;c. A sampling and storage shed has been erected at Darwin, where assays are carried out free. Investigations have been made by three well-known geologists of metalliferous parts of the Territory, and comprehensive bulletins, with maps, have been published containing their rc-  ports. In addition, a prospecting party, in charge. of a mining engineer, consisting of twelve returned soldiers, was engaged for twelve months in an investigation of the country between Darwin &#39;and the Katherine. An examination of that assistance will show that it is through no fault of the Government that little or no development has taken place in the mining industry of the Territory, and as a result of past experience I am not proposing to the Government at this juncture to spend any other money in this direction. &#34;We propose to confine our efforts to the Marranboy tin-field, where there is an up-to-date battery, which cost  &#163;22,000,  and where at the present time we are assisting the miners to put a tramline on to the field. If there are .any developments which indicate clearly that it is the duty of the Government to spend more money, and that it would bo worth while to spend more money, I shall not hesitate to come to Parliament and ask for it; but at this juncture I do not think that the facts point to that as being the most helpful way of developing the Territory. </para>
                    <para>Now let me take the agricultural industry. From  1911  to  1920  a sum of  &#163;50,000  was expended in the encouragement of agricultural settlement in the Territory.- This has been productive of practically no satisfactory result at all. Nearly  &#163;8,000  has been advanced, to settlers, of which over  &#163;5,000  has been written off as irrecoverable. Altogether some thirteen settlers availed themselves of the free blocks ranging from  300 to 600 acres at the Daly River. In order to assist the settlers in the production of agricultural products, experimental farms were established at the Daly River and at Stapleton (Batchelor), at which &#163;15,000 and &#163;20,000, respectively, were Spent. Something has been happening of recent years which, I think, is a pointer to us, indicating that the practice of the Government in doing these things itself is not the best way of developing agriculture. There is one. successful settler in tins Northern Territory, a man named  Verburg,  and honorable senators saw this evening pictures of his place, and heard <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jackson</inline> speak of his achievements. Se has constructed an up-to-date irrigation plant at his own expense, and he provides Darwin with vegetables and fruit. The policy of the Government should be to assist and encourage such men. We should see that they get 20s. of value for every &#163;1 they spend; but when, the Government itself goes into farming it has no guarantee of value for money, and certainly on the result of its experiences did not get even 10s. for every &#163;1 spent. There is another man named Zakharrow.  who1 has also been doing dome cultivation, and has produced l&#163; tons of cotton this year. The Government gave him no inducement at all ; he did it entirely on his own account, but we feel that in order to encourage him and secure him against loss, we ought to put him. in the same position as if he had grown the cotton in Queensland. If he had grown it there he would have got a guarantee of 5$d. per lb., and the Government would undertake to see that his product was taken to the ginning plant, and that the freight was paid on it. The Government did this in recognition of his pluck and as an encouragement to him to go ahead. He is located on the Daly River. </para>
                    <para>Those honorable senators who have looked at a map of the Northern Territory will have seen that there are two zones - the coastal, which is not so well suited for pastoral purposes, as the inland country, and the hinterland, which has demonstrated by actual results that it is a pastoral country. The railway to the Katherine River, which only touches the end of that hinterland provides its only means of communication at present. Cattle can be driven to the line and then trucked to Port Dar-win. On the other side of the Territory there is the Victoria River on the one hand, . and the McArthur River on the other, and these are the natural outlets for the pastoral country. </para>
                    <para>The Commonwealth Government, in their effort to assist those .pastoralists in the past, have spent a tremendous lot of money, and, I say with regret, have wasted large sums in endeavouring to run a Government steam-ship service. In order to reach either of these places from Port Darwin a steamer has practically to undergo an ocean journey, and yet an attempt was made to get a steamer suitable for both an ocean voyage and for going up tidal rivers. If a steam-ship service could be maintained to those centres it would assist pastoralists to obtain stores, and it would decrease the cost of pastoral .pursuits. I think the policy for the Government and the Parliament to adopt should be to assist private enterprise, because the individuals whose money was at stake would see that the best, steam service available, capable of coping with the trade, and yet not too extravagant, was employed. At present the Government are maintaining an altogether unsatisfactory service. It is not sufficiently frequent, and the vessel is unsuitable. I hope to get the consent of the Government, and later on of Parliament, to the granting of a subsidy, which will not be as costly as the present service, and will be infinitely better. </para>

                    <para>Another hindrance to the development of the Territory is that, owing to its small population and its vast distance from the markets of the south, freights  and  fares from Brisbane on the east, or from Fremantle on the west, are abnormally high. The steamers are infrequent,  and  every pound&#39;s worth of goods that a person in -Darwin or the hinterland wishes to buy, and every passenger fare represents an enormously increased expenditure. Therefore, there is an abnormally high cost of living. This reacts on the cost of labour, and so wages are abnormally high, with the result that people thinking of putting capital into the development of the Territory are discouraged. The question is: How can we improve the labour conditions? Obviously, the only way is to decrease the cost of labour. We should try to improve the shipping service from the east and from the west, and also endeavour to reduce freights and fares. That would lessen the cost of living, so that labour, and, consequently, the cost of production, would come down to something nearer what it is in the pastoral districts of Queensland and Western Australia. </para>
                    <para>Prior  to 1913 there were only sixty- three sub-artesian bores throughout the Territory, and since then the number has been increased to 160. Nature has done her part in supplying water to this region, and in order to secure permanent water supplies between Western Australia and across the Barkly Tableland to Queensland a complete chain of bores within easy travelling distance of each other has been put down. There are five stock routes, aggregating 2,120 miles, on all of which there will be a good supply of water when the existing Commonwealth contracts are completed about the end of&#39; this year. That is practically the only assistance which the pastoral industry has received. </para>

Even the Port Darwin wharf supplies an illustration of the lack of interest we have apparently taken in the development of the cattle industry, which is the one activity that has succeeded. The tide has a rise and fall of 28 feet. A ship lying at the wharf would be either up or down, and the cattle being loaded would have to be driven up or down a gangway. I am assured that under this arrangement the stock are knocked about to a serious extent, and trade is greatly hampered. </para>

Plans are being prepared, and have been submitted to the shipping people, who are quite satisfied with them, for a proper cattle race, and a flexible platform that can accommodate itself to the tidal conditions. This will enable cattle to be handled without injury, as is being done, I am informed, under pre-cisely similar conditions at the north-west ports of Western Australia. </para>

                            <para>- &#39;Whether they can  or not  the Government cannot alter the position, because a section in the South Australian Acceptance Act practically prevents us from resuming those lands. The leases have in some instances from eleven to twenty-two years to run. Apart from the enormous areas held, there is the further difficulty that so much money having already been spent upon the Territory the taxpayers are opposed to any further expenditure, especially seeing that the revenue from that country does not anything like meet the interest on the money invested nor meet current expenditure. Whereas the Commonwealth receives a. rent of less than 2s. per square mile, Queensland gets 12s. 6d. per square mile  for  similar country. For land on the other side, from which the Commonwealth receives 2s. a mile, Western Australia gets 7s. It is not a fair proposition to the taxpayers of Australia that large sums should be spent for the benefit  of  these pastoralists unless they are prepared to treat the general community fairly by agreeing to such an alteration of the conditions under which their land is held as will make some of that land available to other settlers, and also give the Government a little fairer rental than is now being received. I say frankly that whilst the obligation is placed upon me to outline to the Government a policy that will lead to some development of the Northern Territory, at the same time there is an obligation to see that the Commonwealth gets a fair deal also. I can only hope chat the lessees will see that it is in their own interests that there should be a consolidated Land Ordinance. At present there are in operation Ordinances under the South Australian Acts and Commonwealth Ordinances, some of the land being held under both laws, with differing conditions as to stocking, improvements, resumption, rents, and so on. If these lessees could be brought under a consolidated Ordinance, and an arrangement made whereby land could be made available in those districts where settlement is possible and will be profitable, the Government could secure  Borne  revenue to justify further expenditure. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Extension of time granted.&#93;</inline></para>

                    <para>One of the difficulties confronting the pastoral. industry in the Territory is that it is a long way back from Darwin, and io is widely separated from those means of communication which enable it to get into touch with supplies or market centres. If honorable senators will look at the map of the Northern Territory they will see that the overland telegraph line is practically the only means of communication, and yet lying on its flank are vast areas of good pastoral country, capable of producing great quantities of meat, and possibly of wool. The cattle industry is very seriously handicapped. Before stock can be shipped at Darwin they have to bc brought great distances from the various cattle runs, and assembled in time to meet any ship that may have been chartered. Yet, in some cases it takes weeks for a message to be transmitted from any centra on the telegraph line to cattle stations, and then there is the uncertainty with regard to chartering arrangements. It is possible that the charterers may be unable to obtain a ship, and accordingly cattle, after having been assembled at Darwin, may have to be returned to&#39; their stations, because at the port of shipment there is no land where cattle can be kept in anything like good condition. The handling of cattle in the Territory requires a tremendous amount of organization. For instance, it has been represented to me that if Vestey Brothers were to_ re-open for the next killing season, which I believe begins in September, they would have to start now to make the necessary arrangements for the cattle to be brought in, so distant are the cattle stations from, any centre of communication. Honorable senators will realize, therefore, how difficult it is to do anything to induce people to settle in the Territory under existing conditions, apart altogether from the certainty of hardship, due to absence of communication, in time of sickness. I have had inquiries made as to the possibility of improving the telegraphic communication. </para>

                            <para>- That is so, and the areas served would be saddled with  the liability to make up the loss to the Post and Telegraph Department. It is obvious, therefore, that it is beyond the capacity of the Commonwealth under present conditions to provide the ordinary telegraphic facilities for this sparsely settled country, but there is every reason to believe that the difficulty may be overcome by wireless. It has been suggested to me that if we were to establish a central wireless telegraph station, . capable of communicating with, the wireless telegraph station at Darwin, we could equip the pastoralists with wireless telephone sets that would enable them to communicate with the central or collecting station, which in turn could transmit the messages, either to the telegraph station or Darwin, or in the case of the Victoria &#34;River country, even to &#34;Wyndham. This scheme would bring Northern Territory pastoralists in immediate touch, not. only with the outside world, but with their markets, and they could make their arrangements for shipment with some degree of certainty. Incidentally, it would provide those out-stations with a ready means of communication in the case of sickness or any other emergency. </para>

                            <para>- I am dealing at present with the means of communication only. The Amalgamated Wireless Company, with, whom the Commonwealth recently entered into an agreement, have been in consultation with me, and at present they are preparing a scheme which I shall submit to the Government shortly with details as to the probable cost of a subsidy for the company to maintain the collecting station, and the cost to the pastoralists of wireless telephone sets. This seems to me to promise the cheapest, as well as the most effective, way to give pastoralists in those out-back areas a proper means of communication. As regards medical requirements, there is already a known system of dealing with that  prob-  lem, and that is aviation. The experiments which were conducted by the Government, under my own direction, when&#39; I was Minister for Defence, have been most successful. The aviation service to Geraldton and Derby, after the tragic mishap at the outset, has been running  with  absolute regularity ever since, and devoid of any accident, over an area of back-country that climatically is not ideal from an aviation point of view, because, during the  cyclonic  seasons, disastrous &#34;  willy-willys  &#34; are experienced in the north-west. </para>

                    <para>These conveniences which I have outlined seem, to point the way .by which, in those sparsely populated areas, medical as,sistance may be quickly made available, and mail and other parcels delivered, thus bringing to settlers- &#39; outside some of the amenities of civilization... I do not think any one of these proposals will mean very great expenditure. I am certain that the sum necessary to construct a single telegraph line to Camooweal would be more than sufficient to do all that I have suggested. But expenditure must be faced if the Territory is to be developed. If not, what is the alternative? Are we to admit failure ? Are we to say deliberately that we have attempted to develop the North of Australia .and have failed  1  Dare we say that we cannot afford to face this expenditure ? I am not unduly optimistic, but I believe that by altering and improving the conditions, and providing the pastoralists with a means of marketing their stock, we shall induce pastoral settlement and insure the greater stocking of runs. We have a ready market, at Manila, in Java, and if Vestey&#39;s works will re-open, that, too, will absorb a very large number of cattle. If settlement can be induced along these lines we shall, after all, only be repeating experiences in the southern States, where pastoral settlement preceded agricultural development. It is the one industry that has demonstrated its capacity to live and thrive in the Territory, and. I am hopeful of success in the future. 1 shall not put forward any  ambitious  proposal. Anything I submit will - bo economical, and, I hope,- practical. Everything will, as far as possible, be tried out before it is submitted to Parliament. I believe that if we can increase the capacity of the Territory in the way of stocking the pastoral areas and add to its population, wo shall make it possible for people to live there. One gentleman whom I. &#39;consulted concerning the problem before ii3 remarked that one of the great drawbacks is that the pastoralists will not live in the Territory. He does not live there himself. He simply employs as few white men as possible, and . utilizes aboriginal labour. Can we expect .increasing numbers of white men and women to live in the Territory under tha conditions that exist  to-day?  If. however, we can provide the means of communication I nave indicated,, is it not just as likely that white people will live there as (hoy are living in similar country in Queensland and in the north-west of Western Australia?&#39; </para>
                    <para>I have not mentioned the railway at all. I omitted that deliberately, because honorable senators know where I stand on that question. I have never made it a secret that I am a believer in the north south railway, and, therefore, I did not think it necessary to mention it. Apart altogether from the question of &#39; railway construction, these means of communication are essential. Even if the north-south railway  were  built, these other facilities would have to be provided. They stand by themselves. The railway would not meet the situation. Let me &#39; illustrate what I mean. When cattle are trucked through from the Katherine River to Darwin for shipment, whilst they are waiting for the steamer they arc fed on lucerne, which, in many cases, is brought from Geelong, in this State. Honorable senators can imagine the cost, and how difficult it must be to show a profit on cattle shipped in these circumstances. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Verburg,  whose name has been mentioned during this debate, demonstrated that he can grow lucerne in the Territory. I have been in  communication  with him through the Administrator, and he has undertaken to provide lucerne at a given price at Darwin for this live cattle trade. This, then, is one industry that will depend, and I hope prosper, on the export cattle trade. No doubt there are others. </para>

                            <para>- I have no doubtthat <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Verburg  will in time find means of doing other things, because he is a man of the type that made the Australian States  what, they are to-day. I can vividly recall a period in South Australia, where I waa born, where areas of. country which are to-day the homes of happy and prosperous yeomen, in my boyhood days were regarded as desert lands. At the time of which I speak, an. Englishman settled on Yorke Peninsula, where he was named, &#34; The mad Englishman.&#34; But he grew wheat where people said it could not be grown, and cultivated an orchard where older residents said that fruit-trees could not possibly flourish. That is typical of developmental history in every one of the Australian States, and: I do not think there is an honorable senator who cannot recall- similar experiences by others. While we have this policy of despair preached concerning the Northern Territory, we cannot look for the most promising results&#39;, and although I do not hold out any roseate possibility of being able to profitably grow rice and other commodities, I believe we may be able to. Primary consideration must be given to the pastoralist industry. This is the task to which I intend to devote what knowledge I have, and I believe that when the proposals are submitted&#39;, they will have the unanimous support of those who are now representing the people in this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire to offer my congratulations to the Government on the programme submitted for consideration during the present session, and I am hoping that, as this is the last session of the present Parliament, that the Government will have time to carry out many, if not all, of the proposals embodied in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech. It may happen that, by some unexpected occurrence, the Government may be defeated at the elections: - although it is very unlikely - and it is therefore hoped that effect will be given to the intentions of the Government. I have, however, sufficient faith in the electors to believe that no such&#39; calamity as the defeat of&#39; the present Government is likely to befall the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>I desire to record my high appreciation of the work done during the recess by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> who at considerable inconvenience visited every Slate  in the Commonwealth to make himself acquainted with the industries in those States. In Queensland, we appreciated very much the fact that the right honorable gentleman spent some weeks in the northern State after meeting with a serious accident, which must have rendered his work much more difficult. I believe I am voicing -the opinions of. not only the Queensland representatives in the Federal Parliament, but of the people of Queensland as a whole, when I say that we are grateful to. the Prime Minister far the active interest he took, not only in the sugar industry, but in other important undertakings in Queensland. Other members of the House of Representatives, and. some honorable senators also, took advantage of the opportunity afforded during the recess to visit Queensland, which enabled them to become acquainted with the vast possibilities which that State possesses. </para>
                    <para>May I take this opportunity of also expressing my appreciation of the valuable work carried out by the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> as Australia&#39;s representative at the Washington Disarmament Conference. I believe the Commonwealth was very fortunate in having such a capable delegate at that memorable gathering. When the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was announced, there were many who were strongly opposed to the selection; but those who were most bitter in their criticism will be prepared to admit that his tactful speeches and work generally was of such a character that the action of the Government in selecting him as our representative was more than justified. </para>
                    <para>Reference is made in the Speech to a reduction in Defence expenditure and to the  raising of a loan for extending the work of the Post and Telegraph Department.In view of the fact that many returned soldiers who were employed in the Defence Department have been dismissed in consequence of the retrenchment, ! trust the Government will push on with, the projected . extensions in the Post and Telegraph Department to enable those men who have been deprived of their means of livelihood to find remunerative employment. That phase of the question, considering the extent of the scheme proposed, may appear somewhat insignificant, but to the men, and those who are endeavouring to assist them, it is a very important one. </para>
                    <para>I wish to congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MacDonald</inline> upon his maiden effort in addressing the Senate; but I regret that in referring to the Burnett Land Scheme he should have referred to some secret conspiracy which he said existed in Federal circles, to prevent the Queensland Government obtaining from the Commonwealth a loan of &#163;2,000,000 to develop that territory. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MacDonald</inline> will peruse the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of the last session, when the development of the Burnett lands was under consideration,, he will find that the representatives of both political parties were in favour of the Government making the necessary investigations with a view to the money being made available for soldier settlement in Queensland. If the honorable senator will do that, I defy him to show in any of the debates where any representative of the State of Queensland has at any time endeavoured to throw cold water on the scheme. One of the main reasons why the Commonwealth Government refused to loan that sum was because .the Queensland Government were not prepared to lay. all their cards upon the table. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> desired certain details, which I believe he was unable to obtain ; and probably the principal reason why an advance was not made was the unsatisfactory manner in which the State Government handled the mosey advanced by the Commonwealth Government for soldier settlement. The Federal Govern-&#39; ment have, no control over land within a State, and the manner in which the soldier settlement in Queensland  has been administered is a standing disgrace to any Government. </para>

                            <para>- There are many who were previously supporters of the present Queensland Government who have now lost faith in it, and I believe that it will not be long before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MacDonald</inline> will also be a supporter of the presentFederal Administration. The present state of affairs in connexion with soldier settlement in Queensland is most unsatisfactory, and I do not see at the moment how the system can be altered. An advance of &#163;1,000 per settler is made to the State Government, of which the settler receives &#163;625 With which to develop his block, the remaining &#163;375 being retained by the State Government for constructing railways, and roads,- and for general administrative purposes. It is not fair that the Commonwealth Government should provide money for constructing railways which are an asset to the State, and which should be regarded as part of its natural development. </para>

                            <para>- No; to the general scheme. Apart from soldier settlement, the State Governments construct railways at their own expense, and do not receive advances from the Commonwealth. In settlements such as those at Stanthorpe and Pikedale, quite a number of men are leaving their holdings. Fruit-growing is an industry which does not show a quick return. The prospects are that unless something is done many more of the men will leave their holdings. If an advance of another &#163;20.0 could bo made available to the mcn, many of those who have exhausted their  credit and are now leaving their  farms  would remain on them. It is felt that the difference between the amount the soldier receives and the amount advanced by the Commonwealth Government to the State Government is too great. We were informed by a representative of. the Pikedale Settlement that an additional advance of &#163;200 to the individual soldier settlers would make all the difference between success and failure, as it would tide them over the time until their farms were productive. </para>

Where the settler has to wait n long time for his crop, it is felt that a larger advance might be made to him than . in the case, for instance, of a man growing pines, from which he can look for a return in a period of about twenty months. Unfortunately, the Queensland Government have&#39; very little sympathy with returned soldiers. </para>

                    <para>There is a matter about which I have to make a complaint against the Government. It is in connexion with the shipbuilding contract entered into by Messrs. Badman and Mayoh, of Sydney. I was a member of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee who eighteen months ago made a thorough investigation into the building in Sydney of two wooden ships, the <inline font-style="italic">Burnside</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Braeside.</inline> The terms of our reference were to give the Government our advice as to whether or not Messrs. Kidman and Mayoh should be relieved of their contract. The contract specified that the boats, before being accepted by the Commonwealth, should receive a first-class Lloyd&#39;s certificate; and because the contractors could not obtain such a certificate from Lloyd&#39;s they were unable to carry out their contract. The Public Works Committee was asked to advise whether they should in the circumstances bo relieved of their contract. We went into the matter e&#39;x-   hanstively  from every point of view. We sat taking evidence in Sydney for long hours, and right up to Christmas Eve. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland,</inline> who is a member of the Committee, was not able to get to his home until mid-day on Christmas Day. We went into details, and submitted our report and recommendations, and from that moment until the present we have heard nothing more of the matter. </para>

                            <para>- We recommended that the contractors should not be relieved of their contract. The Government hnd made progress payments up to 80 or 90 per cent, of the cost of the ships, and in my opinion they should have immediately endeavoured to secure a return of that <inline font-style="italic">money</inline> from the <inline font-style="italic">contractors.</inline> Without going too much into detail, I may say that  one reason why we recommended that the contractors should not be relieved of their contract was that when the first ship was launched it developed what is known to  ship-builders as a &#34; hogback.&#34; The ends went down and the centre rose as much as 39 inches. On investigating the reason for this, it seemed clear that the other  vessel  would develop a &#34; hogback &#34; in the same way as soon as it was launched. The members of the Public Works Committee called to their aid <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Farquhar,</inline> who is now in control of Commonwealth ship-building, and other experts, and inspected the ships with them. According to the designs ordered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curchin,</inline> certain edge bolts had to be put into the ships to strengthen them. It was represented to us that those bolts had been inserted. Upon investigation with  the  experts, it was found that in one part of  the  ships practically the whole of these bolts had been left out, and in other parts 60 or 75 per cent. of them were missing. </para>

                            <para>- I am sorry to say that we were unable to obtain some evidence we required because, in the very early stages of the inquiry, one of the witnesses whom we desired to examine committed suicide. The information we received from the experts was that if the contractors could have obtained a Lloyd&#39;s certificate for the ships, and they had been allowed to go to sea, immediately they got beyond Sydney Heads, and into rough water, in which they would work, they would have gone to the bottom. I say, without hesitation, that to send out ships in such a condition was a murderous thing on the part of the contractors. </para>

                            <para>- I will do so in justice to one of the partners of the firm, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Sidney</inline> Kidman. He is the man who found the money, and he had nothing whatever to do with the construction of the ships. I believe that he joined the firm from purely patriotic motives. He put his money into the venture without any idea of making a profit, but merely because ships were badly wanted at the time, and he desired to render a service to the Commonwealth by establishing a new industry in this country. </para>

                            <para>- It is a little difficult to explain the exact position. A longitudinal ceiling was being put in, and the contract stipulated that edge bolts should be put right through the timbers forming the ceiling, and this was not done. To have inserted the bolts after our inspection of the ships would have practically involved the taking of the vessels to pieces. It was represented to us by expert advisers that, in view of the value of the ships, the expenditure necessary to put the bolts in after our inspection would not be justified. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Farquhar</inline> and other experts advised us that the designs of the vessels were nob as good as they might have been, and that no matter what was done to them, it would be impossible to put them in good order. </para>

                            <para>- There was very fine timber used in them. If the bolts had been put in in accordance with the specifications, the ceiling to which I have referred would practically have been in one piece. There were a number of captains of American sailing vessels in Sydney when we were there, and they spoke in the highest terms of praise of the timber and materials used in the ships. The vessels were not acceptable because they had not been well and truly built I might mention that the contractors endeavoured to provide for extra tonnage,  and, as a consequence, the vessels were more bulky than wooden ships should be. Although their contract stated that the ships should be of a certain tonnage, they were to receive &#163;26 per ton. for every extra ton deadweight they provided. The contractors failed in the workmanship provided, and the vessels were not acceptable. My complaint in the matter is that no action was taken by the Government on the recommendation of the Public Works Committee, and since we reported an arbitrator has been called in. I understand that the Mayoh Brothers made certain representations to the Government, and, as a result, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Mark</inline> Sheldon, of Sydney, was called in as an arbitrator in the matter. I think it would only have been reasonable, immediately that report was made to the Government by the Public Works Committee, for some order to have been taken out against the firm, so that they would not have been able to dispose of their assets. </para>

                            <para>- There was one dissentient. On some of the motions the Committee was unanimous. I understand that the spars, masts, winches, wire ropes, and the valuable rigging of the ships have been disposed of. So far as the actual ships and the shipyards are concerned, the assets have been dwindling. The Government advanced a sum of &#163;113,000, and that money, under the terms of the Committee&#39;s recommendation, the Government should have sought to recover from the company. Eighteen months have been allowed to pass. The <inline font-style="italic">Burnside</inline> is lying at the wharf at Ryde, and the <inline font-style="italic">Braeside</inline> is still on the stocks in the same condition as when the Committee made its investigations eighteen months ago. I believe the ships have come in very useful for sleeping accommodation for tramps. </para>

I am not a legal man, but I imagine that that would have been the first thing that I would have done.

                    <para>I notice that in the programme outlined by  His Excellency,  reference is made to the Commonwealth Shipping Line, and it is stated that it is the intention of the Government to hand over the management of the Line to a body free from political control. I watch, with a great deal of suspicion the handing over of Government industries to individuals or Boards who are free from political control. We have heard statements like that in this chamber before. It is not very long ago that the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> introduced the first War Service Homes Bill, and said that certain powers must be vested in the Commissioner for War Service Homes, and that the management of the Department must be taken away from political control. This was done, and it resulted in one of the rottenest  pieces of administration that I suppose Australia has even seen. I refer to the administration of Colonel Walker, at the War Service Homes Department. We have only to look at the position in which we were landed in that case to realize what this haphazard handing over of control to individuals means. I am not in favour of State industries of any description; but if the State has industries it should itself control them. If the Shipping Line is to be owned by the Government, the Government in power for the time being should control it. </para>

                            <para>- The railways are practically controlled by the State Governments, except in regard to wages, staff appointments, and so on. Questions of policy, such as where lines should be built and the like, are decided by the Government. The present Nationalist Government finds itself in power bv reason of securing a majority of votes at the last election, and the people expect it to administer the affairs of the country. I am not satisfied to hand over, <inline font-style="italic">holus</inline><inline font-style="italic">bolus,</inline> the Commonwealth Line of Steamers to a Board of management outside of Parliament, which is not responsible to Parliament for the policy of the Line. I consider that it is our job, as a Parliament, to have the controlling voice in matters of policy. After what we did when we handed over to the Commissioner for War Service Homes a blank cheque, thereby letting ourselves in for an expenditure of millions of money, and making ourselves the laughing stock of Australia for the way in which the Department has been administered, I am not prepared to hand over a blank cheque to any Board of management for the Commonwealth Line of Steamers. I would prefer rather to see the ships dispensed with altogether. Unless it can be shown that it is absolutely necessary that the boats should be retained by the Government, I would prefer to see them dispensed with; but if we retain them, it is the duty of the Government in power to control them and the policy of the Line. </para>

                    <para>I want also to congratulate the Government on what they have done in coming to the rescue of the meat industry. A few months ago, that industry, which is a large one in Queensland, was in a very precarious condition. The Government came to the rescue with a subsidy of &#163;d. per pound, and also by negotiating with the State Governments for a reduction in fares and freights, by taking up the matter .with the shipping companies, and by approaching the meatworks employees for a reduction in wages. In this way they have been able to place the meat industry on a far sounder basis than it was on a little while ago. I very much regret that members of the Country party - men who claim to represent the primary producers - should have severely criticised the Government and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> for coming to the rescue of that great primary industry. It is strange that members of that party should criticise the Government in that respect. They&#39; evidently cannot see very far beyond their own State boundaries. </para>

                            <para>- I think they have played their part in that direction. They made such bad bargains with their stations that they had to get some money <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> try <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> balance the ledger. The employees in the meat works were also prepared to do their share, and they accepted a reduction in their wages, which saved the meat industry to the State. It may be said to the credit of all concerned that the trouble was settled by conciliatory methods at a round-table conference, and I would commend that plan to other industries in Australia suffering from unrest on account of low prices. </para>

                    <para>Now I come to the question of the War Service Homes. To-day I sought information regarding the empty houses in Queensland that were built for soldiers under the group system. Several questions were put to the Government last session concerning these houses which had not been taken over by soldiers, in some cases because of the high prices, and in other instances because they were situated too far from railway stations, or in suburbs where the fares were high. In order that the money expended should not continue to lie idle, I suggested that where returned soldiers would not occupy the homes they should be disposed of to private citizens. However, there was a scheme to let the houses on a weekly tenancy. It would have been far better to keep them empty rather than let them on those conditions. Many of the homes will remain unoccupied if they are restricted to returned soldiers, so it would be far better to dispose of them to other people. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, in some cases. Some of the houses are built at Sandgate, about 14 miles from Brisbane, and the return railway fare would amount to about 15s. per week, which is far too much for a man receiving only the basic wage to pay. Some of the premises will probably remain empty for ever, judging by the localities selected. Groups of houses were built here, there, and everywhere, apparently in the hope that soldiers would come <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the rescue of the Department and purchase the homes. </para>

                    <para>I have repeatedly urged the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> and the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hector Lamond)</inline> to keep the Canungra Mill in oi5eratio.il whether the Government intend to dispose of it or not. I have been assured that the Government are very anxious to sell the whole of the properties purchased in Queensland by the Repatriation Department. In the case of this mill, the Commonwealth has a fair asset for its outlay, but I cannot see the wisdom of taking over the property and then shutting it down. A deputation of Queensland members waited on the Assistant Minister for Repatriation a few months ago with reference to the timber areas held by the War Service Homes Commissioner in Queensland, and at the Minister&#39;s request General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> McCay gave some information as to the stops that had been taken to protect the Commission&#39;s property and dispose of the timber at Canungra and Beaudesert. It was stated that over 4,000,000 feet of timber had been sold at satisfactory prices. Only some 40,000 or 50,000 feet of timber remained there for disposal, and this was under offer at the present moment. As Queensland is practically the only State producing building pine in large quantities, I am of opinion that there would be no difficulty in disposing of every foot of timber that the -mill at Canungra could turn out. </para>

                            <para>- There is no reason why it should not be disposed of, because the private mills are all at work. Under the terms of the purchase of the Canungra Mill, the property will revert &#34;to Messrs. Leahy Brothers after a few years have elapsed, because the Commonwealth Government have only purchased the timber rights. The town of Canungra practically depended on this mill for its existence, and the closing of it resulted in unemployment. I feel sure that the Government could sell the mill better as a going concern than if the machinery is allowed to stand idle and depreciate. Certainly the timber is growing, but the time for getting it off is limited. Under present conditions the mill is simply eating its head off. </para>

                    <para>I am pleased that the Government intend to provide a superannuation scheme for the Commonwealth Public Service. This matter has been too long delayed, and I hope the question will be treated as&#34; a non-party one. I desire to bring under notice a number of matters in connexion with the Public Service, because I understand that an amending Public Service Bill will be introduced. The treatment meted out to members of the Public Service located in the Northern Territory and also New Guinea has always struck <inline font-style="italic">me</inline> as being very unfair, because they have no right of transfer to any other branch of the&#34; Service outside those tropical areas. </para>

                            <para>- I should think there would be very great difficulty in filling many of the positions in the Northern Territory. I had an opportunity only a few days ago of discussing this question with a man who had served in the tropics for thirty-five years, having been appointed there prior to Federation, and he informed me that he had had no opportunity at any time to apply for positions in the Public Service elsewhere. It seems that once a mau is sent to New Guinea or any other tropical area, there he has to stay. To be perfectly fair, a man who serves four or five years in Darwin should be entitled during the next four or five years to serve in a place like Melbourne or some other southern place. At present, as I have said, permanent officers of the Northern Territory Service have no right of transfer. This means that they must be prepared to spend their whole lives in a sparsely populated tropical town boast-  ing  no modern conveniences, amusements, or other recreations so necessary in making life worth living. The other alternative is to resign and seek employment or enterprise iii a more congenial atmosphere. This, however, for obvious reasons, becomes increasingly difficult as the length of residence in the Northern Territory increases. To a man with a growing family, &#39; the difficulties of making a fresh start and earning enough to provide for them make it too hazardous to undertake. The conditions of life, therefore, render it essential that the officer must seek respite at certain limited periods - a complete change of environment, rest, and recreation. This period at present is set at three years for a married officer and five years for a single officer. At the end of each of these periods a return passage is allowed to either Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, or  Adelaide, and one month for travelling, with a month&#39;s leave in respect of each year&#39;s service. . This enables a married officer to leave his work for four months every three years and a single officer six months every five years. The expenses for the trip, however, are heavy. A complete outfit of southern clothing for every member of the family is necessary on each occasion on which the trip is undertaken. Warm winter clothing, such as is never required at Darwin, becomes all the more necessary owing to an added susceptibility to colds and other ailments when the southern States fire reached. A married man on, say, an annual salary of &#163;400, after paying 10 per cent, for rent and &#163;5 8s. for rates, and after providing ordinary living expenses, cannot save sufficient in three years to provide and pay the fares of his children, fare back of his wife, outfits and clothing, and incidental extra expense of a holiday during three months. A single officer may, perhaps, save sufficient in five years by denying himself all except bare necessaries, but it has been repeatedly found that five years is far too long for any one to go without a holiday. The officer&#39;s health suffers, and when the holiday is undertaken he is often on the verge of a breakdown, which may necessitate medical fees and treatment during the first months of leave. After three years the efficiency of the officer is lessened, and the Department suffers through having an officer whose vitality is lowered. Interest in the work slackens and the officer is incapable of concentration, to the detriment of the duty performed. &#39; </para>

                    <para>That is the position in which Commonwealth officers in tropical areas are placed. When we remember that the return fare from Darwin to the south is &#163;50, and that the Government only provide for the fare of the officer, not of his wife or children, we can readily understand how difficult it is for any married man to scrape together enough money to enjoy anything but a mean sort of holiday. &#39; Facilities should be provided for every officer to have a decent holiday, otherwise it is hardly possible to have an efficient Public .Service in the Northern Territory or New Guinea. Some people say that Darwin is an ideal climate. It is not. If people are to stand up to their work in the Northern Territory they should be able to get away to the south every few years, .in order to recuperate. When my colleagues and I were there last year in the middle of winter, we found it  swelteringly  hot. I urge upon the Government the necessity of providing better conditions for all those employed in the Public Service in the tropics, in order to insure greater efficiency and contentment. </para>
                    <para>I wish now to direct attention to the great sugar industry of Queensland. I shall not attempt to reply- to the carping criticism of those who have made violent attacks upon the industry recently, because I cannot imagine that any member of this Parliament is likely to do anything to endanger the great primary industry of our northern State. I believe that this Government and this Parliament will guard the sugar-grower -just as jealously as they would guard the wheat grower, fruit-grower, or any other primary producer of the Commonwealth. </para>

But I shall not attempt to reply to their criticism, because my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford,</inline> as a recognised authority on sugar growing, is possessed of first-hand knowledge of all the details of the industry, and is better able to do that than I am. Nevertheless, I want to place before honorable senators some facts in connexion with the industry that will go to show how important  it is to the Commonwealth, and how desirable it is that it should not be allowed to disappear. At present about 4,000 farmers are engaged in sugar growing, and production totals over 200,000 tons per annum. The capital value of the farms under cultivation is in the vicinity of &#163;5,000,000. </para>

                            <para>- I am speaking of the value of the farms only ; . in addition, there are forty-three huge mills, tramways, refineries, and so forth. It pays in wages each year about &#163;6.000,000, and it has insured settlement in that part of Australia which, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> a little earlier in the evening showed, is causing some concern to all those who have the welfare of the Commonwealth at heart. Prior to its establishment that part of North Queensland where it is now flourishing was practically a tropical jungle. I remind the Senate that the conditions under which pioneering work is being done there are very much more severe than m connexion with the wheat-production or fruit-growing industries in the southern States. But I am not one of those who care to pit one primary industry against another. I am merely stating the facts. I may add that numerous small towns in North Queensland, as well as such places as Bundaberg, with a population of 10,000, and Mackay and Cairns, with a population of 6,000, are practically dependent upon the industry. </para>

                            <para>-  The honorable senator would not see sugar, because cutting has only just commenced. It must not be forgotten that the cane-growers in Queensland are not large planters, and many of them are not in the position of well-established grazietre and successful wheat farmers. Generally speaking the sugarcane-growers are men working in a small way, many of whom were originally cane-cutters or the sons of cane-growers. The production of sugar-cane assists closer settlement to a remarkable extent, and the employment given per square mile in sugar growing country is far greater than in any other primary industry in Australia. </para>

                            <para>-I  have made the statement, and if the honorable senator desires, he can endeavour to refute it. If he had acted as others had done during the recess and visited Queensland, he would be in possession of information concerning the industry which would be invaluable <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> him. The honorable senator displays a petty spirit,&#39; and although he claims to represent the primary producers, I know of no primary industry, apart from those in which he is particularly interested, which he has ever supported. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> had an opportunity of showing whether he was anxious to support primary industry when the protective duty on bananas was under consideration. He failed miserably on that occasion and he will find, when the time arrives, that his action is not supported by a majority of the primary producers in the Commonwealth. I ask leave to continue my remarks. </para>
