            <para class="block">Honorable senators will observe that this form is similar to the original form with the exception that it provides for a space between the groups of candidates, and for the insertion of small letters to indicate the respective groups. In the original form there was no space between the groups of candidates, and the original alphabetical letter indicating a group candidate, being a capital letter, might be mistaken by an elector for the initial letter of a candidate&#39;s Christian name. The substitution of small letters to indicate a group candidate is an obvious improvement. </para>

                    <para>- If the names of the candidates were bracketed together, it might convey to the mind of the elector that he was only required to vote- for a group, and that when he had so voted he had discharged his duty. It seems to me that the form of ballot-paper pro posed in the amendment is an improvement on the other, and is less likely to mislead the public. </para>

                        <para>- Not necessarily. The idea&#39; was to assist the elector by enabling each political party to advise its supporters that the candidates representing that party would be found in group &#34;A,&#34; &#34; B,&#34; or &#34; C.&#34; Now we find that it is not the group that is proposed to be lettered, but each candidate&#39;s name, and in a way that will make it almost impossible, except in certain circumstances, for the electors to determine to which group a candidate belongs. I do not know whether my experience has been different, from that of other honorable senators, but I have been in polling booths late in the afternoon when it was so dark that it was almost impossible to see the names of candidates, although they were printed in large letters. If very small letters are printed in front of each name, I can easily conceive that electors, and particularly those who are aged, will not be able to distinguish between them. What objection could there be to the letter being placed in front of the squares, and a large capital letter instead of a small one being used ? This would make it quite clear to the electors which candidates were grouped together. </para>

                    <para>.- I agree with the suggestion put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan.</inline> The amendment proposes to put the letter in the wrong place. It should be on the other side of the square, . and in bolder type. I can see no objection to printing the letter * A,&#34; &#34; B,&#34; or &#34; C,&#34; so large that it would instantly catch the eye of the elector, and make the ballot-paper clearer to him. We have to remember that many people: have imperfect sight; that the ballot-papers are frequently printed on inferior paper, and that some of the polling booths are very, badly lighted. Owing to these causes it is exceedingly difficult for many people to pick out &#39;the lettering. In dull places, I sometimes have difficulty in deciphering reading or writing on inferior paper, and I am quite sure that many other people have had the same experience. I do not think that the electors, after having voted for one group, of candidates, would think that they had fulfilled their duty. If they were informed that they would have to vote for seven names, they would vote for seven. If the Minister will not accept the suggestion, 1 intend to move an amendment. </para>

                    <para>. -  When I first saw the suggested ballot-paper I objected to it because of . the smallness of the letters &#34;A,&#34; &#34;B,&#34; and &#34;C,&#34; but, having examined a <inline font-style="italic">facsimile</inline> of the real ballot-paper, I have formed the opinion that, although the letters are small, they could be discerned readily in any polling booth. I. do suggest, however, that there should be a  double space between each of the squares, opposite the un-grouped candidates, in order to avoid confusion in the minds of electors. There should be as much space between the names of the independent candidates at the bottom of the list as there is elsewhere on the ballot-paper. On the sample paper the un-grouped candidates appear to be in a group at the bottom. If the letters &#34; A,&#34; &#34; B,&#34; and &#34; C &#34; are to be adopted as shown on the sample ballot-paper, it will necessitate an amendment of section 105a <inline font-style="italic">d,</inline> which we have dealt with in a previous clause1, and where we have already declared that capital letters shall be used. My whole reason for supporting this proposal is to make the issue plain, and it will clarify the position if  We  keep the groups separate and allow each un-grouped candidate to have a double space after his name, so as to make it clear that he is not in a group. </para>

                    <para>. - It is quite clear, from the comment of honorable senators, that this innovation for the &#39; purpose of enabling electors to cast their votes intelligently presents fresh difficulties every time we examine it. We could scarcely expect anything else, when we are asked to adopt a; practice that has been cast aside in the country in which it has been most exhaustively tried. There is a danger in determining .too hastily to adopt a new proposal until every aspect of it has been . thoroughly discussed, and I am afraid that, in this case, we have made up our collective mind rather hurriedly. I am reminded of an old pitcher. Every time one tries to patch it up, it breaks in a fresh place. This proposal is .an old pitcher which was discarded long ago - the ticket system of the United States of America. Previous speakers have referred to the difficulty of enabling an elector to record his choice intelligently. Let me put in a word on behalf of that much-neglected type of candidate, the man who chooses to have an independent mind on political issues, and also on behalf of another type who may not happen to be in favour with the governing body of his party at the time of an election, but who may choose to take his chance in the contest. We provide a means for that unfortunate: man to have his name placed on the ballot-paper, but we put him at the tail-end of it, because he does not happen to be the appointed and anointed of his party for the time being. Some of us, as old political campaigners, have known men in the past who would not bow the knee to party domination, but preferred to try their chances alone. Sometimes this type of candidate succeeds. More often he fails, but why should we make his failure more assured by this device, and why put additional aid to his downfall in the hands of the group of candidates who happen to be within . the charmed circle of party nominees, and whose desire is to  exclude the less-favoured candidate from the group ? In a free Democracy the independent candidate, if he is not to be encouraged, should certainly not be handicapped. Honorable senators, who have initial letters near the end of the alphabet, would, probably, like their names to commence with &#34;A&#34; or &#34; B,&#34; but, under this proposal, candidates with names beginning with &#34; A,&#34; &#34; B,&#34; or &#34; C &#34; would be put at the bottom of the list, if they did not happen to come within the charmed circle of those who bear the <inline font-style="italic">imprimatur</inline> of a party. Suppose the Labour party had three nominees. By the procedure proposed in the. Bill, they would stand an excellent chance of being placed at the head of the list, and of securing that wayward vote cast by jaded electors who cannot cast their eye down a ballot-paper. The independent candidate, however, is at the mercy, for the time being, of the very men whose special object it is to see that his name is not included on the ballot-paper at all. It is a wrong policy, and subversive of that fundamental principle of justice, of giving a chance to an independent-minded candidate, who should not be discouraged as he would be under this proposal. If such men come forward, they should have the opportunity of forming a group and having an equal chance with the white-haired boys who happen to be selected by a particular party, but contrary to past practice, they will have to place their fate in the hands of selected candidates. Is there any reason why selected representatives of a party should sit in judgment on independent candidates? If Smith, Brown and Robinson are the selected candidates of, say, the Nationalist party, why should O&#39;Brien, Edwards and Jackson, who are also members of the same party, and who wish to come forward as independent candidates, not have the same rights as the selected three? Under the present proposal they will be placed at the bottom of the list because they do not happen to be the selected representatives of any particular party. </para>

                        <para>- The Bill has not yet left our hands, and that can still be done. Surely selected candidates have sufficient political chivalry to say that, although they have no power to keep independent candidates out of the contest, they have no desire to handicap other members of their own party who are willing to have a &#34;go.&#34; Why should not Abraham Anderson or Benjamin Buckley be in their proper alphabetical order near the top of the paper instead of at the end, as is proposed ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Garling</inline> has said that the position cannot be altered unless certain clauses which have already been passed are reconsidered. That may be so, but as we are discussing the schedule, I wish to extract from the Minister an assurance that independent candidates representing any political party, although they may not have the indorsement or benediction of their party, shall have the right to come forward as members of an independent group of that party. </para>

But the Minister will readily recognise that, in such circumstances, there is likely to be two Nationalist and two Labour parties in the field, which clearly demonstrates the chaos into which &#39;this discarded ticket system is leading us.

                    <para>. -  In agreeing to clause 10 we have committed ourselves to the group system, and also to the lettering to be used. The object of the altered form of the ballot-paper is to assist some electors - not the candidates or group of candidates - who may not be as familiar with the method of recording a vote as others may be. In examining the ballot-paper, which the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> now wishes to withdraw, it would appear that the lettering may be somewhat confusing, as there may be a group A candidate named Brown, and also a group B candidate of the same name, and it might be thought by some that one was named A. Brown, and the other B. Brown. </para>

It has been suggested by some honorable senators that independent candidates may wish to form a group outside the recognised party nominees. I can quite understand a candidate from each of the three present political parties in this Parliament agreeing amongst themselves to form a group. </para>

                        <para>- I fail to see that any candidate or group will be at a disadvantage by&#39; being placed at the bottom of the ballot-paper. There must be some name at the bottom of the paper. I would advise that there should be spaces between the names of individual candidates as well as between groups of candidates. Our . intention is to make the ballot-paper as clear as possible to the elector. I direct attention to the fact that it has been the practice at elections to use a ballot-paper of one colour for Senate elections, and of another colour for elections for the House of Representatives, and if there should be a referendum taken at the time - and God forbid that one should ever be taken again at the same time as a Federal election! - a ballot-paper of yet another colour is used for the referendum. Small letters on these coloured papers would be difficult to read, and that might lead to confusion. We often hear of the number of informal votes that are cast at elections, and the purpose of the proposed amended ballot-paper is to reduce the number of such votes. I am glad to learn that the Minister intends to accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Plain&#39;s</inline> amendment. </para>

It was accepted by the Minister, but now appears in an altered form as placed before the Committee. Sub-clause 3 is not in the form accepted by the Minister and passed by the Committee. I pointed out that the clause would presuppose the existence of two different classes in the same group. It is now worded differently, and conveys what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Garling</inline> thought it should convey. I think that the approval of the Committee will be required for that. </para>

                        <para>. - I ask the Senate not to accept this proposal for recommittal. I trust that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Garling</inline> will not think me discourteous, but will realize that the Bill is in my charge. The officers of the Government are at the disposal of honorable senators, if they wish to move amendments, to assist them to draft their amendments in legal form. It is the primary duty of officers, however, to advise Ministers if they think that any drafting amendments are necessary. The officer, in this instance, has not at any time advised me that any amendment of clause 3 is necessary an order to give effect to the desire of the Committee. He contends that the clause, as it stands, does give effect to the desire of the Committee. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Garling</inline> consulted him, because the clause did not meet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Garling</inline> &#39;a view, and the officer has told me that he drafted an amendment, as it was his duty to do, at the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Garling,</inline> to give effect to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Garling&#39;s</inline> view. That does not mean that the officer admits that there is a defect. It simply means that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Garling</inline> thinks that there is a defect, and that the officer, as a draftsman, drafted an amendment to give effect to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Garling&#39;s</inline> view. If the draftsman had thought that the clause was defective, it would have been his duty to have reported the matter to me. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Garling</inline> made that statement it surprised me that the draftsman in charge of the Bill should express dissatisfaction &#34;to a private member, and not to me. *I have questioned him on the matter, and he has told me that he did not do so. He said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Garling</inline> expressed a certain opinion as to the clause, and he took that to be a request to put in form an amendment to meet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gar.</inline> ling&#39;s views, which are not the draftsman&#39;s views. It is a somewhat risky adventure to have too many cooks engaged on the business of framing this clause. The draftsman who has framed it has been engaged on the Bill throughout, and I desire <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Garling</inline> to know that, in opposing the recommittal of the clause, I am not acting in any spirit of personal antagonism to him. I feel that I must do so because I am satisfied, with the assurance of the draftsman, that the clause does carry out the Committee&#39;s intentions. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to make a personal explanation. When I spoke to the officer who handles these matters for the Minister, I placed my opinion before him, and he concurred with my view that the clause required amendment. He said, &#34; I will further consider the matter. It will be brought up again.&#34; As I had heard nothing further of it I walked across the Chamber to him to-day, and he handed me a draft proposal for the amendment of the clause. I thought that to be Minister would move it. I did not ask for it, and did not presume to move for it, but, seeing that nothing has been done, I think it my duty to draw attention to an obvious defect in the clause. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable senator has furnished evidence as to how foolish we should be to accept his amendment, because, since he first submitted it, two alterations have been made. He has now altered it so that an individual could notify the Electoral Officer that he desired to have his name included in a particular group. This would enable any candidate to have his name placed in a group without the consent of the other members of that group. The clause to which the Committee agreed is perfectly clear. The honorable senator has employed the expression &#34; name or names.&#34; That is entirely unnecessary, because the Acts Interpretation Act makes the singular include the plural, and the plural the singular, as the case may require. </para>

That is hardly fair to me, because I was not using my own language, but that employed by the draftsman. I still assert that as it now stands it means that a group can include the names of certain candidates, who notify the Commonwealth Electoral Officer that they desire to have their names included in that group with the names of the &#39; &#39; other &#39; &#39; candidates in that group. </para>

                        <para>. -  At the present time, on the acquisition of any land any leases of the land are converted into claims for compensation.. That is not always desirable, and the amendment as proposed will enable a lessee to continue to occupy the land until the termination of the lease. A case in point which will readily occur to those who have followed the acquisition of land by the Commonwealth is that of the acquisition of certain land for the General Post Office, in Perth. Similar cases may arise in any of the capital cities. Some of the land may be under occupation with&#34; shops or hotels, and the Commonwealth may not require to use that land. A claim for compensation may be made, although the lessee of&#39; the land may not be disturbed in his rights. It is obviously necessary that in such cases the Commonwealth should have the power  of  resumption, and should be able ito allow a lease of property not required to run its course in the ordinary way. A drafting amendment of this clause is also necessary. </para>

                    <para>. -  The proposed new section is intended to remove the limitations at present existing on the power to revoke a notice for the compulsory acquisition of land. The object is to enable the Commonwealth to give back land where exorbitant claims for compensation that are difficult to combat are made. The proposed section does not take away from any person on whose land a notice of compulsory acquisition may have been posted any claim he may have for damages because of the posting of the notice. But if, for some reason or another, the Commonwealth Government desire to revoke a notice of compulsory acquisition, the proposed new section will enable them to do so. That is eminently desirable, although the power is likely to be exercised only on very rare occasions. </para>

                    <para>. -  I see that the proposed new section provides that whenever any land has been acquired by the Commonwealth by compulsory process either House of the Parliament may, within thirty days, pass a resolution that the notification shall be void and of no effect. That seems to imply that an opportunity would be given for the consideration of such a proposal. I point out that the Government might delay the laying of the copy of the notification of acquisition before Parliament until the dying hours of a session, and Parliament might thus lose its, chance of exercising the power which the proposed new section would appear to confer upon it. </para>

                    <para>. -  This clause proposes to bring under the Torrens system any land required by the Commonwealth by compulsory process, which is not at the time of acquisition under that system. This will greatly facilitate any dealings by the Commonwealth with the land, and is most desirable from that point of view. Those of us who are admirers of the Torrens system will cordially approve of this clause. </para>

The clause will not give the Commonwealth Government any power to acquire such areas, as their acquisition is not permitted by the principal Act, but what it will provide for is that, if any such land is included in any notice of compulsory acquisition, the notice shall not be voided in respect of the land referred to therein&#39; which we can lawfully acquire. </para>

                        <para>- At all events, I am pointing out that the clause will probably prevent a lessee from receiving full compensation at the expiration of his term, because it disregards the fact that he may have entered into contracts to effect important improvements, and had an option of renewal which would be a valuable consideration to him. I think the clause should be so worded as to include the lessee&#39;s interest in any option. </para>

                        <para>- Well, that is the only conclusion one can draw from the honorable senator&#39;s remarks. He assumes, evidently, that* because the clause contains .no mention of a lessee&#39;s option in respect of a renewal of a lease, such a contingency is not provided for. As a matter of fact, hundreds of cases have been decided under the existing Act, and a lessee&#39;s option has always been a factor in determining the amount of compensation to be paid. This clause deals with only one phase of a lease, and that is its term. it does not take away from a lessee any light which he may hold with regard to an option for a renewal. That is covered in the principal Act. </para>

                        <para>- It is. But if a lessee holding an option for renewal of  a  lease sells the lease, he has to enter into a covenant that he will exercise his option within the prescribed period. As far as the Lands Acquisition Act is concerned, it looks to the owner of the land, and compensation is paid to the owner. The point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Garling</inline> requires a little more elucidation than has been given to it by the Minister. </para>

                        <para>- In this clause we are dealing with the term, not the interest, in a lease. There may be other interests, such as good-will. Unless an option is exercised the term is fixed definitely. How can an option  be  recognised until it is exercised? A lessee may have an option for a renewal of from five to twenty years, but until he definitely exercises his option, how can any&#39; one say what the term of his lease will be? A lessee&#39;s interest in the matter of compensation is safeguarded in the Act. </para>

                    <para>. - On a cursory reading of the clause I am inclined to think that the interpretation put upon it by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Garling</inline> is correct. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has informed us that if that be the correct reading it certainly does not convey the intention of the Government or of himself, and he has undertaken that the matter shall be looked into, and if it is found that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gariing&#39;s</inline> contention is correct, the mistake will be corrected. Personally, I am prepared to accept that assurance, &#39;although I feel strongly that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gariing&#39;s</inline> view is correct. I am sure that it is not the desire, either of the Government or of the Senate, that a man who possesses a very valuable right under a lease should, by our inadvertently passing a clause of this kind, be denied monetary compensation for a valuable right of which he is deprived. </para>

If the Government makes up its mind to acquire certain land it gives notice to the owner thereof, and the power is retained by Parliament to revoke that notice. The process obviously may take months to complete. It is, as I have said, slow, tedious, and uncertain. If Parliament were not sitting the completion of the process might take six months. </para>

                        <para>- There is a difference of opinion on that point among men who axe better qualified to speak than I am. The fact that the Government gives notice to a lessee does not necessarily mean that the property will be acquired, but it means that it will swing in mid-air until Parliament exercises the right that we have deliberately placed in its hands. When it comes to a question of compensating the lessee, it is proposed to give him the value of the lease, not at the date upon which the notification is given, but at the date upon which the lessee gives up the land to the Government. Between these two dates there may be an interval of several months. The fact that a Government is in the field as a prospective, potential buyer of leasehold property means that the value of the property becomes very much enhanced. As a result, Governments are sometimes driven to the necessity - I do not know how praiseworthy or justifiable it is - of obtaining properties, not exactly surreptitiously, but by very quiet means, so as to avoid enhancing their value in the market by reason of the suspicion that the Government is a prospective buyer. It is proposed in the Bill to give the lessee the utmost benefit of the doubt - that is to say, if there is going to be an enhancement of value the lessee will get the benefit of it. I think that is a reversal of past experience, and I think, also, that we should recast this clause so as to give a fair deal to the lessee on the one hand, and the prospective purchaser, the Government, on the other. The value that should be fixed is unquestionably the value which a Court or other machinery constituted under the Act would agree that the land was worth on the date when the notice of acquisition was given. Although the appearance of the Government in the field as a prospective buyer may, as we know it does, send values up and although that may give a tangible increase in the value of a leasehold, we propose to say that the Government must pay that enhanced value. </para>

                    <para>. - It seems to me that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> suggests that we should allow as  a  claim for compensation the increased value given to a lease by the knowledge that the Government is about to acquire the property. Has the taxpayer no rights in this connexion? Has <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> no bowels of compassion for him? What has the Government done to the lessee?&#39;. It does not do him any injury until it takes away his lease. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch&#39;s</inline> contention were upheld we would turn into a claim for compensation the increased value given to the lease between the date of notification and the date of resumption. Why should we make a present of that to the lessee? Why has he a right to take that out of thepublic revenue? We do not propose to give him that right, and the honorable senator misreads entirely the words of the clause. The clause has to be read in conjunction with, clauses 9, 10, and 11, because on the acquisition of any land any leases on it are converted into claims for compensation. The amendments that we axe making by clauses 9, 10, 11, and the one the Committee is new considering, will enable lessees to continue in occupation of the land until the termination of the lease, if necessary. As it enables them to continue to occupy the land, and as the value of the land is enhanced by the fact that the Government has notified that it is going to resume, why should we turn that enhanced value into  a  claim for compensation ? All the clause says is that whenever we terminate a lease by entering into possession we shall compensate the lessee for the unexpired period of the lease. What more has he any right to expect? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has referred to the delay that may occur in dealing with the acquisition of land. As  a  matter of fact, there is very little delay. The Minister, may acquire land by notification in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> and there is provision whereby, if the parties cannot agree as to the claim for compensation they shall go to the Court. That might take some little time, but any delay would not be due to Parliament. Parliament votes the necessary sum for the acquisition of land. The power of veto has never yet been exercised. It is only provided for in case some Minister does an improper thing. I do not see why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> should want to give a lessee any more compensation than he would get under this Bill, or under the original Act. There have been no cases of ill-treatment of lessees under the original Act, except where the Commonwealth, through not having the power now proposed to be given it, had to terminate leases. Under this clause we are obviating that, and, in many cases, we shall not disturb the leases, perhaps, for a number of years. Whilst it is very desirable not to inflict any damage on a lessee, we do not want to allow fictitious values to be attached to land simply by reason of the fact that the Government are putting up a post-office or some such building, thus allowing lessees to obtain compensation from the Government for value due merely to such an act of public policy. </para>

The process of acquiring land might be a matter of weeks, or it might extend over months. The Minister said that very little time would elapse, but there would necessarily be delay. Parliament should have the right to review the acts of Governments. It is common knowledge that the presence in the market of any Government as a buyer enhances: the value of property, and the Minister said that we should not allow fictitious  Values  to  be  created. That is  a  value that could only come about by the presence of the Government as  a  prospective buyer. When the Government decide to purchase land, it should  be at  the value on the day on which notice of acquisition was given. </para>

                    <para>. -  The object of the amendment is to protect the Commonwealth from unfair and unnecessary charges, and if the lessee does not produce evidence) of his lease, it is considered that to make him a yearly tenant would be giving him too great an advantage. It might put him in a better position than under his lease. It seems perfectly reasonable to require a lessee to produce the lease at his own expense, and if he does not produce the document, which establishes his claim, he should be treated as a monthly tenant. There is an easy way for him to establish his claim, and that is by simply producing the document. </para>

                    <para>. -  I differ from the Minister. This is a case of compulsory process. When a man is compulsorily dispossessed of his property, an entirely new feature is introduced under this Bill whereby he would be compelled at his own expense to produce a certain document. He should be put to no expense at all. A man who is being dispossessed should not be asked, to bear any expense in making out his title to the land. It will be seen on reading through the Bill that an attempt is being made to introduce the principle that holdings are to be resumed at the expense of the one who is being dispossessed, and that is a principle which we, as representatives of the people, should not support. If the original Act had been framed when I was a member of this Chamber I would have pointed out that the provision in which a lessee is given twenty-one days in which to present his documents is unjust, because in 50 per cent. of the cases dealt with they are&#34; held by the. mortgagees. A person who may be holding land with a lease of five or ten years to run is under the hard conditions of the clause to be treated not even as a yearly tenant, but merely as a monthly one, and the compensation to be paid must be on that basis. It is such a striking instance of taking advantage of the subject that I shall oppose the clause. </para>

                    <para>. - I sympathize with those honorable senators who desire to see that the Commonwealth is not vested with power to victimize or to inflict undue hardship on any person; but at the same time we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that when land is being acquired for public purposes there is, unfortunately, in the public mind the opinion that the Government is fair game, and that any expense we can be put to, and any inflated value obtained, is a tribute to their business ability. The way to do this is to place as many obstacles in, the way of the Government acquiring land, and to saddle them with costs, especially legal costs, obtain writs of discovery, and employ legal gentlemen. Where a lease is involved it may be very profitable to certain professional gentlemen, but not very profitable to the Commonwealth taxpayers. A man is either a lessee or is not, and in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred the lease is in his possession. The original property may be mortgaged, but it is very seldom that the lease is. When the land is being acquired in a proper legal fashion he should produce his claim to compensation. It is intended to exercise this provision only where refractory persons, either from a sense of resentment or a desire to get at the Government, create obstacles. In the original </para>

A tenant is there from year to year; but, notwithstanding that, there have been cases where persons have adopted an obstructive attitude in an endeavour to extract the last penny from the Commonwealth in the form of compensation. Legal obstacles have been put in the way of acquiring land, and the departmental officers inform me that it is necessary to have a penalty clause to show those people that they must produce the documents before they can claim compensation from the Government. </para>

                    <para>.- I am strongly in favour of the argument  adduced  by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Garling.</inline> It is all very well for the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> to assure the Committee that this provision will not be used except in the case of troublesome persons; but from my experience in dealing with some Government Departments, I  am convinced that they are ready to exercise their authority to the fullest extent. We should, therefore, be very guarded in placing such a power in the hands of the Government.- Quite recently I had experience in a case where a person entered into a contract with the Government under which a property was taken over, and the officials of the Department were aware for months of. the terms of the contract under which it was. fully understood that the employees also would be taken over. But for various reasons they have decided that they shall not be taken over.. After having the property in their hands for months, the Department turned around and said that if their officers agreed &#39; to take the undertaking over as a going concern they had no authority to do so from the Minister. If that sort of thing could go on for month&#39;s without the knowledge of the Minister he can then disown all knowledge of it, or responsibility for it. A Department conducting business on those lines should have its authority limited and denned in the plainest terms. I refuse to give the Government a blank cheque, although it has been said that the provision will be applied only where difficulties are raised. I shall support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Garling</inline> in rejecting the clause in its present form. </para>

                <para class="block">Elliott; but I- rose merely to reply to a statement made by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> in which he expressed the opinion that there was a general desire on the part of the community to take advantage of the Government. We should analyze that statement to ascertain what creates that desire. Where resumptions are made and owners demand from the Government more than a fair price, that demand is generally brought about because the Government, in acquiring property, assume that appeals will be lodged, and when appeals have been made the Government have gone down and the position has been adjusted by the Courts. If we look closely into the position we will find that representatives of the Government have been coming down on a weak individual and compelling him to accept their terms, which are usually low, so that in the event of an appeal being successful the purchase price will not be high. I remember in my younger days attending the Court in connexion with a case where the Government were resuming land for waterworks, and the whole question appeared to hinge on the Crown case of what was the value of the land for the production of, say, wheat, oats, or potatoes. The barrister handling the case for the farmer was the .late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid, who took up the stand of the value of the land for a reservoir, and proved out of the mouths of the Crown witnesses that no piece of land in the district was as good, and, of course, the claim for compensation was not based  on the productive capacity of the land, but its value as a site for a reservoir. To every one&#39;s surprise the Court awarded the claim up to the hilt. The farmer who owned the land was like a good many others, and if he had been selling the property as a farming proposition would not have appealed. He was, however, driven to appeal because the land was taken at a miserable price, and those preparing the appeal did not value the land merely as a farming proposition, but as a water supply proposition, and rightly decided that if he held the most suitable water site he should be paid on that basis, which was done. That is an illustration of what often happens when the Government, in their desire to see that no one gets at them, press unduly upon the weak individual. </para>

I can quite realize, as the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> suggests, that there are some who endeavour to get as much as they possibly can out of the Government whenever the opportunity occurs, but they should not inflict hardships on the community because there are some dishonest individuals who cause trouble and expense. Assuming a man were a tenant of a property for ten years, and he happened to be absent when served with a notice, and the documents were not produced within twenty-one days, he would then be deemed to be a monthly tenant, and would be compensated accordingly. He would lose the value of his ten years&#39; lease. Such a person may be in Queensland, and his leasehold may be mortgaged to some one resident in Western Australia, the Northern Territory, or even outside the Commonwealth, and because he could not produce his title within twenty-one days, he, would be treated as a monthly tenant. </para>

                        <para>- The Act in its original form is quite good enough. One knows perfectly well from experience in dealing with public Departments that officers adhere to the law, and rightly so, too. What the law lays down they shall do, they must do. That is my experience, and frequently extreme injustice is done to individuals concerned. Consequently I cannot support the clause in its present form. In this case a lessee is to be called upon to produce his lease at his own. cost. Who can say what this will cost some men ? The course proposed is most improper. </para>

                        <para>- They do receive consideration. All a lessee is asked to do is to produce his lease upon which his claim for compensation may be based. At present lessees are in a position to make it necessary for the Government - that is, the people of the Commonwealth - to spend money to compel them to produce evidence that they are in the possession., of certain rights, for the surrender of which the Commonwealth is willing to compensate them. Whilst we do not desire to place anybody in an unfair position, we still have to safeguard the taxpayers&#39; interests. </para>

                        <para>- Of course not. We have no Pandora&#39;s box from which we can extract this money. It must come out of revenues, and it must be charged against the cost of resumption. For the information of honorable senators I may state that in one case at Liverpool a lessee claimed &#163;18,000, and the Commonwealth offered &#163;6,000. Subsequently this offer was accepted. I have here quite a long list of claims by lessees for compensation, in some of which the Government offered more than was subsequently awarded by the Court. </para>
