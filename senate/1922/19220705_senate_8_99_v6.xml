                        <para>. - I think I shall be pardoned, by some people at any rate, if, as a representative of New South Wales, I say that I personally am disappointed at the amount of work done at Canberra during the recess. I do not altogether blame the Government, nor do I attach personal responsibility to members of the Public Works Committee; but I do complain of the system under which we are attempting to build the Capital City. The Public Works Committee has made its inquiries expeditiously, and, I have no doubt, has done its work well, but, through no fault either of the Committee or of the Government, there has been delay, owing to the works authorized by Parliament having to be referred to the Public Works Committee for report, and the reports having to be submitted to Parliament. If there is a majority in the Parliament who think that the Federal Capital should not be built, then let us abandon the project, and stop wasting money. If, on the other hand, we believe in keeping the compact with New South Wales, let us have the Capital built without any unnecessary delay and consequent waste of money. </para>

                    <para>The only fault I have to find with the Governor-General's Speech is that it is unnecessarily long. It is very unwise for any Government to draw up a programme which cannot possibly be carried out during the time at our disposal. The whole of the work outlined in the Speech certainly cannot be completed in this, the third, session of the present Parliament. </para>
                    <para>There is no more important matter referred to in the Speech than that of the unification of the railway gauges of Australia. We cannot develop our country without railways, and unless our system is the most up to date obtainable we are to that extent hindering progress. Last year I raised the question of the unification of gauges, and one or two honorable senators thought it was somewhat unfair to ask the Government to carry out this proposal, seeing that a Commission of experts had been appointed to decide the gauge for the Commonwealth. </para>

One of the members was a financial man, and an Australian, but he was not a railway expert. I understand that he expressed no opinion- as to what the gauge' should be, leaving this matter absolutely to the other two experts, who, as I have shown, were not Australians. One had been brought from England and the other from America. Consequently, they were not in any way dominated by State influences or State jealousies. They simply stated in a valuable report, which I presume honorable senators have read, what in their opinion the gauge should be. I may be pardoned if I extract from their - report one or two paragraphs of interest. They refer to the opinion expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Eddy,</inline> who came out to New South Wales as Chief Railway  Commissioner many years ago, and who, it is generally conceded, was one of the greatest railway experts ever associated with our railway system.

                    <para>If these words mean anything, they mean that an exceedingly strong case has been made out for the unification of the gauges, and should remove any objection that can be raised against the proposal. In their reports the Commissioners point lc the great amount of waste resulting from the present unsatisfactory position due to the various breaks of gauge. We frequently hear a great deal about the need for business men to bo elected to our National Parliament. I am not quite so enamoured of that view as are some people, because I think that what we really want is a man who knows his business when he is elected rather than a man elected because of his supposed business ability. We hear, as I said, much about the great undertakings of .the Commonwealth being conducted on business lines, and I emphasize that a great deal of waste is duc to the existing system of gauges. This, -of course, ought to .be self-evident, but I should like to furnish the Senate with information which has come into my possession within the last few weeks from Queensland. I have been informed that one firm of fruiterers last month lost £2,000 worth of fruit owing to delay caused by transhipment of goods at Wallangarra and Albury. Of course, this firm did not actually lose £2,000. They simply added the amount of loss to the cost of the other fruit. </para>

The people of» the United States of America decided at the outset that one gauge was in the interests of commerce and pf the travelling public, and the result is that goods can be transported, if necessary, from one end of the country to the other without transhipment. </para>

Before the inception of Federation the Colonies were working under different fiscal systems, and there were people in those days who believed that by preventing an interchange of commodities development in an individual Colony in a particular direction would be greater than if products had to enter into competition with those from adjoining Colonies. </para>

Before the inception of Federation there were Protectionists who did not favour the interchange of commodities, and who, possibly, regarded breaks of gauge as an excellent means of assisting in achieving their objective. It was thought, perhaps, at that time that a system of breaks of gauge would assist their fiscal policy; but that day has now passed, as we have Inter-State Free Trade. Breaks of gauge are as great an impediment to the interchange of commodities . between States as a high Protective Tariff would be. ' </para>

The arguments in favour of a standard gauge are so strong and overwhelming that I cannot understand any opposition being raised, particularly by business men. To have brought the gauges of Australia into conformity with the New South Wales system twenty-five years ago would have cost £2,000,000; but, to-day, the cost would be £21,000,000. </para>

                            <para>- As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> suggested, by interjection, the work cannot be undertaken without the consent and assistance of the States. The railway experts, who have fully inquired into this matter, have recommended the' unification of the gauge from Fremantle to Brisbane, <inline font-style="italic">vid</inline> Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne, and Sydney, and the work cannot,, of course, be undertaken unless those States are agreeable. I understand that the South Australian and Victorian Governments are opposed to the scheme, and the Governments in those States remind me of Lord Eldon, the Lord Chancellor of England, who said that the time was not ripe for Catholic emancipation; that it was not ripe for altering the Courts of law; that it was not ripe for making landlords pay their debts; and, in fact, that it was not ripe for doing anything more or anything less. There are some people in Australia who, while not possessing his ability, are still adopting his attitude. It seems strange to me that honorable- senators should find so many reasons f 6^ doing nothing instead of doing something. The variety of railway gauges in Australia calls for action by the Government.. The New South Wales Government is now dealing with the city railway, the building of which ha3 become inevitable. The Railways Commissioners have declared that they cannot guarantee the safety of the travelling public in Sydney unless they have this railway. They asked for it some years ago, but their advice was rejected by the gentlemen who said, " Let us wait for a more opportune time." Now, when the work has to be undertaken, it will cost at least £1,500,000 more than it would have cost a few years ago. Is the Commonwealth Government, after having placed the  unification  of the railway gauges upon its platform, going to stand still, just because Victoria or South Australia raises an objection? Another proposal that might be considered, is to unify the gauge from Fremantle to Brisbane, <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Hay, or Condobolin. If South Australia or Victoria do not want the improvement made, then I would say, " All right. Let South Australia and Victoria please themselves, but do not allow them to play ' dog in the manger.'

                            <para>- It was before the flood, but, giving that in, there is no doubt that the experts now say that the 4 ft.8½ in. gauge should be the one adopted. The Premiers of South Australia and Victoria were parties to referring the settlement of the matter to the Board of experts who have come to that decision. I ask the Minister, when replying to the debate, to be good enough to say whether, if the State Governments of Victoria and South Australia are not willing to carry out the original proposal for a uniform gauge, the Federal Government will be prepared to do their fair share in giving effect to the alternative scheme to which I have referred, if the Governments of New South Wales, Queensland, and Western Australia will do theirs. </para>

I said a few words on another occasion when particular circumstances justified me in doing so; but this is really the first occasion upon which I have the honour to address the Senate, and I am sure that I shall receive a sympathetic hearing from honorable senators. Although I have spoken on other occasions, it is needless to say that I am not a practised  speaker,  and am not yet a politician. </para>

                            <para>- I shall do my best to become one within the next year. I am very sensible of the great honour of membership of the Senate. As one of the third generation of an Australian family, if there is any part of the world which I can claim as my country, it is Australia, these lands under the Southern Cross, and I feel that it is indeed a great occasion for pride for any young Australian to find a place in this Senate, which is the highest political Court in the Commonwealth. With such thoughts in my mind, I express the hope that my conduct as a member of this Chamber, and outside of it, will cast no discredit on my people who have preceded me, in trying to make this country what it ought to be. </para>

                    <para>I must compliment <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Garling,</inline> who moved the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply, on his very fine effort. Like myself, he clearly felt the importance of the occasion; but despite that, delivered a very careful and able address. I compliment him upon it, and I shall be very pleased if I can approach his effort. . </para>
                    <para>There were two matters dealt with in the speeches of the mover and seconder of the motion to which I should like to refer. I was unable to be present during the delivery of the whole of their addresses, but I heard a good deal of them, and subsequently took the opportunity to peruse the report of them. Whilst naturally I take exception to some of the views they expressed, I shall not to-day be very critical, because of my desire that nothing I say should lead to an acrimonious debate or be inconsistent with the intention with which I have risen to address myself to this Chamber . </para>
                    <para>When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Garling</inline> was dealing with the question of immigration, an honorable senator representing South Australia interjected that it was necessary that there should be some stirring up of the State Governments, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Garling</inline> indorsed that statement. I should like to say that not only should there be a stirring up of certain State Governments, but there should be a very decided forward movement on the part of the Federal Government, who have the principal responsibility in this matter, and who, in my opinion, should have done a great deal more than they have done. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Garling</inline> mentioned the Western Australian Government as having done something special in the matter of immigration.. I believe that the Premier of that State, when in England recently, did a great deal in connexion with immigration ; but I submit that the State Government of Queensland have shown themselves to be more in earnest in this matter than the Governments of other States, and, further, that Queensland offers a better opportunity for a comprehensive plan of immigration than does any other State in the Commonwealth. None of the speakers who have preceded me has referred to this question, and I claim to have a personal knowledge of it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore,</inline> the Premier of Queensland, as lon? ago as June, 1921, was particularly earnest in his desire to settle the Burnett lands. He asked me to accompany <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gullett</inline> at the time, and it was only some personal matter that prevented me from closely inspecting those lands in connexion with the proposed immigration scheme. At that time the people of Queensland fully understood that the then Federal Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> and the Federal Government were prepared to enable the Queensland Government to obtain a sum of £2,000,000 to assist tin the opening up of the Burnett lands, with a view to the settlement of immigrants in the only way in which an immigration scheme can be effectively carried out, and that is by malting land ready for occupation by immigrants, and thus preventing them from being forced into the labour markets of the cities. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore</inline> took great pains to give effect to that scheme, and no one can doubt , the honesty of his intentions. But what was the result? We found that, owing to some secret or unknown influence, the offer of £2,000,000 from the Federal Government was withdrawn, and the Queensland Government were therefore unable to proceed with the scheme. </para>

                            <para>- It was one of quite a number which have been exercised with a view to embarrass the Labour Government in Queensland. We know that political cards are not always laid on the table, and for certain reasons, that probably are not very well known in the southern States, it was desired by certain people that the Queensland Government should be embarrassed. 1 might point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> that one influence at work was due to the desire on the part of the two Conservative sections in Queensland to ride into power on the backs of the unemployed, and the settlement of the Burnett lands would have materially helped to absorb the workless in Queensland. The figures supplied by the Statistical Department show that there is more unemployment in Queensland than in the other States. </para>

                            <para>- That may be the honorable senator's opinion, but if he will consider the geographical position of Queensland, and to a lesser extent that of New South Wales, he will agree with me that when men who are unemployed in Melbourne or in Sydney desire to secure work, they move out to the larger territories, which may be called the feeders to the great metropolitan areas. The first thing which a man unemployed in the large metropolitan centres does, if he honestly desires worK, is to move north, and, as a consequence, there is quite a considerable traffic of men who have failed to find work in Melbourne and Sydney, and in the smaller State of Victoria, moving northwards to the greater opportunities which Queensland offers. </para>

                            <para>- It is so regarded by some people, but iu New Zealand, where there never has been a Labour Government in power, the system of perpetual leaseholds has been in operation for many years. With my family, I was myself interested some time ago in a. leasehold property in that Dominion. The system provided practically the only way by which men of small means could secure the possession of land. It was provided by a Government that was not a Labour Government, and one by no means greatly concerned with economic theories of labour and capital. </para>

I do not wish to labour the point too much, but I have personal knowledge of the sincerity of the Queensland Government in this matter. Any one can picture the addition of a whole province to Queensland in the settlement of the Burnett lands. It would mean the addition of 100,000 people to the population of the State and would lead to the absorption of quite a number of the unemployed of this country. The Prime Minister has taken shelter under the plea, and there is a good deal of truth in his suggestion, that the unemployment of many of that 40,000 or 50,000 estimated to be out of work in the Commonwealth is due to the world's economic crisis, for which no member of this Parliament can, be held accountable. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. A very fair amount. In every State where these conditions have been tried, there has been a certain amount of settlement as a result. The resignation by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gullett</inline> of his position as Director of Immigration, at a salary of £1,500 per annum, is an instance I feel I should refer to in support of my attitude. Any stirring up required in connexion with immigration should begin with the Federal Government, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gullett's</inline> action suggested strongly. </para>

From my knowledge of his work, which extends to Great Britain, he has taken a very keen interest in the question of Australian settlement. I realize the importance of numbers. Safety is the first thing to be secured. ' With a population of only 5,500,000, Australia is hardly safe, when we remember the hundreds of millions facing us from the north. This country certainly needs more people, but unless the newcomers are settled here in a proper manner, and unless we strive to make every Australian a good citizen, increased numbers can act to the detriment of the nation rather than to its advantage. Borne and Greece, though small countries, have left a greater heritage to civilization than have India and China, with their hundreds of millions of people. This shows that quality in population is a very . important factor. Immigration, which merely means flooding Australia with probably the poorest elements of Europe, and failure to give the new settlers a proper opportunity to better themselves, would undoubtedly do more harm than good. </para>

I have seen the degradation of life that takes place under unwholesome conditions, and we do not desire to experience them in this beloved land. As an Australian, I have great hopes for the future of our country. We have a great mission before us. Here is a. Democracy of self-governing States which, if properly guided, will probably produce the greatest nation the world has ever seen. It rests with those who rise to high positions, whether in industry or politics, to see that our policies are directed to the uplifting of the race and the strengthening of our people, both in numbers and quality. </para>

The honorable senator said that he did not desire to be offensive, and I accept his remark in that spirit; but I cannot let it pass without saying that, so far as I understand the Labour party's attitude during the war, it was entirely in consonance with that of the great Radical and Liberal sections in Great Britain in other wars, and the Radical and Labour sections in the late war. </para>

                            <para>- It is natural that we all desire to take sides with the Empire in any quarrel, but we should not be " like dumb driven cattle " in a dispute iu which the decision for war is made by a Government or rulers who are not subject to the electors of Australia. As a war progress, surely the conduct of the campaign, and the time for its termination, should be matters for consideration by the great political parties of Australia. I do not wish to discuss this subject in any acrimonious spirit. I feel that there was room for great diversion of opinion, and, perhaps, some reason for the tremendous upheaval which occurred. We all know what an important influence is exerted over individuals by national sentiment, as witness the love of river, valley, or range,  which have bounded the homes of ourselves and our ancestors, and which lead at times to the utter destruction -of our reasoning powers. That unfortunately is the trouble with the world to-day, and that was the material and basic reason behind the war. This condition of affairs will not be altered until we rise to a higher conception, if I may be permitted to paraphrase a remark of . the honorable senator who seconded the motion, of our duty to our own people and to the peoples of the world. The influence of the Radical and Liberal in England in former years has been responsible for a similar division of opinion during great national crises such as the Crimean war and the wars with France, Holland, and Spain. </para>

                            <para>- I was of accountable age at about the time of the Boer war, and in my capacity as a member of the daily press I stood by the current opinion of the time. I believed then that it was being waged by Great Britain in the interests of civilization, of liberty, and democracy, which were threatened, so we believed, by the attitude of the Dutch in denying the Outlanders the right of free citizenship in the Transvaal. Because I had not then seen the other side of the picture I felt that our view-point must be right. But two years after the conclusion of the war I was in New Zealand, and read an article in the "Wellington <inline font-style="italic">Evening Post,</inline> one of the Conservative organs that loyally supported the war, and I was much impressed with a memorable sentence. The <inline font-style="italic">Post</inline> declared  that if the people in New Zealand had known that one result of the South African war would have been the introduction of Chinese labourers to the Rand - if they had known that the great British victory over the Dutch farmers meant the introduction of Asiatics to oust the white labour from the mines - not a single soldier would have been obtained in New Zealand to go to the war. I mention this to show that no matter how certain we may be about the rights of any such struggle, there is always a possibility that later information and events will show that to some extent we may have been mistaken, and that we may see that Imperialist aggrandizement or exploiting interests are factors. </para>

                            <para>-  The Minister must not misunderstand me. I do not say that. I say that the basic causes of the late war were the same as those which for thousands of years have actuated all nations, including the British Empire, in the struggle for Imperialism. The historical facts are there for. any one who cares to delve for them. I realize that, so far as Australia was concerned, we were obliged, in the late war, to stand in an attitude of defence. I take it that the attitude of countries in times of war should be the same as that of individuals when attacked. They should fight. But when it comes to a question of clearing up, and determining whether there shall be a continuance of the struggle, any right-thinking man should at least consider whether terms of peace cannot bs accepted, and thus avoid the further shedding of human blood. </para>

                    <para>I desire now to say, something with regard to the unemployment problem, and certain governmental activities during recent years, particularly the Burnett lands proposal and the Canungra sawmill hold-up. These are matters with which I am particularly conversant, because they affect my own State. Prior" to its acquisition by the Commonwealth Government the Canungra saw-mill proposition employed a couple of hundred mien, and also gave employment to quite a number of people in the other States. As soon as the Government assumed control the mill, for some reason, was closed. Senator Foll a little while ago wanted to know what secret influence prevented the Queensland Government from proceeding with the Burnett land proposal. That influence is the Tory section, who are fiercely opposed to State trading or Commonwealth ownership, and the same secret influence induced the Commonwealth Government to close the Canungra mill. </para>

                        <para>As is well known, the prices of timber and bricks are subject to the will of two powerful combines, one of brickmakers and the other of timber merchants. . . . These huge increases cannot be explained by the war. Australia is largely self-contained in respect to timber, and is wholly so in respect to bricks. In the war years, when imported timber could not be secured, a local substitute was used with success. There is no need for any but Australian timbers to be used in the construction of houses, so that a shortage of imports or the adverse rate of exchange cannot affect the question. . . . There does not seem to be any prospect of immediate relief as long as these combines are allowed to bleed thepublic. </para>

The following is also taken from the same source, which is a paper giving general support to the party, behind the Federal Government- </para>

                    <para class="block">It was rumoured at the time that not only was the mill idle for a year, but that the loss to the taxpayers would be in the vicinity of £100,000. I have been reminded by interjection that some very peculiar things were done in connexion with War Service Homes. I do not intend to deal with the administration of that Department at this juncture; but on some future occasion I shall quote some facts and figures in regard to the purchase of land for War Service Homes, and the action of certain officials in that connexion. </para>
                    <para>The topics enumerated in the Speech are so extensive that a cursory examination of the document is almost sufficient to paralyze one. Prominence is given in the Speech te the Treaties with which the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> will later deal, and it is gratifying to realize that for at least a generation the principal nations of the world are likely to work out their destinies in peace; but I do not believe that under the present capitalistic system war will be an impossibility. A permanent peace must be based on working-class organizations throughout the world bringing sufficient pressure to bear on those controlling the destiny of any capitalistic country, and the fast great struggle proved such to be the case, although Germany was as keen to go to war as any other nation. It is regrettable that references have appeared, particularly in the Tory press in this and other countries, to the effect that Japan has designs on Australia, because utterances of that character breed the war spirit, not only in Japan but in other countries, and I trust that anything we can do will be designed to remove that impression. Before 1914 it was freely stated that the great American Republic had no desire to interfere with European politics; but, notwithstanding that opinion, American troops numbering over 2,000,000, crossed the Atlantic in support of the Allied cause, and I am convinced that any attempt by an Asiatic race to overwhelm Australia would meet with an even more prompt and emphatic response. </para>
                    <para>Reference is made in the Speech to the desirability of establishing a uniform railway gauge for the trunk lines of the Commonwealth, and it is generally admitted that such a great national undertaking should be grappled with as early as possible as delay will only entail additional expenditure. </para>
                    <para>It must be obvious to every honorable senator that there is something radically wrong with the constitution of the Senate, when an important political party has only two representatives in this Chamber. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> said, that the party which I have the honour to represent miserably failed in its conception of its duty to the people ; but great or small as the cardinal issue between the two parties may have been several years ago, it must be remembered that there are other issues which have1 to be considered. </para>

                            <para>- I have known it for fifteen years, and, like other institutions which are supposed to be non-party, it is a party Chamber. If the two Labour representatives in the Senate were dispensed with, honorable senators would have to divide amongst themselves, the Radicals going one way and the Tories another. When the position was not as it i9 to-day, that mighty organ, the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> referred to the iniquity of this Chamber having only three or four Conservative representatives, but it has little to say now the position has been reversed. The present constitution of the Senate enables it to be attacked by those who believe in the unicameral system of government with the initiative and referendum, and before very long the position will have to be modified. As the Government have outlined their proposed legislation in such detail, it is regrettable that they have not been able to include in the Governor-General's Speech a reference to some proposal by which this deplorable state of affairs could be rectified. </para>

                            <para>- They will inevitably do that. It is patent in every country and in every age that during a period of war the people's minds are largely influenced by the Tory or Conservative section of the community. Conservative-minded . people, who liar most to gain by war, shout loudest for war, and they by this means gain the support of the majority of the people. The Labour party in any country is more concerned with internal reforms and social betterment than with wars. Their eyes are fixed more on the industrial fight, and when they are asked to brush that aside and look to the " enemy beyond the seas," they do not see it in the same light as the Conservative. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator is entitled, to his opinion; but inevitably the time will come when the attention of this country will be directed again to economic issues, and to the industrial struggle. Then the fevers of war will pass away, and there is no doubt that a majority of the people will once more .incline towards Liberal, Radical, or Labour representatives to manage their affairs. That has been the course of history in every country, and I do not fear but that it will happen in this country. It may not occur for three, six, or nine years, but the day will come when these Opposition benches will be occupied by the few representatives remaining of the senators who are now on the other side of the chamber. There ought to be something on the notice-paper recognising this defect in the representation in this chamber. The absence of it almost breaks a pledge and falsifies a promise. </para>

There is no reference, at any rate, that any reader of the notice-paper could take literally. If everything on the notice-paper is to be covered up in that way, we might as well have it printed in Sanskrit. It is obvious why I am representing the Labour party in this chamber, and I believe that the presence here of my honorable friend the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gardiner)</inline> is due to fortuitous circumstances rather than to the working of the electoral machine. I do not think that even the honorable senator f-rom New South Wales who has spoken will deny that the Labour party should have something like seventeen out of the thirty-six senators who are members of this Chamber when we consider the enormous number of electors who vote for Labour. </para>

I have to thank honorable senators for their kindness in hearing me; and the fact that a large number of them have remained to hear me out is a source of considerable pleasure to me. There are other attractions for honorable senators which might lead them outside the Chamber, and, therefore, I feel that I should be doubly grateful for their kind attention and patient hearing.

                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">(By leave.)</inline> - The honorable the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> thought it desirable, in accordance with the promise he made, that Parliament should be advised as early as possible of the approximate financial position of the Commonwealth, as far as it can be calculated up to the end of the financial year. I have made arrangements for copies of the statement I have laid upon the table to be distributed to honorable senators, and I desire briefly to set out a few of the main headings, so that they will be in possession of a summary of our financial position. The total approximate expenditure out of revenue for the year 1921-22 amounts to £65,118,265. This compares with the actual expenditure of £64,624,087 for the year 1920-21, an increase of £494,178. In comparison with the estimated expenditure for 1921-22 of £64,104,458, it represents an increase of £1,013,807. The four main headings of expenditure are as follows: - The ordinary votes of Departments were : -Estimated, 1921-22, £15,745,769; approximate expenditure to 30th June, 1922, £16,200,164; approximate excess of expenditure over estimate, £454,395. Special appropriations other than war appropriations were :  - Estimated, £14,637, 025 ; approximate expenditure, £14,972,586; approximate excess of expenditure over estimate, £335,561. For additions, new works, and buildings, the estimate of expenditure out of revenue was £2,518,411, and the approximate actual expenditure £2,584,359, representing an increase of £65,948. For war services the estimate was £31,203,253, and the approximate expenditure £31,361,156, an increase of £157,903. Those headings show a total approximate increase over the estimate of £1,013,807. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I shall now give . the figures for each of the Departments separately, so as to explain to honorable senators where the principal increases occur. For the Prime Minister's Department the estimate was £416,798, and the approximate expenditure was £539,658, representing an . increase of £122,860. This increase is explained by the following main headings :  - Wheat contribution, which had to be paid in connexion with shipments of wheat to South Africa, £32,500; contribution to League of Nations, £14,500. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. For the Air Service the estimated expenditure was £100,000, the approximate expenditure £152,058, showing an increase over the estimate of £52,058. The amount provided in the Estimates proved insufficient to meet the expenditure of the establishment existing at the beginning of the year. The additional amount was provided conditional upon the saving of a like amount under the vote for New Works. </para>

                    <para>The estimated expenditure for the Post and Telegraph Office was £7,455,533, the approximate expenditure was £7,758,399, showing an increase over the estimate of £302,866. It will be seen that the provision on the Estimates was inadequate for the maintenance of the services which the people have long been accustomed to. The increase is very largely due to increases in salaries following upon arbitration awards. Had additional funds not been provided it would have been necessary to discontinue many services, and to discontinue work in connexion with repair and maintenance of lines and instruments. This would have seriously impaired the efficiency of the Department, and would have involved the dismissal of a large number of returned soldiers. </para>
                    <para>The estimated expenditure for the De&gt;partment of Health was £108,568; the approximate expenditure was £144,106, showing an increase over the estimate of £35,538, the whole of which was due to the outbreak of  bubonic  plague, to meet which special provision had to be made. </para>
                    <para>The estimate for special appropriations other than war was £14,637,025, the approximate expenditure was £14,972,586, showing an increase over the estimate of £335,561. Of the increase, invalid and old-age pensions, maternity allowances, and payment to States under the Surplus Revenue Act together account approximately for £100,000. Other special appropriations account for £12,000. Defence compensation, being provision for <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> retiring under the reorganization scheme, accounts for £300,000. Soldiers' Co-operative Woollen Mills account for £25,000; and interest and sinking fund for a decrease approximately of £100,000. </para>

                    <para>The estimated expenditure for additions, new work's, and buildings was £2,518,411. The approximate expenditure was £2,584,359, showing an increase over the estimate of £65,948. This increase was due to the necessity for making provision for paying the British Government the sum of £163,000 for munition making plant ordered some years ago. </para>
                    <para>The estimate of expenditure for war services amounted to £31,203,253. The approximate expenditure was £31,361,156, showing an increase of £157,903. In connexion with this expenditure two decreases and one increase are shown. The two decreases are repatriation of soldiers, approximately £160,000, and other w;ir services, approximately £61,000. But in connexion with war pensions there has been an approximate increase of £378,000. These groups of figures considered together account for the excess of £157,903. </para>
                    <para>Coming to the Revenue the estimate for the year was £61,787,350, the approximate revenue received was £64,913,085, showing an increase over the estimate of £3,125,735. The principal increases are Customs £3,499,392, and income tax £1,790,645. Assessments outstanding at the beginning of the year represent £4,494,2S5, and payment on account of the Army of Occupation amounts to £835,000. The principal decreases shown are: - War-time profits tax, estimated revenue £2,000,000, approximate  revenue  £1,306,708, showing a decrease of £693,292; the Commonwealth Government Lino of Steamers, estimated revenue £300,000. In connexion with the revenue from the Line of Steamers the Treasurer does not consider it prudent  at this stage to put forward any figures, though at a later stage they will be submitted. The figures show an approximate loss of revenue of £300,000, but that is not to be taken as indicating that there has been a loss of that amount. The estimated revenue from Australian note issue is £1,400,000, the approximate £1,261,482, showing a decrease of £138,518. The advances made necessary by war finance are now being paid ofl' and consequently the earnings of the note issue are less. </para>
                    <para>The estimate of transactions for 1921- 22 made at the beginning of the year showed receipts £61,787,350, expenditure £64,104,458, showing a deficit of £2,317,103. So far as they can be given, the actual transactions foi' the year show receipts £64,913,085, expenditure £65,118,265, showing a deficit of £205,180. The estimated deficit of £2,317,108 has been turned into a deficit of £205,180, or an improvement of £2,1.11,928 iu the position as foreshadowed in the last Budget. </para>
                    <para>On the approximate figures as now estimated, an amount of £6,413,147 will be carried forward by way of surplus for the present year, as against the estimated amount of £4,301,219. </para>
                    <para>As we shall bo adjourning presently, I thought it' would be convenient and' of value to honorable senators to have these figures on record, that they may peruse them at leisure, and form their conclusions upon them. </para>

There has been no time to examine the figures in detail, hut I think that this is the first time iu the history of the Commonwealth when this Parliament has been placed in possession of such figures as I have to-day submitted, lit such an early stage of the financial year. Obviously, detailed particulars of the various accounts must await the delivery of the Budget, some time in August. </para>
