The national interest analysis, which was done by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties—JSCOT—in report No. 61 informs us that the free trade agreement is `GATT plus'; that is, it will remove almost all barriers to Australia's export of goods to the US through a negotiation of offer and request. The way it works is that it will provide an agreed list of exceptions to which obligations of the FTA do not apply. The result of the free trade agreement, it is stated, will be to increase market access. It is argued, both in JSCOT's report No. 61 and in the later report of the Senate Select Committee on a Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America, that the free trade agreement will bring significant economic gains to Australia. Just how big those economic gains will be—as I stated last Thursday—is still in contention. I suspect that we will have to wait to see the conclusion to that debate. </para></talk.start><para>The point that should be made about this debate is that we are not arguing about minuses but about the magnitude of the gains that will accrue from the free trade agreement. Unfortunately, the national interest analysis which accompanied the treaty did not contain any specific financial information on costs and benefits. The only such information provided to the JSCOT was an estimate by Treasury of the cost of the agreement. Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall, I note that you are a member of that committee. The Treasury, through the NIA process, made available economic modelling to that committee in a report by the Centre for International Economics. This report showed a variance in the gains that may accrue through the FTA—one from a high base to an even higher base. </para><para>One of the most notable benefits that will accrue from the FTA is investment liber-alisation. However, investment liberalisation could have been implemented in a unilateral action by government decision. It is one of the issues that came up in negotiations on the free trade agreement with Singapore. Investment liberalisation will increase the threshold for foreign investors from $50 million to $800 million—a significant change. The reports by JSCOT and the Senate select committee illuminate this issue. </para><para>In addition to the economic modelling that was provided to JSCOT, the committee was also fortunate enough to receive the Dee report, which was then used extensively by the select committee. The Dee report became available towards the end of that inquiry and identified modest gains to be gained from the FTA. Notably, the Productivity Commission was not called on to analyse the FTA. This was an omission, or an oversight, by this government that should have been corrected. It can still be corrected by allowing the Productivity Commission to take up the cudgels and do the job that it does best—analysing economic models and matters such as the free trade agreement. It could provide some future information to both the government and the opposition about how the FTA will proceed.  </para><para>It became transparent throughout the process that the government had not undertaken rigorous examination or engaged in consultative rounds with the states and with its own stakeholders, which I think is an oversight that the government could have corrected. It could have ensured that the states were brought on board more. The JSCOT report comments on the lack of consultation by the government with respect to the free trade agreement. </para><para>The FTA is a living agreement. It does not just finish, as does the construction of a house. There will be ongoing dialogue with the US—and there will be ongoing dialogue, I suspect, in this chamber—about how the FTA will continue. There will also be a significant joint committee to supervise the operations of the agreement. This committee will play a central role in how the FTA will unfold. The committee will meet annually and review the current functioning of the agreement. It may consider any improvements or amendments, clarify issues and issue interpretations, and it becomes part of the initial stages of any dispute resolution process that may be called for.</para><para>Another important consideration is that the agreement does not allow private investors to directly challenge government decisions. It remains a government-to-government document. Individual investors are of course able to raise concerns about their treatment with their respective governments, but what will emerge is a functioning, flexible trade agreement. That clearly will not suit all who want clarity, certainty and a document with a black-and-white approach. This is not one of those. However, I think it is best to refer to this statement made by Ms Meg MacDonald during the JSCOT hearings:</para><quote><para>We think that the various forums and mechanisms established under the agreement ... will be able to continue the work of streamlining the bilateral business environment ...</para></quote><para>Turning for a moment to the technical detail, for the free trade agreement to come into force both parties will need to fulfil their domestic approval processes. These processes include amending or agreeing to legislation and accepting an agreed date of introduction of the agreement. These two bills before the Senate today are part of the process which will enable the free trade agreement to come into being.</para><para>One of the major sticking points at the moment, which is quite a live issue in the Senate, is the pharmaceutical debate. The DFAT fact sheet says that the annex will:</para><quote><para>... provide more opportunities for companies seeking listing of new medicines on the PBS to have input to the process.</para></quote><para>That has caused a significant amount of debate. It is clear that no-one wants to either directly or indirectly undermine our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. At least, I am confident the opposition take that view; I am not sure all the government ministers take that approach. The question can be formulated in this fashion: will the free trade agreement either directly or indirectly undermine the Australian PBS system?</para><para>The analysis undertaken by JSCOT examined each individual issue. JSCOT heard `no compelling evidence' that the agreement would affect prices of medicines, that the review mechanism would affect the PBS, that patent issues would weaken the PBS, that the establishment of a working group could undermine the PBS or even that the behaviour of US pharmaceutical companies could potentially undermine the PBS. On the issues separated and dealt with individually they came to the reported conclusion—if it can be called a conclusion—that there would be no tangible effect on the PBS. However, if you look collectively at the individual statements that are contained in report No. 61 by JSCOT and in the report of the subsequent select committee, you will see that there remains a concern. I think that that concern can be addressed by Labor's amendment. </para><para>Before I look more at the PBS, I want to comment briefly on Labor's approach. Over the last several days we have seen the validation of Labor's approach to the free trade agreement with the United States. It is a complex document with more than 1,100 pages and a considerable amount of detail included. Labor said at the beginning of this year that we owed it to the Australian people to examine it. My email account is, and was, overflowing with views from the elderly, the young, the sick and those who have to care for them. In fact, in the last four days over 900 emails have been received in my inbox. Labor's commitment to using the Senate—that is, through the select committee—for its intended purpose as a house of review to examine the agreement is borne out by that process. Since announcing our intention to put up two amendments—that is, the local content amendment and the PBS amendment—I have received further encouragement from people in my state of Queensland.</para><para>The Prime Minister calls this `a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity—a chance to open trade'. Irrespective of the once-in-a-lifetime tag, I think we owe it to the Australian people to let them have their say about the FTA. That stands as the hallmark of what Mr Latham outlined when he first took the approach he did in respect of the FTA. He said that the select committee should be allowed to do its work—to examine the FTA, to build on the work the JSCOT committee had done to ensure that the FTA was properly scrutinised. The opposition forced the government to put its touted FTA under the spotlight. Frankly, I think it was a worthwhile and necessary process. Considering the length of time it took the Howard government to deliver all of the information about the FTA to the select committee, they have done remarkably well in the time available to produce their comprehensive report.</para><para>Two issues remain outstanding. One of them has, I think, been resolved by the government agreeing with us. The second is in relation to the PBS. The interesting fact about that is that the final appeal mechanism for the PBS was delivered to the public arena no earlier than two weeks ago. It could have been delivered earlier. The government could have provided information on how the system was going to work, given the comments made originally in the treaties report and the subsequent comments by the select committee.</para><para>The process requires generic manufacturers to do two things: firstly, certify that they do not infringe any existing patent; and, secondly, certify that they have notified the patent holder of their intention to seek listing on the PBS. This notification requirement could allow patent holders to consider whether to take early pre-emptive action against a generic manufacturer. There might be issues surrounding that as to whether or not they would and whether or not it is similar to the US legislation. But what we have to concentrate on is ensuring that the PBS in Australia is sound and continues to deliver affordable medicine to people.</para><para>In contrast to the government, Labor was determined to get it right. The government has failed the Australian people in not ensuring that the PBS was solid. The Prime Minister made disparaging remarks about the select committee and the process Labor undertook to ensure that the FTA was properly scrutinised and that all the issues were examined and considered. However, given that the Prime Minister has already conceded that we had a valid viewpoint on the question of cultural content, I think he should reconsider the issues and his words about the PBS as well. </para><para>Today, I expect we will see the opposition's amendment to the PBS but that is not a matter I will talk about during the second reading debate. In my view, it would have been far better if the government had last week joined with Labor and said, `Yes, there are issues; there is a problem and we need to address it,' rather than to continue over the weekend to create doubt that otherwise might not have arisen.</para><para>In relation to these two amendments and these two issues, the government would not have looked at Australian content if it were not for the Australian Labor Party; nor would they have looked at ensuring the continuation of a strong PBS if it had not been for Labor. In conclusion, over the weekend Labor and the government have had a chance to spar about these issues. I think it is high time now that we took these issues to a conclusion and that the government got on with it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>25856</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak in the debate on the <inline ref="R2118">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2111">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004</inline>. On a number of occasions in recent weeks—commencing on about 28 or 29 July—I was cited in the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> as being a person who supported the free trade agreement and its implementation. I probably was the only member of the parliamentary Left to adopt this position but I did so after great deliberation and with no confidence in the prospects of the El Dorado that the government has tried to con the Australian public to believe would flow from the treaty into the Australian economy.</para></talk.start><para>I supported the FTA with absolutely no trust in the white shoe brigade of the government—from the Prime Minister down—whose rhetoric knows no bounds on this issue, as with many others, and whose credibility is inversely related to their outlandish rhetoric. I supported the agreement in the belief and expectation that the implementation and ratification were inevitable and in the belief that ratification would present a real opportunity for a parallel agenda to be pursued by those who had concerns about the downsides of this treaty. I believed that that agenda would be critical to any balanced outcome for the Australian people.</para><para>We are led to believe that there is only an upside but I would like to put on the record an early part of the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America because I think it reflects some of the diversity of outcomes arising from this treaty. The report says:</para><quote><para>For many people, however, the Agreement represents nothing but economic, cultural and employment risks from exposure to powerful United States interests. Some economists have argued that the trade diversion effects of the AUSFTA could work to the overall detriment of the Australian economy. Many have argued strongly that the Agreement will undermine Australia's sovereignty and erode social policy, and that many of the AUSFTA's provisions will severely restrict Australia's future capacity to direct and manage its own affairs. </para></quote><para>That paragraph sums up the diversity of concerns in the community, ranging from economic to cultural concerns and concerns about sovereignty. They were concerns that I addressed in coming up with my position on this matter. </para><para>For me the ratification process presents an opportunity to address some of these fundamental concerns in a long-term way; to focus in a meaningful way on some issues such as the PBS, cultural content and so on; to develop forward agendas and secure long-term structures and outcomes; to address some of the issues that arise from the FTA; and to address some issues which have their genesis before the FTA but also run parallel to it. By expanding and changing the market, pressures are going to be put on existing systems and existing legislation, and those sorts of issues have to be addressed in a timely way. At the same time the politics were, and continue to be, extremely important for me. The government's lie machine has been in overdrive. Expectations across industry sectors have been raised. If the critical and central issues could be addressed then the politics also demanded a balanced outcome. </para><para>The outlook I adopted was not a new one. It has been successfully used by progressive people in mainstream politics in the ALP quite often in the past. It is one that, as a member of the Hawke-Keating cabinets, I participated in quite often. In fact, if one goes back even as far as post-war reconstruction under the Marshall Plan, one can see the obvious elements of a strategy that should have been used from the start but which has been forced on the government by the opposition leader, Mark Latham. That is, you cannot have economic reform without a contemporaneous social policy underpinning such reform. Under the last Labor government we had unquestionably an enormous trade liberalisation, regulatory reform and global agenda. We opened up Australia to the world but we recognised—and we paid ongoing policy respect to—the fact that some of our citizens would miss out on the benefits and some would lose because of the opening up of the Australian economy to global pressures, expectations and demands.</para><para>Recognising that, we acted to either insure them from the effect or, importantly, provide them with new opportunities arising from new markets and new agendas. So we had a steel plan. Particularly for my state of South Australia, we had a car industry plan. When it came to the banking sector we had consumer protection and regulatory measures. We had a raft of social and community adjustment programs. We had those measures with regard to our trade and economic liberalisation agendas, and we had them when our environmental or Indigenous agendas were going to impact on smaller outlying and regional communities.</para><para>These opportunities have been tried and proven in the past. These opportunities should have been seized by this government when developing the Australian position on the AUSFTA. But the government did not. Not only did it not take a broad approach to policy, one driven by the concern of Australians, but it did not even go through the formal processes of, for instance, raising this treaty with the Treaties Council of ministers before it agreed to the AUSFTA. In fact, probably the first real opportunity the public has had to have input in the parliamentary process and in the development of this treaty came through the Senate committee in particular, a committee that the government has bagged consistently from day one, rather than through the processes of the House of Representatives and the Senate. But it has been a committee process that has raised for the consideration of the parliament some critical issues that quite obviously needed to be addressed right from the start.</para><para>I need to make one other point at this stage, one that I think is fundamental and that exposes the hypocrisy of some of the proponents of the AUSFTA in the current debate. I have always proceeded in politics on the premise that the Australia-US alliance was a critical fundamental piece in our policy settings—the alliance with the US, that is, not with the neoconservatives who have momentarily hijacked that country and its policy directions. The alliance is an important security link that permeates many other areas of policy. It has never worked and would never work if Australia were to be a client state, in servitude to US interests, or a deputy sheriff. It only works and it only resonates if it is respected by a broad cross-section of Australian people and a broad cross-section of the Australian politic. It is not an alliance of conservatives of both countries; it is an alliance between countries. And it is only an alliance that works for us, proud Australians that we are, if it is an alliance with dignity. We can have our disagreements, we can disagree on major issues—as we have in the past—but we should always have that right to disagree and take a different position to that of the US. This right is fundamental to a meaningful alliance. </para><para>Within these parameters two things are important. General support for the alliance across the broad section of the body politic is critical to its continuation as an important factor in political life in this country, as with the USA. It is not good enough to have an in-house club between neoconservatives on both sides. It is not good enough to marginalise and politicise the alliance in that respect, which has happened quite consistently over recent months. It is an agenda that has been consistently pursued by the conservatives in this country in particular. If you do not have broad support for the alliance, if it is only left to the Right on both sides in both countries, then you do not have a healthy, ongoing alliance. You need to have, as much as possible, people from across the spectrum—the Right, the centre and some on the Left as well—to ensure that you have a healthy, dynamic relationship. But it has been marginalised, and I think that has been unfortunate for those who claim to pursue the interests of the alliance but who, in the process, are undermining it. On the other side of the debate, in the US, the way that President Bush has played politics with this has not been helpful. In earlier days the US ambassador fell into that trap, but it is good to see that in more recent days he is taking a more diplomatic approach to the issue.</para><para>It is important not to politicise the alliance; it is also important not to threaten the underpinnings of our trade and security policies. Year after year in this place, the conservatives in particular have said to us: `You have got to keep the US alliance immunised from day-to-day political issues. You cannot use it as a political bargaining chip.' But what have we had in recent months? We have had this Prime Minister, desperate to do anything to retain government, using this alliance for that specific purpose. For him, it does not matter if he trashes it, it does not matter if he marginalises it, so long as he gets the political outcome he wants. Those on the conservative side of politics have particularly been the ones who for decades have been using the mantra: `We can't use the alliance as a bargaining chip'—whether it comes to agriculture, whether it comes to issues such as MX missiles, whether it comes to Star Wars and so on. Unfortunately, those on the conservative side have dragged the alliance into day-to-day politics here. People like the Prime Minister you would expect; but it is a pity that the likes of Paul Kelly and Greg Sheridan—people I know and respect—and others like them who know better, and I know they know better, are not writing better. It is a pity they are falling for the government's strategy. It is a pity they have become so institutionalised that they have lost their balance and their long-term perspective on issues such as this. </para><para>We have before us legislation in respect of that treaty, but it is legislation and a treaty which would have not received adequate scrutiny—responsible scrutiny—had it not been for the Senate committee process. As I said, it was a committee that was criticised for its institution, criticised for its deliberations and criticised for its outcomes, but it is a committee that has come up with quite a number of areas of concern. The Australian people need to understand what is in the nuts and bolts of this treaty. They need to go into it with eyes wide open. Except for this Senate committee, they would have been going into it with eyes wide shut. It is not the El Dorado that the Howard government claimed it was: a $6 billion assertion that we heard on day one has conveniently disappeared into the ether. The committee says there are benefits and there are negatives, but the benefits are probably marginal at best.</para><para>There will be winners. For instance, with respect to some of those winners in my state, South Australia, the manufacturing industry came solidly behind this agreement in the first instance, but people in the vehicle industry realised that where there might be some manufacturing industry adjustments, particularly in the component parts industry, they are not going to be to the benefit of the South Australian community. Similarly, the fishing industry is cited as an industry that expects major opportunities out of this treaty. That has been the view expressed by some of their leaders. But with the rules of origin that apply, and with time, a lot of those people in that industry have started to realise that, once again, their expectations should be nowhere near as high as they have been led to believe by the government. Wouldn't it be really great if we had a government that focused on a huge market for them, a market that does have trade barriers—the European market. There is a 15 per cent barrier there. Were we to get rid of that as a priority that would be of major benefit, particularly to the fishermen in Port Lincoln and other parts of South Australia, if not to the whole country.</para><para>One of my primary concerns was the cultural community. `Let's protect it' was the mantra coming through on the emails; but protect what and protect for how long? This industry came up as a candidate for the typical Labor solution in this area—that is, to ensure that if you are going to be affecting the rules that govern the industry then you have to make sure that the industry gets not just protection but a springboard into future generations of that industry. You need to do so not just with an industry plan but by looking at the future generation of technologies, the future delivery platforms and the real protection that is going to be needed. You do not have real protection now and you have not had real protection in recent years under the ABA chaired by David Flint. What the industry needed, what it needs and what Mark Latham has proposed it will now get is a new platform of protection and support. That is going to be critical for its future.</para><para>There were many concerns with the agreement, as I said, one of which was the PBS—and that has had a solid work-out. The dishonesty of the government knows absolutely no bounds. Minister after minister over the weekend appeared on radio and TV telling us that this agreement will not change the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. What this agreement does do is change the market. It changes the players in the market, it changes their share of the market, it changes the pressure in the market and, consequently, it changes the regulatory mechanisms that are in play. If you have an evolving market, yesterday's regulatory mechanisms will never be good enough for the future. The government knows that but dishonestly tries to skirt the issue of what this trade agreement does for the pharmaceutical market. The market will not be the same. That is a fundamental outcome of this agreement. If the market will not be the same then you have to focus on how to best protect our patent laws in the context of a new market and in the context of new pressures on the PBS. </para><para>Once again, the federal opposition leader's initiative in this area is one that any responsible government should have come up with. But what have we had from the government? We have had dishonesty, disingenuity, a belittling of concerns and a belittling of the ideas of the other side. On the one hand the government say, `Well, we will listen to a good idea,' but do you reckon they have the capacity to come up with one themselves? This has been quite stark in recent discussions on this issue. If you look at the Senate committee report, whether on health services, patent law, the service industry or, particularly, intellectual property—an issue that has not been adequately addressed either by the government—you will see that it was the Senate process, rather than the government, that came up with the concerns with the agreement and with the way to address them. The government have just blindly signed to a treaty without even scant respect for the concerns of the people it might affect.</para><para>For a treaty that was inevitably going to be passed into law, it was important to me that a parallel agenda be developed. As I say, the usefulness of the Senate committee process was shown again in the weight of the report. For that I have to congratulate you, Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall, and other members of the committee, particularly Senator Peter Cook, who obviously deliberated on this issue under enormous personal duress. I think he and you have done a great job in a very comprehensive report. I must say, after debate on this report by almost all the Senate, hardly anyone has been able to find fault with it—with its fundamentals, with its premises or with its deliberations. There might be some political argument as to outcomes and as to some value judgments at the end, but I do not think anyone has managed to strike a blow at the heart of the validity of this report. Senators need to be commended for that.</para><para>The development of that parallel agenda was something that was always going to come out of this, and the opposition leader has done that. Some people might say, `You can have that agenda but it doesn't have to be within the legislation.' That is almost like the Prime Minister saying to us in the parliament: `Trust me. I'll look at it into the future.' The Prime Minister's store of trust with us and with the Australian public has worn out. The strategy of ensuring that legislation is amended as we go towards a treaty is obviously a much more productive one than taking this Prime Minister and this government on trust. Some issues raised need to be taken much more seriously than they have been. I have quoted one paragraph from the Senate committee report. It is also important in closing to acknowledge that, as the report says:</para><quote><para>Any trade agreement, especially one as unprecedentedly complex as the AUSFTA, necessarily entails both costs and benefits ... Assumptions are invariably contestable ...</para></quote><para>Econometric reports, as the committee found, led in different directions. Agriculture, investment and service industries were important. The power imbalance in the marketplace was something that the committee seized upon but that the government has never acknowledged. The report continues:</para><quote><para>While the removal of tariff and other barriers enhances Australia' access to the American markets, the opening of Australia's markets to highly competitive and export-oriented US firms will obviously have ramifications for Australian companies and their employees.</para></quote><para>We are dealing with a huge market and, as the report says, with firms geared up to greater consumption levels and greater opportunities to offset costs, and that is something that needs to be factored in. At the end of this process, we are in a position where amendments have been put up by the opposition. Those amendments go very much to the heart of protecting the Australian public from the excesses of this treaty, excesses which we always knew were going to be there. It is a pity the government did not put them up, but I am pleased to say that the leader of the Labor Party had the courage to do so and has the courage to pursue them to their conclusion. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>25861</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to address an issue that has not been focused on terribly greatly so far in the debate on the <inline ref="R2118">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2111">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004</inline> but that is nonetheless very important—that is, the issue of multilateralism versus bilateralism in the making of agreements. The reason I do so will become obvious in a few moments, but at the outset I want to acknowledge those people who have taken the time to endlessly bombard me with emails to try to sway me in my views on this issue—and many people around here have felt that pressure. Having said that, there is a plus in this whole process. It needs to be realised that the Senate committee process once again has stood the test of time. The value of the process is that it gives the public an opportunity to make representations to the Senate committee, to express their views and their doubts on the issue at hand, to have their views weighed up by the members of the committee and in this case to have the evidence and the agreement itself closely scrutinised by the Senate.</para></talk.start><para>That is a fundamentally important issue because without that scrutiny people could not have felt secure in what the government were telling us. The government were telling us: `We have an FTA with the United States. You should feel warm and fuzzy about that. Trust us.' Unfortunately, one is not in the position in this parliament, particularly on this side, to trust the government and what they might say on issues as important to Australians as a free trade agreement with the United States. So the public scrutiny process was terribly important indeed. The Labor senators—and I congratulate them for their diligence in the scrutiny of the free trade agreement—brought down some 43 recommendations, which are appended to the report. That shows that it has been the subject of scrutiny and, as we all know of course, if agreement can be reached on the issue of the PBS it is likely that the legislation on this US free trade agreement will pass through this chamber by the end of this week. That will be a major milestone in our relationship with the United States in respect of trade.</para><para>I particularly want to look at the issue of bilateralism in free trade agreements as opposed to multilateralism. I had the pleasure back in 1997 of being the chair of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee, a position which I have left behind me for some time now, though I am still a member of the committee. That committee was handed a reference on Australia and APEC, a review of the APEC processes, APEC itself and multilateralism, and it gave the opportunity for bilateralism to be discussed and debated as well. I think it is worth while noting in this debate, whilst the focus has been almost solely on bilateralism—and rightly so, because it is a bilateral agreement—that multilateralism has been pushed, in my view, to the back. That is most unfortunate, because I think that most of the major gains that we will make as a trading nation will be made in the multilateral arena rather than in the bilateral arena as such. I think it is worth revisiting that. </para><para>It is worth while looking, firstly, at the final report of the Senate Select Committee on the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America which was tabled in August 2004. One can see that there is not a great deal there that is focused on multilateralism versus bilateralism, but I will go to this report and also to the earlier interim report, and then to the Senate committee report on APEC back in July 2000. In that final report, of 2004, paragraph 1.18 of the majority report of senators concluded:</para><quote><para>A prominent advocate of liberalised global trade, in its multilateral rather than bilateral manifestations, is Professor Ross Garnaut.</para></quote><para>I must say that when I get to the report on APEC it is not unexpected that Ross Garnaut was very much a player then, and earlier in this area of trade, championing the cause of multilateral trade. The report goes on:</para><quote><para>He has expressed concerns on several occasions about the risks arising from preferential bilateral agreements, and has identified five key risks that are at play in the AUSFTA—</para></quote><para>The AUSFTA is the Australia-US free trade agreement. It is worth while just going over these risks for a moment. They are concerns that are valid but do not get much airplay when the focus is purely and simply on the implementation of the agreement. But they should weigh on the minds of Australians thinking about where our role in trade negotiations should go in future. The first point Ross Garnaut raises, and it is quoted in the report of the committee, is:</para><quote><para>... the negotiation of a bilateral FTA would accelerate the weakening of the multilateral system.</para></quote><para>Professor Garnaut has been consistent in that view, which he expressed when he appeared before the inquiry into APEC. And there was a subsequent inquiry into our relationship with Japan, which arose out of the APEC inquiry, when similar views—if my recollection serves me correctly—were mentioned. So there is a concern expressed by him, and I share that concern, that shifting to a bilateral system of negotiation of trade agreements will weaken the multilateral system. We have seen a propensity on the part of this government to go down the bilateral path—we have seen the Singapore free trade agreement and others—and it seems also that at the same time the government has lost any zest and life for APEC itself. That is a tragedy indeed.</para><para>The second point arising from Professor Garnaut's comments to the committee that is quoted in the report is:</para><quote><para>... there will be resulting trade diversion from Australia's most important export region, East Asia ...</para></quote><para>If one goes back to the original formation of APEC, one will find that the focus was not only on our relationship in trade with the United States but also with our Asian neighbours, and on their importance to us as their economies grow and they become a greater part of our marketplace. To me that is a very valid and important point indeed. The report then outlines his next point:</para><quote><para>... the rules of origin associated with a US FTA would raise transaction costs in international trade and lower productivity in the process ...</para></quote><para>His next point is as follows:</para><quote><para>... the exclusion of US agricultural subsidies from the FTA would corrode the position of free trade agricultural exporters in the international system and could negate any benefits from increased market access to the US...</para></quote><para>The last point, as outlined by the Labor senators, is this:</para><quote><para>... the processes of policy making in developing this agreement, relying on commissioning consulting reports with limited terms of reference, have been very damaging to trade policy processes.</para></quote><para>One could gain quite clearly from that the fact that Professor Garnaut's view of bilateralism versus multilateralism is clearly and heavily weighted in favour of the multilateral stage. Whilst the committee did not refer at length to it there, they did make some comment on it in the earlier interim report, which they tabled in June 2004, under the heading `Multilateral v bilateral trade agreements'. I will just look at a few considerations that were again reported by the majority of senators—being Labor senators—in that report. At paragraph 1.23, the report notes: </para><quote><para>A prominent concern among critics of free trade deals is that Australia's negotiation of a free trade agreement with the United States of America would be detrimental to current multilateral trade and service negotiations by undermining the principles of the multilateral trading system through the WTO.</para></quote><para>The report goes on to give an example of that. The interim report did note that DFAT had, not unexpectedly, a different view. So that some balance can at least be said to be seen in what I am saying here today, I will quote what the report cites as the DFAT view. At paragraph 1.27 the report says:</para><quote><para>DFAT considers free trade agreements that are comprehensive in scope and coverage can complement and provide momentum to Australia's wider multilateral trade objectives. DFAT stated that one of the best ways of ensuring this occurs is for agreements to meet the criteria in the WTO agreements.</para></quote><para>In the very next paragraph, the report goes on, not unexpectedly, to contradict that. It says:</para><quote><para>However, free trade agreements are contrary to the fundamental `most favoured nation' principle that underpins the WTO.</para></quote><para>At paragraph 1.29, the report goes on:</para><quote><para>The Committee also notes arguments that suggest that, with the more recent focus on regional and bilateral trade agreements, there is a risk that Australia and the world may see the emergence of the same global tensions that applied prior to the Bretton Woods Agreement.</para></quote><para>I am also aware that that very paragraph appeared in an earlier report of the committee as well. The report continues:</para><quote><para>Such a situation may see deepening political divisions and Australia being excluded from certain trade blocs with enormous economic consequences. </para></quote><para>I will later move to what Professor Garnaut put before the committee, but that conclusion really raises the fundamental concern I have—that is, how we are viewed in the Asian region. We are undoubtedly part of Asia. We need to trade with the Asia-Pacific region. It was nearly two years ago, Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall, when you and I were part of a group that toured throughout the region for the Senate foreign affairs committee. We noted the importance of growing trade for many of the microeconomies in those areas. Of course, it will not be through bilateralism that those economies are saved; it is only through multilateralism that we can hope to promote good economic growth so that they can be free from all the negatives that happen when there is a lack of economic growth in those countries. I think Professor Garnaut's comments as quoted in the report sum up that concern. On page 6 he is quoted as saying:</para><quote><para>In our region there is a danger that we will end up over time—not tomorrow but over time—with a division down the Pacific, with us being part of a block with the United States and most of East Asia having discriminatory arrangements amongst themselves that leave us out. That would obviously have horrific economic consequences for us. The economic consequences would be much smaller for the United States and Europe, but they would be huge for us, because they are our main export markets. In addition, there is a danger that that would make cooperation more difficult on the many things that we have to cooperate on at this difficult time in the world.</para></quote><para>That is a real concern. There are growing markets, particularly in China where there are burgeoning markets. I know we are going into a bilateral there. But why the need for bilaterals? Why the need to go down that path exclusively, as seems to be happening? On reflection, from what I read in the report about Australia and APEC, it seems to me that APEC, in effect, has been abandoned. I know that that is not entirely the case. I know that there are liberalisation and facilitation discussions still taking place at the level that APEC is operating at. But it is not operating to the extent and degree that it needs to to provide a more broad based marketplace for trade within the Asia-Pacific region. </para><para>Last but not least, I want to look at the concern that is noted at paragraph 1.30 on page 6 of the interim report:</para><quote><para>The Committee acknowledges that it is inherent in bilateral and regional free trade agreements that the MFN principle is not followed. However, the Committee notes that APEC, a regional economic forum that Australia helped establish, is based on the principle of `open regionalism'. In other words, what progress APEC makes in opening up markets in member economies is then automatically shared with the world on an MFN basis. This approach strengthens the multilateral system and prevents the Asia Pacific region from becoming an exclusive economic club.</para></quote><para>I think that that sums it up; that says it all.</para><para>In the brief time that is left to me it is worth while looking at what APEC is about. APEC was set up, admittedly under a Labor government, and it brought about some major economic benefits for Australia which we are sharing and relishing even today. APEC was born back in 1989 in Canberra. If one reads the report of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee of July 2000, one will see a very good chronology, at least up until 1999—headings such as `1990—Reaffirmation of APEC's general principles and objectives', `1991—APEC: “an international personality''' and `1992—In search of a vision'. According to the report, the ministers at the APEC conference agreed that a small eminent persons group should be established to articulate a vision for trade in the Asia-Pacific region to the year 2000. This group would also identify constraints and issues that APEC should consider and would report initially to the next ministerial level meeting in 1993. That was a major step forward—looking for a vision.</para><para>I do not know if it can be said of the US free trade agreement that it is necessarily in itself a vision. It is a very narrow view of the world. It does not take in the broader area. But it is interesting to look at the 1993 leaders summit and the `political horsepower', as the heading describes it in the report. It refers to what the eminent persons group had found and recommended to the APEC ministers. On page 14, the report says that the EPG identified three main dangers to the region's economic growth. The first danger identified was the erosion of the multilateral global trading system. The second danger was the trend toward inward-looking regionalism, and of course that has no place and plays no role for Australia. We need to have a broader and much more inclusive outlook. The third issue raised by the eminent persons group was the risk of fragmentation in the region. The Australia-US free trade agreement does not do anything, in my view, to fit in with any of those principles. It keeps us in a very narrow, very slender, very slim part of the world.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>25864</page.no><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator HUTCHINS</name><name.id>84P</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is always a pleasure to follow Senator Hogg; in his many years as a member of the Senate and in his many years of active involvement in either the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade or the Senate's Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee, he has always been involved in a number of areas in which our relationship in trade, in particular, has been fleshed out and exposed.

I thought it was only right that I come down and give my two bob's worth. In particular, I would like to thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall, because I had an opportunity to read your contribution to this debate and the work which you did in quoting some of the US congressmen in relation to this trade deal to which I will refer shortly.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I came down on the 12.35 Qantas plane yesterday, a Dash 8 from Sydney. The Leader of the Opposition was on that plane—as was one of the senior staffers, Simon Banks—and he was sitting up the front. As you would know, when travelling on those small aircraft, when you are in the emergency area you are issued with documents asking you whether there is some assistance you might be able to give. Admittedly, one-third of the plane was full of Japanese tourists, but two-thirds of the plane was not. When the young stewardess went over to Mr Latham and said, `In the case of an emergency would you be prepared to assist?' the whole plane broke out in good-natured laughter and they all said, `Please, Mark, help us get rid of this government.' I joke not, because I was there, I saw it and it was quite humorous. But I think you would have to say that at the moment we are probably in the throes of trying to assist in getting rid of this government.</para><para>When we left here at the end of June, I was sure that we would not be coming back. I thought that for most of the year—and I think my colleagues might agree with me—the coalition had not been kicking too many goals but that maybe in that last week or so we had had some difficulties and it might have been that the Prime Minister had that five weeks in which he could go around the electorate opening bridges, going to football games and doing whatever else we politicians might do in that break, and that he might want to think about calling an election before we came back. If you recall, the coalition's primary vote did increase and in fact ours was level pegging with theirs.</para><para>The opportunity was there for the coalition to call the election that is now being mooted. But, no, they did not. Prime Minister Howard came back this week thinking Labor were at sixes and sevens on the free trade agreement, that he would have the opportunity to exploit what was seen as division within the Labor Party and that he would ram home what he believed was our inability to lead this country. What a difference 24 hours makes. Within 24 hours that grin was wiped off the Prime Minister's face. Once again the Prime Minister is faced with a situation—like the one he faced in the week of the opening of parliament this year—where he has to accept Labor's initiatives, which he will inevitably do, on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. I will go on to that in a second.</para><para>The Prime Minister was already prepared to accept our amendments on local content. What a marvellous backflip that was from the Prime Minister. Within 12 hours he agreed to do that one on the local content, and almost for a week he has been strung out and wandering out there wondering what to do next in relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. That is exactly where we are at the moment. What a difference 24 hours makes. You thought you were coming back to this parliament to exploit the divisions within this party. You thought that would lead you to be, towards the end of this week or maybe the end of next week, in a perfect position to call an election because you would be on a high. Haven't you been given the raw end of the pineapple? You have found yourselves in a situation where it has all backfired on you. </para><para>Politics is sometimes a matter of luck, but all this year this coalition have had no luck at all. Every which way the chessboard has been played we have been able to outmanoeuvre them—on each and every occasion. They let go the opportunity they had to use a perceived division within the Labor Party. Where is it now? They are on the back foot. They are the ones that have lost the initiative. They are the ones that are yet again having to come up with suggestions from the Labor Party for how to get themselves out of this impasse. Once again they have demonstrated that they are not capable to continue in power. After not using that opportunity they had, you would think those coalition MPs in marginal seats would be gnashing their teeth. I like to always think of the expression, `If you cannot look after yourself, how can you look after anybody else?' That is exactly where the coalition have got themselves at this stage. They cannot look after themselves. They are out there meandering about wondering where they will go next.</para><para>There were two elements to the free trade agreement that we found objectionable. The Labor senators on the Senate Select Committee on the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America made this recommendation on local content:</para><quote><para>... that Australia's local content requirements for free-to-air television, subscription television and radio be enshrined in legislation, so that reductions in these quotas require reference to the Parliament.</para></quote><para>There was concern that the ratchet nature of Australia's local content regulations would endanger local content on television and radio in the future. Labor's proposed amendment to ensure local content in legislation is an entirely sensible measure to ensure that local content requirements can only be changed by the parliament of Australia. Currently the Australian content standard for commercial television, known as the Broadcasting Services (Australian Content) Standard 1999, regulates the amount of local content on free-to-air television. This is reviewed regularly. While it is informed by legislation, the local content quotas themselves are not enshrined in legislation.</para><para>The Prime Minister quickly agreed to this amendment. Despite all his protesting and his demands that the Australian people and the parliament simply trust his opinion on the benefits of the free trade agreement, he speedily acquiesced to Labor's recommendations regarding local content. That demonstrates that the Senate's committee process was useful. Why did he do it so quickly? I think we know. He did not want all those actors walking around the marginal seats raising concerns about local content. That is why he speedily agreed to it. He did not want actors like Toni Collette or Geoffrey Rush going out doorknocking in some of the marginal seats across this country. So of course he made an opportunistic decision, thinking that would be smart enough to put us in a bind. Hasn't that backfired on the coalition?</para><para>The significant difference between ourselves and the coalition on the free trade agreement—and the one that will matter most to Australians' hip pockets—is on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. While it is good for Australia that the Prime Minister has agreed to Labor's position on local content rules, the one remaining hurdle is our proposed change to patent rules applying to pharmaceuticals. As we know, the big issue in this is evergreening. Just to remind people, evergreening is a process by which patent-holding pharmaceutical companies lodge new patents to prevent the production of generic forms of drugs. In cases where the patent for a drug is due to expire, pharmaceutical companies will lodge a fresh application, sometimes on dubious grounds, in an attempt to perpetuate—or, as they call it, evergreen—their sole right to produce and sell the medicine concerned. </para><para>There are a multitude of dubious patent applications which have been lodged in the United States, which demonstrates that this is a problem which could have a lasting effect on the accessibility of cheap, effective generic drugs in Australia. Often in the United States a fresh application for a patent will be lodged to change the use to being primarily for children rather than for adults, as the first patent stated. The new patent could be for the physical appearance of the pill or capsule itself rather than the chemical composition of the medicine. These sorts of spurious or dodgy applications have the potential to undermine Australia's access to cheap, effective drugs, because they slow the listing of generics on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</para><para>People need to take in the weight of what I said about what these pharmaceutical companies are up to. This is not something that could happen or something that happens only in the United States; this happens in the United States and in many other countries around the world. These huge and profitable pharmaceutical companies make sure that people have less access to cheap generic drugs. In this process of evergreening you can imagine people in the law firms in New York, Boston and London, quaffing back their Moet Chandon on a Friday afternoon wondering how they can make sure that they protect their clients, the big pharmaceutical companies. It can be as trivial as the size of a `new' product, its colour or, as I said, whether it is square, oblong or round. They may have put a band through the centre of it or two bands through the centre of it. This agreement would prevent—and we will look at Labor's amendment—Australians having access to these generic forms of drugs.</para><para>These are not just concerns that are rightly raised by Australian legislators. As I said at the commencement of my contribution, Senator Marshall no doubt had his staff look at some of the contributions made in the US Congress. I want to quote the three congressmen that Senator Marshall quoted in his contribution to this debate. Firstly, there was Mr Tom Allen, a US congressman. He said:</para><quote><para>... I question whether it is appropriate to use trade policy to interfere in other nations' health systems. We certainly wouldn't accept such a demand from other countries.</para></quote><para>That was said in the US Congress by a US congressman, querying why they were doing something to one of their allies. Let me quote Mr Henry Waxman, yet another congressman. He said:</para><quote><para>Domestic healthcare policy should not be decided in trade agreements.</para></quote><para>I agree with that. He continued:</para><quote><para>It is wrong for us to interfere with another country's domestic health policy, particularly when it comes to the affordability of medicine which is an equally sensitive issue here in the United States. This is special interest policy making at its worst. The Bush Administration is letting the pharmaceutical industry use trade agreements to manipulate the drug laws of the United States and other countries in ways that the industry could not otherwise achieve.</para></quote><para>This is nirvana for these greedy pharmaceutical companies—a nirvana that is being legislated by the United States government and acquiesced in by their sycophants here in Australia. Let me read what Mr Mark Udall, yet another US congressman, said in relation to the free trade agreement and its impact on the pharmaceutical industry:</para><quote><para>I am concerned about the potential precedent of the Administration meddling excessively in the internal affairs of a trading partner. With regard to this treaty, the USTR initially sought substantial changes in Australia's drug-pricing program. Though the USTR was not completely successful, the agreement does give U.S. drug companies more say in what drugs are included under Australia's universal drug coverage program. While market access for U.S. goods is important, we shouldn't be in the business of bullying the world and potentially undermining a country's ability to provide prescription drugs to its citizens.  </para></quote><para>Nowhere in the debate so far have I heard any reassurances from the government spokespeople that if we were to pass this legislation without the foreshadowed Labor amendments we would not be suffering in the long term from being denied access to generic drugs and damaging our current pharmaceutical benefits system.</para><para>Recommendations 19 through to 25 by the Labor senators dealt with their concerns in relation to the pharmaceutical benefits aspect of this legislation. In fact, Labor's amendment will be coming out shortly. It will not be just the tap on the hand approach that has been put forward by the coalition to deal with people who would try to prevent access to generic drugs. Our amendment will be strong, as our shadow minister, Ms Gillard, has said, and it will have in it punitive actions for people who do this. </para><para>Finally, I want to make a comment in relation to tainted blood and the free trade agreement. Labor senators recommended that, consistent with the terms of the free trade agreement, the Commonwealth ensure that the following occur whenever possible: all blood products to be used in the Australian medical system must be sourced from Australian blood plasma; Australian blood plasma must continue to be collected by voluntary donation; if plasma fractionation is to occur outside Australia then Australian plasma should be processed on separate production lines; and if plasma fractionation occurs outside Australia then overseas suppliers must satisfy at least the same level of medical standards that apply to Australian suppliers. The Senate has just conducted an inquiry into what we call `tainted blood', hepatitis C and people who acquired hepatitis C via blood transfusions. The level of infection in this country is nowhere like the level of infection in the United States because of the fact that we still have a voluntary system in this country rather than the system in the United States, where people are paid for the blood they donate for use in transfusions. </para><para>I started off my contribution by giving you an anecdote about the Leader of the Opposition and about the view of people who wish to make sure that our country is left in safe hands. I know that when the amendments come before the Senate and the House of Representatives the government will probably have to accept them in the end, because, as you would be well aware, Mr Deputy President, we are saying to them that this is the way to get this bill passed. The government are also being told this by their business masters. In fact, the Business Council of Australia has told them to pass them, the Australian Industry Group has told them to pass them and the Australian Medical Association has told them to pass them. The Australian Medical Association commented that Labor's enabling legislation would make generic drugs more freely available or at least make sure that there were no flaws or snags along the way. That is exactly what the Australian Medical Association said in relation to Labor's proposed amendments. In conclusion, you might have thought the coalition were walking into a great week last week. Didn't it turn sour very quickly? It will continue to turn sour on them, because they have lost the touch.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>25869</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased to conclude the second reading debate and to take the opportunity to thank all honourable senators for their contributions. The debate has gone considerably longer than was expected to allow the Labor Party further drafting time for its patent amendment. I noticed that the speaking list was added to this morning to allow yet further hours. It seems astonishing to me that, if Labor were to come up with a worthwhile idea, it would take it so long to produce that idea in written form. We all know, in fact, that it has run into great difficulty in that regard. </para></talk.start><para>We believe that this is a historic moment and a historic debate. It is a debate on enabling legislation that will allow this country in turn to put the US-Australia free trade agreement into operation. It is an agreement that has been negotiated between the two governments of Australia and the United States of America that gives the Australian export industry an opportunity to significantly grow its exports into the largest and most dynamic country in the world. We know that it would not have been achieved by a Labor government, because, of course, Labor do not believe in bilateral trade agreements. They believe in putting all their eggs in the multilateral basket. If that does not succeed then these opportunities simply will not come about.</para><para>By contrast, the coalition government, being much more pragmatic, took the opportunity to seize a range of different bilateral trade agreements: one with Singapore, the Thailand trade agreement and now the US one. We are making significant progress with ASEAN as well. Further down the track we will look at the sorts of opportunities that China is going to present. So, yes, we on this side of the chamber are prepared to take the benefits and opportunities that flow from multilateral trade reform, but we are not so much purists that we will forgo the opportunity to take significant advantages if they present in the bilateral form.</para><para>I have to say that there were many who believed that it would be impossible, particularly within this time frame, to negotiate such an agreement with the United States. The fact that it was successful is a great credit to Minister Vaile and to the Australian negotiators, and I am particularly pleased with the reception it received after endorsement by the administration in the United States. The reception in the Congress was overwhelming. I think somebody said that it is the best vote that a bilateral trade agreement has ever received. I think that in part reflects the very close and positive relations between the two countries, which have clearly also been enhanced by the Howard government.</para><para>So it is a very important moment. Legislatively we are looking at locking in an agreement which we believe will give a $6 billion benefit to the economy annually after year 10. That is $57.5 billion over 20 years. It can produce another 30,000 jobs for the Australian community. It reflects the approach that our government has taken to the economy: to get the fundamentals right, keep interest rates down, keep inflation down and steady, and free up the industrial relations system so that business will grow and be in a position to take new opportunities as they present. On the other side of the ledger, we look to facilitate greater opportunity in export markets, of which this bilateral agreement with the United States presents the greatest opportunity of all.</para><para>That is why this agreement and this legislation are so important to the coalition. They will give the Australian economy the opportunity for significant growth in the future and for many more thousands of Australians to obtain worthwhile employment. They will significantly build on the economic successes of the last 8½ years. It is true that we said that in this negotiation there were a number of areas that we would need to protect, areas that are vitally important to this country for a range of different reasons. Certainly we wanted the expanded economic opportunity—but not at any price. Of course, an example of that is in relation to quarantine. We were not prepared to sacrifice the Australian quarantine system and the safeguards that are so important in that regard, and we succeeded in protecting the Australian quarantine system. </para><para>Secondly, we were obviously interested in preserving what we referred to as `the cultural sector in Australia' from a much larger economy whilst recognising that we do not want to be too protective because we want our cultural industries to be able to invest in the United States. We succeeded in doing that in these negotiations and I think it was a very good outcome in that regard. Thirdly, we said that the PBS was sacrosanct and that we were not going to put in jeopardy the protection Australians have for reasonably priced medicines through the PBS. We succeeded in negotiating this agreement without putting in jeopardy that system and all of the benefits it has that we treasure.</para><para>Labor, for its purposes—and after it had been through many months of agony on this matter, agony demonstrated through the Senate committee inquiry as well as through the joint inquiry and through various public manifestations—decided that it really had no choice but to support the agreement. In fact, the Australian Labor Party would have looked ridiculous—there is no doubt about that—if, after the endorsement that the agreement received by the US Congress, it had gone out and voted down this opportunity of another 30,000 Australian jobs, apart from all of the other benefits.</para><para>Not surprisingly, Labor, wanting to salvage a few political points, picked up one recommendation of the joint committee in relation to the audiovisual sector. I have to say that I found that interesting because, during the many months of deliberation on this matter, Labor seemed to dismiss the considerations of the joint committee, which was actually set up for the specific purpose of examining prospective treaties, saying that, rather, it needed to rely upon a separate Senate committee. When it came to the crunch, it referred back to the joint committee to find a recommendation that was supported by both sides to justify an amendment to further entrench in law the audiovisual protections. We are prepared to come on board. We may not have thought that it was necessary and we may well have thought that the existing system provided the protection that was necessary, but we can accommodate that and we have put forward an amendment to do so.</para><para>As to the second area in which Labor thought that it might be able to seize a short-term political benefit, it was argued that in some way this agreement provided a disincentive for the growth of generic drugs, that that would produce a cost pressure and that therefore, by amending the Australian Patents Act to address unsatisfactory practices that occur overseas but that do not occur in Australia, the potential for growth in the generics sector would be supported. That was, of course, a nonsense as the Australian patents system works well. There is not the same opportunity for abuse as exists within the United States, Canada and some other places. Nevertheless, it was a line that could be spun, and it was spun by Mr Latham, that this would be an amendment that would in some way look to ensure lower priced drugs.</para><para>I have to say that this government, in its support for the PBS, has also strongly supported drugs at an affordable price. There is no benefit for this government in drugs that are going to become unaffordable, but you need to approach that in two ways. Firstly, you have got to provide the incentives for the pharmaceutical sector to develop new products. Secondly, you have got to ensure that those incentives are not such that they are unfair to the ultimate growth of generics and with the downward cost pressures that they can introduce into the marketplace. It has been the view of this government that that has worked well for Australia and will continue to work well for Australia, but Mr Latham said no, it could only be safeguarded by an amendment. We have waited all of last week and all of today so far for this magic amendment. As Mr Howard said, when the amendment is put on the table it will be considered. We badly want this agreement to pass, for all the benefits that I outlined in the second reading speech.

Let me reassure carers about the absolute scaremongering that is being undertaken by the Labor Party and by the shadow minister. There was an agreement—the legislation went through this place with no opposition from the Labor Party—that we would review people on the carer allowance caring for children with a disability. There were 67,000 reviews undertaken: 30,000 people were not eligible for a carer allowance and 2,742 were deemed not to be eligible for the carer allowance. Six and a half thousand people contacted Centrelink and said, `We're not eligible for this benefit.' Is Mr Swan saying, and is the Labor Party saying, that we ought to pay those people? They rang Centrelink and said, `We believe we are not eligible for that payment.' </para></talk.start><para>Part of the group of people who were no longer eligible for the carer allowance included 8,300 people who were contacted by Centrelink—not once, not twice, but three times as part of the review—and who failed to respond to Centrelink. Is Mr Swan saying that we should pay them? Is the Labor Party saying we should pay them? We have 6,500 people who rang up and said, `We're not eligible.' We have 8,300 who did not respond to the review. The remainder of them—7,000 of them—achieved a lower qualifying score and received a health care card. People with children who have asthma, for example—but not to the point where it requires special care—and who require increased medication were given a health care card. </para><para>This mischief is being made by Labor about the 30,000 carers, and we need to go back further. Answers to questions in estimates committee hearings in November 2003, when the review was being undertaken, indicated the range of people under this review—60,000 customers were reviewed. The facts are that 2,742 people were deemed under the measures not to be eligible; 6,500 people did not contact Centrelink—I presume Labor is saying they should be paid; I find that amazing—and 8,300 did not respond. Is Labor saying they should be paid? There was a small group of people where a carer had died or where the caring arrangements had changed.  </para><para>We have just committed in this last budget half a billion dollars to carers. We have extended the carer allowance to carers caring for people with disabilities with whom they do not live—an enormous extension. Hundreds and hundreds of carers will now get a carer's allowance. The nonsense that Mr Swan is going on with, over and over again, needs to be put to bed because it is totally untrue. Those people were not eligible. There were 2,742 who did not get a benefit. A significant number, almost half of that 30,000-odd, indicated by their behaviour—by not responding or by ringing up and saying they were not eligible—that they were not eligible for that payment. If Labor thinks they should be paid, it should go out and tell them that. The Australian public is waiting for Labor's family policy. What are you going to do to make sure the system is fair?

Is Labor saying they should be paid? Also, when those children have been reviewed, their disability may be such that they are not eligible for the carer allowance, but 7,000 of them are eligible for a health care card. Of the 67,000 that were reviewed, a significant number—over half of them—are still able to be on the carer allowance. This legislation went through in 1998, with the indication that there would be a review, and it was not opposed by Labor. Let me reiterate that in the last budget we extended the carer allowance to carers who are now not living with the person for whom they care.

They want to reduce casual employment, which will especially hit the women and the young in the work force. They want to abolish junior wage rates, which will make it harder for young people to get jobs.

Let me reassure carers that we are as determined as ever to ensure that people who are caring for a child who has a profound disability or a disability which is on the list of recognised disabilities will be provided with care. We have extended the carer allowance to people who care for people with whom they do not live. We have made a commitment of half a billion dollars to carers in this last budget alone.</para></talk.start><para>Legislation introduced here in 1998—not opposed by the Labor Party—said that a review would be undertaken. If I remember correctly the history of the review—I will stand corrected but I think this is how it occurred—former Senator Newman and I visited a DSS office when she was a very new minister, and some of the people in the DSS office were concerned that people were getting the carer allowance for children who did not have significant disabilities. They indicated that what those families probably needed was a health care card. The review was undertaken as part of the legislation in 1998 which said that within five years there would be a review.</para><para>Senator Vanstone, as that review was being undertaken, was very aware that when we looked at the number of cases where children were reviewed and not rejected we found that in those six additional categories there was a high rate of acceptance—a very low rate of rejection. I think it was appropriate that Senator Vanstone intervened at that stage, because there was a low rate of rejection, and had those categories included on the list of recognised disabilities. What Labor is doing is absolutely running a scaremongering campaign.</para><para>Sixty-seven thousand cases have been reviewed. Over half of them were still able to receive the carer allowance. About 7,000 of them were still in receipt of a health care card and 2,700-and-something—without looking, I think 2,762 is the exact figure—were not eligible. As I said before in answer to the other question—I do not know why Senator Crossin would ask me the question again—of the 30,000-odd that were not actually eligible for the carer allowance, 2,762 did not get either the benefit or the health care card and 7,000 got a health care card. But half of that number indicated that they did not think they were eligible any more or did not respond to Centrelink. If Labor think they should be paid, Labor can go ahead and have that sort of policy. We believe that people who have children who require assistance should be paid but people who ring up and say they do not think they are eligible or that they should not be eligible should not be paid. If that is what Labor are saying it really makes a muddle of any policy they might be thinking about. </para><para>What we are about is ensuring that we implement a fair policy. They make the claim that it was some politically inspired change. The figures clearly showed that a significant proportion of the children in those six categories were not rejected.

It was quite evident in the review process that very few of the children in those categories would fail the test to get the carer allowance.

Good economic management does not happen by accident. It requires careful planning and responsible spending of taxpayers' money. It requires the strength to take some hard decisions. The Howard government inherited a $10 billion deficit from the Labor Party. Labor was, as we all know, addicted to debt. It ran up $90 billion of debt in its last five years in office. This government had the strength to turn that situation around. We brought the budget back into surplus and helped fireproof Australia against the Asian economic meltdown.</para></talk.start><para>Our economy is strong because this government has been responsible in its economic management. And the results are there for everyone to see: low interest rates, low inflation and record jobs growth. Again, it does not happen by accident; it comes about when the economy is being responsibly managed. Under this government more Australians are in work than ever before. We have helped create more than 1.3 million new jobs since coming to office. Those jobs have been created because, under this government, Australian industry is confident about its prospects. We have secured key trade deals to give our exporters greater access to foreign markets. By providing a low interest rate, low inflation environment we have given Australian companies the ability to expand. </para><para>Australian workers are also benefiting from low interest rates. Under Labor, home interest rates topped 17 per cent. Under this government home loan rates are down to about seven per cent. Australian families are the big winners from this government's strong economic management. Under this government the monthly interest rate paid on a home loan of $200,000 is $1,166. Take Labor's peak interest rate of 17 per cent and that monthly figure would have been $2,833. The savings delivered by lower home loan interest rates go straight into the pockets of Australian families and soon families will be able to make a choice about the alternative policy Labor puts forward in regard to economic management. </para><para>We already know what Labor is promising: billions of dollars in new spending, none of it properly costed and none of it, of course, properly funded. So the Australian people will simply have to go on the Labor Party's record. Those opposite do not like the Australian people being reminded of what life was like under Labor's management of the economy: record high interest rates, one million Australians out of work, record high budgets and tax increases across the board. You cannot trust Labor on the economy; you cannot trust Labor on jobs; you cannot trust Labor on taxes; and you cannot trust Labor on interest rates.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Drugs: DHEA</title><page.no>25876</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>25876</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison.

It is a substance which many people buy over the Internet. It is an image enhancing drug, and people take it for that property but, of course, it is an illegal drug and it is one that is seized by Customs. The point I was making the other day in relation to the seizure of these performance enhancing and image enhancing drugs is that they are acquired for a number of reasons. The opposition was asking about drugs obtained by elite athletes. The point I made was this: there were over 1,000 seizures and Customs was finding it very difficult to assess whether the drugs were being obtained by elite athletes—or by athletes at all—because when we were asked to go through the list for the forthcoming Olympic Games, we had to be provided that by the Australian Olympic Committee. In fact, I wrote to them and said, `You want this but you are going to have to tell us the names of people who are going to Athens, because Customs does not have a list of all the athletes in Australia or of elite athletes.' What we have is a situation where these illegal performance enhancing and image enhancing drugs are seized. They are drugs which are acquired by a wide range of people in the community. In these cases, Customs assesses the evidence as to what investigation can be carried out.</para></talk.start><para>In case Senator Bishop is not aware of it, in the calendar years 2002 and 2003, Customs formally investigated a total of 376 importations of performance enhancing and image enhancing drugs. Of those, 76 people were prosecuted. Of course, when you seize an illicit drug in this situation, you have the name of the person to whom it is addressed and in some cases where it came from and in some cases not. But that is all the evidence you have, and Customs has to carry out an investigation. If there is nothing further to corroborate that transaction, it makes it extremely difficult for Customs to engage in a successful prosecution. That is the point I was making the other day in relation to the investigations that can be carried out. In the further information I tabled, there were 25 sports related referrals. What you should remember is that 15 of those 25 were for non-Australians, and I think that puts it in some perspective. Some people would believe that those 25 related entirely to Australian referrals. In fact, the referrals related to seven Australian athletes only; two of 10 were for officials and one competitor was referred twice. So let us put that in context. Customs is not able to further its investigations in relation to every seizure because of the limit on evidence that is available. It carries out an excellent job, and that is reflected in the investigations and prosecutions that have been conducted. </para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>25877</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

I have not yet had an opportunity to read the judgments—I will do that. But your question, Senator, I think leaves out part of what is a difficult issue in returning people who are found not to have a lawful reason to stay here—that is, whether they themselves are contributing to not being able to be returned. There are individual circumstances in each of these cases. They are all different. I am thinking of one case—and I do not want to mention the details of it—where someone appears from the public's perspective to be stateless but has changed their story on so many occasions that you can understand departmental officials being uncertain of the veracity of the latest story. That is the advice in relation to one matter that I was given on Friday, and I will be looking at a brief in relation to that case to check the details of it.</para><para>What you did not point out, Senator, is that we do have a safety valve here—that is, ministerial discretion. It is not for life: there is a ministerial discretion; there is the opportunity for people to be given relief and stay in Australia. So it is not the case that people are necessarily detained, as you put it so dramatically, for life. Having said that, I have asked for a review of all the long-term detention cases individually to come to me. I will have a look at them and see if they warrant intervention. Equally, I will look at each of the cases of those people who are at large because of the Al Masri decision and have not yet been re-detained. So what I can confirm for you is that we have the opportunity to do these things on a case-by-case basis, and that is how it will be done.

In a system where we have a targeted asset tested pension it is absolutely important, and a reminder for everyone who is in receipt of a benefit from the taxpayer, that it is a voluntary system where people are required to advise Centrelink if there is a change in their circumstances. If they be a pensioner and there is a change in their income or a change in an asset that they have, we have a view that it is only fair that customers with particular assets or income invested in any way—whether it is structured in shares, bonds, managed funds or properties—be treated in the same way. It is a system which requires vigilance on the part of the customer to ensure that they keep Centrelink advised, not only to ensure that they are getting the right payment but also to ensure that they are getting benefits to which they are entitled. As to the details of this particular case, I am not aware of them. I will get information as appropriate. I do not know the state of this case. I do not know whether it has gone on beyond the AAT.

Senator, as you would be aware, there are a number of steps in the process of an investigation into a doping offence. The first is to establish that a prima facie case exists. Then there is the appointment of an independent investigator. That occurred with the Stanwix report. He investigated the allegations that were then on foot. The allegations on foot, if my memory serves me correctly, were that there were some general comments made about unnamed athletes injecting themselves with vitamins. At the same time, as you would be aware, some of this material was referred to the police. The police then carried out their investigations. Then there was the CAS hearing, which you would be aware of. During that CAS hearing, allegations were made about named athletes. You would be aware that Robert Anderson was asked to investigate these named athletes. So this has gone through a process which, it is my understanding, is the usual process for these matters.</para></talk.start><para>But you have to understand that the allegations, first of all, related to unnamed athletes who were injecting themselves with vitamins, which is a code of conduct issue.

These particular investigations are ongoing. As I said, the process and the issues will be considered under the terms of reference given to Robert Anderson.

Does the minister acknowledge that 10 years of the national competition policy has seen the destruction of large numbers of independent butchers, greengrocers and supermarkets, and now threatens liquor, petrol and pharmacy small businesses as well?</para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>25884</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the Democrat leader for his question.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>—Leader?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>JX4</name.id><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name></talker><para>—Sorry—Senator Cherry.

That was something we supported. Indeed, the great and extraordinary economic success of this country over the last eight years can in part be attributed to national competition policy, which has made this country much more competitive—much more able to compete internationally and much more competitive domestically, which has helped increase real wages, keep prices down and put Australians into jobs. It has been very good for the economy overall.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The original agreement has reached its use-by date. That is why we have referred the matter to the Productivity Commission. The Productivity Commission is fully examining it and will report to the government on future arrangements that it recommends for national competition policy in this country. Whether or not there will be an NCC under any future arrangements remains to be seen. It will be a function of what the Productivity Commission puts back to the government and the government's response to that. We think that is a healthy process. What the New South Wales government have put in the ring is their submission to the Productivity Commission for this review, commissioned by the government, of national competition arrangements.</para><para>One of the furphies, of course, is the proposition that states are penalised. That was never the proposition put by the Keating government. What in fact occurs is that states receive bonus payments from the federal government when they undertake measures that are in accord with national competition arrangements. If they choose not to take those measures then they do not receive the bonus payments. It is quite wrong for them to be characterised as penalties. As the Keating Labor government quite properly put in place—and as the Labor Party well understands, and as I hope the Democrats would understand—it is a question of whether the states receive bonus payments for undertaking action consistent with the original agreement between the Commonwealth and the states. We welcome the Productivity Commission inquiry into this matter. We welcome the submissions made by the states.

Looking at the article in today's <inline font-style="italic">Australian </inline>newspaper referring to carers and the freedom of information request, I could easily characterise this as volume 4, chapter 186 of the politicisation of the public sector. The case highlights the callous disregard for the circumstances of a family with one baby and acknowledges that even though this child, who required far more medical treatment and remedial treatment than perhaps a child with Down syndrome, was excluded from carer allowance provisions under the government's new regime there was very little regard for what would occur with that child. </para><para>Perhaps of greater concern in this piece is a different aspect. Highlighted in a communication from Peter Fisher, a senior Centrelink bureaucrat, is the phrase:</para><quote><para>We should have a knowledge of this—</para></quote><para>this was the Asperger syndrome issue of last year—</para><quote><para>and a line to peddle on Saturday.</para></quote><para>Where have we gotten to so that senior public sector bureaucrats refer to each other and senior Department of Family and Community Services officials with respect to the lines they need to peddle? We know where we are: we now have these senior bureaucrats thinking that to preserve their occupations they need to peddle lines for this government.</para><para>Today, the day after 43 former military chiefs and senior diplomats accused the Prime Minister of going to war with Iraq based on a deception and of making Australia a bigger terrorist target, we can see quite clearly that these misrepresentations go well beyond the areas of foreign affairs. All Australians are familiar with the `children overboard' affair and other areas of foreign affairs where concerns have been raised, but this is a very good example of how these concerns extend into areas such as social benefits. It has taken a formal freedom of information process to uncover the truth about how this government were planning to remove 30,000 families from the $90 per fortnight carer allowance. Last year Labor discovered in the government's budget figures that that was how they had costed it. That was the reduction anticipated by this government into future years. Surprise, surprise: perhaps this is the reason the government no longer provide family and community services forward estimates. Those forward estimates highlight the assumptions that the government are making based on the cuts that they intend to make.</para><para>The estimate that came out of those figures corresponded to their review of 70,000 families who received carer allowance for their disabled children. The figures seem to confirm to Labor that 30,000 of those 70,000 families would lose this important payment when they are reassessed under the government's tough new disability rules. Senator Patterson got up today and said that Labor had agreed to a review. Yes, we had agreed to a review. What we have not agreed to is their tough new disability rules. That is what this whole debate had been about. When we raised this issue with Senator Vanstone her response was to deal with our questions with utter scorn. It was claimed that Labor were scaremongering, that there was no target for removing payments and that the figure of 30,000 for those that were likely to be removed from the payment just simply was not relevant. What Senator Vanstone did not say was that she had estimates from her own department that 36,000 people would lose the payment.</para><para>What else Senator Vanstone did not say was that the Prime Minister was fully briefed on this issue as well. For the Prime Minister to say on Alan Jones's program that he had only just recently had this issue raised with him defies all credibility. As a result of this freedom of information request, we now know that he had very clear and comprehensive advice on the issues and the problems involved here months ahead. But, of course, this is not strange for the Prime Minister who was once known as `honest John'. I ask senators in this chamber whether they can recall the last time anyone referred to our Prime Minister as `honest John'. I suggest it was many years ago, and even then it was obviously a charade. The truth in this case of the government's decision to redefine what constitutes a disability has forced tens of thousands of families off the carer allowance. Nothing in this recent budget is going to compensate for that. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>25887</page.no><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name><name.id>TH4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We have Senator Collins, the shadow minister, coming in here every week, having been on the opposition benches and in the portfolio for quite some time, unable to produce an opposition policy.

Some years ago, a government being accused of being loose with the truth might have occurred fairly irregularly. It is almost a daily occurrence now with the Howard government. The feedback from the doorsteps, the street stalls and at market stalls is quite clearly that the Australian public do not trust this government. This is another perfect example of why that is the case.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Knowles would allege that we are making up stories. There is no story to be made up here.

We now know, of course, that information was requested and provided not just to the Minister for Family and Community Services but to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet almost two months before the Labor Party started asking questions and three months before the Prime Minister told Alan Jones on air, as Senator Collins said, that he knew next to nothing about what was going on. This is a government that did know, lied about what it knew and tried to hide what it knew. Senator Vanstone stood in this chamber on at least two occasions and again misled the Senate and the Australian people—this is another example—by denying that this government was about to strip the allowances of 30,000 carers. It turns out, of course, that it was 36,000 carers. The truth is the government's decision to redefine what constitutes a disability forced tens of thousands of families off the carer allowance.</para><para>I remember at the time doing some work with people in the Northern Territory who belonged to the Down Syndrome Association. They were most concerned that they were going to be taken off the list. The question that I alluded to today was that there were six conditions that were automatic qualifiers for the carer payment. We now know that they were chosen in part because they were able to get organised and they were able to get motivated. They had the loudest and noisiest concerns, so it seems with this government that the squeakiest wheel does get the grease, that the organisations that could lobby the hardest and were motivated got put on the list somehow. I am not saying that is not fair, but what about all the other disabilities that were absolutely ignored—for example, the claims about children with insulin dependent diabetes?</para><para>I am not entirely sure about the groups Senator Knowles is referring to, but a lot of people I come across who have children with disabilities or who work with people with disabilities say that they would have been eligible for the carer allowance. It is not that they did not bother to apply; it is just that the form was totally inadequate, was time consuming or did not provide them with enough space to clearly explain why they needed the carer payment. The process was made more difficult for people and it was a very frustrating process, but at the end of the day, even if you bothered to apply, most of your disabilities were cut off the list.

The fact is that we have here an attempt by the Labor Party to discredit the achievements of this government with respect to enhancing the security of Australian families, and to do so they are resorting to almost every trick in the book. They are blowing up and exaggerating cases where possibly administrative failure has occurred. They are making much of supposed contemplated changes in the system, which actually do not translate into any adverse outcomes for Australian families or for individuals entitled to particular allowances.</para></talk.start><para>Today we have heard much made of the fact that there was a difference in the projection of people affected of between 35,000 and 36,000. I do not think that is exactly riveting the families of Australia. It is not exactly generating much discussion around dinner tables and barbecues in this country. We are told that the form the government used to allow people to advise them of changes was totally inadequate. I ask senators opposite to step back a moment from what they are doing and to look at the big picture of what has happened to Australian families in the last eight years. It is hard to imagine any family or individual receiving benefits in this country through Centrelink who is not better off in real terms under this government and who has not had a substantial, measurable improvement in their condition as a result of what this government has done.</para><para>Let us make allowances for inflation and things like that and compare the condition of people on disability support benefits back in 1996 to that of the same people today. Look at the condition of people receiving family benefits in 1996 and today. Look at unemployment benefits in 1996 and today. Each of those groups of individuals or families has had a substantial increase in its position as a result of what this government has done, yet somehow the Labor Party continue to focus on the minutiae, on the irrelevant and on the untruthful in order to make their point. We even had the shadow Treasurer not long ago, the man who purports to want to manage the $800 billion Australian economy, make the claim that 8.5 million Australian families missed out on any benefit in the 2004-05 budget. That is a pretty interesting claim, because, according to the latest census data, there are only 4.9 million Australian families. Where the figure of 8.5 million Australian families missing out comes from, I do not know.</para><para>The Labor Party are in overdrive when it comes to distortion and misrepresentation at this time and the question needs to be asked: what is Labor's alternative? We are not at some abstract point in the debate where it is fair enough just to throw criticisms around; we are a matter of weeks potentially from going to the Australian community and asking for judgment. The Australian community will expect not only to judge the record of this government but also to see what are the alternatives of the alternative government—if I can use that grandiose title to describe those opposite. What are those alternatives? Of course, we do not know. We do not know what they are proposing and what they would do differently. They would do it better apparently, but what that means we do not know. They are focusing on eligibility, breaching and things like that. Tell us what you are going to do. Are you not going to penalise or ask for some accounting from those who receive payments illegitimately or illegally under the terms of the Australian law? Is that your position? We want to know, and I think the Australian community is entitled to know. As I said, there would be no Australian family not better off under this government's social security arrangements when compared with those of the former government. Until they come up with the goods on their policies, I think we are entitled to take what they say with a massive grain of salt. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>25890</page.no><name role="metadata">Moore, Sen Claire</name><name role="display">Senator MOORE</name><name.id>00AOQ</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I also am taking note of the answers given in question time this afternoon by the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Patterson.

It is not a scare campaign, Minister. The issues and concerns that we are raising are those that have been raised with us by members of the community—families, friends and indeed, as Senator Knowles referred to, some of the most vulnerable people in our community. They came to their members of parliament and they raised their concerns about what they saw as an attack on their role and entitlement with somehow a view that they were not fulfilling a worthy task and were somehow taking down the government. They raised with us the fear that the complexity of the form gave them little chance to justify their role and their entitlement to a payment from their government.</para></talk.start><para>The minister accused us of not supporting a review that we passed through legislation. As Senator Collins pointed out, we did support a review. A review process is a natural part of any legislation that is looking at entitlement. What we and the people who came to our offices are concerned about is not the fact of a review but the motivation behind the review. What is the intent of the review? Is it really to look after the people who are taking on a caring role in our community? Is it really to ensure that they are receiving appropriate payments and support from their government? Or is it a blatant attack to save money, to knock entitlements off people so that the government will then have more money? In terms of the process, we are talking about an appropriate review, one to ensure that people understand their rights, take part in the process effectively, are actively engaged with the department—in this case, Centrelink, through the Department of Family and Community Services—and are fully aware of their entitlements and responsibilities.</para><para>We need to understand the process and to work effectively with members of the community, not make them feel as though they are victims and not make them feel as though they are criminals. In this process is it right then for the minister to say that a certain number of people—and the numbers just flow off the tongue every time we hear a response, but it was several thousand people—did not bother to respond? Do we know why they did not bother to respond? Did we follow up more effectively than just by another letter in the mail? To just keep sending written information is not the way to ensure that people communicate, particularly given the time frames and workloads that some of these people have. </para><para>To a specific question this afternoon on the data-matching and debt recovery processes which may be occurring throughout the rest of this year, the minister—almost biblically—responded `not at all' twice. Twice the minister was asked whether she or her office were aware of any plans to delay data matching or debt recovery for the rest of the year. In response to that question—twice—the minister told us what data matching was. The minister told us how important debt recovery was. We know that, Minister. Because we have been through numerous Senate estimates processes, we know how important to the department effective debt recovery processes are, how much planning is involved and how many resources are required to make an effective calendar, ensuring that the appropriate processes are put in place. What we wanted to know was what processes were in place throughout the rest of the year. We did not get an answer. What we were told was that the department was the one that would have these processes in hand. What we want to know is what processes are in hand and what is going to happen in the areas of debt recovery and data matching for the rest of this year. The minister said that she never takes anything that the ALP says on face value. What we are wanting to know, Minister, is exactly what is happening. What are the motivations of the reviews that are going on? What indeed was the motivation of the attacks on the carer pension in the last year? Do not take us on face value, Minister; just simply respond to the questions that we ask and to the questions to which the carers and families of Australia deserve to know the answers.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Immigration: Detainees</title><page.no>25891</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>25891</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (Senator Vanstone) to a question without notice asked by the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Bartlett) today relating to the detention of asylum seekers and a High Court finding.</para></motion><para>On Friday last week, 6 August, as my honourable colleagues would be aware, a couple of very important decisions were handed down by the High Court of Australia. Essentially, it is now constitutional—that is how fundamental this change is—and lawful under the Migration Act to keep someone who is in detention indefinitely detained, even when there is no real likelihood of that person being able to be deported from Australia in the reasonably foreseeable future. That is the amazing part of this judgment, of this decision. We are talking about the possibility that people can be detained for life. This is a grave constitutional and legal change that has a fundamental impact on human rights in this country. </para><para>We should be debating this issue—as I hope we will do this afternoon in the context of an urgency debate initiated by the Australian Democrats. This is one of the greatest outrages. We should be doing everything in our power, for humanitarian reasons, to ensure that this legislation, this law, this ruling, does not mean that people are detained in our country for life. We should also be looking at the legal avenues through which we could prevent such a horrific thing happening, now and into the future. One way we could prevent that happening would be by establishing a bill of rights in this country. I am sure my colleagues will have more to say on that this afternoon.  </para><para>The High Court has found that under current legislation the government can detain people for the rest of their lives—and inhumane conditions do not make that detention unlawful. I am so ashamed today. I am so angry about this judgment and the implications it has for the real people, the personal tragedy, at the heart of this decision. The minister was able to use the legal jargon, and I am sure that there will be people in better positions than us who will do just that. People like Peter Qasim, with whom I met recently in Baxter detention centre, has been in detention for around six years. He is effectively stateless. What does this decision potentially mean for him? It possibly means spending the rest of his life in Baxter. How heartbreaking that is. </para><para>How have he and others reacted to this decision? We have on our conscience as a nation how these people are reacting. I know, on good authority—and I will be speaking to Peter later—that he is crushed by it. I am informed that he would rather not live than live in detention. He has nowhere to go. He is effectively stateless, so he cannot go anywhere else. That is the problem. This judgment means that, regardless of not being able to be deported in the foreseeable future, he is stuck in detention, and maybe for life. This is a young man who came to this country fearing persecution, a man born in the disputed region of Kashmir on 14 May 1974. His father was murdered by security forces because of his political activities—peaceful activities, apparently. His mother died after that. </para><para>As a young man, his own peaceful opposition to the government's brutal policies in the region led him to be detained and tortured in his own country by security forces and, after some years in hiding and on the run, he fled his country. He passed through Singapore and Papua New Guinea on his way to our country, but these were places in which he had no legal right to remain, and there was no way to have his claim for asylum heard. So he came to Australia on 9 September 1998. The delegate of the minister assessed his claim, accepting that he was an Indian citizen from the region of Kashmir, and that he had been tortured. But she did not at that point believe that he faced persecution. To cut a long story short, he has been in detention all this time. For five—almost six—years Peter Qasim has been in detention. The implication of Friday's judgment is that he will be in detention for life. If we are not debating this as a matter of urgency this afternoon—I am sure we will be; the writing is on the wall—we should be discussing this in our national newspapers and in other national fora.

In fact, since 1996 I have never done that. It is a practice that was regularly followed by Senator Hill and Senator Chaney when they were leaders of the opposition during the life of the Hawke and Keating governments, a practice that senators who have been here since 1996 would be well aware of. I do not do it, and this opposition does not do it, but on this occasion I think comment needs to be made about the absence from the chamber of the Minister for the Arts and Sport, Senator Kemp. The Labor Party will not oppose the motion, but I want to speak briefly to it.</para></talk.start><para>I received a letter on 6 August from Senator Hill indicating that Senator Kemp would be absent, representing the government at the Athens Olympics. I interpret the government whip's comments about `parliamentary business overseas' to be Senator Kemp's attendance at the Olympics. I do not understand why it is necessary for the minister for sport to leave the chamber and his important parliamentary duties today to attend the Olympic Games, given that the opening ceremony for the Olympic Games is to be at 4 a.m., eastern standard time. So he is leaving early, getting out of here as quickly as he can, because there are many issues he probably does not want to be present in the chamber to deal with. I admit that we are probably better off without him. I am sure most people would accept that we are probably better off without him because no minister could give a worse performance than we have seen from Senator Kemp at question time.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Honourable senator interjecting—</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—I am sure about that. I do not believe we could have a more vacillating minister, a more inept minister, a more incompetent minister or a minister who is less across the detail than Senator Kemp. You can nominate a minister if you like, Senator Brown or Senator Murray, but I cannot think of one. I really do believe that his performance has been an absolute disgrace in relation to the crucial issue that has been before this parliament—the very important issue of drugs in sport. It is of course an issue the minister has to accept responsibility for.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I understand that this is a lap of honour for Senator Kemp. I know that the brothers Kemp are in the doghouse. I know—everyone on the government side tells me—that Senator Kemp will not be a minister if the Howard government is re-elected. I understand that, but that is no excuse for leaving the parliament early for the Olympics. Even though Senator Kemp's time must be up, even though he has no ministerial future, the key point here—and I take this opportunity to stress it—is that Senator Kemp leaves at a time when we have a real scandal on drugs in sport. There is a festering scandal on drugs in sport being left behind as Senator Kemp jets off on this lap of honour. </para><para>The key thing is that it should never have got to this. Senator Kemp should have acted way back in December last year and instructed the Australian Sports Commission and the Australian Institute of Sport to deal with these issues. These issues of drugs in sport should have been dealt with comprehensively. They should have been dealt with with expedition so that we did not find ourselves with these matters still unresolved just a few days before the Olympic Games. It is an absolute indictment on this minister. He has very limited ministerial responsibilities. He is minister for sport and for the arts. I know he has struggled with that comparatively minor portfolio. I know that Senator Kemp is the only minister in the history of the Commonwealth of Australia who has been demoted from the position of Assistant Treasurer—even lower down the pecking order. But when an issue like this comes up, however small those ministerial responsibilities might be, he has the task to do the job properly.</para><para>Those matters that were identified in December last year should have been investigated and dealt with well before this week leading up to the Olympic Games—when they are still unresolved—and when the evidence was fresh. So I say quite clearly that I am disappointed that Senator Kemp is leaving early at this time to attend the Olympic Games. There are many questions that need to be asked of the minister in relation to these matters. As I say, they will be asked of another minister, who certainly could not do any worse—no minister could do any worse—than Senator Kemp on these issues. I think everyone understands, and I believe the Prime Minister understands, that Australian sport has been failed here. I sincerely hope that when Senator Kemp gets to Athens for this lap of honour he does not embarrass Australia as he has embarrassed himself in this chamber on this very important issue of drugs in sport.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>25898</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We have just seen a farcical performance by a former minister for sport.

He turned a blind eye to corruption within the sport that just about brought it to its knees in this country. It is still recovering from his negligence as a minister.

What a recipe for disaster! </para><para>Our minister, Senator Rod Kemp, who will represent the Australian government at the Olympics, will be travelling there early for very good reason. What happened when Senator Faulkner was the minister? I cannot recall whether he went to an Olympic Games—I think he was one of the shortest-serving sports ministers in history, so he probably missed out—but he did go to the Commonwealth Games. His typical behaviour was to turn up to a sporting event, swan around the opening ceremony, go to a few high-profile sports and then scurry home again. Senator Kemp is doing the opposite.

Senator Faulkner, who was one of the worst ministers for sport and an abject failure as a minister for the environment, is trying to put the kybosh on Minister Kemp. We have seen an obscene politicisation of this drugs in sport issue in cycling. It is a political beat-up by Senator Faulkner and the Labor Party for their own cheap and disgraceful political purposes. We have a minister out there doing a good job and handling it professionally, only to be undermined by people who want to score cheap political points.</para><para>What we saw today was a disgrace. I suspect that Senator Faulkner was trying to fill in a few minutes because the Labor Party's real problem today is that they have been promising the parliament, day after day, these amendments on the FTA legislation. We asked for them last Tuesday. The reply was, `Yes, we're working on them.' We asked for them last Wednesday. The reply was, `Yes, they're coming.' We asked for them last Thursday. The reply was, `Yes, they're coming.' On Friday they did not appear; on Saturday they did not appear; on Sunday they did not appear. It is now Monday and I have been asking the Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate, `Have you got the amendments?'

Following the 4-3 decision of the High Court it is now law in this country—and to be technical it was not law until Friday because previously there was a standing decision of the Federal Court to the contrary—that a person can be kept in migration detention indefinitely even when they have said that they want to be deported, even when the Australian government has tried for a prolonged period of time, without success, to deport them, and when there is no real likelihood of that person being able to be deported in the reasonably foreseeable future. Even in such circumstances that person can be kept locked up indefinitely. It is quite literally a life sentence or a potential life sentence for a person who has not been charged and who has not been tried—without any scope for judicial oversight of that detention. That is obviously extremely serious and extremely distressing. To use the words of one of the High Court judges who ruled in favour of the government, it is a tragic situation for the people concerned—and the person concerned in this case.</para><para>It is, I suggest, an extremely serious situation for the entire Australian community because we now have a situation where a government minister can deny freedom to a person, can lock them up for administrative purposes indefinitely, without recourse to the courts, without charge, as long as they can get an act through the parliament that gives them that power and that power relates to one of the heads of power in the Constitution. We have an act such as that today, which is the Migration Act, that gives the power to keep a person in administrative detention forever, even if they cannot be deported. That act gives that power to a government minister. It also means that it is now lawful if a government can get a law through this parliament in a whole range of other areas, and the obvious immediate potential is in the area of security and all the so-called antiterrorist legislation that is being passed, with a clear head of power for the government to act in that area. It would be lawful, if a relevant act empowered the government to do so, to detain someone indefinitely without charge on the grounds of security and public safety. I believe that is something that the vast majority of Australians would find extremely concerning and I believe it is not what the parliament could possibly have envisaged when it passed this particular section of the Migration Act back in 1992. </para><para>I should emphasise that the Democrats strongly oppose mandatory detention and we strongly oppose keeping people in detention any longer than is necessary, but under the act as it stands the purpose of detention is to keep people in detention whilst their claim for a visa is being assessed and to keep them available for deportation as soon as is practicable. The problem for the people involved in the cases before the High Court—and a range of other people—is that it is not practicable at any stage in the foreseeable future for those people to be deported. So the purpose of keeping them in detention so they can be deported as soon as practicable, I would have thought, becomes void. I submit that that would have been the intention of the parliament when this piece of legislation was passed. But we never know, of course, and the fact is that the High Court has ruled otherwise, so my opinion of what the intention of the parliament might have been and my opinion about how the act should be interpreted does not matter. The High Court have spoken, as they have the power to do under the Constitution, and they have interpreted the law to allow the government of the day to keep a person in administrative detention indefinitely.</para><para>Today in question time the minister said, `We have got a safety valve because we have got ministerial discretion, so is not forever because the minister can let a person out.' They can, but they do not have to, and there is no legal avenue anyone can pursue to compel them to let that person out. There are people now in detention, from even before this decision—because the government was resisting the interpretation of the law as it previously stood—who have been there for one, two, three or four years who have signed a piece of paper saying: `Deport me. I am willing to go. Send me back.' And the Australian government has not been successful in sending them anywhere, so they have been detained. There is a person in Baxter, Mr Kassim, who has been in detention since 1998. He has submitted to go back. He is originally from the disputed region of Kashmir but has not been able to obtain travel documents and has not been accepted by the government over there, so he is perpetually locked up. Can any of us imagine what it would be like to have to face that scenario? What would it be like to be a human being denied your freedom, caught in the ultimate bureaucratic catch-22 and imprisoned for the foreseeable future without any legal avenue to pursue?</para><para>This undermines one of the most fundamental principles that our country and our rule of law are built upon: the right to freedom. Freedom from arbitrary imprisonment by an executive government is one that is now clearly at risk. There is a wide range of issues that could flow on from this. The bill of rights debate needs to be explored again. But all this motion seeks to say is that this decision indicates an interpretation of the law that the Democrats believe goes far too far and that we should immediately reverse that and enable a person to be freed from detention if there is no prospect of them being deported in the foreseeable future. There are plenty of other things that we believe should happen, but that simple fact, that simple situation, that people should not be condemned to the prospect of perpetual detention without any recourse to a court, should be removed. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>25903</page.no><name role="metadata">Mason, Sen Brett</name><name role="display">Senator MASON</name><name.id>84M</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Bartlett raises some really important issues this afternoon. Let me join him on the most important of them. What the High Court decided was that failed asylum seekers—that is, those people who have no right to be in this country—who cannot be deported immediately from Australia can be held in detention until there is a place to which they can be deported. In other words, unlawful noncitizens can be detained until they are either deported or removed or a visa is found for them. It is that simple. People who are not entitled to be here can remain in detention, full stop. Despite the outrage expressed by Senator Bartlett, we are talking about people who arrived in this country seeking asylum, whose cases have been often exhaustively examined—sometimes over months or, indeed, years—and who have gone through all the appeal processes and been found not to qualify for refugee status. In summary, these people have no legal right to remain in Australia. The reason they cannot be deported immediately is either that they are stateless or there is insufficient identification to ascertain their country of origin. What Senator Bartlett's amendment proposes is that it should be illegal for the government to detain those people if we cannot deport them in the reasonably foreseeable future. What Senator Bartlett is saying is that people who are not refugees—those people who have gone through the process and do not qualify as refugees—who have no right to be here, should be set free, at large in the community, if we cannot deport them straightaway.</para></talk.start><para>My friend and colleague Senator Brandis will discuss the High Court's decision later. Let me draw on one quick quote from Justice Callinan in the al-Khafaji case. This goes to the heart of the matter. In relation to the relevant sections of the Migration Act, Justice Callinan says:</para><quote><para>The statutory language here is specific and clear. It gives effect to the difference in status between aliens and citizens. Such curtailment of freedom as occurs—</para></quote><para>it occurs—</para><quote><para>occurs for a statutory purpose within constitutional power only. People who do not have valid claims to refugee status or to whom the nation owes no obligations of protection take the risk in unlawfully entering the country that they will be detained. It is difficult to believe that they can have any different understanding. If they do, ignorance of the Australian law can afford them no greater excuse than it would an Australian citizen.</para></quote><para>People coming into this country cannot expect, if they have no right to be here, to be at liberty in this community. Let me just say that again, because that is the nub of it: people who come here and have no right to be here cannot expect to be at liberty in our community. That is the argument in a sentence.</para><para>Let me concentrate very briefly on the public policy impacts of Senator Bartlett's proposition. There are several of them, but let me come to the crux. If Senator Bartlett's amendment became law, what consequences would it have? Mr Acting Deputy President, imagine you are an asylum seeker who has not been granted refugee status in Australia and all your avenues of appeal have been exhausted. According to Senator Bartlett, you should be set free until such time as we can find a country for you to be deported to. He is saying, `We'll let you out into the community, but come and see us when we've found you a country that you can be deported to.' Is that going to work? What sort of public policy answer is that? According to him, we should let people into the community and, as soon as we have found a place they can be deported to, say, `Come and check in at the police station so we can send you back to a country where you may not necessarily want to go.' It is not even a practical outcome. It is not going to work. </para><para>Secondly, it would create an unfair new migration category of people who cannot stay in Australia because they have not satisfied the requirements under any of the migration streams but who are nevertheless allowed to stay because no-one wants them. Is that fair? In this country we have one of the most generous refugee programs in the world. During 2003-04, over 13,000 humanitarian program visas were granted—the greatest number in eight years. Eighty-five per cent of those were dedicated to people being resettled from refugee situations overseas—people often living in really desperate circumstances in places like the Kakuma camp in Kenya; not people that came here, sought refugee status and had that status denied. There are so many other people—desperate people—that want to come to this country. What this country will not allow—cannot allow, of course—is queue jumpers.</para><para>Ultimately, Australia has an obligation to make sure that failed asylum seekers are safe and secure—I accept that; we all do—but not that they are at liberty. I accept that failed asylum seekers should not be pushed out of Australia if we do not know where they come from, but that does not mean they should be set free among the community. My friend Senator Bartlett has been busy the last few days in the press. An article on page 6 of the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> on Saturday said:</para><quote><para>Senator Bartlett said the court had unfortunately found that the Government had the power to lock up for the rest of their lives people who had committed no crime.</para></quote><para>That is right: they have committed no crime, but they also have no right to be here. They may have committed no crime, but they have no right to be in this country. That is why they will be deported as soon as a place can be found, and that is why the government believes they should be held in detention until then. Finally, the article continued:</para><quote><para>“The potential for this massive increase in government power, without legal protection, is chilling,” he said.</para></quote><para>There is no increase in government power at all. This, of course, is Labor legislation dating, I think, from 1992. These are Labor provisions. In the end, there is always ministerial discretion. As Senator Vanstone said today, ministerial discretion can take care of those genuine cases where people cannot find a country to go to and where humanitarian reasons mean that ministerial discretion should be accorded.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>25904</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Omit all words after paragraph (a), substitute:</para></quote><para>(b)	acknowledge that the High Court in its finding was dealing with the small number of cases who are regarded as `stateless';</para><para>(c)	acknowledge that the 4/3 finding, with the Chief Justice in the minority, reflects the very serious concern in the community of asylum seekers being detained for lengthy periods of time;</para><para>(d)	condemn the Government for its failures in the asylum seeker area, in particular, the lengthy detention of asylum seekers without review, the detention of children for lengthy periods, and its refusal until recently to contemplate graduated detention;</para><para>(e)	note that Labor's policy approach requires graduated detention and the ongoing monthly review of asylum seekers who are not finally assessed within 90 days of claiming asylum; </para><para>(f)	believe that Labor's approach will ensure that the small number of failed asylum seekers who are `stateless' will not be left in limbo for lengthy periods of time;</para><para>(g)	believe that Labor's approach will ensure a case by case assessment of such cases, leading to settlement in a third party nation state, or the use in these cases of alternative forms of detention, including residential housing projects, supervision in the community or release into the Australian community on a temporary basis pursuant to the exercise of ministerial discretion; and</para><para>(h)	call on the minister to immediately review the two individuals concerned, with a view to deciding whether their continuing detention in Baxter detention centre is appropriate and in the public interest given their recent presence in the Australian community for 12 months on terms and conditions as set by the Federal Court.</para><para>Firstly, let me say that the High Court ruling made on Friday underlines the point which Labor supports—that detention in immigration detention centres can only be for immigration purposes, not for a punitive purpose. The four to three ruling of the High Court also underlines community concern at lengthy periods in detention without review. Senator Bartlett's motion seems to want to eliminate mandatory detention altogether, and that is something the Labor Party does not support. Unfortunately, Senator Bartlett is trying to use the narrow point the High Court was required to rule on to broaden the debate to one on the overall mandatory detention of unauthorised arrivals.</para><para>The narrow point of the case before the High Court was whether the ability to resettle a stateless person, who cannot be returned to a state of origin, sees the immigration purposes ceasing and, therefore, the basis for detention disappearing when all efforts have been exhausted to settle that person in a third-party nation-state. This has always been a very difficult point in Australian immigration and migration administration, and generally it has been dealt with on a case-by-case basis. The difficulty of the issue has been heightened by this government's obsession to condone long-term immigration detention. </para><para>The government has presided over a very bad period of immigration detention, in my view. The government's administration and policy on immigration detention have undermined the integrity of Australia's migration regime and have left it open to criticisms, such as allegations of punitive detention, by allowing lengthy periods of detention without graduation of detention or regular review. These criticisms go to the heart of the overwhelming problem of asylum seekers under the Howard government's regime. This government has taken the integrity out of Australia's approach. </para><para>The High Court ruled by majority that keeping a stateless person in immigration detention indefinitely is not punitive. Under the Migration Act the government has the authority to detain a person for migration purposes—and Friday's decision more than reinforces that authority. It also provides the authority to detain a person who in all likelihood will not be returned to their country of origin or settled in a third nation-state. When it comes to stateless people, the options are to attempt to resettle them in a third-party nation-state or to make a judgment about a person's ongoing detention, such as an alternative form or graduation of detention or release into the community. The government has traditionally adopted a case-by-case assessment approach to detention, but not in this instance. </para><para>The Senate Select Committee on Ministerial Discretion in Migration Matters highlighted the government's inability to understand the process and to ensure it has clear guidelines and operates in a fair, transparent way. This government has lacked integrity in this area—a lot of decisions have not been transparent and have been made behind closed doors. The Prime Minister, the former minister for immigration, Mr Ruddock—and it appears that the current minister is continuing in this vein—have allowed this system to fall by the wayside.  </para><para>Labor's approach is far more sensible. It advocates a case-by-case approach which will ensure that people are not lost in the system for long periods of time and that we have an immigration system of integrity that treats people with civility and dignity. It will also ensure that there is transparency and openness in the process. Under Labor's new policy approach there is a mechanism that deals with this difficult situation. Firstly, we believe strongly that immigration detention can only be for an immigration purpose. Secondly, we believe in graduations of detention—once an initial assessment has been completed, it is possible to contemplate graduations of detention such as residential housing projects, which we see at Port Augusta, and supervision in the community, which we have seen more recently from the government. </para><para>We have also made it clear that one of the great problems with the government's very bad policy and administration in this area is that people are being left in limbo for long periods of time. That is why we have committed ourselves to a policy approach of 90 per cent of people being dealt with and finally assessed in 90 days and those people who cannot be assessed in that way being subject to a monthly review. That is the best way of ensuring that people are not lost in the system. As I understand the facts and circumstances of both Mr al-Kateb's and Mr al-Khafaji's cases, until the decision on Friday they had both been in the community for at least 12 months, under conditions provided by the court. </para><para>I understand that Minister Vanstone is currently considering the case of these two persons, and I assume that is with respect to the terms of the discretion available to her as minister. However, another issue highlighted during the course of the select committee on ministerial discretion is that the basis upon which she makes the decision whether or not these persons should be granted discretion and be released—and the conditions that might also be attached—rests only in her mind; the decision that the minister makes is not transparent for this parliament to look at. In fact, if she did make that decision, I believe that we would get a pro forma report—not something with considered reasons why she made her decision—tabled in parliament in six months time.</para><para>I hope in truth that Minister Vanstone is now contemplating whether it is appropriate in accordance with the exercise of ministerial discretion that these two persons be released back into the community on similar terms and conditions. The minister must now make a judgment whether it is sensible to return these persons to Baxter at taxpayers' expense, given the fact that they have been in the community for at least 12 months, under various terms and conditions, or not to return them—in other words, to make or exercise her ministerial discretion. Under Labor the latter would happen. Labor would approach this in a much more humanitarian and different manner to that by which the present minister and the former minister have approached stateless persons. We would determine these matters, as I have stated earlier, on a case-by-case basis. </para><para>The High Court, in this instance, has outlined—and enabled us to underscore in the debate that we are having today—that you can only detain people in immigration detention centres for an immigration purpose. The court has also ruled that, while the possibilities of returning a person to their country of origin or settling them in a third nation-state exist—regardless of how remote those possibilities are—a person can be detained for immigration purposes. But the 4-3 majority also reflects that the court shares the community's and my very grave concerns about people being detained for lengthy periods of time. </para><para>Labor's approach is to ensure that 90 per cent of people are assessed in 90 days and that those who are not assessed on that basis and remain in immigration detention beyond that period are reviewed on a monthly basis. When you have a very small number of people who are stateless, you have to make a judgment as to whether it is possible to return them to a third-party nation-state. If it is not possible, you have to make a judgment on a case-by-case basis about different forms of detention—for example a residential housing project, supervision in the community in the case of these two appellants or releasing them into the Australian community on a temporary visa basis.</para><para>The decision will receive significant reading by more learned persons than me. Justice Gleeson said:</para><quote><para>A more difficult question, which does not arise in the present case, concerns the power of a court to impose conditions or restraints in the case of a person who is shown to be a danger to the community or to be likely to abscond. It may be that the reason for difficulty in arranging for the removal of a detainee is that the detainee is regarded by his country of nationality, and other countries, as a dangerous person. Whether that could affect the detainee's right to be released from administrative detention, or the terms and conditions of release, is a matter that could arise for decision in another case.</para></quote><para>The difference between the government's position and Labor's position is fundamental to the motion we are debating today. The High Court ruling made on Friday is indicative of what we have seen for the last eight years from this government. The government has presided over very bad policy and very bad administration in this area. It has allowed people to be lost in limbo. It has allowed people to be lost in the system. Essentially it has said that people can stay in Baxter for lengthy periods of time because this would somehow deter other people from coming to Australian shores.</para><para>In the course of this year we have seen Minister Vanstone subtly change from the previous minister's dogged approach to asylum seekers and to shift the emphasis to ministerial discretion, but there is no commitment from the government to change the system for the better. We have not seen a report of the Senate Select Committee on Ministerial Discretion in Migration Matters, and we do not know whether the government will act upon those very good recommendations of the committee. That, in truth, underlies this government. The government now has before it a report on ministerial discretion that includes recommendations to make the system more open, transparent and fairer for all. The government remains silent on the issue. There is no commitment from the government to change the system by way of legislation. Minister Vanstone has slipped people out from Baxter and from Nauru in the middle of the night, behind closed doors. We want to change the system for the better. That means, so far as detention is concerned, committing to graduations of detention and not to Senator Vanstone's whim. Labor's new processing system would see 90 per cent of people processed in 90 days. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>25908</page.no><name role="metadata">Brandis, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator BRANDIS</name><name.id>008W7</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Last Friday the High Court gave its judgment in two consolidated appeals—al-Kateb and al-Khafaji. Although the facts were somewhat different, the cases raised a common question: what may one lawfully do under the Migration Act in the case of illegal entrants to Australia who have applied unsuccessfully for protection visas but who, because of their stateless condition, cannot be deported to another country; and, in particular, is it a misuse of the Commonwealth's power to keep such people in detention while attempts are made to find a destination to which they may be deported? The cases were resolved in favour of the government in both instances. </para></talk.start><para>We have heard a lot of rather emotional rhetoric from Senator Stott Despoja and Senator Bartlett about locking people up for life. The fact is that all that those cases decided was that it is not beyond the exercise of the Commonwealth's power to detain people for an indefinite period of time as a preliminary to seeking to deport them. As soon as a state can be found that will accept those two people, they will be deported. In fact, in both cases they sought to be deported, having exhausted their legal remedies under the Migration Act.</para><para>The facts were slightly different but the principal proceedings were the al-Kateb proceedings. Let me say something briefly about them. Mr al-Kateb arrived unlawfully in Australia by boat in December 2000. He is a stateless person. He was born in Kuwait of Palestinian parents. The government of Kuwait will not accept him, and the governing authorities of Palestine will not accept him either. He sought to be classified as a refugee and his application failed. He appealed that decision to the Refugee Review Tribunal, and his appeal was dismissed. He sought review of the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal in the Federal Court, and his review application failed. He then appealed that decision of the Federal Court to the full court of the Federal Court, and that appeal was dismissed. So there were four administrative or judicial determinations of Mr al-Kateb's claim for refugee status, and every one of them failed. You could not possibly say that he did not have the opportunity of a hearing. He then sought to challenge the relevant provisions of the Migration Act, not because he was a refugee but on the ground of habeas corpus.</para><para>Senator Mason made the point very well. It was also the point made in the leading judgment of the High Court by Justice Hayne, who pointed out:</para><quote><para>The detention to be examined is not the detention of someone who, but for the fact of the detention, would have been, and been entitled to be, free in the Australian community.</para></quote><para>We are dealing here with a person who came to Australia unlawfully, who took full and free advantage of the Australian law to seek to establish his status as a refugee and who failed on four consecutive occasions. So this is not a case of a man who is entitled to be considered to be a refugee. </para><para>It is a hard case; I accept it is a hard case. It may very well—because of the element of hardship involved—be a proper case for the exercise of the ministerial discretion. Senator Vanstone indicated in question time today that she would consider the matter, and no doubt she will do so with care and sensitivity. Nevertheless, it remains that we are dealing with a person who came here unlawfully, not as a refugee, who failed on four consecutive occasions to establish their statutes as a refugee, who actually sought to be deported from Australia and who has no right or entitlement—as Senator Mason and Justice Hayne have both pointed out—to be at liberty in the Australian community. I think Justice Hayne put the question very well and very directly when he said in his judgment:  </para><quote><para>It is essential to confront the contention that, because the time at which detention will end cannot be predicted, its indefinite duration (even, so it is said, for the life of the detainee) is or will become punitive. The answer to that is simple but must be made. If that is the result, it comes about because the non-citizen came to or remained in this country without permission. </para></quote><para>	...	...	...</para><quote><para>The removal of an unlawful non-citizen from Australia then depends upon the willingness of some other country to receive that person. If the unlawful non-citizen is stateless, as is Mr Al-Kateb, there is no nation state which Australia may ask to receive its citizen. </para></quote><para>His Honour went on to quote from one of the most distinguished and, I might say, most famous liberal American jurists, Judge Learned Hand, in an opinion he wrote in an equivalent American case in 1952, United States v.

In slightly more old-fashioned language, Judge Learned Hand said: </para><quote><para>“An alien, who comes to our shores and the ship which bears him, take the chance that he may not be allowed to land. If that chance turns against them, both know, or, if they do not, they are charged with knowledge, that, since the alien cannot land, he must find an asylum elsewhere ... When at his urgence we do let him go ashore ... we may give him whatever harborage we choose, until he finds shelter elsewhere if he can.”</para></quote><para>Those are the facts in this very sad case. As I say, it may be an occasion for the exercise of ministerial discretion. But it cannot be charged against the Australian government or the Australian people that the operation of this act—an act originally amended to its current form by the Keating government—is unjust, when the person suffering a liability under the act is a person who comes here, as Justice Hayne said, without permission, who has exhausted the avenues which Australia has afforded him and who, through no fault of the Australian government, cannot find a state to be deported to. It is a sad set of circumstances, but the blame for that set of circumstances does not lie at the feet of the Australian people.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>25909</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>APA</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I listened with interest to the contributions of both Senator Mason and Senator Brandis to this urgency motion, and I certainly have to agree with one thing—these people are in an extremely difficult situation. Indeed, I could not have put it better myself. But we have surely now got ourselves to a situation where we need to show some compassion and some concern for people who did not come here illegally: they came here to seek asylum. They have been found under our very tough laws—and you correctly say that it was Labor that originally brought in these laws; and they have been toughened since—not to be entitled to asylum. What are they entitled to? That is where we are at now with this High Court decision. </para></talk.start><para>Basically there are three key problems: firstly, the policy of mandatory detention; secondly, forecasting whether or not there is any possibility in the future that someone can be removed—in other words, whether international circumstances will change; and, thirdly, the issue of cooperation of another country. After all other avenues have failed, we come now to ministerial discretion. With the High Court decision being very clear, this will be the last opportunity for these people. </para><para>At the end of the day, the problem is our law being so tough and so inflexible that people are asking to be taken out of Australia. They have had enough. They are sick of being locked up. They are sick of the persecution here. They want to go but, as we see in the case of Mr al-Kateb, there is no possibility of that. His home state will not accept him and nor will anyone else. The courts have accepted that Mr al-Khafaji would be persecuted in his home state of Iraq. He cannot go back there. Syria, where he spent some time, does not want him—so back he goes into endless detention.  </para><para>It is an absolute absurdity that someone who has not committed any criminal act, who has never been found guilty of any wrongdoing on Australian soil, can face basically life imprisonment—no parole, no hope of ever being released. The way the courts are forced to interpret our law is pretty clear. In the future there may be some vague chance that one of these gentlemen will find that their home state or, in Mr al-Khafaji's case, another state, Syria, have changed their mind and decided to accept them. Until then, there is no chance of any sort of normal life for them in a community; it is back into detention.</para><para>The High Court states:</para><quote><para>There are, however, exceptional cases, where a visa application has been determined adversely to an alien, or an alien has requested removal, but removal is not possible in the circumstances which prevail at the time and which are likely to prevail in the foreseeable future.</para></quote><para>The court asks:</para><quote><para>What happens then? Is the consequence indefinite, perhaps permanent, detention? The Act does not, in express terms, address that problem. [3]</para></quote><para>Basically, I am here today arguing that we must change this. I am asking the minister to go back to the legislation and make sure that we do not see this situation happening again, because I understand that there are another half-a-dozen, eight or 10 people who could find themselves in this situation. In these two specific cases, as they have exhausted all of their legal options, I call on the minister to have some compassion, to use her ministerial discretion, and to give these people the opportunity to have some sort of a reasonable life by being allowed into the Australian community. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>25910</page.no><name role="metadata">Kirk, Sen Linda</name><name role="display">Senator KIRK</name><name.id>00AOO</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I also rise this afternoon to speak on the urgency motion presented to the Senate by the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Bartlett. As speakers in this debate so far have said, we are here to acknowledge the finding of the High Court last Friday that it is in fact constitutional, and also lawful, under the Migration Act to keep a person in detention indefinitely even in circumstances where there is no real likelihood of that person being able to be deported from Australia in the reasonably foreseeable future. Senator Ludwig has moved an amendment to Senator Bartlett's motion to omit all paragraphs after (a) and insert new paragraphs (b) to (h). I will talk briefly about these points before turning to the substance of my remarks.</para></talk.start><para>This amendment acknowledges that the High Court in its finding was dealing with the small number of cases who are regarded as stateless persons. We acknowledge that the finding of the High Court was a split 4-3 decision, with the Chief Justice, Justice Gleeson, in the minority. We think this reflects the very serious concern there is in the community over asylum seekers being detained for lengthy periods of time. We condemn the government for its failures in the asylum seeker area—in particular, the lengthy detention of asylum seekers without review and the detention of children for lengthy periods, which I have spoken about on many occasions in the Senate.</para><para>We also condemn the government's refusal—until recently—to contemplate graduations of detention. We note that Labor's policy approach requires graduations of detention and the ongoing monthly review of asylum seekers who are not finally assessed within 90 days of claiming asylum. We believe Labor's approach will ensure that the small number of failed asylum seekers who are stateless will not be left in legal limbo for lengthy periods of time. We believe that Labor's approach will ensure a case-by-case assessment of such cases, leading to settlement in a third-party nation state or the use in these cases of alternative forms of detention—including residential housing projects, supervision in the community or release into the Australian community on a temporary basis pursuant to the exercise of ministerial discretion. Finally, in our amendment we call on the minister to immediately review the two individuals concerned, with a view to deciding whether their continuing detention in the Baxter detention centre is appropriate and whether it is in the public interest, given their recent presence in the Australian community for 12 months on terms and conditions as laid down by the Federal Court. </para><para>As a number of speakers have indicated today, these High Court decisions delivered on Friday, 6 August are of extreme importance and great significance not only to the asylum seekers concerned but also to those who remain in detention and to members of the Australian community who look upon this government's policy in relation to asylum seekers as a national shame. As has been indicated, the finding was a 4-3 decision. I think that in itself is very significant. It highlights the importance of the issues that we are dealing with here, and also the significance of the issues in terms of trying to reach a decision which is both consistent with the law and yet enables some compassion to be shown.</para><para>In the time that I have left I wish to make some brief remarks about the judgments. My focus will be on the decisions of the three minority judges—namely, Chief Justice Gleeson and Justices Gummow and Kirby. I should say at the outset that I do not wish to make any criticism of the majority judges in this case because I think they were faced with a very difficult situation. It was a difficult case of statutory interpretation of the relevant provisions. On the basis of the existing law, in many ways they were left with very little option other than to make findings in the way that they did. I refer to the decisions of the minority justices in this case because I think they highlight that there was some scope, some opportunity, to inject into this area of the law some decency, some compassion and some integrity—which is so needed and on which so many individuals' lives depend.</para><para>In his judgment Chief Justice Gleeson recognised the difficulty in the case of statutory interpretation that was before him, but he was prepared to accept what had been accepted by the Federal Court of Australia when, in the case of Al Masri, it ordered the release of asylum seekers into the community in circumstances where—as these stateless persons are—stateless people cannot be returned either to their country of origin or to a third-party country. Chief Justice Gleeson was willing to accept, as the Federal Court did, that it is not inconsistent with the remedy of habeas corpus to make an order which permits a person to be released into the community and to impose conditions as part of a final order for release from detention for an individual. Chief Justice Gleeson was able, if you like, to get around the strictness of the existing law by accepting that it is within the power of the Federal Court of Australia—and, indeed, any chapter 3 court—to make a final order for release into the community on conditions.</para><para>I now move to the judgment of Justice Gummow, who took a similar approach to that of Chief Justice Gleeson. Like Chief Justice Gleeson, Justice Gummow was prepared to accept that it is certainly possible and within the discretion of the courts to make an order for the release of an individual into the community on conditions and in circumstances where it is quite clear there is no reasonable prospect of that person being deported from Australia and moved to another country willing to take them. </para><para>Finally, I would like to mention the judgment of Justice Kirby. Justice Kirby's judgment really does highlight, to me at least, the gravity of the issues at stake here. I think we should not read these judgments, as I and many others have done, and just look at the strict law. We need to think very seriously about the context in which these decisions are being made and the implications that this decision will have not only for those asylum seekers who remain in detention but for those who may come to this country in the future. In his dissenting judgment Justice Kirby said:</para><quote><para>I dissent from the majority view in this case—</para></quote><para>and he noted that this view:</para><quote><para>... has grave implications for the liberty of the individual in this country which this Court should not endorse.</para></quote><para>Justice Kirby was prepared, in layman's terms, `to read between the lines'. He was prepared to look to the way in which this law operates at an international level and, where there is some ambiguity, to permit international law to shape the common law. He makes references to international law principles and believes that, in his view, it is not inconsistent with our Constitution for international law to shape our constitutional principles. At paragraph 175, Justice Kirby said:</para><quote><para>Whatever may have been possible in the world of 1945, the complete isolation of constitutional law from the dynamic impact of international law is neither possible nor desirable today. That is why national courts, and especially national constitutional courts such as this, have a duty, so far as possible, to interpret their constitutional texts in a way that is generally harmonious with the basic principles of international law, including as that law states human rights and fundamental freedoms.</para></quote><para>We need to be aware that this was a difficult constitutional law case for the High Court, and it has decided as it saw fit. We have a majority judgment; yet three judges in the minority, including Chief Justice Gleeson, took a contrary view. As Senator Ludwig has indicated, Labor will take a different approach to these issues when in government and will introduce some compassion and integrity into the process, which I think have been sadly lacking from the Howard government.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>25912</page.no><name role="metadata">Payne, Sen Marise</name><name role="display">Senator PAYNE</name><name.id>M56</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—At this stage in the debate it is worth noting that, in its consideration of the High Court's findings of 6 August last, the Senate has approached the issue very seriously and in a very considered manner. That has not always been the case—sometimes these issues involve a lot of flailing of arms and words—but on this occasion it has been a considered discussion. That is very important and is indicative of the seriousness of the issues at hand and the state in which the individuals to whom the High Court's decision applies find themselves.</para></talk.start><para>By a 4-3 majority the High Court has held that the Migration Act provisions requiring the continued detention of unlawful noncitizens are not invalid and that, under the act, detention must continue until an unlawful noncitizen is removed from Australia, deported or granted a visa. As we know from previous discussion, the majority of the court held that, as a purpose of detention is the eventual removal of unlawful noncitizens, the detention is not prohibited by the Constitution. Accordingly, as the High Court's press release says, `The court has dismissed Mr Al-Kateb's appeal and allowed the minister's appeal in Mr Al Khafaji's case.'</para><para>I also note that the current statutory regime is that which was passed by the parliament in 1992, as introduced by a previous Labor government. The purpose of that regime makes it possible to detain and remove persons with no lawful authority to remain in Australia. I note from the remarks of the opposition's spokesman on this issue and the remarks of Senators Ludwig and Kirk that there is no proposal from the Labor Party to amend the act in this specific regard. It is also noted that the act provides flexibility to allow alternative detention arrangements or release where there is no possibility of removal. </para><para>The issue of detention of persons with no lawful authority to remain in Australia is one with which I have involved myself over some years now. It is worth noting that most individuals who are in immigration detention are there for only a short time. But extended periods of detention have led to extraordinary and exacerbated angst amongst those concerned, and amongst many members of the Australian community. This particular matter is about exceptionally difficult cases where resolution does seem to have been impossible. The minister noted in her responses in question time a number of reasons for which lengthy immigration detention often results. She noted that it may be because of the pursuit of judicial review, a process that can take years—as the committee which I chair in this place certainly knows; we have discussed that often enough. It may be because of difficulties of accurate identity determination of the individuals concerned. I know that both the department and the minister are concerned to monitor those processes to ensure they are carried out expeditiously, but it is also important that detainees provide full cooperation for their removal.</para><para>It is particularly important to note the remarks that the minister made in question time today. She confirmed the High Court's view that the detention itself is not unlawful and that the act is clear and unambiguous. She went on to say that there is a capacity in this area for the exercise of ministerial discretion, which she described as a `safety valve'. There is ministerial discretion and there is the opportunity for people to be given relief and to stay in Australia.</para><para>In saying that, the minister indicated quite clearly to the Senate that she has asked for a review of all of the long-term detention cases individually to come to her and that she will examine those and see whether they warrant intervention. At the same time, the minister indicated that she will look at each of the cases of those people who are, in fact, outside the detention regime because of the Al Masri decision and have not been re-detained. What the minister has indicated is a very important part of the application of policy in this area.</para><para>There are many people who are unhappy with the act as it stands. The first speaker in this afternoon's debate, the leader of the Australian Democrats, made that entirely clear. Senator Meg Lees also made it clear. But the aspect of the process which is important to emphasise in relation to these people is the capacity for ministerial discretion to be exercised. I think the remarks of the minister this afternoon should be taken seriously on that note. I would be very disappointed if other senators in the chamber decided not to do that. In her actions in this regard the minister has made her position quite clear and senators can hardly ask for anything more in relation to the legislation as it stands. As I said earlier, I have not seen the opposition suggest that the legislation should be changed.</para><para>The minister has indicated the approach that she intends to take. It is important also that the minister is given the opportunity to do that. Having made her intention clear and made the undertaking to the chamber that she will see what response is warranted in all of these cases is an important step in this process. It will enable her to do that with the full consideration, I should imagine, and input of members of the Senate. I, for one, am not usually backward in coming forward on these matters, as the minister and vast numbers of my colleagues will attest to. I will take up an opportunity to raise certain issues with the minister in relation to the situation of the individuals impacted by the High Court decision. I want to say again that it is important that this has been a considered debate and I think senators have contributed constructively to the process. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>25914</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wanted to be on the speaker's list because of my long-standing involvement in this issue.

The Democrats do not support Labor's amendment because it takes away the core part of what the urgency motion seeks to do. The first part of the urgency motion is to note the court's ruling. We now have a serious situation where people can be locked up indefinitely for so-called immigration purposes when there is no prospect of them being deported in the foreseeable future. That includes stateless people where no country is likely to accept them.</para></talk.start><para>The urgency motion goes on to say that we believe that is unacceptable and that the law should be changed to remove that prospect. The Democrats would like to do far more than that to our immigration law but we think that single, simple thing—that it should not be possible for a minister of this government or any future government to keep someone in detention indefinitely without charge—should be acceptable. We should seek to remove such an offensive provision from any law in the land. The longer it is allowed to stand the more it sends a signal that that sort of extreme amount of executive power to deny somebody their freedom is acceptable.</para><para>I cannot support any amendment that would remove that simple part from the motion even though Labor's amendment makes a range of other points, some of which have some validity. The simple thing is that the Democrats' strong view is that it is not appropriate for such an enormous power as the denial of freedom to be in the hands of a government minister without any scope for judicial oversight or intervention. I note that the minister did not come to defend the situation at all in this debate. It is good that she might be going to look at the circumstances of the couple of people who are the subject of these court decisions, but there are others.</para><para>A person's freedom should not have to depend on the goodwill of any individual minister to have a look at the case. No other democratic country allows that sort of power. No other democratic country allows mandatory detention regardless of the circumstances, regardless of how long you are likely to be in detention and regardless of the prospects of deportation. Senator Mason said these people had no right to be in this country, but they are here, that they may have no right to be anywhere else and, apparently, we say they have no right to freedom. We lock them up indefinitely, according to Senator Brandis as a preliminary to being deported. It is a very long preliminary. We have someone who, next month, will have been imprisoned for six years. It is not a crime to be stateless; it is not a crime to fail in your claim for asylum. You should not lose your freedom for such extreme lengths of time. As a consequence, I believe the law is unjust and it should be changed. The Democrats will continue in our efforts to ensure that it is changed. </para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the amendment (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ludwig's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>16:55:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.</para></division.header><para>(The President—Senator the Hon.

The International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples is an opportunity for all Australians to reflect on the rich contribution Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people make to the life of our nation. Today is also an opportunity to recognise the entrenched disadvantage experienced by Indigenous Australians and commit to tackling that disadvantage.</para><para>The Howard government's term of office has coincided with the Indigenous Decade of the World's Indigenous People, which ends this year. While comparable nations like the United States, Canada and New Zealand have narrowed the opportunity gap between their Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples, Australia has failed to make much progress. One of the Howard government's most shameful legacies is the fall in the life expectancy of Indigenous women and a growing gap in the life expectancy of Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.</para><para>Labor believes Australia can and must do better than this. As the shadow minister for reconciliation and Indigenous affairs and also the shadow minister for tourism, I believe the tourism industry has an important role to play in improving the lives of Indigenous Australians. It is one of the reasons why Labor moved amendments to the <inline ref="R2024">Tourism Australia Bill 2004</inline>. We wanted to ensure that Indigenous Australians with valuable tourism and cultural experience had a place at the table when Australia's new national tourism body engaged in discussion about the future of this industry. I am very pleased to note the appointment of Karen Jacobs to the Tourism Australia board.</para><para>As noted in the minister's response, Ms Jacobs operates her own Indigenous tourism business in Western Australia. Operators like Ms Jacobs serve as great examples for other Indigenous Australians with an interest in joining the great Australian tourism industry. Of course, the whole country has much to gain from increased Indigenous involvement in the tourism industry. Through the tourism white paper, the Australian industry has noted that we currently meet only half the international demand for Indigenous tourism experiences. We all have something to gain from meeting more of this demand. Further development of Indigenous tourism will serve to build greater understanding between Indigenous Australians and international visitors and greater understanding within our own nation.</para><para>I again congratulate Anangu Tours, an Aboriginal owned tourist operation based at Uluru that won the 2004 National Geographic world legacy heritage tourism award. I believe it is a magnificent achievement for that business, a magnificent achievement for an Indigenous tourism business and a magnificent achievement for this country.

I want to add a few comments to those of Senator O'Brien. We have to recognise that the first Australians have a relationship with this continent which is steeped in a spiritual connection to the land and which is the essence of what many tourists want to get close to. It is an indefinable but very powerful thing because it is in the make-up of all of us. For Indigenous Australians it is a living component, whereas for far too many people who have generations of their own history in cities and away from the wilds, it has become an echo of the past—yet we seek to go back to it.</para></talk.start><para>What concerns the Greens about the development of tourism in Australia is that too often Indigenous people, who have that particular ability—and it includes a different view of time, which is essential if one is going to reflect on and enjoy Indigenous culture and the land—are swept aside by those who want to plan all tourism according to European precepts or concepts. On a visit earlier this year to Palm Island I was struck by its extraordinary beauty. Because it has been under Indigenous control, it has not been open to the white shoe brigade—thank goodness. The pressures are nevertheless mounting as local government is weakened for the Indigenous people, and they are asking what happens in the future as the pressure for not just leaseholding but freeholding of land grows. Anybody who comes from the world of profit-led tourism can see quick dollars coming from the exploitation of such a beautiful place—its magnificent beaches, its intact ecosystems, its great fishing and its sheer beauty.</para><para>The same applies to the rivers of the Kimberley. Five or six years ago I went with others to raft down the Fitzroy River at the behest of the Bunuba people from Fitzroy Crossing and the Kimberley region. What was an adventure trip at that time has developed into one of the great whitewater experiences of Australia, if not the world. From the pictures I have seen since, we had a very placid trip. Get caught after a monsoonal downpour and you are into huge toppers and very exhilarating, fast moving waters. While that might be an exciting thing from a Western viewpoint, what struck me greatly on that trip was the extraordinary relationship of the Bunuba people and the other Indigenous groups in the region with their land and the wish of the young folk to bring the older folk—in particular, the women—back to get a much closer induction into the various gorges, the great rock outcrops, the specific features of the river and the role they have played in the living relationship of those people with the land.</para><para>It is a precious opportunity to ensure that the cultural attachment for the land is not divested from the wonderful people of the Kimberley in the way it has been so cruelly trodden on for Indigenous people in the south of the continent. These are big questions and they must be at the forefront of planning. Senator O'Brien brought up the interesting statistic that the demand for Indigenous tours or presentation of the country is twice the capability at the moment. Let the demand keep and make sure that the capability is developed according to Indigenous wishes and not just be a demand thing because— </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name></talker><para>—It won't work if it just is.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>—Senator O'Brien is quite right.

I wish to inform the Senate that the government does not intend to table the report at this stage. There is a protocol that such documents are not released without the agreement of the Commonwealth and the states and territories. In accordance with that protocol, the Commonwealth has sought the views of the states and territories on the release of the report. The advice received is that several states do not agree to the release of the report, and as such it would be inappropriate to agree to its release.

If the outcomes from the investigation by COAG, which were available to the Prime Minister and the several states at the start of April, are to be of value to the nation then they must be made available.

She is commenting, very responsibly, that she can see no good reason why this report should not be released, and several good reasons why it should.

Why should this document be denied to the nation as a whole or to the people in all states, I think I presume fairly, who are preparing for fires and who want to see it, just because there is a state or territory government somewhere that says, `No, we don't want to release it yet'?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name></talker><para>—Or a federal government.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>—Or a federal government; thank you, Senator O'Brien.

It is very interesting that the government seeks to blame anyone but itself for the non-production of this document. This is a government that has made an art form of not complying with returns to order. It always seems to find a reason why it is someone else's fault that it does not comply. It is fairly typical of the Prime Minister to seek to shift blame to someone else. In this case it is suggested that it is probably a state or territory government—of course a Labor government—but, as I recall Senator Abetz's opening statement, he said that a state or territory government or the federal government could object to the production of a COAG document. He did not say that it was not the federal government that was actually objecting. He did not make it clear that the federal government was not the government or one of the governments responsible for providing the excuse for the non-production of this document in response to the Senate's return to order.</para></talk.start><para>The Howard government does have form in seeking to shift blame and not take actions which are its responsibility in relation to the fighting of fire. It is clear that in the past the Howard government has ignored expert advice that might have made the 2002-03 bushfire season that ravaged Victoria, New South Wales and the ACT less devastating. In the wake of the January 2002 Sydney fires the Howard government promised a national firefighting strategy and a national air firefighting strategy and commissioned the Australasian Fire Authorities Council to provide the advice. But, unforgivably, that expert opinion—the expert opinion of Australia's fire chiefs—was immediately dismissed by the then minister, now backbencher, Mr Wilson Tuckey. We have been waiting for this government to respond to a variety of things, including the House of Representatives select committee report for some time. </para><para>Without wanting to take this chamber's time up for too much longer, I have to say that we can be concerned about the government refusing to comply with returns to order. The Democrats originally supported a motion that I moved to hold up a piece of legislation until the government responded to my returns to order in relation to ethanol and Manildra but, after saying that it was time that the Senate stood up and was counted on the question of holding the government to account for failing to respond to returns to order, the Democrats rolled over on the basis that I had subsequently achieved some of the information by pursuing freedom of information applications—according to the Democrats, that was all right, we would accept what had effectively already been provided; not the rest of the information—and passed the bill. At that time I said that it would be very difficult for any party in the Senate to have confidence that the government could be held to account for not complying with returns to order. We have seen just that action today and, frankly, the government knows it can do it with impunity because of that action by the Democrats. I am not surprised and senators should not be surprised. I think it is a pattern which has emerged from this government. The Senate is now unable—because of the unwillingness of the Democrats to hold the line—to pursue this further. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>25921</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I know the chamber's time limit on such matters but I do have to express my concern about the failure of the Council of Australian Governments to provide information which is quite essential for our consideration. The upshot is that national policy issues are being debated in an atmosphere of secrecy. COAG is not directly accountable to the Australian people, yet it has a profound influence on the way that we are governed. It lacks transparency. There have been a number of occasions when there have been requests for COAG documents, and they have either not been forthcoming or, alternatively, they have come when all the debate is over.</para></talk.start><para>COAG is only a relatively recent invention, if I can use that word. It has been around for about 10 years. It is a council of Australian government ministers, but the agenda and papers are prepared by civil servants in the state and federal spheres. That is fine—I am not criticising civil servants, the majority of whom, presumably, are very dedicated people who provide high-quality advice to their ministers—but very few Australians have actually heard of COAG. It and its papers are not subject to freedom of information legislation. I am not objecting to the existence of COAG, because I think it is important that a council of Commonwealth and state ministers exists and there is a need for coordination of activities in various fields, not least of which are firefighting, land management and so on. I had some thoughts on this matter published in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> of Thursday, 28 August last year. If people are interested, they can get it all off the Net.</para><para>I appeal to all sides to examine where we are going with COAG, whether it is undermining proper accountability and whether its processes are undermining our important democracy. We should calmly have a look at that because it is very important, particularly to the Senate because we are a house of review. Very often you come forward with a particular matter and the federal minister says, `That's a decision of COAG.' Ultimately, we have to make the decision here, and I believe we are entitled to get all of the information and background not only because it is important for our consideration of the matter but also because it is important to put ourselves in the position of the COAG ministers. You cannot do that unless you are provided with the papers upon which they have made their consideration. That should seem obvious to everybody.</para><para>For the good of democracy in Australia and for the good of COAG—because, as I said, it is important to have such a coordinating body—I appeal to both sides to look at this calmly and to examine it further.

I remind Senator O'Brien that the return to order to which he referred was complied with. In fact, here I have the documents—some hundreds of documents—whose return to order was complied with. It was not a question of the Democrats giving in to anything. We said to the government, `We won't deal with that legislation until you supply those documents,' and it did. Most of them were indeed supplied under FOI to Senator O'Brien. I do not know what he did with them. Most of them, I imagine, would have been fairly useless in his ongoing attack on the ethanol industry, because most of them point out the advantages of ethanol and of biofuels, so no doubt he was disappointed by that finding. However, as I said, I take very strong exception to being accused of being party to the government's recalcitrance on returns to order. </para></talk.start><para>We will join Labor at any time at any stage on their suggestion that we hold the government to account. I wish we did far more of that in this place. There are plenty of ways that the Senate can be non-cooperative with the government if documents are not provided when it is reasonable that they should be, and I would argue that our returns to order are most reasonable. As Senator Harradine says, the information that is requested is requested for good reason, by and large. I am not so sure about the great wad of documents that Labor asked for in the Honan debate but, nevertheless, we agreed with those, and I think it was important that they were provided to whoever needed them in the debate.</para><para>I make a commitment here and now that the Democrats will join the ALP whenever they invite us—in fact, we have invited them on a number of occasions to do likewise—to not be cooperative when the government does not provide documents that the Senate has asked for. We do need to restore the importance of that. But for Senator O'Brien to come in here and accuse us of being party to some nasty cooperation with the government so it does not have to provide documents is very silly. As I said, I have the documents here and I am happy to hand them around to anyone else who wants them. I know that Senator O'Brien also has them. We had them before we dealt with that piece of legislation. Senator O'Brien is simply fabricating what happened in this place.

Indeed, it was not only the first round of Indonesia's current presidential elections, but also the first round ever of direct presidential and vice-presidential elections in Indonesia—a truly remarkable experience. Indonesia, therefore, is one of our youngest and most vibrant democracies. As part of our recent visit to Indonesia, we observed the campaign leading up to election day, we observed the election day and then we took part in some post-election analysis. It would be fair to say that the campaign went relatively smoothly and peacefully.  </para><para>There were some initial concerns about the campaign, mostly expressed by the European Union long-term observers who had concerns about the balance of media coverage of the presidential election. The European Union observers felt that both government and privately owned media were far too supportive of the current president and gave far too much coverage of her quest for re-election rather than provide an open and equal coverage of all five candidates. There were also some concerns about the use of incumbency by President Megawati's party, the PDIP, and the inappropriate use of public servants and their positions. Those two issues are something that Indonesia will have to come to terms with, but I am sure they will continue to struggle with them, as indeed we in Australia still struggle with them.</para><para>The election day was a very peaceful day. It had a very festive and relaxed atmosphere and was almost celebratory, although much quieter than the previous election day in April for their parliamentary elections. The overall view of our delegation was that the election could be viewed as free and fair. As most observers of Indonesian politics would have noticed, there was some concern initially about what was seen as double punching of ballot papers on election day, but in my view that matter was resolved very quickly. There was a ruling by the electoral commission before voting had finished, and all of those ballot papers were recounted by the end of that Monday night. So it was a very transparent and open process. The counting was very open, like during the parliamentary elections. Because all the results were displayed in public places, it was very transparent right through the various recording stages. </para><para>One of the Australian groups that went out into regional areas to observe encountered some problems in an area of Lampung. They had concerns about polling places opening late and closing early. They formed the view that perhaps there was some intimidation of some voters in those areas but that it would not have had an impact on the overall result of that election. Indeed, it would be fair to say that a lot of polling places in Indonesia opened late on election day because, like Australia, Indonesia is a sports-mad place and there was an important soccer match on the previous night. Apparently lots of local communities agreed that, rather than vote at 7 a.m. as per the electoral commission's ruling, they would start at 9 a.m. so they could have a sleep-in. There was a lower turnout on the presidential election day than there had been for the parliamentary election, which could be an example of all politics being local and people being a lot more interested and vitally concerned about who their local representatives would be in the various local parliaments rather than about the outcome of the presidential election.</para><para>As part of its contribution to observing the election, the Australian government not only sent a delegation but also, through the Australian Electoral Commission, funded considerable training of the Indonesian electoral commission and domestic observers to ensure that the electoral process was smooth, transparent, free and fair. Whilst I congratulate the government on this commitment to the vibrancy and freedom of democracy in Indonesia, I did have some concerns about the organisation that was chosen to fund the domestic monitors. This time some $2 million of funding was directed to the JPPR through the Asia Foundation. At the previous election, funding went to a number of domestic monitor organisations. It would be my observation that the JPPR did not fully commit to that independent domestic monitoring role. The organisations that were involved in April were a lot more committed to the process. They were formed around university campuses and academics, so there was theoretical understanding of and commitment to democracy. I am not sure how it happened but in my entire time there on this occasion I saw only two of the Asia Foundation's monitors. Hence I am not sure where the money went. </para><para>One of the recommendations in this report—as was the case in the report on the parliamentary elections—was to send another delegation to the second round of the presidential elections should the Indonesian government invite Australia to do so. There is no doubt that sending a parliamentary delegation was seen as a very high level commitment by Australia to the democratic process in Indonesia, which gave those parties and individuals involved in the democratic process, who perhaps had had some concerns about it, an independent avenue to express their concerns and to make their feelings known. There is no doubt that it was seen to be a very serious commitment by Australia to the flourishing democracy of one of our nearest and largest neighbours. That is an important recommendation of the report. With the second round of the presidential election to take place in September, it may prove difficult for any of our parliamentary colleagues to take part in that delegation, but I urge people to consider doing so should they have the opportunity.</para><para>I would like to place on the record my thanks to the others who participated in the delegation. Only two of us were parliamentarians, but the delegation was composed of a number of representatives from different government departments, all of whom spoke fluent bahasa Indonesian—unlike we parliamentarians—and all of whom had an incredible depth of knowledge, sensitivity and commitment to the Indonesian people and their electoral processes. It is therefore no wonder that Australia is viewed quite favourably by the Indonesian people when they see the calibre of those who participated.</para><para>I place on record my thanks to Bev Forbes, who was secretary to the delegation yet again. Bev was tireless in her commitment to ensuring that our needs were taken care of, and she made sure that we had a complete record of our observations and recommendations. I was accompanied by Dan Hill, an AusAID official at the Australian embassy. Dan's commitment to the Indonesian people is longstanding. His commitment to our aid ventures in Indonesia is another incredible gesture of goodwill and is viewed very favourably by the Indonesian people. Another person who accompanied me on this trip was Glenn Tankard, from the Australian Federal Police. Our Australian Federal Police officers do a fantastic job supporting those of us who travel to places such as Indonesia and supporting the Indonesian people in their quest to deal with the difficulties they are having in combating terrorism and other issues. I would like to place on record my sincere thanks to him for his dedication to the task and for his incredible flexibility. Finally, I would like to thank the government and the people of Indonesia. Their willingness to accept democracy and the openness with which they allowed other people to observe the process stands us all in good stead.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>25925</page.no><name role="metadata">Johnston, Sen David</name><name role="display">Senator JOHNSTON</name><name.id>00AON</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Like my friend and colleague Senator Webber I attended the general parliamentary elections in Indonesia in the early part of April. I must say a special thank you to Senator Webber and to Mrs Margaret May, from the House of Representatives, who led our delegation and to Senator Stott Despoja. Senator Webber has attended Indonesian elections twice now. She attended the presidential campaign and the general election. I am sure it has been a phenomenal and very fascinating and interesting experience for her, because it certainly has been for me. One of the high spots in my very short parliamentary career has been seeing a country such as Indonesia have such a tremendous commitment to running an election in the most difficult of circumstances. If time permits, I hope to get into a bit of the detail of some of the difficulties confronted by the government of Indonesia. On my visit, we had the delightful presence of some 17 representatives of the Australian Public Service. Dr Brad Armstrong, from the Australian Embassy in Jakarta, was virtually the team leader for our delegation of four members of parliament, me included, and 17 public servants. Amongst the public servants were members of the Australian Embassy in Jakarta, the Department of Defence, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, AusAID and the Office of National Assessments. </para></talk.start><para>These people were much younger than me, predominantly in their thirties. I pause to say that I could not wish to meet a more professional, experienced, talented group of young Australian diplomats. They were simply outstanding. I was delighted to be escorted to Bali by Ms Kate Callaghan, from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. She was ably assisted by Mr Brian Hearn from the Australian embassy. Both of them are very fluent Indonesian speakers. They know the culture, and they knew how to get in and drill down into what was happening on the ground during the course of the parliamentary elections. They made the visit to Bali, where I spent the deployment observing the elections, very worth while.</para><para>The delegation went to a number of places, which included Bandung in West Java; Bandar Lampung in Lampung; Makassar in South Sulawesi; Semarang in Central Java; Balikpapan in East Kalimantan; Denpasar in Bali, which is where I went and beyond there up into the highlands; Kupang in West Timor, which is where Senator Webber went; East Nusa Tenggara; and Malang in East Java. Those were the eight or so deployments of the various groups of Australian diplomats and parliamentarians. </para><para>Before going out into the field we had briefings in Jakarta from the JPPR, the people's voter education network, who fielded over 142,000 observers into each polling station in Indonesia during these parliamentary elections. We also had briefings from the United States delegation, the EU delegation, the KPU—the government department, if I can call them that, which had the responsibility for conducting the ballots—and a post-deployment briefing from the Japanese delegation. All of these matters and all of these briefings were most enlightening and disclosed an enormous commitment by countries and by non-government organisations throughout the world to seeing that the electoral process in Indonesia went smoothly and was in fact a legitimate expression of the will of the people of Indonesia.</para><para>While in Bali, I visited with the other two members of my group some 25 polling stations, commencing at about 6 a.m. on 5 April—if I recall the date. We travelled to Sanur, Denpasar and up into the highlands of Ubud. At each polling station I observed a number of traditionally dressed officials conducting the ballot of approximately 300 voters from the surrounding village or town district. The polling station was usually a school, a public building, a meeting hall or something of that nature. The commitment of the staff and the way they went about dealing with what was a very difficult logistical matter was very impressive. </para><para>Indonesians have varying degrees of literacy. Voting was carried out on four large ballot papers—each with more than a dozen candidates—by punching a hole in the ballot paper. When the official in charge of counting the ballot came around, they held the ballot paper aloft, and people standing around could see the light shining through the pinhole that had been made. The process was extraordinarily transparent, quite fair and fundamentally simple. It met the needs of the people. I was very impressed with the Indonesian people. They are on the road to being an emerging economic power. I must say that, because my preconceived notion was that they were not such an economically designated power. If Indonesians get good leadership and continue to have good government—and I think that is improving—I can see them becoming a very strong nation and a bit of an economic powerhouse in South-East Asia into the future.</para><para>As I said, I saw a group of very dedicated officials in their traditional dress running the ballot. I saw a lot of goodwill. I saw no violence. I saw a very orderly procession of citizens who were keen to participate in this process. Overall, I thought the whole thing was very successful.</para><para>I pause to mention some of the statistics. There were 147 million eligible voters participating in the ballot that I saw. That, in itself, should say to the Senate that this was a phenomenal logistical exercise. There were 24 political parties contesting the election. There were over 2,057 separate elections in the various provinces around Indonesia, with two houses in each province and two legislative houses back in the capital, Jakarta. There were over 585,219 voting stations to be correctly equipped for a maximum of 300 voters in each station. </para><para>These figures just boggle the mind when you consider what we do in Australia. There were 660 million ballot papers to print and distribute to some of the most isolated regions in the world. There were 581,000 KPU officials and staff to train to go out into these areas to conduct the ballot. On polling day, 3.9 million—that is, almost four million—polling station staff were involved in running the ballot. There were 1.1 million polling station security staff, 15,276 representatives to be elected and 448,705—that is, almost half a million—candidates seeking election. Each ballot paper had a photograph of the particular candidate. In line with what I was explaining about the pinholes, this allowed people who cannot read to recognise the face of the candidate they wanted to vote for. There was a massive amount of preparation in terms of getting the candidates photographed and onto the ballot papers. </para><para>Having said all of that, the cost that Australia contributed to the elections was a mere $15 million. I think it was a very important $15 million. The overall cost of the process for all the presidential elections and the three run-offs that will occur at the end of this year is approaching $US3 billion. This is a phenomenally huge commitment, which Indonesia should be extremely proud of. I think it is working well. It is going to achieve a strong result, and it has engaged the population in an exercise that has taken them to a whole new dimension in terms of good governance and adherence to, and respect for, the democratic process. </para><para>I am delighted to participate with Senator Webber in reporting to the Senate that things are looking very healthy in terms of democracy in Indonesia. My heart goes out to them and I congratulate them on the huge effort they have undertaken and on the success they have had in so doing. </para><para>Question agreed to. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE (LEARNING TOGETHER—ACHIEVEMENT THROUGH CHOICE AND OPPORTUNITY) BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>25927</page.no><id.no>R2108</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R2110</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>25927</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bills received from the House of Representatives.</para><para>Senator ABETZ (Tasmania—Special Minister of State) (6.00 p.m.)—I move:</para><motion><para>That these bills may proceed without formalities, may be taken together and be now read a first time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bills read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>25927</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>25927</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That these bills be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>I seek leave to have the second reading speeches incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speeches read as follows—</inline></para><para><inline ref="R2108">SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE (LEARNING TOGETHER-ACHIEVEMENT THROUGH CHOICE AND OPPORTUNITY) BILL 2004</inline></para><quote><para>This Bill renews the Government's commitment to school education for the next four years. This funding package delivers $31.3 billion for schools over 2005-2008, which is an increase of $8 billion over the current quadrennium and represents the largest ever funding commitment to Australian schools. </para><para>The Bill secures funding for Australian Government programmes of financial assistance to the States and Territories for government and non-government schools. It succeeds the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 2000 which authorised funding and arrangements for the 2001 to 2004 funding quadrennium. </para><para>The Bill represents a major investment in the future of our society. Through increased financial assistance to schools, particularly schools serving the neediest communities, the Government seeks improved outcomes from schools and a brighter future for Australian students. </para><para>This Bill reflects the Government's policy decisions related to the 2005-2008 school funding quadrennium. It is built on the principles that every student will be financially supported regardless of the school that the child attends and that no school will have its funding cut. These are important principles that are not shared by the Australian Labor Party.</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">State Government Schools</inline></para><quote><para>Following representations from the State and Territory Governments, the generous Average Government School Recurrent Cost (AGSRC) method of indexation will be retained as the basis for determining the increases of Australian Government funds to state schools. This will continue to deliver increased funding to State government schools of 6 per cent per annum.</para><para>In the next four years the Australian Government will deliver $9.8 billion in supplementary funding to state governments for their schools—an increase of $1.9 billion over the current quadrennium. $7.2 billion of this $9.8 billion will be in general recurrent grants. This represents a 28% increase over the current four year period in general recurrent grants (excluding increases due to enrolment and related effects).</para><para>The AGSRC will also be maintained as the basis of indexing recurrent funding for Catholic and Independent schools.</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Catholic Schools</inline></para><quote><para>The socioeconomic status (SES) funding model will be maintained and more deeply embedded as the basis for Australian Government funding of non-government schools in Australia. From 2005, the 1610 Catholic systemic schools will become fully integrated into the socio-economic status (SES) funding system, meaning that every non-government school, regardless of denomination, will attract funding according to the socio-economic status of the communities that the school serves. As a consequence of the Catholic schools joining the SES system, they will receive $362 million more in additional funding. This will bring their general recurrent funding over the four year period to $12.6 billion—a 32 per cent increase over the current four year period (excluding increases due to enrolment and related effects). </para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Independent Schools</inline></para><quote><para>Independent schools will continue to have their funding determined according to their SES scores, which have been updated.

This Bill continues the Australian Government's commitment to improving literacy and numeracy for all Australian students. The Bill includes an estimated $2 billion for a new overarching targeted programme, the Literacy, Numeracy and Special Learning Needs Programme, which will be targeted at the most disadvantaged students, including students with disabilities. This funding represents an increase of $393 million or 25% over the previous quadrennium. This includes additional funding of $25.6 million to provide fairer and more transparent funding allocations for students who require additional assistance in the government and non-government sectors.</para><para>The Bill also contains funding of $1.5 billion over 2005-2008 to assist with the provision of school facilities, an increase of 14% over the previous quadrennium. Importantly, it includes an additional amount of $17 million over the quadrennium to provide specific capital grants funding for non-government schools in isolated areas and communities in the Northern Territory. </para><para>This Bill also includes </para></quote><para>	$113 million to assist geographically isolated children. </para><para>	$231 million to assist newly arrived students of non-English speaking backgrounds. </para><para>	$110 million to improve learning outcomes of students learning languages other than English. </para><para>	Conditions of Funding</para><quote><para>A key feature of this Bill is the strengthening of the performance framework for Australian Government funding. The strengthened accountability and reporting requirements in the Bill will reinforce the link between the funding provided under Australian Government programmes and improved outcomes for all Australian students. These requirements will underpin the Australian Government's national priorities in schooling. </para></quote><para>	Greater national consistency in schooling. At present, everything from school starting ages to educational standards differs from one state to another, causing great difficulties particularly for the 80,000 students who move interstate each year. This Bill will stop these absurd anachronisms. As a condition of funding, States and Territories and school authorities will have to agree to implement by 2010 a common school starting age and to implement common testing standards, including common national tests in year 6 and 10 in English, maths, science and civics and citizenship. Children should be at the same educational standard and learn similar skills regardless of the state in which they reside. These national tests will provide authoritative measures of the standard of achievement of children against national measures.</para><para>	Better reporting to parents. Parents are frequently not kept fully informed as to how well their child is performing at school. This Bill contains provisions to ensure that school reports are written in plain language and that assessment of the child's achievement is reported against national standards (where available) and is reported relative to the child's peer group. Achievement in national numeracy and literacy tests must also be reported to parents against national benchmarks. </para><para>	Transparency of school performance. Information about a school's performance is frequently poor or difficult to access. This Bill will require all schools to publish school performance information to provide parents with objective data to assess schools and have specific information against which to hold schools accountable. The precise requirements will be specified in regulations but will include the public release of the following information for each school: percentage of students achieving national benchmarks in literacy and numeracy and their improvements on the previous years; average year 12 results and percentage of year 12 completions; school leaver destinations; teacher qualifications and proportion participating in ongoing professional development; staff and student retention and absentee rates; value added measures of student performance.</para><para>	Greater autonomy to school principals. The Bill includes as a condition of funding that school principals have a significant say over staffing issues in their own schools. Further it will require State and Territory governments and school authorities to commit to providing principals strengthened autonomy over, and responsibility for, education programmes, budgets and other aspects of school's operations.</para><para>	Creating safer schools. We should be doing everything we can to ensure that children are able to go to schools where they feel safe and protected. There are no circumstances where bullying is acceptable in schools. Not every school has well known protocols in place which teachers and parents can follow. The Bill requires the implementation of the National Safe Schools Framework in all schools as a condition of funding. This provides a set of guiding principles for schools to follow so that every school can have in place a comprehensive set of protocols for providing a safe learning environment. The Framework will need to prominently displayed in schools.</para><para>	Common commitment to physical activity. Obesity and lack of physical activity are major causes of preventable health problems. Schools play an important role in promoting physical activity and a healthy lifestyle. However, the time dedicated in the school week to physical education and sport is declining. More than 40 per cent of children play no organised sport. This Bill will require all students in the compulsory years of schooling to undertake at least two hours of physical education each week as part of the school curriculum. This is subject to commonsense exemptions. This measure will complement other measures that will be announced shortly to tackle childhood obesity. </para><para>	Making values a core part of schooling. Parents consider discipline and values as very important social factors in choosing a school for their child. I will be seeking the endorsement of State and Territory Education Ministers for the adoption of the National Framework for Values Education in Australian Schools. It will be a condition of funding to prominently display this is all schools. In addition, every school will be required to have a functioning flag-pole and fly the Australian flag.</para><quote><para>The Australian Government remains committed to school choice as a fundamental democratic right. The Bill recognises the right of parents to choose the type of education they want for their children. This Bill recognises that every child is entitled to a base level of public funding towards their education. </para><para>If we are to develop the skills and knowledge for Australia's future then we need a genuinely national education system, proper recognition of quality teaching, greater freedom for schools at the local level, schools that are safe and committed to teaching values, educational justice for Indigenous Australians, and a commitment to do something about schools that are not performing. We remain committed to quality schooling for all Australian students regardless of the school they attend and we will continue to provide record funding to all Australian schools. </para><para>This legislation will strengthen all schools and build national consistency. Through improved accountability and outcomes this Bill will ensure the health of our education sectors and the future growth of our nation. </para></quote><para>—————</para><para><inline ref="R2110">STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004</inline></para><quote><para>The purpose of the Bill is to amend the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 2000, to provide funding for the Tutorial Credit Initiative in 2004 and to correct a technical defect in the Act.</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Tutorial Credit Initiative funding</inline></para><quote><para>Literacy and numeracy are the most important foundation skills our children need during their education.

These have now become a critical part of the schooling system and a key indicator of academic performance. The Australian Government is also committed to ensuring that States and Territories provide information to parents about their child's performance against the national literacy and numeracy benchmarks. </para><para>This Government is also taking steps to assist those students who do not meet the national literacy benchmarks. I recently announced the Tutorial Credits Initiative, to provide up to $700 to parents for tutorial assistance for children who have not attained the minimum reading skills as measured by the Year 3 national reading benchmark in 2003. </para><para>The Tutorial Credits Initiative will provide $700 worth of tuition to students on a one to one basis out of school hours by appropriately qualified, screened and vetted tutors.

Other States agreed to report to parents their child's performance against national benchmark standards, and these states will also be included in the trial. </para><para>In order to expand the number of states included in this trial initiative, additional funding is required under the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategies and Projects programme for 2004. This additional funding will also enable other authorities, once they have committed to reporting the 2003 Year 3 reading benchmark results to parents, to participate in the Tutorial Credits Initiative. </para><para>The 24,000 children across Australia who have not attained the minimum reading skills deserve the opportunity to receive additional tutorial assistance offered by the Tutorial Credits Initiative, and their parents are entitled to comprehensive information about their child's progress. </para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Technical defect</inline><inline font-weight="bold">—</inline><inline font-weight="bold">SES funding phasing in arrangements</inline></para><quote><para>This Bill will also correct a technical defect in the Act. </para><para>The Act gave effect to the new socio-economic status (SES) based funding arrangements for non-government schools for 2001-2004.

The new producer rebate will apply to all domestic sales, not just cellar door sales. The maximum of $290,000 in rebate that will be available to each wine producer under the new scheme is significantly greater than the $42,000 cap of the current cellar door rebate scheme. This maximum rebate applies to each individual producer or a group of producers that are associated or connected with each other..</para><para>Around 90 per cent of wine producers will receive a rebate that will offset their WET liability, with around 85 per cent of the benefits being received by small wine producers in rural and regional Australia. </para><para>The rebate will continue to be claimed through the business activity statement. To reflect the implementation of the arrangements from 1 October 2004, transitional provisions in the bill provide that the rebate available in the 2004-2005 financial year will be pro-rated.</para><para>The two compliance measures relate to ensuring wine packaging is included in the tax base and the export and re-entry of wine.</para><para>In particular, the practice of a retailer purchasing bulk wine and then subsequently and separately undertaking steps integral to preparing the wine for retail sale, such as bottling and packaging the wine, will be addressed. This practice artificially excludes the costs of these value adding processes from the wine tax base.</para><para>The other revenue protection measure will ensure WET is not bypassed by the practice of exporting wine, claiming a WET credit for the export, then re-entering the same wine WET-free for sale in the Australian market. </para><para>This bill will also remove accelerated depreciation for grapevines, with effect from 1 October 2004. New grapevine plantings will fall for consideration under the general arrangements for horticultural plants. </para><para>Currently, a grapevine starts to decline in value in the year in which the taxpayer first uses it in a primary production business for the purpose of producing assessable income. Grapevines can be written off over a four year period at a rate of 25 per cent per annum. Under the horticultural plant provisions, grapevines will still be subject to write-off at an accelerated rate depending on their effective life. </para><para>Full details of the measures in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>I commend the bill.</para></quote><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buckland</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>25932</page.no><id.no>R2118</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION (CUSTOMS TARIFF) BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R2111</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>25932</page.no></subdebateinfo><quote><para>Debate resumed.</para></quote><para><inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the amendment (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nettle's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion><division><division.header><time.stamp>18:09:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.</para></division.header><para>(The Acting Deputy President—Senator J.O.W.

This is a monumentally important piece of legislation. It is a substitution for the Australian parliament looking at the US-Australia free trade agreement itself, something that both houses of the US Congress did. This is a very complex trade agreement that Australia is entering into. It has massive ramifications, not just across the spectrum for Australians now but forever into the future. In many respects it binds the hands of this parliament forever into the future as well. </para></talk.start><para>One problem that we have with the process here is that we have complex enabling legislation—two bills brought forward by the government—and it is impossible to adequately draft amendments which will safeguard the interests in a whole range of areas which the Greens are concerned about and which are not even touched upon by these pieces of legislation. It is a sham process. We should have the full agreement before us. That is what the parliament should be looking at. This is not some rump of democracy at the behest of the Prime Minister or George W. Bush; this is the sovereign parliament of this country. Where is the free trade agreement brought before the parliament by the government for its adjudication? The government has decided it is not going to do that. Instead, it has brought a couple of bits of legislation to make sure that the free trade agreement—and its hegemony over this parliament—is passed. We dispute it from the outset. </para><para>On top of that, we have controversial amendments coming from the opposition, which are complex and require legal explanation, and we have not had them before us until this committee began sitting five minutes ago. No doubt other amendments are in the offing. We have some amendments before us—we have a running sheet. The government does not even know whether the opposition amendments are on the running sheet. It is a totally unsatisfactory process. This chamber needs time to digest those amendments. It would be entirely appropriate for us to go away now and look at the amendments and the legal opinion on the impacts on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the so-called `evergreening' of pharmaceuticals in Australia. We should have had these amendments over the weekend. There is no headlong rush to get this agreement settled. Even taking the terms entered into, 1 January 2005 is the implementation date. We cannot be hijacked and forced into making decisions without due consideration. That is not the role of the Senate, nor is it our role to get things out of the way for the big parties to have an election. That is not our role either. Our role is to adequately look at every particle of the free trade agreement and try to make it the best agreement that the people of this country can have. </para><para>The Greens are far from satisfied that that is the case right across the spectrum. It is an enormously complex piece of legislation. It has huge ramifications. How do you interpret the legislation? As a joint committee set-up, outside the reach of this parliament, to arbitrate. Underneath all that, it could set up a range of other committees to interpret, arbitrate and decide outside the purview of this parliament—for example, between Australia and US corporations in future. So much for democracy a la the period of John Howard.</para><para>This is a totally wrong process. It demeans democracy, it demeans this parliament. This is not about the free trade agreement—it is not before us. It is about a couple of pieces of legislation that the Prime Minister, the Rt Hon. Mr John Howard, has agreed with George W. Bush and his administration need to be passed through this parliament so that this free trade agreement will have rule over this parliament forever and a day. This process here is not about this parliament ruling on this free trade agreement; it is about this free trade agreement having rule over this parliament, straitjacketing this parliament in so many ways forever and a day. Even when it comes to repudiating the agreement—if the government finds that it is untenable for Australia at some future date—that is left to the executive. It is not the role of this parliament to do that, as the agreement unfolds. It is a derogation of this parliament; it is a slight on this parliament and it is a wrong process. </para><para>How dare the government say,' We're going to make the most monumental agreement with the United States and anybody who stands in the way of that is not a friend of the United States.' We are, but friendship demands that you look after your own interests and that you respect each other's democracy. Even if another country does not respect our democracy, you would expect that our Prime Minister would. This process says that he has second-rated it to his own immediate political interest. There may be, by and large, a compliant press—with some notable exceptions—and a press gallery and a business community in Australia. But they are not the representation of the average Australian who has his or her democratic rights, their security about Australian culture, their assuredness that they will have cheap drugs when they are very ill—even if they are poor—under the great system that we have in Australia, which is second to none and came from the Chifley government. But not now. </para><para>We have a second rate agreement here and a so-called `free trade agreement'. This is a restricted trade agreement. What happened to agriculture? The free trade agreement was going to be the boon for Australian agriculture. The door shut on sugar to start off with. The taxpayers in this country paid $400 million upfront to fix that one. Far from being a free trade agreement, it is an expensive trade agreement. The Greens will not allow this position to stand without a long and detailed review here in the chamber of what is involved in the trade agreement, disadvantaged as we might be by the process, which is wrong. So expect some searching questions and we expect the right answers. If the Labor Party, in its wisdom, brings in amendments—which are amenable to the government in one way or another—and votes, as it just did for the second reading of the free trade agreement, nevertheless, without those amendments, expect that we will ask questions of the Labor Party as well, the alternative government. Senator Conroy indicates that he assents to that and I therefore expect we will get answers.  </para><para>It is very important to have a parliamentary debate for a healthy democracy and for those millions of Australians who are worried about this agreement. They might be beguiled by the complexity of it—everybody in this chamber probably is as well—but it is our job to unravel it and to ensure that at the end of the day this parliament is supreme in directing the future for this country's interests.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>—I move Greens amendment (1) on the running sheet:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>(1)	Page 4 (after line 11), after clause 3, add:</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">4 Definitions</inline></para><quote><para>In this Act, <inline font-weight="bold">the agreement</inline> means the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement signed on behalf of Australia and the United States of America in Washington on 18 May 2004.</para></quote><para>This is a simple definitional matter.

I know that that upsets Senator Brown, but we heard his presentation on that subject before dinner. </para></talk.start><para>Senator Brown believes that in this instance the executive should not have the authority to make treaties but that, rather, it should be the parliament that makes treaties. In other words, in this instance he seems to be arguing for a system of government that is closer to the United States system. That has never been the case in this country. The making of treaties is an executive responsibility. We have reformed the system in recent years so that the parliament is well informed about the decisions that the government intend to take and, through the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, has the opportunity to influence the decisions that the government intend to take. The work of that committee can also be useful in debate on implementation legislation such as that before the Senate tonight.</para><para>Senator Brown wants to take tonight's debate on this bill into a debate on matters relating to the agreement that has been negotiated between governments.

Mr Temporary Chairman, I can tell you and the minister that it is the business of this chamber to be debating the US-Australia free trade agreement. That is what we are here for. That is what this parliament is about.</para></talk.start><para>It might be the dictatorial view of the Howard government that we are here simply to restrict ourselves to a couple of bits of enabling legislation and to turn a blind eye to the US-Australia free trade agreement and all the ramifications it has for this country. The Howard government says that this is only the parliament. This is just the parliament; the real action is between our Prime Minister, John Howard, and the George W. Bush White House, the executive in the United States. The minister says that, if you follow through the Greens' logic here, you get to the position of this parliament discussing treaties in the way the American system does. Well, horrors! Quelles horreurs! Here we are signing a free trade agreement which is going to very manifestly encroach on Australia's way of doing things, including the ability of its elected representatives to make decisions for this country and the cultural richness of this country. It is an invitation for an American rollover of the powers of the parliament and our culture, amongst other things, and the minister opens the defence of it by saying that we must not go too close to the American parliamentary system.</para><para>Of course, there are good and bad things on both sides of the Pacific, and this Senate, above all, is modelled on the American system. If the Senate in the United States gets a vote on the free trade agreement—and it did—it is an extraordinary thing for the minister, particularly of a conservative government, to get up and go against his own background in this matter and say, `But the Senate should be sidelined. As to the US-Australia free trade agreement, we'll talk about a couple of bits of enabling legislation and get that through. We've got the opposition on side. They're on cue', and let the parliament go hang as far as its right to investigate and know the ramifications of this agreement.</para><para>I moved the Greens amendment and went on to ask about the environmental assessment that must be done under the terms of the agreement. We know that in March this year the US began its environmental assessment of the impact of the agreement, obviously on the United States as far as the environment is concerned. Under chapter 21 of the agreement, the very last section, we have a description of the powers of the joint committee which oversees the institutional arrangements, administration and disputes that may arise between Australia and the United States—and that means between corporations in the United States and the Australian government as much as anything. At the end of the description of the powers of this very powerful committee which sets up—and we will get back into this a little further down the line—at the outset, groups to look over the implementation of the treaty and therefore disputes in a wide range of things from quarantine through to manufactured goods, article 21.1(7) says:</para><quote><para>At its first meeting, the Joint Committee shall consider each Party's review of the environmental effects of this Agreement and shall provide the public an opportunity to—</para></quote><para>have input. At the very first meeting of this all-powerful extraparliamentary joint committee appointed by the ministers, not by the parliament—faceless people adjudicating on the interests of this country, appointed by the Howard government in this case or it will be a Latham government if Labor gets elected—there will be no report back to the parliament, no transparency, no minutes available and nothing for the parliament to oversee or vote on. But it does say—at least this parliament knows this much because it is in the agreement—that the first meeting of that committee `shall consider each Party's review of the environmental effects'. We know the Americans have been looking at theirs since March; we know this government has been doing nothing. </para><para>There has been no inquiry open to the public and one would expect that, if you are going to have an environmental impact on something as impactful as this agreement—from quarantine to water, genetically modified organisms and the power of corporations, which have increased from the United States—on the Australian environment, that, firstly, there would be such an environmental effects study under way; secondly, the public would have been informed; and, thirdly, the government would know about it. But here we have the minister, the former minister for the environment, representing the government in the chamber on this all-important preliminary requirement of the agreement saying, `I don't know about it. I don't know nothing.'</para><para>This committee has a right to know about it. The minister has now had time to get advice, and I ask him to inform this committee of the terms of reference of the environmental assessment. When will it be open to the public? What aspects of the free trade agreement—it should be all of them—are going to be assessed under chapter 21 article 7? It is here in the free trade agreement; let us hear about it from the government.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>25937</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am a little surprised that Senator Brown attacks the Westminster system of government.

Again, both sides could argue the strengths of their particular system. Our legal obligations are within the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, in which the Commonwealth has particular responsibilities for matters of national environmental consequence. The focus of that legislation has been on the consequences of an agreement rather than the agreement itself. So it is true that actions that might be taken under the free trade agreement that could potentially have a significant detrimental environmental consequence in relation to a matter of national concern could trigger that legislation. That is the existing law in Australia. Obviously, this government will apply that law, but the agreement in itself does not do so. </para><para>It was indicated that the Australian government would be preparing an environmental assessment. That was basically done through the CIE report, which considered the environmental impact of the agreement and did not identify any major environmental problems. I assume, therefore, that, when the joint committee comes to review, it will do so with the background of the Australian law and it will ensure compliance with the Australian law. That is the obligation between states under the agreement. But, as I said at the start of tonight's debate, that is not specifically what is being debated here tonight, which is the implementation legislation that is before the chamber.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>25938</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Firstly, I think the Westminster system is a great system.

You would expect a minister to be on top of the ramifications of something as important as a free trade agreement, but at the outset we find that that is not the case with Minister Hill. The minister said that the review has been done through the CIE report. I would like him to elaborate on that report. I would like him to also elaborate on what is meant by both parties when they wrote the words:</para></talk.start><quote><para>At its first meeting, the Joint Committee shall consider each Party's review of the environmental effects of this Agreement and shall provide the public an opportunity—</para></quote><para>to be part of that arrangment. Where is the public opportunity, which is in the agreement, in a departmental report that nobody here knows about, including the minister? Could the minister read to the committee the CIE's finding on this environmental impact?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>25938</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The CIE report was a report commissioned by the government that obviously covered a whole range of issues. Unfortunately, I think that Senator Brown is failing to understand the legislation of our own parliament. The EPBC Act deals with actions that have a detrimental environmental consequence, and the agreement in itself does not do so. Under the agreement that has been negotiated with the United States, the environmental issues that will be looked at by the joint committee will be a judgment on the application of the law of each state. Again, Senator Brown seems to be preferring to adopt the US environmental law over the Australian environmental law, which surprises me because I actually think ours is working very effectively, notwithstanding the fact that the Greens opposed it. It gave Australia national environmental legislation for the first time; legislation that actually made particular events rather than the process accountable. It was a huge step in the protection of the major environmental heritage of this country. I have every confidence that, in the application of this agreement over the decades ahead, that environmental legislation will continue to serve us well.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Brown clearly wants to move down another path. He says the parliament does not have a chance to debate these things. I remind him that we have also had two lengthy and detailed parliamentary inquiries, which had the capacity to debate every aspect, including the way in which Senator Brown believes that environmental values should be preserved under the legislation. So it is not a question of the parliament not having the chance to debate these issues. The issue is whether parliament votes on the treaty—and, as I said, under our system of government, the parliament does not do that. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>25939</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—At least the parliament, in this second-rate role the Howard government gives it, has a right to be given an understanding of the processes that the government knows about in implementing this full-blown treatment. I acknowledge that the minister has said from the outset that the Greens have a better understanding of our friends in the United States and how their legislation and their concern for the environment works than this government has. That is on the record. But I repeat: article 21.1.7 of the agreement says:</para></talk.start><quote><para>At its first meeting, the Joint Committee shall consider each Party's review of the environmental effects of this Agreement and shall provide the public an opportunity to provide views on those effects.</para></quote><para>I want to know how that public opportunity `to provide views on those effects' is going to work in Australia. In America they will have to give the public an opportunity. There are some major conservation groups in the United States, who have had experience with the North American Free Trade Agreement and a number of other agreements, who are quite alarmed about that and have been warning that Australia should reject this free trade agreement.</para><para>I have a press release of three days ago from the Australian Conservation Foundation saying that the environmental impact of the free trade agreement is unknown and untested. It says:</para><quote><para>ACF has refuted Government claims that the Free Trade Agreement poses no harm to the Australian environment.</para></quote><para>The claim the minister has just given to us comes from the Centre for International Economics, hardly a group with environmental expertise. In fact, it is an insult to this committee, to this parliament and to this country that a former minister for the environment in this government should say that their dismissal of environmental effects—from their point of inexpertise—should be seen as a national environmental impact statement, a national environmental effects statement, about the potential impact of this treaty. I get back to the press release, which states:</para><quote><para>ACF Campaigns Director John Connor said Environment Minister Ian Campbell was wrong to claim that an environmental impact assessment had been conducted—</para></quote><para>he ought to have informed Minister Hill before tonight about that, but the message did not go through—</para><quote><para>to determine whether the environment would be adversely affected by the US Australia FTA.</para><para>“The Centre for International Economics report, with a small environmental chapter, cannot be claimed to represent an environmental assessment of the agreement. The report itself acknowledges this ...</para></quote><para>The minister might want to hear this. Mr Connor said the CIE report review:</para><quote><para>... does not attempt to provide a full scale quantitative assessment of the consequences of the Agreement on the environment.</para></quote><para>So the minister's proposition is exploded at the outset. ACF campaigns director John Connor went on to say:</para><quote><para>“The CIE report was inadequate in terms of public input and final content. For example it failed to look at impacts of the agreement on water consumption, land disturbance and energy use. It cannot be passed off as meeting the FTA's requirement for a review of the environmental effects of the FTA at the first meeting of the Joint Committee—</para></quote><para>and Mr Connor there refers to the section that I have been referring to. He goes on to say:</para><quote><para>“There is little doubt that the US/Australia FTA will have dramatic implications for Australia's law-making processes, and force governments to think twice before introducing important environmental and public health regulations. </para><para>“Government initiatives around water, waste management, energy and the management of our national parks will ... be scrutinised and subjected to special tests designed to show the least burdensome approach for US investors.</para></quote><para>The minister nods at that. The press release continues:</para><quote><para>“The NSW, Victorian and ACT Governments have all expressed their concern that any new environment protection initiatives imposed after the FTA has come into effect could result in massive compensation payouts to US companies.”</para><para>Earlier this week six large ... environment groups—</para></quote><para>including the Sierra Club—</para><quote><para>said the agreement in its current form threatened to undermine environmental protection in both countries. </para><para>“There is an urgent need for new trade legislation that will grant Parliament a greater role and say in the process and ensure that the environmental and social impacts of future trade agreements are assessed prior to signing and implementation,” said Mr Connor.</para></quote><para>I will summarise this as far as we have got it. I asked the minister about the review of the environmental effects and the environmental assessment and he said he did not know. I then quoted from article 21.1(7), which says that there must be one before the first meeting of the joint committee so it can be presented to the first meeting. He said, `That has been done through the Centre for International Economics,' but the Centre for International Economics itself says that the review does not attempt to provide a full-scale quantitative assessment of the environmental effects. So it is not that at all.</para><para>So what we are left with here is a minister who does not know and presumably does not care. The government has not fulfilled the obligation under the terms of the treaty. There has been no opportunity for the public to provide its views on the environmental effects. We are moving to have this legislation rushed through the parliament now because there is an election coming and it will be good for the CVs of the big parties. A basic requirement about the national impact on the environment in this country is not understood by the government. It does not know what is in its own treaty; it does not know what is in the agreement it signed—far from meeting the requirements of it.</para><para>The questions are: how is the government going to fulfil the requirement of the agreement that there be an environmental effects statement before the first meeting of this all-powerful joint committee which oversees the whole implementation of the treaty? If you cannot get the first meeting passed, the whole system will break down. If the government cannot fulfil the first obligation, what about the rest? Is this a boys club meeting in which this joint committee in secret says: `Oh, well, we'll scrub that'? It is not going to worry the Australian government if there is an impact on the environment—`Look at our record,' they will say; `Why? We won't bother. The United States is doing a full environmental impact assessment, but that is for them over there.' As Senator Hill says, they have a different system.</para><para>We do not have to do an environmental impact assessment under our law, which is sidelined by this treaty, and the minister says, `I don't know. I think some organisation—the CIE—has done it.' But the CIE say themselves that they have not fulfilled that obligation. The question goes again to the minister: when will this requirement for an environmental effects review be done? When will the opportunity for the public to provide views on those effects be enabled? How is this joint committee going to move on if that prior requirement for its first meeting has not been fulfilled?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>25941</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Brown puts a lot of words into my mouth. He tends to prefer that to listening to answers. What I tried to explain to him is that, under our environmental law, it is the environmental actions themselves that are judged. When they are of national environmental significance, they may well trigger the Commonwealth environment protection and biodiversity conservation legislation. The system is different to the United States system. When Senator Brown says that the agreement may have an effect on energy, waste, land clearing or water, the answer is that it is not the agreement itself that has that effect; it is actions that are unrelated to the agreement. </para></talk.start><para>Senator Brown's argument is that any attempt to encourage exploitation of natural resources per se has environmental consequences that must be judged. We say that the actions that are taken—if actions are taken to expand, for example, Australia's agricultural production through land clearing—might in themselves trigger the Commonwealth legislation, but not a free trade agreement as such. The free trade agreement does not directly lead to the consequence that Senator Brown is concerned about at all. Advice was sought, and the advice was that the agreement does not in itself trigger the Commonwealth legislation, which does not surprise me. That is what I have been trying to tell Senator Brown. Whether there are other actions in the future that do trigger it will be something that we will have to see. And whether those actions are related to the agreement is also something that will have to be assessed.</para><para>In relation to this agreement, it is not 21.7 but 21.1(7), and it is true that the parties will report to the joint committee. But the report of Australia would be in terms of the Australian law, which I have just outlined, because the agreement provides the obligation on each state to comply with its own environmental law. So that is what the report will cover—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name></talker><para>—Where does it say that?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name></talker><para>—It is in the chapter on environment.

It would not surprise me if he says that, because already tonight he has said he has a preference for the US system of government when it comes to treaties. He says he has a preference for US environmental law. He seems to have a preference for US environmental assessments. But it is my view that our system works and, if I might be so bold, I actually think our system works better than that of the United States when it comes to environmental protection.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>25941</page.no><name role="metadata">Ridgeway, Sen Aden</name><name role="display">Senator RIDGEWAY</name><name.id>8G6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I also want to say a few things about this issue because, as a member of the select committee that looked at this issue—as well as having been a member of the committee that looked at Advancing the national interest—I think it is disingenuous on the part of the minister to take a very narrow approach to looking at the question of an environmental analysis. The minister might recall that, back in March by way of a question here in the chamber, I indicated that—given that the CIE analysis was only going to deal with the economic bottom line, and given that there was a legal requirement through the US trade commission for the US to undertake an environmental impact assessment, which I have no difficulties with—I thought it was incumbent on the government to instruct CIE to undertake that analysis, most of all because that is where I think the free trade agreement falls down, particularly in terms of environmental policy. </para></talk.start><para>The minister might say that it is a question of the government retaining the right to deal with environmental regulation in the future. That is in respect of a very narrow issue in relation to how the EPBC Act itself might work. Given that there has been very little, if any, analysis done on the environment, the JSCOT recommended that there should be legislation to deal with an environmental impact and to also look at the provision of this in the legislation. We do not seem to have a response from the government about that. If you take a broad approach to environmental impact assessment, I think it also goes to the question of looking at our ability to protect our island nation, particularly in terms of the imported diseases that may or may not come as a result of trade. The government is not giving any satisfactory response—or any answer—to that question, and that has not been analysed in any great detail as a result of all of the inquiries that have been conducted. In the context of environmental health policy, it perhaps also goes to the question of genetically modified products, particularly in terms of the labelling laws. The minister might want to answer the question about how the EPBC Act is going to deal with issues of that sort.</para><para>It is disingenuous to suggest that we are only talking about issues of land clearing here; the impact is much wider than that. It goes to a range of industry assistance programs, tax benefits and subsidies and how they might change or be interfered with. Where they are being provided to industry in this country, I agree that the EPBC Act might apply in those circumstances, but will structural arrangements as far as tax benefits, subsidies and the like have an impact—positive or negative—on the environment? </para><para>These are pertinent questions that the minister needs to answer. That is why back in March we asked for some sort of guarantee from the government that they would instruct CIE to undertake an analysis of environmental, social and cultural outcomes. If I recall correctly, the minister's response was that some of these things cannot be quantified. If they cannot be quantified, how is the United States managing to do that? It is really fobbing off the reality that the analysis of the free trade agreement looked only at the economic bottom line and outcomes—without regard for the environment and social and cultural policy. </para><para>Again I ask the minister to respond to the JSCOT recommendation about reviewing the environmental impact of the free trade agreement and legislating for this to happen for all future free trade agreements. It was wise on their part to suggest that. Is the government happy to accept that recommendation? When can we expect to see the results of a review being done and tabled in parliament? Is the minister proposing to table that assessment during the course of this debate? </para><para>JSCOT also went on to recommend that there be provision within this package of enabling legislation to ensure that an environmental impact assessment is undertaken with all future FTAs. I do not see any mention of that and wonder whether the minister might respond to that question as well. We need to look more broadly at the question of what an environmental analysis is. It is not just about land clearing; it is also about other issues that go to how our industries operate and to sustainability goals being met. Quite frankly, all the reports are deficient in that respect—most of all because the government has not given the instruction to its consultants, as was requested by the Senate on that occasion. The Senate passed a motion calling on the government to do that, and I believe that it has failed—it did not instruct CIE to go away and look at that question.  </para><para>In the context of the debate on this issue, it is legitimate to ask why these things are being overlooked. If we are to make a proper assessment of what is in this agreement for Australia, we must also look at environmental, social and cultural outcomes. Frankly, the government has been negligent in its responsibilities.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>25943</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There is an ongoing debate as to how useful environmental assessments of free trade agreements are. I know the Europeans see value in them, and in the last few years there has been a trend towards them in the United States, but from the assessments I have read they are of marginal value because it is not the agreement in itself that leads to the threatening actions. </para></talk.start><para>Australia is as committed to protecting its environmental values as it is to protecting its quarantine system and its PBS. There were a lot of fundamentals that we were not prepared to put at risk in the negotiation of this agreement. This agreement does not override Australia's environmental laws, and I am not just talking about Commonwealth law—you cannot just look at Commonwealth law; you have to look at the different tiers of environmental protection in Australia. The primary responsibility for natural resource management still lies with the states. </para><para>This agreement is not going to threaten any of those environmental values. Whether environmental values are adequately preserved depends on the adequacy of our domestic legislation and its enforcement. That is an issue for this parliament, and we have legislation at the national level to assist us. Environmental protection is also an issue for the state parliaments in relation to their areas of responsibility. As I said, as far as the Commonwealth is concerned, if there are actions in the future that threaten matters of national environmental significance, Commonwealth legislation may be triggered and action can be taken to protect those values. Despite what Senator Ridgeway said, I was not just talking about land clearing; I mentioned water, energy and other issues. </para><para>It is legitimate for him to talk about genetically modified products. We have a process in Australia to evaluate the consequences of those actions, and that is being implemented. The release of genetically modified organisms has to be pursuant to the Commonwealth regulatory structure. That is the protection that this parliament has put in place, and it will exist whether or not a free trade agreement is entered into with the United States. </para><para>How to best protect Australia's environmental values is always worth debating, but I would respectfully suggest that it is not so relevant to tonight's debate. If Senator Ridgeway wants to come back later and argue for changes to Commonwealth environmental legislation on matters of national environmental significance, he can do so. I know it is the position of the Australian Democrats that other areas should be triggered by that legislation and that the list should be expanded. That is a legitimate debate to have, but it is for Australia to determine domestically and, if Australia determines that it wishes to do so, it is not relevant to the United States under this agreement. We will protect and conserve our environment. We will not put it at risk by this agreement. I would hope that we will continue to produce sustainably, but that is in the hands of Australians. It is not something that the United States is going to cause us to revisit. Obviously it is easy to argue either way. Clearly there are some states that see value in environmental assessments of framework agreements of this type; however, I think a more effective form of assessment is one that focuses on a specific proposed action, because then you can get a clearer evaluation of whether that specific proposed action is a threat. That is the system that we have developed in this country, and I think it is working quite effectively. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>25944</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to commence One Nation's contribution to the committee stage of the <inline ref="R2118">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004</inline>. Earlier on we heard Senator Hill calling people back to the bill. That is exactly what I would like to do, and I would like to ask Senator Hill some questions about the bill. Before doing that, though, the chamber needs to look at the scope of the bill that is before it. It is the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004. What does it implement? What does it change? Here is the list. It changes the Customs Act 1901, the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Code Act 1994, the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980, the Life Insurance Act 1995, the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975, the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997, the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, the Patents Act 1990, the Copyright Act 1968 and the Telecommunications Act 1997. The title of the bill is rather innocuous but it has the effect of altering 10 of the major pieces of legislation under which corporations operate in this country, under which states carry out their activities and under which each and every one of us conducts our lives. The bill has a simple title but it has very complex outcomes.</para></talk.start><para>Let us look briefly at the first act that we will alter, the Customs Act 1901. In schedule 1 of the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill, under `Customs amendments', the first thing we find is that we are altering definitions in the Customs Act. Under the subheading of `definitions', section 153YA `Interpretations'—paragraph 1, line 10, page 6—says:</para><quote><para><inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">Australian originating goods </inline>means goods that are Australian originating goods under a law of the US that implements the Agreement.</para></quote><para>Stop and think about the wording of that definition. Have a look at the adjectives in it. What is the operating function of that change? I will read it again:</para><quote><para><inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">Australian originating goods </inline>means goods that are Australian originating goods under a law of the US that implements the Agreement.</para></quote><para>What the hell have the Yanks got to do with defining what `Australian originating goods' means? That is what the definition says. It does not say that it means goods that are originating goods under an Australian act; it says `under a law of the US'. On page 7, `indirect materials' are described as:</para><quote><para>(a) goods used in the production, testing or inspection of other goods, but that are not physically incorporated in the other goods; or</para><para>(b) goods used in the operation or maintenance of buildings or equipment associated with the production of other goods; including:</para></quote><para>	...	...	...</para><quote><para>(g) Catalysts and solvents.</para></quote><para>What effect will the change in that definition have on manufacturers in Australia? Again on page 7, at line 24 it states:</para><quote><para>originating materials means:</para><para>(a) goods that are used in the production of other goods and that are US originating goods; or </para><para>(b) goods that are used in the production of other goods and that are Australian originating goods; </para></quote><para>We have a balance in that definition. It goes on to say `or (c) indirect materials'. Unless my comprehension of the English language is somewhat lacking—and I do not believe it is—I find the following example even more confusing. It says: </para><quote><para>... This example illustrates goods produced from originating materials </para><para>and non-originating materials. </para></quote><para>Simple—there are two types of materials in the goods—</para><quote><para>Pork sausages are produced in the US from US cereals, Hungarian frozen pork meat and Brazilian spices. </para><para>The US cereals are originating materials since they are goods used in the production of other goods—</para></quote><para>in other words, the sausages—</para><quote><para>and they are US originating goods under Subdivision B.</para></quote><para>But this example does not help us, because it does not explain in any way what happens to the Hungarian frozen pork meat and the Brazilian spices. Because they are part of a product that has originating material in it from the US, do they all of a sudden become originating materials of the US for the purpose of this agreement? Unless I am totally missing the reason and the concept of that example, whoever wrote it has not defined it clearly and has left us in a worse state than we were in before we read it. When I consider that this legislation will be used to define disputes within Australia's territorial borders—and in all probability those disputes will end up in a court of law—I have some grave concerns about either the mischief or the difficulty that people will have in relation to that example.</para><para>Moving to page 8 of the definitions, line 4 refers to `produce'. It states:</para><quote><para><inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">produce </inline>means grow, raise, mine, harvest, fish, trap, hunt ...</para></quote><para>I wonder how many in our mining industry would have any concept of the definition that `mining' is now being carried in. Let us go back. What section are we looking at? It is customs amendments. Why have we got a mined product? How can you have something that is mined and, under a law of Australia, subject to a customs amendment? My understanding is that a customs issue relates to incoming product—unless our mining products are now to be exposed to some customs regulation in the exporting stage.</para><para>Line 13 on page 9 refers to regulations.

We might as well start with them now. In relation to the first issue that he raised—which was: why do you apply the US law in determining whether it is an originating product?—we are talking about products originating in Australia going into the United States. The issue is whether we get the benefit of the preferred tariff. To get the benefit, it obviously would have to be an originating product under their law and vice versa—if it was a product coming into Australia then it would have to be an originating product under our law. I do not see any particular concern in that. That is the way in which we get our advantage under this agreement.</para></talk.start><para>In relation to the definitions of originating materials, obviously you have to have definitions. If benefits flow to originating materials then you have to deal with that under the legislation, and we seek to do that. We also address the issue of products that are partly comprised of originating material and partly comprised of non-originating material. I think the bill before the chamber this evening is quite helpful in its examples. It gives an example of goods that are produced from originating materials and non-originating materials. The examples are those that were given by Senator Harris. I have to say that that seems reasonably clear to me.</para><para>Senator Harris asked why produce includes the product of mines. It is because we get benefits under the legislation in the export of our products, including minerals, into the United States. So the broader that definition, the better off we are. Again, I do not see any problem in that—it is a benefit to us. Senator Harris referred to the provision which states:</para><quote><para> ... For the purposes of this Division, the regulations may apply, adopt or incorporate any matter contained in any instrument or other writing as in force or existing from time to time.</para></quote><para>That provides that the regulations may, if such a decision is taken, do just that. On the face of it, that does not seem to me to be extraordinary either. It gives a capacity for flexibility in relation to the regulations to pick up other existing instruments, which may well be to our advantage again.</para><para>I accept that if you are going to go into the fine details of the customs legislation, one will find that it is a very complex environment. I do not think there is any way of avoiding that. Part of this implementing bill before the chamber is to reduce the obstacles to Australia under the customs regime of the United States—in other words, to be able to provide a better opportunity for Australia to be able to export these products competitively into the United States. That is what this is about. We on this side of the chamber obviously believe that more open access to the United States market is potentially of great benefit to Australian producers; and therefore the Australian economy and all Australians. If improved access is going to be given then it has to be subject to rules and definitions. I do not think there is any way to avoid that. The fact that the rules and definitions are complex is, I am afraid, also just part of contemporary legal life—such that, on occasions, we even have to seek advice from others on issues of interpretation. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>25947</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to continue briefly on that point. I have a question for Senator Hill that relates particularly to the regulations. As you read out, for the purposes of this division the regulations may apply, adopt or incorporate matters. If they were to incorporate writings, then those writings would actually become part of the regulation. Under the wording as I see it written here, it would be possible for a regulation to adopt a writing without physically incorporating it within the regulation. If that is the case, I see that as being of concern. If the regulation in adopting writings as enforced is required to physically incorporate them in the regulation, that would give everybody in this chamber the ability to peruse them and make a decision on whether they ought to become part of a disallowance motion. The question I am asking very clearly is whether, under the structure of the wording, it is possible for a regulation to actually adopt writings without incorporating them as part of the regulation.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>25947</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Speaking on a general basis, it would have to make specific reference to the relevant writing and adopt it in a way that is clear. It does not mean that you have to necessarily transcribe the other writing into the new regulation, but it has to be referred to explicitly; you have to have clarity in the law. I am seeking further expert advice, but I think all this provision is doing is making it clear that the regulations may apply or adopt or incorporate such other matters. There would have to be, in my view, specific action for that to occur.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>25947</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In order to help the committee, I have previously moved amendment (1) on sheet 4351 but I now seek leave to move amendment (1) on sheet 4366 and ask that they be dealt with together.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>—I move Australian Greens amendment (1) on sheet 4366:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>(1)	Page 4 (after line 11), after clause 3, add:</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">5 Parliamentary scrutiny</inline></para><quote><para>	(1)	The Joint Committee and each committee and working group established under the agreement must, on or before each 30 June and 31 December occurring after the agreement enters into force, provide to the minister a report on:</para></quote><para>	(a)	membership and attendance at meetings;</para><para>	(b)	numbers of meetings;</para><para>	(c)	issues considered and decisions and recommendations made at meetings;</para><para>	(d)	any other activities.</para><quote><para>	(2)	The minister must cause each report provided under subsection (2) to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 5 days after the report is provided to the minister.</para><para>	(3)	For the purposes of subsection (3), if a House does not meet within 5 days after a report is provided, the minister must present the report to the Presiding Officer of that House or to a person authorised to perform the duties of that Presiding Officer.</para><para>	(4)	An instrument that gives effect to, or interprets, any provision of the agreement is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the <inline font-style="italic">Acts </inline><inline font-style="italic">Interpretation Act 1901</inline>.</para></quote><para>I have moved amendment (1) on both those sheets, because the definition in amendment (1) on sheet 4351 simply says that the agreement means that the US-Australia free trade agreement applies to the substantive amendment on sheet 4366. This is about parliamentary scrutiny and the reporting of the agreement back to parliament. This is an enormously important amendment for the Greens and I thank the committee for agreeing to that. I want to come back to the environmental component—you know, Senator Harris, that we will keep coming back to the environmental issue until it is cleared, which may be the best way for me to put that. </para><para>The minister incorrectly said, `The laws of Australia will look after the environment and that, really, the study by the Centre for International Economics was to look at the impact on the laws and that the two things do not cross over'. That is wrong on both counts. The Centre for International Economics makes that clear. If you look at its seven-page contribution on the environment you will see that it did a best guess effort at a 0.01 per cent increase in greenhouse gases in Australia as a result of the agreement—that is, it did look at the environmental impact of the agreement per se and it did take into account methane emissions from cattle, for example, if Australia has increased beef production as a result of the agreement, and it offset that by saying that it may lead to a commensurate decrease in the number of cattle in the United States. The centre seemed to overlook the reality, which is that Australian beef exports to the US—and I know the minister will correct me if I am not right on this—even after the 20-year implementation period, if any of us are still alive to see it, are dependent on a buoyant market in the US. If times are bad over there—that is, if cattle numbers are down or if prices are down, which is the important thing in a market economy—Australia does not get the so-called free access that has been promised, even 20 years from now.</para><para>So the environment is left as a poor cousin. The point I want to make is that even the CIE recognised it and the environmental effects statement was about looking at the effect of the implementation of this agreement on the Australian environment as a whole. It was not simply about looking at whether there would be an impact on environmental laws. So the former minister for the environment got that wrong too. I mentioned earlier that a number of North American groups have warned about the environmental impact of this agreement. Those groups are the Center for International Environment Law, the Defenders of Wildlife, Earthjustice, Friends of the Earth, Sierra Club and Pacific Environment. These groups this month have put out a statement that said:</para><quote><para>The Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement (AUSFTA) threatens to undermine environmental protections both within Australia and the United States. Our organizations representing millions of Americans are therefore opposed to the passage of the AUSFTA in its current form. Our concerns regarding specific areas of the agreement are described below.</para></quote><para>We have to examine three major areas in the light of the minister's wrong statement that the impact of the agreement as a whole on the environment was not a matter of concern and that Australian laws deal with that. Let us have a look and see. The six North American groups say:</para><quote><para>The environment chapter of the AUSFTA includes provisions that are generally vague and unenforceable. Moreover, we are troubled by the inclusion of the provisions in Article 19.4 of the agreement, which appear to encourage the Parties to use voluntary measures, as opposed to regulatory instruments, to achieve and maintain high levels of environmental protection. While we believe that voluntary measures can serve a valuable purpose, in most cases they are not an adequate substitute for publicly adopted regulatory standards.</para></quote><para>The groups possibly do not know of the Howard government's failure to produce environmental laws with teeth in them and its reliance on voluntary measures and the consequent degradation of the environment in Australia on so many fronts, from greenhouse to forest protection to land clearing through to water quality, during its eight years in office. Nevertheless, they go on to say: </para><quote><para>We also are deeply concerned that the environment chapter does not include a citizen submission process that would allow citizens to address failures by either government to protect the environment. An effective and strong citizen submission process, with clearly enforceable outcomes, should be included in order to ensure that the environment is adequately protected and that the AUSFTA leads to sustainable development rather than to socially and environmentally harmful economic activities.</para></quote><para>I interpolate again. Here are environment groups calling for the citizens of the country—that is, Australia—to be involved. We have heard no response from the minister about even the requirement for that under the provisions of the free trade agreement and I do not think we are going to hear about it because this government does not want citizens to be involved. This is the executive government of Australia shutting out the Australian people. The six groups go on to talk about investor rights. The agreement, they say:</para><quote><para>... does not include an `investor suit' mechanism that permits foreign investors to directly challenge environmental laws and regulations before international tribunals. We welcome the exclusion of such a mechanism. However, the AUSFTA still explicitly leaves the door open to direct suits by multinational investors before ad-hoc international tribunals. Article 11.16.1 of the agreement permits the executives of the two governments to establish an ad-hoc investor suit process in particular cases, without any approval or oversight by either the U.S. Congress or the Australian parliament. By allowing foreign investors to bypass domestic legal processes, investment suits permitted under this procedure would undermine democratic governance concerning public interest policies.</para></quote><para>This is very serious stuff. I will bet the minister is not going to get up and countermand that except by another series of bland, meaningless, unsubstantiated and vague blandishments. The groups then go on, under investor rights, to say:</para><quote><para>Moreover, we continue to have significant concerns about the substantive rights provided to foreign investors in the AUSFTA. The agreement provides multinational businesses rights that are similar to those in NAFTA and other agreements. Under NAFTA, both Mexico and Canada have already lost cases involving environmental protections, and the United States faces challenges to public health and environmental standards. These cases have included challenges to policies concerning toxic gasoline additives, hazardous waste treatment, transboundary transport of hazardous waste, open-pit mining mitigation measures, and others.</para></quote><para>We have the minister here saying that water and land—these vague things that are out there—are looked after by environmental law. This is not so. Here is the experience of people who live under NAFTA who say the multinational corporations will move in under provisions such as in this US-Australia free trade agreement. The corporations can go through international tribunals and can subvert the laws of countries like Canada and Mexico and indeed the United States itself when it comes to the environment, let alone social justice and democratic governance. The groups go on to say:</para><quote><para>We believe that the rights in these agreements are too broad and grant privileges to multinational investors that go significantly beyond the rights provided under either Australian or U.S. domestic law. The result is that environmental laws and regulations that affect foreign investors will be inappropriately subject to challenge. For example, the AUSFTA includes language requiring that foreign investors be compensated if laws or regulations `indirectly expropriate' their investment interests. The agreement lacks adequate limitations on this provision, making it contrary to long-standing legal principles in Australian and U.S. law that have permitted environmental regulation concerning land use and other policies without a legal requirement to pay compensation. </para></quote><para>If the multinational corporation does not like environmental law protecting the Australian commons, it can go through the promissory system of the two governments involved, it can go to an international tribunal somewhere on the other side of the planet and Australia can be overruled just as Canada was overruled on gasoline additives that were harmful to public health in that country which they wanted to keep out. Not so; the NAFTA broke that down. Mexico was overruled and the US is now facing being overruled in its environmental laws. The companies get not only over the border but also under the law. The group goes on to talk about their concerns about trade in services:</para><quote><para>Finally, we are also deeply concerned by the provisions in the 'trade in services' chapter of the ... These rules could impinge on the ability of state, local and federal governments to adopt and enforce environmental standards in environmentally sensitive sectors that are classified as 'services' in trade law—including such sectors as oil and gas extraction, transport and storage operations; mining activities; tourism and hotel construction; water supply; forestry activities; and others.</para><para>For these sectors, the ... goes beyond World Trade Organization rules by requiring that governments must endeavor to ensure that domestic regulations are not more burdensome than necessary to ensure the quality of the service. In other words, the agreement requires policymakers to choose the regulatory alternative that is least restrictive of service operations, regardless of issues of cost, efficacy, or democratic preference. For example, restrictions on coastal development could be required to be carried out in the manner that is least restrictive of services operations carried out by foreign hotel operators. The... also prohibits the use of a number of kinds of quantitative restrictions on service operations, which could include forbidding environmental restrictions on the number of offshore oil wells, mining operations, hotels, and other service operations.</para><para>These services provisions, for example, are troubling in light of the recent, highly controversial efforts by the Australian company BHP Billiton to establish a liquid natural gas (LNG) terminal off the California coast. The services chapter could impede regulatory measures to address the environmental risks posed by the terminals.</para><para>For all of the reasons outlined above, we believe the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement will undermine efforts to protect the environment and should not be approved.</para></quote><para>What is Minister Hill's response to that? These are very serious charges. They are very cogently argued. The group says that the vague provisions in this legislation—or to put a more nefarious spin on it I say, `the very carefully crafted provisions which do not tightly protect the environment but rather open the door'—will allow huge corporations with huge economies, huge legal backup and huge access to lobby governments to engage in lawsuits which will override Australia's environmental and social amenity. That is the case, that is the reality, that is what has happened under the NAFTA and that is what will happen under this agreement. The minister says, `No, don't worry about the environment, our laws will look after it.' I ask the minister how he answers these charges.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>25950</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think Senator Brown put six specific arguments. Firstly, he said that the CIE could provide only a best guess of the greenhouse consequences of the free trade agreement. If that is the case, I think it proves my case. That is the problem of trying to attach environmental cost to a framework agreement. You have to estimate the extent to which there will be economic growth, pursuant to this agreement, and you have to distinguish that from the growth that there would otherwise be. You have to try to assess the nature of that growth, the sources of energy and so forth and, in Senator Brown's own words, you come to a best guess. I think that proves the difficulty of environmental assessments on framework agreements and demonstrates why the Australian approach is a better approach. It means that, when action is to be taken that can have significant effects on a matter of national environmental significance, the Commonwealth legislation will be triggered. So far from proving what I said was wrong, I think it rather proves that what I said was right.  </para></talk.start><para>Senator Brown's second point was to list the number of organisations which he said were opposed to this agreement because of what they saw as detrimental environmental consequences, but what they are really saying is that they are opposed to economic growth. You can argue that any economic growth has environmental consequences. The issue is whether they are consequences you are prepared to accept for some other benefit. Most of us want the benefit of improved living standards with a minimum environmental downside. That is why we on this side of the chamber support sustainable growth. You best achieve sustainable growth through your own domestic regulatory system; you do not achieve it through a free trade agreement of this type.</para><para>Senator Brown's third argument was that the agreement has a prejudice in favour of voluntary rather than regulatory enforcement. I have looked at the agreement and I cannot find that assertion. Article 19.3 says:</para><quote><para>Each Party shall provide remedies for violations of its environmental laws to ensure the effective enforcement of those laws. </para></quote><para>Article 19.4 says: </para><quote><para>Each Party shall promote public awareness of its environmental laws ...</para></quote><para>I would have thought that is something that Senator Brown would applaud rather than condemn. A well-educated public is more likely to contribute to better environmental outcomes rather than a less informed public.</para><para>Senator Brown's fourth argument was that there was insufficient opportunity for citizen-initiated action under this agreement. Again, I would argue that it is not through this agreement; rather, it is through domestic laws that that opportunity is given. Certainly the EPBC legislation broke some new ground in relation to citizens initiating action. As a result of some of those citizen-initiated actions prosecutions have been launched and successfully concluded.</para><para>The fifth argument he sought to put was that investors are not subject to rules. Investors into Australia are subject to Australia's domestic laws, whether they be environmental, quarantine or whatever. That is not prejudiced under this agreement. And Australian investors into the US will be subject to their laws as well. Provided those laws are genuinely structured for those purposes, they are not prejudiced by this agreement.</para><para>Senator Brown's sixth argument was that the trade in services could in some way be utilised to avoid environmental standards. Again, I have looked at the trade and services part of the agreement and I cannot see how in any way that argument can be sustained. I noticed that Senator Brown did not specifically draw our attention to the part of the language that was of concern to him but rather referred to the views of third parties.</para><para>So in relation to the six matters that Senator Brown has just raised, I think that each can be answered more than effectively.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>25952</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Is the minister saying that there is no provision and no way under the agreement in which a corporate entity aggrieved by environmental laws could take an action in a court outside Australia?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>25952</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There is no way under this agreement that the EPBC Act can be overruled. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>25952</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—That is a silly response from the minister.

The US government, under an approach by a corporation, can take Australia to the disputes mechanism. The minister has ventured to say that it can be because the corporation does not think that a law that is brought in here is a genuine environmental law—that that is not the real dinkum reason for the law. For example, in comes a carbon tax, let us say. A US corporation that owns a big slice of the Australian fuel refining and/or selling business—or in the coal industry, for that matter—can say, `That is not a genuine environmental law. They are simply going to raise revenue there.' If the US government happens to agree with that, off we go to the disputes mechanism. Australia's laws can be overridden in that way.</para></talk.start><para>The minister has explained step by step. You can take him to the water but you cannot make him drink, even though that is what is important here. It is going to be the Australian laws that are going down the stream. We have august US environmental organisations saying that, under NAFTA, both Mexico and Canada have already lost cases involving environmental protections. That is their law. The United States faces challenges to public health and environmental standards. These cases have included challenges to policies concerning toxic gasoline additive. That is famous—Canada defending against toxic additives being put in gasoline. A US corporation takes a suit against Canada; Canada loses; the law is overriden.</para><para>The minister is saying that it cannot happen with us. There are the same provisions. He says it will not happen with us. That is what the Clinton administration assured everybody in the United States—that it would not happen there. Likewise the Canadian and Mexican governments. Wrong. It not only could happen; it did happen. Senator Hill is wrong. It not only can happen in Australia; it will happen, because the same provisions pertain here. It is just that the boffins have not thought it out. They cannot foresee where it is going to come from in this complex world, so they think it will not happen. It will happen. </para><para>In the future, Australian environmental law will be challenged under this mechanism. And Australia will lose. Judged by whom? Some faceless joint committee appointed by governments or an international tribunal that it is referred to with power over the environmental protection laws of this country. The minister, who did not know much about it at the start of the evening and seems to know even less about it now, says, `No, that won't happen.' But he knows it will, and that is not speculation; that is practice. That is what has happened. It is quite wrong for a minister, particularly a former minister for the environment, to come in here and say that it will not happen in Australia's case. It will happen. It is going to happen, and the environment groups and their lawyers are right—that is practice; that is what has happened.</para><para>This is a clear case of derogation of Australia's laws in sovereignty to a free trade agreement signed by the executive outside this parliament with the parliament having no comeback. This parliament is weakened. This parliament is left without defence such as the case of the US corporation against Canadian law. I am not going to convince the minister because he does not want to hear or know about it and has not studied it, but that is the reality of the situation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>25953</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will respond very briefly because, in typical fashion, Senator Brown seeks to unnecessarily, unreasonably cause distress to people. He is seemingly arguing that the US could, through this agreement, enforce upon Australians a detrimental public health outcome. That is simply wrong. What is true is that an agreement of this type is designed to try to reduce barriers to trade and investment in an effort to contribute to economic growth, which can bring significant benefits to community and—an argument that Senator Brown has never been prepared to accept—contribute to better environmental outcomes.</para></talk.start><para>Economic growth contributes to the options of better environmental choices whereas Senator Brown, in some of the groups he represents, believes the only way to protect the environment is to restrain economic growth.

Senator Brown read out the CIE comment, in which they said it did not fulfil the requirement. I thought I would have a look at the latest Senate committee that has looked into this issue and what the government senators on that committee were saying.

Each party is to report on its environmental assessments. Part of the debate in this chamber earlier tonight was over the fact that Australia and the US have different ways of approaching environmental protection. The US puts greater weight on assessments of agreements; we put greater weight on assessments of prospective actions. I argued that our approach is more effective because it is much more specific. That led us into a debate about what was described by Senator Brown as a `best guess' of greenhouse consequences from a framework agreement. I said it demonstrated the difficulty of carrying out an environmental assessment of an agreement when it is impossible to predict with certainty the actions that will be taken thereunder. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>25955</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—So the Centre for International Economics' cursory look at the environment, which they themselves state is not a comprehensive analysis, is enough for the government. So far we have heard from the minister that the government has no intention of carrying out further environmental reviews. That is despite the comments from the government senators that they will be carrying those out, and it is despite the requirement within appendix B of the agreement that a review of the environmental effects of the agreement shall be carried out `and shall provide the public an opportunity to provide views on those effects'. It is not a very good start for the government, I would have thought, in meeting its own commitments and the commitments under the trade agreement to carry out that environmental analysis.</para></talk.start><para>The Centre for Independent Economics' cursory environmental study did not, so far as I am aware, provide any opportunity for the public to provide views on those effects. The government seems to think that is good enough. It is not good enough for the Greens, and we will continue to pursure this. It was a recommendation that came out of the first Senate inquiry that I was a part of. It was a recommendation that came out of the second inquiry, which was supported by the gov-ernment senators on that inquiry. Yet the minister seems to think that the Centre for International Economics' report, which looked at this as part of an overall study, admitting it was not the full environmental analysis, is good enough. It is good enough for the government in terms of looking at the environmental consequences of this agreement.</para><para>Over the weekend I was in parts of regional New South Wales talking with orchardists who are concerned about the impact of the quarantine laws in this legislation on their capacity to continue with their crops—their apples, their pears. They are concerned about the trade committees that are set up as part of this agreement to look at our quarantine laws, which have US trade representatives on them and which have explicit criteria to improve investment in trade between the two countries—not to scientifically look after our quarantine standards, as is appropriate, through the WTO.</para><para>Those orchardists in New South Wales are concerned about the environmental con-sequences of the US-Australia free trade agreement. The minister says to us here today that the Centre for International Economics has had a cursory look at it and admitted it is not good enough, but it is good enough for the government. It is not very comforting for those people whose livelihoods rely on quarantine laws and the environmental protections that are a part of this agreement. This agreement sets out a framework under which they can be undermined, and the government say, `Before the agreement comes into effect, we're not even going to look at the environmental consequences that impact on your livelihoods as orchardists in parts of New South Wales.' It is not good enough.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>25956</page.no><name role="metadata">Ridgeway, Sen Aden</name><name role="display">Senator RIDGEWAY</name><name.id>8G6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to say a few words about this particular issue. I found quite interesting the minister's response to the question of an environmental assessment that Australia may have taken the stronger or preferred approach compared to the United States. I want to ask the minister whether or not he agrees that, under US trade laws, there is a requirement to produce a report on the environment and that in the interim report—as far as I am aware, going back some four months—one of the things the United States wanted to look at as part of the negotiations was the commitment by Australia to the effective enforcement of its environmental laws. If that is an expectation that the Americans had of Australia, if nothing else, it implies to me that there is an obligation on our government to ensure that the tender documents—at least as they were dealt with at the time—are written in such a way as to analyse the economic, social and cultural impacts as well as the environment. </para></talk.start><para>Firstly, I want to ask whether or not the minister agrees with that sort of reciprocal obligation, if you like, given that the United States were the ones who insisted upon that as part of the interim report. Secondly, in relation to the work done by the CIE and the first report that provided the basis for the APEC Study Centre report that was commissioned by DFAT, was this environmental impact assessment also part of any documents or instructions that may have assisted the APEC Study Centre or at least the CIE? I know that way back in early March the minister responded to a question by saying that there was a restricted tender process. I am not sure whether we have seen the terms of reference for the restricted tender process—although, thankfully, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade did eventually provide information to the select committee, I seem to recall, on others that did tender at the time. </para><para>At the time the APEC Study Centre were commissioned by DFAT were there any specific instructions given to look at the environment and particularly social and cultural impacts? I think this does come down to looking at the bottom line overall about whether or not it is in the national interest. If that was not done, why wasn't it done in that case, particularly given that this was something that the United States had insisted upon, not just as a result of trade laws but also implying that they took it fairly seriously? Didn't it also mean that Australia should have taken it as seriously as they did and made sure that those who drove this behind the scenes—whether in Minister Vaile's office, in DFAT or elsewhere; all of the consultants engaged—were at least looking at the other bottom line issues and not just at the economic outcome? Whilst the government may talk about the benefits, I think a weak part of the analysis is that we do not have a proper assessment of the cost, and that cost also has to include the environmental, the social and the cultural impacts. </para><para>Does the government agree with what the US was seeking as part of an appropriate commitment by Australia regarding the effective enforcement of its environmental laws—not just looking at retaining the right to regulate in our national interest as far as the environment is concerned but also undertaking that analysis? Surely, that is clearly what was meant by the interim report that was provided by the US trade representative. It clearly indicated that, whilst they were doing it, there was an expectation that we would do likewise. I wonder whether the minister might be able to answer those questions, particularly in terms of whether or not instructions were given or there were discussions that assessments would be done so that we knew not only what the benefits were going to be but what the costs were going to be.</para><para>We still do not have answers in any of the reports about the costs on a range of different issues. We presume the free trade agreement may well end up being of net benefit, but the reality is that there are so many aspects of it that have been deficient or neglected completely that we do not have, as far as a ledger is concerned, an assessment of what the bottom line cost is going to be in order to make some fair assessment on whether it is a fair agreement and certainly in Australia's interests. As I said earlier to the minister, it is not just a question of dealing with the environmental issues in that narrow perspective; it is also a question of looking at the impact upon our quarantine laws, food labelling laws and so on. Quite frankly, there has been very little assessment of that in terms of what the cost is going to be. This does need an answer because this is probably one of the most important things that this parliament will deal with this year—and is certainly one of the most important things in my time in parliament. I think the parliament and certainly the Australian people deserve sufficient explanation from the government about what the costs are going to be, because we have not heard that at all. All we keep hearing about is the net benefit. We have not looked at the ledger, because there has been no ledger drawn up—because the government has failed to do the analysis of what the costs are going to be. </para><para>This question has been raised time and time again over the past four months. It was recommended by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties—the government's own creation—which was supposed to be a mechanism to guarantee that these issues were dealt with. It is not enough just to talk about recommending that all future free trade agreements be assessed on that bottom line. I ask the minister to respond to those issues because we still do not have details about the specific costs and whether or not this free trade agreement really is in the national interest—beyond just the trumpeting of the rhetoric about a net benefit. It simply is just not there.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>25957</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The fact that the United States were interested to ensure that the other party had sufficiently demanding environmental laws I think is a good thing. Obviously, in this instance the United States were satisfied that the Australian environmental standards were demanding and they were clearly prepared to enter into an agreement on that basis. So, yes, they will conduct their assessments under their laws—or practices—which as I understand it include doing an assessment on an agreement. We on our part will principally focus on the actions that might be taken within the framework agreement rather than try to assess the consequences of the agreement itself. I argued earlier tonight that I think the way in which we do it actually gives greater confidence in terms of protecting environmental values.</para></talk.start><para>If the United States had been negotiating with a country that had not developed a sophisticated environmental protection framework, I guess, through the negotiating process, it might have sought some assurances in that regard. But, obviously, that did not apply to Australia. Basically, the responsibility for us to protect our environment remains with us. I will repeat what I said earlier, but I think it is also relevant to what Senator Ridgeway is arguing. Article 19.2 of the agreement states:</para><quote><para>The Parties recognise that it is inappropriate to encourage trade or investment by weakening or reducing the protections afforded in their respective environmental laws.</para></quote><para>So, firstly, we ensure that each other's environmental laws are adequate and, secondly, we reinforce that those laws should not be weakened for the objective of trade benefit.</para><para>It is true that we seek triple bottom line outcomes. We want better environmental outcomes, we want better social outcomes and we want better economic outcomes. We believe that such objectives can be achieved. This agreement helps on the economic side by opening up new markets to us, and we will protect our environmental bottom line through our own legislation, regulation and practices. In terms of social outcomes, we will similarly do our best to ensure that domestically there is an equitable distribution of the wealth that we hope will be facilitated through this agreement. They are not either/or propositions. </para><para>Costs are part of the debate we have been having since half past seven tonight, and I have argued that an attempt to judge the environmental costs simply on the basis of the framework agreement is likely to make you little the wiser. It will not tell you, for example, whether agriculture is going to be produced on a sustainable basis or not. It will not tell you about the choice of energy sources. These are matters that we will determine domestically in order that, as I said, we can not only achieve economic benefits but also protect our environmental heritage and seek the social outcomes that certainly this side of the chamber is committed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>25958</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is a pretty specious argument, Chair, isn't it? The government comes up with its statements about how this is going to be a great economic winner for Australia. The same arguments apply. The government does not know whether there are going to be Democrat administrations, Republican administrations or Green administrations in the US for the next 20 or 100 years. It has no idea. It does not know whether there is going to be World War III, a SARS outbreak or who knows what—or a World Trade Organisation or global compact which could supersede this agreement. It certainly does not know about, for example—and has not written into those cost estimates—global warming, which is something the government can do something about but does not. Yet it comes up with these multibillion-dollar assessments about the agreement being a winner for Australia as well as the US. Give me the calculations, please, and the hard, ironclad assumptions on which they are based, Minister. And you cannot.</para></talk.start><para>But it is so important to get an economic assessment out there and to beguile people with, `We think it's going to be worth this many billion extra in trade, and we think it's going to be worth this many extra hundred million to Australia's GDP 20 years from now'—and they have no idea. But they make their best effort at it. When it comes to the environment, it is a different story. It is difficult. All sorts of assumptions have to be made, but they do not do it because the environment is not worth it. The environment does not rate under this government. The assessment of the environment is too hard. It would require too much of an effort; it would require too many presumptions to be put in. You can do it for the holy dollar, but you cannot do it for our holy environment. That is the difference. This government is besotted with money and not a little greed, but the other values do not count.</para><para>We in the Greens think differently. We think that there is an environmental assessment required. I did not say, as the minister wants to put it, that the CIE was wanting to best-guess the extra production of greenhouse gases under provisions of this legislation when you looked at the beef industry; that is what the CIE says. It is a best guess. So are all the economic assessments—they are best guesses. The minister is very clever at this, Chair—I do not know whether you have noticed. He wants to confuse the issue by taking it off on a different tangent, but he should not get away with it.</para><para>We are not arguing—and the CIE is not arguing—that an environmental impact assessment is required by the laws of the country, that the EPBC Act is the prime environmental law in this country and that, on the surface of it, it is not affected. No, we are arguing that you can do an environmental impact assessment; CIE says so and gives examples, but says it has not done a definitive assessment. If the government does not come up with a definitive effects statement with provision for public input, it is breaking the first instruction to the secret, unappointed joint committee that will arbitrate on these matters: the six faceless men—and I am sure they all will be if they are appointed by the honourable Prime Minister, Mr Howard. </para><para>The minister says that the effects statement is not about the effects on the environment; yet the experts—the Centre for International Economics—say it is. Because it is convenient for him tonight and he finds that it is troublesome ground, he is going to put his head in the sand, hope everybody else does as well and say, `Oh, no, that's not what it's about.' He has a smart alec strategy to divert people by saying: `Oh, well, that was it. There's no requirement for a national environmental effects statement on the impact of the free trade agreement on this great country of ours called Australia.' Well, it will not wash. There is a requirement, and there should be public response to that.</para><para>Annex 1 of the free trade agreement is about values other than quick dollars; it is about the environment. But the minister says: `We won't worry about that one. It doesn't mean what it says. There is a provision written into the free trade agreement, but it's not going to matter. Don't you worry about it. I've reinterpreted it tonight on my feet. It doesn't matter.' That is because it is a value issue; it is about the environment. Social justice issues will be treated in the same way, as we will find out in the next day or two as we debate this matter. Democracy will be treated the same way, as will Australia's ability to write laws for the benefit of the global commons that cannot be superseded by an agreement like this which is all about dollars—in particular, dollars for the already rich and powerful. That is what this agreement is about. </para><para>It is pretty shameful that a former minister for the environment, despite his record, cannot get up here tonight and say: `We are always genuinely concerned for the Australian environment. There is a provision in the agreement which says that each party shall provide a review of environmental effects for the first joint committee's consideration. That environmental effects review will be done seriously for the national interest and, indeed, with public input—during, not after its effects have been discovered.'</para><para>But this government—even despite the Prime Minister's concern that the environment will be on the agenda at the election—is, with the opposition, pushing through a free trade agreement that does not respect the environment. Therefore, I ask the spokesperson for the opposition, Senator Conroy: what is the opposition's interpretation of the requirement for a review of the environmental effects of this agreement that `shall provide the public an opportunity to provide views on those effects'?

The Labor Party has said consistently that the process involved in this free trade agreement has been unsatisfactory. There has not been enough consultation and public discussion on this. I can understand Senator Brown's frustration, because Senator Brown and Senator Nettle tried to get onto the Senate Select Committee on the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America so they could participate in the discussions. But, in what can only be described as a very despicable act, the Democrats voted with the government to knock the Greens off the committee. I can understand Senator Brown's frustrations at the Democrats' behaviour, which excluded the Greens from the process. It was very disappointing.</para></talk.start><para>As you would know, Senator Brown, the Labor Party voted for you. It is probably one of the few times in my life that I would ever vote for you or Senator Nettle, but we voted for the Greens to be represented on the committee. So I understand your frustration at you and Senator Nettle not getting an opportunity to be part of this debate. I can only suggest that you have a look behind you at who tried to ensure that you did not get a voice and an opportunity to participate. I would have welcomed your participation in the limited process that was available to the Senate. Labor welcomed your support of the Senate select committee, which the government was initially very reluctant to support.</para><para>The Labor Party has consistently stated its concerns about this process, and it has consistently written reports. Senator Cook recently wrote a Senate committee report on the failings of the current system, and he made a whole string of recommendations. Many of those were picked up in the ALP national platform. Labor has said that, in the future, it would support environmental impact statements beforehand and much more public consultation. I am happy to table the ALP national platform document and some of the recommendations around those EIS issues that the Labor senators put in their report from the Senate select committee.</para><para>When the Labor Party are in government, we will go down that path, because we do agree with Senator Brown that these are important issues. As to whether we are prepared to stop this process coming into force, I suspect not. Unfortunately this government has controlled the process. It has abused the process and it has ensured that many Australians have not had their chance to have a voice. We have committed publicly, if Labor are elected to government, to a proper process involving environmental impact statements, regional impact statements and all those sorts of issues that are dear to your heart, Senator Brown. I hope that clarifies our position for you. Hopefully, with the election of a Labor government in the next couple of months, we will see an opportunity to put those processes in place so the sort of abuse that this government has been involved cannot happen again. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>25961</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There is no excuse in that. The Labor Party is putting itself forward as the alternative government within just a month or two, and this agreement will be implemented under its vote in that period. Therefore, if Labor were elected, it would come in with all the opportunities that the government has had. The requirement for a review of the environmental effects is not coming from the floor of the chamber—which has been sidelined by this process—but from the free trade agreement itself. I ask Senator Conroy to consider this again overnight. It is there in the free trade agreement that there be a review of the environmental effects of this agreement for the first meeting of the joint committee. I would ask Labor to look at that and see whether it cannot do better than saying, `If the government is not going to do it, we won't either.' That is not good enough.</para></talk.start><para>We think that, on a wide range of issues, Labor has made a huge mistake in backing the free trade agreement and we will be talking about those as this debate unfolds. But here we are with the environment, first cab off the rank. If neither of the big parties can stick to the agreement—if they fall at the first hurdle of the environment—what faith will the Australian public have in the blandishments of the government and the opposition that `notwithstanding this agreement, we will look after the environment'? They cannot even bring themselves to say: `Yes, there's an environmental effects statement. The US is doing its environmental effects statement on the impact of this agreement in the US, but we're not going to do one here and the public is going to be sidelined. It doesn't matter to us.' That is bad enough from the government but, when you hear it from the opposition, it is very saddening indeed. It is left to the crossbench to argue on this environmental value and its rightful place in being defended, because Australians think so highly of the environment. They do not want it ceded to some other faceless authority somewhere else on the planet; they want it kept under the power of this parliament.

This group of students from Melbourne and Monash universities have joined together to form Ampersand—a non-profit organisation aimed at encouraging university students to do more volunteering and community work. Katia Sanderson, Sarah Cleghorn, Jennifer Brook, Denis Cairney, Sam Hardwick, Remy Kinna and Suzi Young are the students and recent graduates behind Ampersand, and they are to be commended for their energy and commitment.</para></talk.start><para>Ampersand is motivated by two ideas. The first is that students are one of the more underrepresented demographics involved in regular volunteer work. The second is that, by getting involved in community work, students will become more focused on others and more active in their communities. Ampersand's strategy is to improve the awareness of students about community work and the ability of students to find suitable community work. The Ampersand web site will provide a hub for volunteering information for young people. This database of opportunities will be promoted by Ampersand at universities in Melbourne. </para><para>Ampersand will also aim to make volunteering more attractive to students. Part of this will involve promoting the idea that volunteer work complements paid work experience and ultimately produces more well-rounded employees. The name `Ampersand' was chosen to signify that there is a community life beyond study and beyond work—that you can work and make a community contribution. To help achieve its goals, Ampersand has linked up with Volunteering Australia, the national peak body working to advance volunteering in the community, which is supported financially by the Australian government.</para><para>Recently, two of the founding members of Ampersand, Katia Sanderson and Sarah Cleghorn, met with me to seek support in launching the organisation. It was encouraging to meet young people committing a significant amount of time and energy to their community. No-one could fail to be impressed by the zest and purpose of Katia and Sarah. Since completing year 12 in 1999 as school co-captain at Ruyton Girls School, Katia Sanderson has discovered how volunteer work can profoundly alter someone's life path. Katia tutored underprivileged students with the Ardoch Youth Foundation during her first two years of study at Melbourne University. Katia was so inspired by this experience that she deferred study to volunteer on a full-time basis. She spent six months at the Children First Rotary Farm in Kilmore in Victoria, helping Moira Kelly care for Third World children recovering from life-saving medical treatment. Katia then travelled to Albania, where she worked with the Sisters of Mother Teresa in orphanages and in food distribution programs. Now volunteering with Lighthouse and Anglicare's Friends Program, Katia has returned to a combined degree in arts and social work. </para><para>Katia's colleague Sarah Cleghorn, also a graduate of Melbourne University, embraced the challenges of motivating and supporting young debaters in her position as school debating captain in 1999. This experience led Sarah to adjudicate for the Debating Association of Victoria's schools competition. Both Sarah and Katia have a profound commitment to making accessible the experiences volunteer opportunities can offer.</para><para>In my first speech to the Senate, I proposed a measure to provide incentive and reward for young people to become more involved in their community—that is, to offer university students the opportunity to reduce their HECS debt in return for undertaking regular volunteer or community work. Katia heard my proposal on ABC radio's PNN while sitting in a broken down car, waiting for the RACV to come along. Katia and her colleagues were interested because they recognised that such a proposal would complement the work of Ampersand.</para><para>A compassionate society is one in which we can place ourselves in the shoes of others. It is a society where we understand that the different lives and circumstances of others are not always of their own making. The HECS mechanism can be utilised to foster greater community involvement by students; in doing so, we could support the work of groups like Ampersand. If today's students become more involved in volunteer and community work, there is a good chance they will stay involved in later life. The aspirations of students behind Ampersand are admirable. I hope Ampersand has a successful launch and helps engender a new spirit of community involvement among current and future university students.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: Autism</title><page.no>25963</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>25963</page.no><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator HUTCHINS</name><name.id>84P</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to speak briefly this evening about the development of strategies to treat autism.

However, through the use of a technique known as `applied behaviour analysis' they have seen a gradual but perceptible improvement in the effect of the disorder on their family. Because of the greater ability of children to modify their behaviour, this technique is most effective when applied as soon as possible to young children following their diagnosis, which normally occurs at two or three years of age. In some cases applied behavioural analysis has been so successful that some children who were again tested for autism came back with a negative diagnosis. </para><para>Applied behavioural analysis has been used for a number of decades, but it was only accepted in the mainstream body of knowledge in this area quite recently. Most organisations in Australia which represent those with autism and their families have expressed support for this method of treatment, and it is time that the Australian, state and territory governments took notice of the treatment with the aim of increasing its implementation.</para><para>The unfortunate matter is that this type of treatment is exceptionally expensive. Only in Western Australia is funding provided for applied behavioural analysis. Western Australian families can access funding through the early intervention program provided by the Disability Services Commission. The rates vary according to the age of the child because of the dependence of the method on the age of the child, and funding is provided with the objective of readying the child for entry into year 1 at school. I have been told by the Disability Services Commission—but I have not been able to confirm it—that the amount available can be up to $5,000 for each year that the child receives the funding.</para><para>Let me say that I am not making a political statement here, nor am I attempting to score any political points. This is an important issue, and I would like to see applied behavioural analysis tested by more governments in an attempt to alleviate the problems faced by families which deal with the difficulties of autism on a daily basis. I understand that the cost associated with applied behavioural analysis may be an impediment to the provision of funding, but it is a method of treatment which has been proven to be effective and which can have a significant effect on the quality of life of the individual and their family. I look forward to doing further work on this matter and speaking to the relevant stakeholders in an attempt to improve the services available to autistic children. I further look forward to personally approaching the minister, Senator Patterson, on this issue to see what assistance the federal government can provide to help these families.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: Program Funding</title><page.no>25964</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>25964</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>APA</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to respond to some material that was tabled on 10 February 2004 by Senator Carr. On that day he tabled a report from an external independent inquiry which investigated allegations of scientific misconduct made against Professor Bruce Hall of the University of New South Wales. Since that report was tabled in the Senate, Professor Hall has been looking for a right of reply. He is aggrieved by the tabling and the fact that the Senate has heard only one side of this dispute. I believe that he does have a right of reply. The document that has been tabled accuses Professor Hall of misconduct. I would like to table Professor Hall's report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Response to the external independent inquiry</inline>. As Senator Carr pointed out when he tabled the original material, this is a messy affair and there are many sides to the story. It has, I believe, been dealt with badly by the university—and there are a number of casualties. I personally would like to see this issue resolved. I want to see this important immunological research continue.
