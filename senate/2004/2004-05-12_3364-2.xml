I request that you investigate the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard </inline>tape from yesterday's question time. You will recall, Mr President, that I raised a point of order during question time asserting that Senator Chris Evans may have said something unparliamentary, in response to which Senator Evans rose to his feet and asserted that he had said certain words to you. The difficulty for Senator Evans is that the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard </inline>tape—and I have a copy of it in my office—clearly discloses that what he said to you is not what he said by way of interjection.

These amendments seek to implement a variety of consumer and regulatory reforms to Australia Post and the postal services industry. Labor support some but not all of the measures contained in the bill. Broadly speaking, Labor support the aspects of the bill which enhance the ACCC's ability to ensure that Australia Post is not cross-subsidising its competitive services from its reserve core service in an uncompetitive manner. We will be opposing the provisions in the bill that deregulate document exchange and aggregation services. We will seek to protect these services within the ambit of Australia Post reserve services. These provisions represent a first small step towards the deregulation of Australia Post. Labor oppose these provisions absolutely. We will also oppose the provisions in the bill transferring the monitoring of Australia Post from the Auditor-General to the Australian Communications Authority. We do, however, support in principle the improvements to regional standards monitoring associated with this section. I will now consider the bill in more detail.</para></talk.start><para>The bill contains measures to enable the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, to determine whether Australia Post is cross-subsidising its competitive services from its core reserved service. These will allow the ACCC to ensure that Australia Post is not cross-subsidising its non-reserved services to the detriment of competitors such as newsagents. The measures will allow the ACCC to keep detailed accounting and auditing information about Australia Post's reserved services. The bill will also allow the ACCC to inquire into disputes regarding the rate reduction Australia Post allows its bulk mail customers.</para><para>Australia Post should not be able to use the benefits derived from its reserved services to unfairly undermine competition in other, non-reserved areas. This is why Labor supports the greater scrutiny of Australia Post by the ACCC. However, Labor supports absolutely the continuation of Australia Post's reserved service. Around 85 per cent of Australia Post's activities are now fully contestable. It is important that in these areas the playing field between Australia Post and its private sector competitors be even and fair. </para><para>Labor welcome most of these initiatives and are happy to support them. However, we have some concerns that the new ACCC role is to be funded by a levy on Australia Post. The estimated cost to Australia Post is up to $3.5 million per year. Furthermore, the people who will benefit from the new ACCC role are likely to be Australia Post's competitors. This money will ultimately come out of Australia Post's profits and its annual dividend to the government. Telstra, with its $3-plus billion profits, did not have similar levies placed on it in the same circumstances. Despite our concerns, and in the absence of an alternative funding model, Labor will support for now the government's new funding model for the ACCC's Australia Post role. However, we will be monitoring this funding arrangement very carefully.</para><para>Some of our key concerns about the bill lie with schedule 1 amendment items 11 through to 14. These amendments legitimise certain practices of document exchange and aggregation services. They represent the first step towards the deregulation of Australia Post's core reserved articles. Labor oppose these amendments and will be moving to strike out this section of the bill. It is clear that the Howard government's long-term policy ambition is to deregulate and eventually privatise Australia Post. Under this bill the carriage of letters from an aggregation services customer to an aggregator will be excised from Australia Post's reserved services. Labor reject these provisions. The bill also provides that the carriage of letters between a document exchange customer and a document exchange centre will be exempted from Australia Post's reserved services coverage. Again, Labor reject this weakening of Australia Post's reserved service. The provisions amount to a further deregulation of Australia Post's services.</para><para>Australia Post cannot be expected to adequately undertake its strict community service obligations if its reserved mail services are gradually opened up to further competition. Australia Post's community service obligation depends on the retention of its reserved service area. This provides an accessible standard letter service to all Australians at a uniform cost. History has vindicated the former Labor government's model for Australia Post's reserved services. Australia Post has achieved outstanding financial and service performance in recent years under both Labor and coalition governments. Australia Post's current regulatory settings are good for the economy and useful for general mail users. Australia Post's outstanding performance levels have been achieved because its core responsibility, the standard letter, is still reserved.</para><para>Australia has a relatively small population distributed very unevenly across an enormous landmass. This means that it is essential that we have some mechanism for cross-subsidisation of our basic postal services to ensure that all Australians throughout our society can communicate adequately by post. In 2000 the government tried to enact the Postal Services Legislation Amendment Bill, which also pursued its deregulatory agenda. Fortunately the bill was withdrawn due to lack of support in parliament, including on the government's own side. But the government's deregulatory agenda remains apparent, as demonstrated in the bill before us today.</para><para>The other aspect of the bill which Labor opposes is the proposed new Australia Post monitoring role for the Australian Communications Authority. This is the proposed new part 4A, division 1 of the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989. At present the Auditor-General monitors Australia Post's service standards. The government is proposing in this bill to transfer this function to the Australian Communications Authority. Labor prefers that the current role of the Auditor-General remain in place. The Auditor-General, as we all know, is completely independent of the communications minister, but the ACA is not sufficiently independent of the government to monitor Australia Post's standards and costs. </para><para>In the telecommunications area, the ACA was exposed last year for reporting statistics which portrayed Telstra's annual network fault levels in an extremely favourable and misleading light. Just in the last few months a leaked internal Telstra document further exposed the weaknesses in the ACA's telecommunications monitoring role. This leaked Telstra document showed that Telstra's soaring fault levels were due to network neglect. In Labor's view, the Auditor-General represents a much more independent and robust institution for monitoring Australia Post's performance.</para><para>The government is now in the process of reviewing future arrangements for its two communications regulators, the ABA and the ACA. The minister referred to this possible merger in a speech earlier this year. It is therefore premature to grant either of these agencies significant new powers before that review is concluded. At the committee stage we will oppose the entirety of the proposed new part 4A, division 1 of the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989. We will also be opposing the repeal of division 1A of part 3 of the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989, contained in item 10 of this bill, which effectively repeals the Auditor-General's postal monitoring role. However, Labor do support the proposed new section—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>—I rise on a point of order.

While Labor support these provisions in principle, we will propose a different way of achieving the same outcome. We will do this by moving an amendment for a new section 28C(3) of the Australian Postal Corporation Act, enhancing the Auditor-General's delivery arrangements role. This will enhance the Auditor-General's existing role and achieve the same outcome through a different agency. It will also ensure that communities can gain decent access to Australia Post services where appropriate. The government also proposes a new section 50E to allow the minister to direct the ACA to monitor and report to the minister on specified matters relating to Australia Post's supply of postal services. Again, Labor have no problems with this new provision. We will move that the same function outlined in section 50E be entrusted to the Auditor-General, not to the ACA.</para></talk.start></continue><para>One reform that would have benefited consumers which is not in the bill and should be is the establishment of a postal industry ombudsman. The government promised such an ombudsman prior to the last election to improve consumer outcomes in the postal sector. Such an ombudsman would apply to all postal service operators, not just Australia Post. More than two years into the government's term and approaching the end of that term, the government has not yet legislated for this significant reform. Until the government implements its postal ombudsman proposal, that proposal can only be regarded as a broken promise. Finally, there are some minor provisions in this bill—items 23 and 24—which are technical amendments to update the Australian Postal Corporation Act. Labor supports these latter amendments. I will speak further to the amendments in committee.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>22979</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1802">Postal Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline> makes amendments to the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 to do a number of things. It shifts responsibility from the Auditor-General and provides the Australian Communications Authority with responsibility for the oversight of, and reporting on, Australia Post's supply of postal services. It requires the ACCC to make record-keeping rules for Australia Post and to inquire into disputes in relation to the terms and conditions of Australia Post's bulk interconnection services. It makes changes to Australia Post's reserved services in relation to document exchange and aggregation. The bill is a very distant relative of the Postal Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2000, which proposed more extensive deregulation of the postal service industry and which the Democrats emphatically opposed. While this bill is much less wide reaching and less ideologically driven than the previous bill, we will not be supporting all of the provisions in this bill either. </para></talk.start><para>In one of its first key areas, the bill aims to shift to the Australian Communications Authority responsibility for the monitoring of, and reporting on, the supply of postal services. The authority would be required to measure Australia Post's performance against prescribed performance standards, a job currently undertaken by the Auditor-General. It would be required to calculate the cost to Australia Post of carrying out community service obligations which are currently performed by Post, based on a model developed by the government. It would be required to monitor and report to the minister on specific matters relating to Australia Post's supply of postal services—an activity not currently performed by anybody at all.</para><para>The government has argued that, as Australia Post retains a monopoly over the delivery of reserved letters and there is no impetus of competition to drive improvements in the delivery of services, the involvement of the authority is therefore needed to drive improvements in the delivery of the services provided by Australia Post. But the government has never demonstrated that any tangible benefits would flow to the community from such deregulation. It has at best asserted that increased competition will improve the postal services industry, but it has not actually proven that that will occur. The Democrats are very cynical about the claims of competition policy. We have had too much experience with deregulation and competition policy having adverse effects to believe assertions anymore.</para><para>The Democrats do not share the government's concerns regarding the need for competition in postal services. Australia Post is already one of the most efficient postal services in the world. It provides an excellent level of service at a uniform rate to all Australians, regardless of where they live, across this country. Its level of customer satisfaction is among the highest of any Australian company. It is in an enviable position in comparison with the private sector. In areas with dubious telephone reception, banks that have closed and state government services that are being withdrawn, Australia Post services still operate.</para><para>The government has also argued that the involvement of the authority is necessary to establish a consumer complaints mechanism. But, again, the government has failed to provide any data to demonstrate that need. There already exist two separate consumer complaints mechanisms: one through the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the other through Australia Post itself. The Ombudsman's dispute mechanism assists consumers to settle their differences with suppliers of goods and services informally and quickly and operates as such for a further 14 government departments, including the tax office. In its most recent annual report, the office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman talked about Australia Post. It stated:</para><quote><para>The total number of complaints received this year was 1,082, compared to 1,060 in 2000-01 and the 2001-02 total of 896 ... </para><para>To put some perspective to these figures, every day of the year, Australia Post moves in excess of 18 million articles (this figure reaches 50 million in the days prior to Christmas). The proportion of complaints received by the Ombudsman is therefore a small percentage of the total number of transactions undertaken by Australia Post.</para><para>Much of the reason for this can be attributed to the generally high level of service that Australia Post provides to its customers and its own effective handling of complaints by its Customer Contact Centres in each State.</para></quote><para>In addition to the Ombudsman, complaints can be made to Australia Post itself through its customer service centres within each state, either via a 131 telephone number or via the Internet. Of the estimated four million customer contacts a year, Australia Post estimates that less than five per cent are customer complaints, the majority of which are resolved in a timely manner. All complaints are lodged on a database and can be easily accessed for crosschecking and follow-up. Indeed, Australia Post's complaints mechanism has been praised by the Ombudsman. On page 139 of the Commonwealth Ombudsman's 2001-02 annual report, the Ombudsman refers to the outcomes of a review by the office of the operations of Australia Post customer care centres. The report says:</para><quote><para>... my office ... confirmed a higher degree of commitment and support to effective complaint handling by management of Australia Post.</para></quote><para>Not only does the Ombudsman's office believe that the number of complaints is small but it also believes that Australia Post has an effective complaints handling procedure. The Democrats, as a result, can see no particular reason to argue for a multimillion dollar extra impost for the Communications Authority to handle that complaints mechanism for Australia Post. It is simply not needed.</para><para>The government also argues that the ACA is a more appropriate body than the Auditor-General to monitor postal services, as the ACA is the regulator of telecommunications and radio communications. However, the Democrats share the concern expressed at various times by the opposition that the efficiency and the effectiveness of the ACA's role in monitoring telecommunications are actually open for doubt. We would like to see improvements to how the ACA performs that role before we would support any consideration of the ACA's role being expanded, whether it be into postal or broadcasting roles. We certainly believe that the Auditor-General performs a very good monitoring role at present at a much lower cost than what it would cost the ACA to do it, as proposed by this bill.</para><para>The Democrats are very concerned by the whole issue of the cost of this ACA monitoring role. The inquiry into this bill heard that the initial cost could be around $2 million and ongoing costs would be around $2.5 million a year, levied from Australia Post on an ongoing basis. We are concerned that this cost would affect Australia Post's profit and, ultimately, the level of return to shareholders in the form of income tax or dividends.</para><para>There are two questions that need to be asked as a result of all this: is the problem as articulated by the government significant enough that the costs are justified and will the potential benefits outweigh those costs? In our view, the answer to both these questions is a clear and emphatic no. The Democrats will not be supporting the government provisions relating to the Australian Communications Authority's role and will support Labor's amendments to expand the proposed monitoring and reporting activities as part of the Auditor-General's role.</para><para>The second area of amendments to this bill relates to the expanding role for the ACCC. Currently, the postal act provides for the ACCC to inquire into disputes about the rate of reduction offered by Australia Post to its bulk mail customers. The bill aims to broaden the scope of the ACCC's power to inquire. The <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> notes that, since the introduction of these measures in 1994, the ACCC has been notified of no such disputes—none whatsoever in 10 years. We certainly question the necessity to expand these powers further, given that they have not been used. However, I do concede that this provision is broadly consistent with other legislation under which the ACCC operates and therefore we will not be opposing the amendment, although we are not convinced that it is absolutely necessary either. </para><para>The bill also provides for the ACCC to make record-keeping rules for Australia Post. The reason for this amendment is, as I understand it, because concerns have been raised in the past that Australia Post competes unfairly by cross-subsidising its competitive services with revenue from its reserved services. The National Competition Council examined this issue in 1998 and found no evidence to support these claims. But the council did recommend that there be a requirement for detailed independent auditing and accounting information to provide transparency of this financial relationship to avoid any further concern being raised. It is estimated that this particular role will cost the ACCC about $600,000 a year. Again, we have concerns about the cost benefit trade-off, especially given that to date no evidence has been found that cross-subsidising is occurring between Australia Post reserved and competitive services. Australia Post has assured us that the cost and accounting requirements of this measure will not affect postal licensees and that they are reasonably comfortable with what is being proposed, so from that point of view we will not be opposing these amendments either.</para><para>The final area of this bill relates to changes to Australia Post reserved services in relation to document exchange and aggregation services. The Democrats believe that the amendments will not lead to a further erosion of reserved services but merely permit an activity within a broad service provided by mail aggregation and document exchange service providers which Australia Post currently does not participate in, namely, the picking up and delivering of reserved mail from the service provider to the customer. The core service provided by mail aggregation and document exchange providers does not change. It seems to me rather silly that a mail aggregation service provider can legally accept from a customer, aggregate and transfer reserved mail to Australia Post but cannot pick it up from the customer. I do not see how allowing mail aggregation service providers to pick up the bulk mail will change in any way their core business or take business away from Australia Post. Surely, Australia Post should not be expected to pick up the bulk mail from a customer and drop it off to a mail aggregation service provider.</para><para>Similarly, with document exchange provision, document exchange service providers can legally transfer reserved mail and documents between document exchange service providers, can accept certain reserved mail and documents from customers and can pick up documents but cannot pick up the reserved mail from customers. Again, this seems an anomaly rather than a major expansion of services. I am a little surprised that Labor is opposing these amendments, given that it was Labor in 1984 that initially excluded these document exchange services from Australia Post's reserved services. I understand that Labor's changes from 1994 have not negatively impacted on Australia Post's performance. Indeed, Australia Post made a record profit in the three years after the changes. </para><para>In the Senate inquiry into this bill, the Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union raised concerns that the changes in the profitable sections of the postal market may lead to major growth in the activities of alternative providers competing against Australia Post and would undermine the financial foundation of the reserved service operation. Australia Post has expressed, both publicly and privately, that it is not concerned with this particular provision and that the proposed changes will not have a negative effect on its bottom line. In correspondence with my office, Australia Post has stated:</para><quote><para>Aggregation is of benefit to Australia Post, because it provides Post with more mail that can be processed more efficiently and for significantly less cost. The revenue reduction is more than outweighed by the associated cost savings. Australia Post has confirmed that the aggregation amendment in the Postal Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 will not have any negative impact on its bottom line profit.</para></quote><para>Australia Post believes that the inclusion of safeguards in this bill with respect to document exchange services will prevent the expansion of these services into the Australia Post core market. I note that a number of safeguards have been included in the bill as it stands. But we are proposing to pick up the further recommendation from the Senate inquiry to include a mechanism to tighten up the penalties for breaches of reserved services. Currently, section 31 of the Australian Postal Corporation Act provides:</para><quote><para>Where a person has engaged, or is proposing to engage, in conduct that involves ... an infringement of Australia Post's ... reserved services, Australia Post may apply to the Federal Court for relief.</para></quote><para>It further provides:</para><quote><para>The relief that may be granted includes an injunction and, at the option of Australia Post, either damages or an account of profits.</para></quote><para>However, we believe that a penalty provision will act as a further deterrent and we will be moving such an amendment, based on a similar provision that exists in the Telecommunications Act. I reserve my further comments for the committee stage.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>22983</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Arts and Sport</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank senators for their contributions. It is true that Australia Post holds a unique position in the Australian landscape. All Australians to some extent, and many to a great extent, use the services of Australia Post. Because of its importance to the Australian community, it is desirable to do whatever is possible to make sure that businesses and residential consumers can be confident about the ongoing quality of Australia Post's services.</para></talk.start><para>The <inline ref="R1802">Postal Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline> is a package of postal reforms designed to significantly improve regulatory and consumer aspects of the current postal legislative regime. The legislation, if supported by the Senate, will deliver certainty to small business and benefits to Australian consumers. For consumers it will, for the first time, provide a truly independent consumer focused oversight of Australia Post's performance. For small business participating in the postal market it will clarify the arrangements and provide operating certainty.</para><para>For example, the legislation gives the Australian Communications Authority, the ACA, the power to monitor and report on Australia Post's supply of postal services. These amendments will safeguard the interests of the users of the postal system and ensure that the highest quality of service is being provided to the public. The ACA will also be responsible for calculating the cost to Australia Post of fulfilling its community service obligations. The fact that the government has announced the merger of the ABA and the ACA does not change the government's approach. The legislation will also extend the powers of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to enable it to inquire into disputes about any of the terms and conditions of a bulk mail service. This will be of significant benefit to businesses that are major mail users. </para><para>For some time now there have been concerns among some small business operators such as newsagents and gift shops that Australia Post is taking advantage of its reserved service mail business to compete with these businesses. To address these concerns, the bill will allow the ACCC to require Australia Post to keep records about the financial relationship between different parts of its business and to publish reports. This, I believe, will ensure greater transparency of Australia Post's operations and therefore allow the investigation of any possible cross-subsidisation between retail operations and the reserved services business. Other provisions in the bill will provide certainty to small businesses who use document exchanges or who aggregate their mail in order to gain access to Australia Post bulk mail discounts. Contrary to the claims of the opposition, these are not at all related to deregulation. They simply clarify the existing operations of the postal services market. Finally, I draw to the attention of the Senate that the legislation extends the government's postal regulation powers to prescribe the procedures that Australia Post must follow in polling communities to determine whether or not they require the property services. This will be of particular benefit to people living in remote areas of Australia.</para><para>I note that both the opposition and the Democrats are proposing to move amendments to the bill. The government also propose to move amendments to the bill. These government amendments will clarify and simplify the cost recovery mechanism to fund the new postal roles of the ACA and the ACCC. The amendments are technical in nature and put in place appropriate payment processes. They do not change the government's objectives or intentions or the operation of the bill. The government will not support opposition amendments to the legislation since they would, if accepted, undermine the government's intended reforms. The government will not support the Democrat amendments as we consider, Senator Cherry, that they are unnecessary. We have carefully weighed up these matters and have come to those conclusions.</para><para>The government considers all the reforms contained in the bill to be in the public interest. The package of measures contained in this bill represents a serious attempt to improve the overall operation and regulatory scrutiny of the postal services market for the benefit of all. The measures will improve the quality of service regulation and hence, we believe, consumer confidence in Australia Post. They provide clarity and certainty to small business participants in postal services, they clarify the operation of the market for users of bulk mail services and they address concerns about possible unfair cross-subsidisation by Australia Post. Importantly, Australia Post itself supports these measures. The government considers that it is important for the bill to be passed as soon as possible, as delaying the potential benefits to consumers and businesses is unjustifiable. I look forward to the cooperation of the Senate.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>22984</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill—by leave—taken as a whole.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>22985</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move opposition amendments (1) and (2) on the second revised sheet 4149: </para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Clause 4, page 2 (line 4) to page 3 (line 2), omit subclauses (1) to (5).</para><para>(2)	Clause 4, page 3 (lines 8 to 14), omit subclause (7).</para></quote><para>We also oppose division 1 in item 21 and items 1 to 6, 8 to 10 and 19 and 20 in the following terms:</para><quote><para>(3)	Schedule 1, items 1 to 5, page 4 (lines 4 to 27), <inline font-weight="bold">TO BE OPPOSED</inline>.</para><para>(4)	Schedule 1, item 6, page 4 (line 29) to page 5 (line 2), <inline font-weight="bold">TO BE OPPOSED</inline>.</para><para>(5)	Schedule 1, items 8 to 10, page 5 (lines 7 to 16), <inline font-weight="bold">TO BE OPPOSED</inline>.</para><para>(10)	Schedule 1, items 19 and 20, page 7 (lines 26 to 30), <inline font-weight="bold">TO BE OPPOSED</inline>.</para><para>(11)	Schedule 1, item 21, page 8 (line 2) to page 11 (line 14), Division 1, <inline font-weight="bold">TO BE OPPOSED</inline>.</para></quote><para>These amendments and opposed schedules seek to reject the bill's provisions transferring the Australia Post monitoring role from the Auditor-General to the ACA. Labor, as I foreshadowed in the second reading debate, rejects this part of the bill. Labor's opposed schedule (11) rejecting division 1 of item 21 is the key opposed schedule rejecting the new ACA role, and the remaining opposed schedules—(3), (4),(5) and (10)—are consequential on the success of the prime opposed schedule getting up.</para><para>Labor amendments (1) and (2) omit subclauses 1 to 5 and 7 of clause 4 of the bill under discussion. These are savings provisions relating to this bill's attempts to transfer the Australia Post monitoring role from the Auditor-General to the ACA. Labor's opposed schedule (3) removes items 1 to 5 of schedule 1 of this bill. These items, as is clear, seek to amend the Australian Communications Authority Act 1997 for the purposes of facilitating the ACA's new postal role, which Labor rejects.</para><para>Labor's opposed schedules (4) and (5) remove items 6, 8, 9 and 10 of schedule 1 of the bill. These items are part of the amendments to the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 which facilitate the new postal monitoring role for the Australian Communications Authority. Item 10 of the bill is of note, we believe, because it is the clause that effectively repeals the Auditor-General's postal monitoring role. Labor's opposed schedule (10) removes items 19 and 20 of schedule 1. These items also amend the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 to help facilitate the new postal monitoring role for the Australian Communications Authority. Labor's opposed schedule (11) omits division 1 of item 21 of this bill. This is the substantive division outlining in detail the ACA's new role, which is the central feature of our objection and the reasons for putting forward these amendments and opposed schedules.</para><para>In the bill many of the clauses relating to the Auditor-General's existing postal monitoring roles are simply transferred without change in any way to the Australian Communications Authority. The same functions, the same powers and the same processes in the old act are proposed to be transferred into the new bill. The central difference is that the monitoring authority will be the ACA and not the Auditor-General. Several new provisions are included relating to delivery arrangements, ministerial discretion and additional reports, so there are some changes there. However, Labor reject division 1 of item 21 of the bill because we do not believe in the new postal monitoring role for the ACA and prefer that it remain with the Auditor-General.</para><para>In summary, our position is that at present the Auditor-General adequately monitors Australia Post service standards. The government is proposing in this bill to transfer this function to the ACA. Labor prefer that this current role for the Auditor-General remain in place. We believe that the Auditor-General is completely independent of the communications minister and we are not so satisfied, based upon the performance of the ACA in more recent years, that it can be confidently asserted that the ACA is similarly robust, independent and free from ministerial discretion in the way it carries out its duties, its performance and its critical role. We believe that the Auditor-General has monitored Australia Post effectively and competently. We do not believe the ACA is sufficiently independent of government to monitor Australia Post service standards and costs. </para><para>In the telecommunications area the ACA was exposed last year with reported statistics which portrayed Telstra's annual network fault levels in an extremely favourable light. In the last few weeks alone it has been the subject of debate in this place and elsewhere with regard to leaked Telstra documents which show that Telstra's soaring fault levels are due predominantly to network neglect and a failure to have sufficient capital investment, and not bad weather, as was alleged by Telstra, the government and the ACA in a rather protracted process. In Labor's view, the Auditor-General is a much more independent and robust institution for monitoring Australia Post's performance.</para><para>A further reason for not giving the ACA these new monitoring powers is that the government has announced the merger of the two communications regulators, the Australian Broadcasting Authority and the Australian Communications Authority, and we wish to observe that process before additional powers or transference of powers is effectively guaranteed. Labor therefore oppose all the provisions in the Postal Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 which transfer the Australia Post monitoring role from the Auditor-General to the ACA.</para><para>In summary, Labor believe that the Auditor-General does a competent and effective job at the moment in this area of his work and that the ACA's role as being properly independent of government and not open to political pressure is problematic—and I refer to recent instances where it has been under review. We say that the government has announced the merger of the ABA and the ACA, and Labor believe it is preferable to await the outcome of that merger before giving a new agency any extra roles, particularly with respect to Australia Post. We believe that the onus is on the government to demonstrate the need for change to the status quo. We are not satisfied that the government has brought sufficient or, indeed, any evidence to warrant ACA involvement in an area of activity which has generally been the subject of satisfactory regulatory oversight to date. In any event, we are not satisfied that the Auditor-General is not discharging its statutory functions adequately and, even if that were so, we do not believe that it is appropriate at this stage to have those roles transferred to the ACA.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>22986</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Democrats will be supporting the opposition on this occasion in respect of the role of the ACA. As I outlined in my speech in the second reading debate, the Democrats do not believe that these provisions add significantly to the function of oversight of Australia Post and its services. Furthermore, the cost that would be incurred for these oversight provisions does not actually outweigh the benefits that they would provide. It is noteworthy that the Auditor-General has done this role, and quite effectively, over some considerable time. There have been no cases put up by the government to show that the Auditor-General is not doing that role effectively. From our point of view, we simply cannot see any merit in spending this money to have this oversight function done. No evidence has been presented to date to show that Australia Post itself needs an oversight and better accountability. Indeed, all the evidence suggests that, whether it be complaints from customers or the cost of services delivered or compliance with law, Australia Post is an exemplary government enterprise, and from that point of view these provisions are not needed. </para></talk.start><para>I would also like to note that we are actually saving the government some money by doing this for them. The cost of this oversight function is around $2½ million a year. After the enormous pork barrel that was rolled out last night, I think the government need every cent we can find for them. It is worth noting that the run-downs of the budget surpluses over the next four years are the equivalent of the complete cost of the selling of Telstra. It is worth noting at this stage that the government need every $2 million they can find if they are actually going to do anything in terms of preventing interest rates going up through a massive fiscal incentive. Whilst $2½ million might not sound like much, given that it is coming straight out of the Australia Post dividend and straight out of Australia Post services, I think it is quite beneficial that the Senate say to the government, `We have found a way for you not to spend money that would be spent unnecessarily and that would fail a cost-benefit analysis.' So, from that point of view, the Democrats are supportive of the opposition's view that the role currently undertaken by the Auditor-General should continue, with enhanced powers—which we will be talking about later on—and that the ACA should not be brought into this particular process.</para><para>I also note that the government announced last night that it will be merging the role of the ACA and the ABA. That is something which, again, the government needs to debate properly before we consider what extended role beyond that the ACA will take on. The notion of a regulator trying to carry out all the current powers of the ACA—which, in my view, it is not undertaking effectively anyway—and then taking on the roles of Professor Flint over at the ABA and getting new roles when at its core is a regulator which, as I said, is not doing its job properly, is something which we have to think about very carefully as a Senate and as a parliament. I think that should be done when the government brings forward its merger proposal for the ABA and the ACA, and we will see what we can make of it then. For those various reasons, the Democrats will be supporting the opposition on this occasion. These are unnecessary provisions. It is an unnecessary $2½ million impost on Australia Post. I certainly think that, from a fiscal point of view, the government should be doing everything it can to save money after its largesse last night.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>22987</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Arts and Sport</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think I have now heard just about everything in the Senate: the Democrats getting up and purporting to lecture the government about saving money! Senator Cherry, you should frame your comments. I think they were done with tongue in cheek, because the Democrats have never been the slightest bit interested in saving the government money. From day one of my being here, the Democrats' policy under various leaders—in fact, quite a few leaders—has been to spend, spend and spend again. So to see you stand up and attempt to lecture the government on fiscal prudence is, I would have to say, a unique experience in this chamber, never to be repeated. On Senator Bishop's comments, I must say that you know when the Labor Party are on weak ground. If they do not like a report, what do they always do? Attack the messenger. </para></talk.start><para>We had aspersions cast on the independence of the ACA. What was the substantive proof for this outrageous comment? The Labor Party did not like their report. Under Mr Latham, the Labor Party has spent a lot of time going around lecturing people about proper behaviour and proprieties and relations with public servants and independent bodies. The ACA board is staffed by distinguished people and you have just cast aspersions on them, quite carelessly, that somehow they are succumbing to pressures from Mr Daryl Williams and others. It is quite outrageous and should not be accepted. </para><para>As I pointed out, the government will not be accepting the amendments that have been moved by Senator Bishop. The proposals contained in the bill give the ACA an oversight role in relation to Australia Post by requiring the ACA to monitor and report on Australia Post's performance and supply of postal services. The opposition's proposal is that the monitoring role proposed for the ACA be given instead to the Auditor-General, an agency whose principal function is that of auditing. That proposal is, I would have thought, clearly weaker in terms of transparency and consumer protection than the government's proposal itself.</para><para>The ACA's new postal functions will benefit consumers. Senator Cherry was talking about costs. Senator Cherry, what about costs to consumers? Again, you show one of the famous blind spots of the Australian Democrats. What is good for consumers here? I think the government's proposal is clearly one which is of benefit to consumers. The ACA's new postal functions will be able to target specific matters for monitoring if there is general public concern about a particular matter relating to Australia Post's supply of postal services. At the moment I think it is true to say there is little, if any, independent oversight of Australia Post's postal functions other than an audit against performance standards. Under the government's proposed legislation there is the opportunity for the ACA to examine systemic failures on a geographical basis.</para><para>Other issues which the ACA could examine which are currently not done by the Auditor-General include geographic disaggregation of issues such as ongoing consumer complaints and late deliveries and/or service performance in the bush in comparison with metropolitan areas. The assessment of Australia Post's performance is, we believe, clearly more appropriately carried out by the ACA, which performs a similar role in relation to the telecommunications industry. The ACA, in the government's view, is an independent regulator—I stress `independent', Senator Bishop—with the requisite expertise to monitor and report on Australia Post's performance in the supply of postal services.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Brandis, George (The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN)</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Brandis)</inline>—The question is that division 1 of item 21 and items 1 to 6, 8 to 10, 19 and 20 of the bill stand as printed.</para></talk.start><para>Question negatived.</para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN, The</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—The question now is that opposition amendments (1) and (2) be agreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Question agreed to.</para></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>22988</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The opposition opposes items 11 to 14 in schedule 1 in the following terms:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(6)	Schedule 1, items 11 to 14 , page 5 (line 17) to page 6 (line 34), <inline font-weight="bold">TO BE OPPOSED</inline>.</para></quote><para>The opposition opposes the provisions in the bill which will deregulate certain aspects of aggregation and document exchange services amendments. Items 11 to 14 in schedule 1 of the bill seek to remove two services currently reserved to Australia Post: firstly, the carriage of letters from a customer of an aggregation service to the aggregator before lodgment with Australia Post under its bulk interconnection service and, secondly, the carriage of letters between the customers of a document exchange service and the document exchange. </para><para>We believe this effectively erodes Australia Post's existing level of reserved services by providing more exceptions to these services. The government has said that these provisions legitimise existing business practices—we understand that to be its position. What we say they would really do is legitimise practices currently being conducted which have no authority and which are in fact illegal. Australia Post's reserved services enable Australia Post to perform its community service obligation, as we all understand. This does truly enable Australia Post to provide all Australians with an accessible standard letter service at a uniform price. Chipping away at Australia Post's reserved service undermines Australia Post's ability to provide its community service obligation, which it is required to provide under the statute which creates the organisation. It is, we believe, a continuation of the government's attempts to deregulate and ultimately privatise Australia Post's services.</para><para>Australia Post's performance levels have been outstanding in recent times and have been achieved because they are its core responsibility, a standard letter being reserved as a monopoly to Australia Post. In no way do the Labor Party depart from their approval of that particular practice. For the last number of years, Labor have consistently opposed the further deregulation of Australia Post and the removal of services that it has under statutory monopolies. We believe it is more appropriate that Australia Post remains in full public ownership, delivering high-quality postal services to Australians across this land. If there are deficiencies in the carrying out of those services or in the carrying out of new services, we believe it is appropriate that Australia Post engages in improving its internal performances so that it can continue to deliver those services to all Australians. So we oppose these particular provisions that are currently before the committee. We support Australia Post as an integral part of Australia's social and economic fabric. Labor are not going to stand by and allow the Howard government to slowly erode, by chipping away, Australia Post's critical national functions, which it has been carrying out properly, effectively, efficiently and at a continuing low cost for many years.</para><para>We understand the Democrats may not be supporting the change proposed by the opposition which is opposing deregulation of Australia Post's reserved service, or certain aspects of that. We believe this position of the Democrats is regrettable. The government's first attempts to deregulate and ultimately privatise Australia Post will be given a hand by the Australian Democrats if they oppose the proposed change currently before the committee.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>22989</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Democrats will be supporting the government amendments on this particular occasion. I think it is worth putting a few things on the record about the aggregation and document exchange services. This affects roughly one per cent of Australia Post's potential business, so we are talking about a very small part of Australia Post's business. Indeed, in coming to our view we took into careful account the views that were raised by the Post Office Agents Association and the CEPU in their submissions to the committee. The Post Office Agents Association were certainly concerned that they may lose business, and the CEPU thought it was rather odd that these provisions were about legalising activities which are currently illegal but in many cases are already being undertaken by document exchange services in collecting and delivering mail for their customers. </para></talk.start><para>At the end of the day, we really do not believe that these proposed provisions are the thin edge of the wedge, as Senator Bishop suggests, but rather that they are a fairly logical extension of what was already excluded from the reserved powers back in 1994. Rather than actually undermining Australia Post, we think they simply clarify what is currently allowed as an exclusion from the reserved powers, in terms of document exchange and aggregation. For the benefit of Senator Bishop, I would like to reiterate what I said in my opening comments regarding correspondence I received from Australia Post that said:</para><quote><para>Aggregation is of benefit to Australia Post, because it provides Post with more mail that can be processed more efficiently and for significantly less cost. The revenue reduction is more than outweighed by the associated cost savings.</para></quote><para>I think that is very important. I think the provisions we are talking about here are for the benefit of customers of document exchange and aggregation services—and I am sure Senator Kemp will be pleased to hear that I am talking about benefits for customers—but they are also about ensuring that we have a proper definition of what is the clear legal extent of document exchange and aggregation services.</para><para>The Democrats have also picked up the concern that the Post Office Agents Association raised about ensuring that, when we do set these clear standards in law, they are properly enforced by government and by Australia Post. That is why we will be moving later as an amendment something that was suggested in the committee evidence, and that is a provision to allow for further legal enforcement of these provisions by adopting a provision out of the Telecommunications Act. In relation to supporting the government's amendments at this stage, what should be remembered is that this is part of a broader package that we are proposing, which is to enforce more clearly these provisions through the penalty provisions in the amendment I will be moving later.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>22990</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Arts and Sport</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It gives me great pleasure to commend the comments from Senator Cherry.

The proposed legitimisation of these practices, as provided for in the government's bill, will not result in the establishment of alternative end-to-end delivery services in competition with Australia Post. Let me put that on record. The safeguards contained in the bill will ensure that the document exchange services can continue to provide their current level of services but that they will not be able to vastly expand their membership with the intent of providing an alternative end-to-end delivery service. Australia Post has been fully consulted in the development of the safeguards and has given its full support to the proposed measures. We will not be supporting the Labor Party's proposal, which, as we all know, was probably drafted by the CEPU.</para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That items 11 to 14 stand as printed.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>10:40:00</time.stamp><para>The committee divided.</para></division.header><para>(The Chairman—Senator J.J.

It is based very loosely on section 570 of the Telecommunications Act in that it establishes clear penalties for infringement of reserve services. Our view was that this provision was essential, having looked at the evidence coming out of the inquiry into these provisions, where in particular the Postal Office Agents Association made it clear that they felt there was a need in the legislation to include specific penalties to act as a proper deterrent to abuses. I do notice that Senator Kemp said in his comments that there are some safeguards in this legislation to protect the reserve services of Australia Post. I think it is a fundamental flaw that the provisions currently rely on civil action by Australia Post to protect its reserve services rather than a civil penalty provision, as is provided in other competition policy areas, in particular in the Telecommunications Act. This provision, as I said, is based on section 570 of the Telecommunications Act and it puts Australia Post on the same basis as Telstra in terms of ensuring that its reserve services are properly protected and enforced.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>22992</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Democrat amendment (1) implements a penalty regime for persons found to be infringing Australia Post's exclusive right to undertake its reserve service. This, we believe, is in many ways the Democrats' mea culpa amendment. The Democrats' opposition to Labor's previous amendments, which we just all noted in that division, has allowed the legislative passage of the government's first attempts to begin chipping away at Australia Post's reserve services. This has allowed the thin edge of the wedge to be inserted. It has begun, and the government and the Democrats are there working as allies in conjunction. So this amendment, we believe, is to ease Senator Cherry's guilty conscience about his previous retrograde actions. However, having said that, Labor do support this amendment but we find it regrettable that the Democrats could not support our previous amendment, which would have ensured that the original, stronger Australia Post reserve service remained in place. We put out our hand for assistance and it was spurned, and now the thin edge of the wedge has been inserted. But we have not reciprocated. We are pleased to announce that we are able to support this Democrat amendment even though it is, as I said at the outset, a mea maxima culpa amendment. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>22993</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Arts and Sport</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—What an extraordinary intervention from Senator Bishop. I am sure Senator Cherry will survive that vicious personal attack. Senator Cherry knows, as I do, that despite the fact that we on this side of the chamber regard Senator Bishop as one of the more intelligent senators on the other side, we do note that when the CEPU gives him a call and asks him to run some lines he is as fast as the rest of his colleagues to get on his feet and do what the paymaster says. Despite your undoubted intelligence and the contributions that you can make, when it is vetoed by the CEPU I am afraid you are like the rest of your colleagues: you just dance to that tune.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Cherry will be upset to hear that we will not be supporting his amendment. The amendment, we believe, is unnecessary. Section 31 of the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 already provides that Australia Post may apply to the Federal Court for relief where a person has engaged in conduct that infringes the reserve service. This relief may constitute an injunction and, at the option of Australia Post, either damages or an account of profits. The government believe that this mechanism and the relief that it provides is appropriate, and we note that Australia Post actively monitors potential breaches of its reserve service. The current provisions have been in place for over a decade and have worked effectively. The government note that Australia Post has sought relief for breaches of its reserve service on several occasions in the past in the Federal Court. Consequently the Democrat amendment would have little or no practical utility. In practice Australia Post is in the best position to monitor breaches of its reserve service and is also the appropriate body to pursue breaches in the Federal Court. The government also believe that the current relief provisions provided in the act, which include damages and an account of profits, are the most appropriate for breaches of the reserve service.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>22993</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I just wanted to note for the record that the deregulation of reserve services occurred in 1994 under a Labor government, under communications minister Michael Lee.

In the bill, the ACA's postal monitoring role is similar to the Auditor-General's existing role, but the bill did contain some enhancements, it is fair to say, of that role. These enhancements relate to the new provisions in proposed sections 50C and 50E of the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989, which have now been deleted in committee stage under opposition amendment (11), discussed previously.</para><para>Opposition amendment (7), which is before us now, relates to proposed new section 50C of the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989. The new section 50C contained a clause which would have extended the standards regulation making powers of the ACA through the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989. As the EM of the bill explains, this new clause would enable standards to be prescribed relating to the processes used by Australia Post for polling communities to determine whether delivery services should be provided to a property. This would address the concern that Australia Post's current method of polling communities to determine whether to institute delivery services to a property has made it difficult for communities to convince Australia Post to institute these services.</para><para>A range of communities across our country that do not have delivery services to a property have been making a series of complaints to Australia Post, the government, the department and, indeed, all the political parties who take an interest in this matter. They have complained that the assessment process undertaken by Australia Post to determine whether there should be delivery services to a property is deficient and unsatisfactory and that it leads to incorrect or wrong responses, upon which Australia Post determines planning for new services. This is an objective of the original bill that Labor support in principle; we just have a different means of achieving that outcome, as outlined in opposition amendment (7). Labor support in principle the new wording of 50C, which allows for prescribed performance standards regarding the methods of determining the level of mail delivery service for a particular area, but we do not support the application of this new provision to the ACA rather than the Auditor-General. </para><para>The Auditor-General's postal monitoring role has been kept in place by our successful amendment (5), which ensures that division 1A of part 3 of the relevant act remains in place. Our amendment (7) simply applies the new delivery arrangements standards role to the Auditor-General using identical language to the original bill proposed for the Australian Communications Authority. Amendment (7) will enhance the Auditor-General's existing role and will achieve the same outcome, we believe, regarding regional delivery arrangements that the government sought to achieve through the ACA. The difference with Labor's approach is that this improved outcome will be achieved through a different agency—the agency that Labor believe is better suited to monitoring Australia Post, which, as we have now said repeatedly, we believe is the Auditor-General, not the ACA. In summary, therefore, Labor's alternative amendment (7) will simply apply the new delivery arrangements monitoring role to the Auditor-General's existing role.</para><para>The next in this series of amendments regarding the enhancement of the Auditor-General's postal monitoring role is opposition amendment (8). This again applies a minor enhancement of the postal monitoring role to the Auditor-General rather than the ACA. The bill's proposed section 50D mostly replicates section 28E of the existing act. Labor successfully defended the existing postal monitoring arrangements, including section 28E, in our amendment (4). Section 50D did, however, have a small enhancement on section 28E, which was that Australia Post was not required to prepare a service improvement plan if the minister considered it unnecessary in the circumstances. This minor change to section 28E recognised that Australia Post may address the reasons for a failure to meet a new standard before its failure to meet the standard is noted in its relevant report.</para><para>Furthermore, in such cases, the requirement for Australia Post to prepare a service improvement plan would clearly be unnecessary. Labor support in principle the merits of the new wording of original section 50D, as reflected in our proposed amendment to section 28E(1). Our previous amendments in committee have kept section 28E of the act intact and have also defeated proposed section 50D of the bill. Opposition amendment (8) applies a slight enhancement of Australia Post's service improvement plan arrangements to the original section 28E. Therefore, the objectives of the government's aim in the new wording of proposed section 50C remain in place in our proposed amendment to 28E.</para><para>The government also planned through proposed new section 58E to allow the minister to direct the ACA to monitor and report to the minister on specified matters relating to Australia Post's supply of postal services, which the minister has referred to in some of the committee debate. Labor do not have major objections to this new provision in principle; we just have a problem with the fact that it applies to the ACA and not to the Auditor-General. Therefore, having defeated proposed new section 50E of the act, Labor's amendment (9) re-enacts a version of that enhanced role outlined in section 50E. Again, it applies to the Auditor-General and not to the ACA.</para><para>Under opposition amendment (9), which creates a new section 28F of the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989, the government's proposed additional reporting role will apply to the Auditor-General, not the ACA. Labor's amendment (9) is worded slightly differently to the bill's original proposed section 50E to take into account the fact that the Auditor-General should not be directed by ministers. Therefore, the wording states that the minister may request reports rather than require reports, as would have been the case with the ACA. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>22996</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Democrats will be supporting these amendments for the reasons I outlined earlier. I would like to comment very briefly on the role of the Auditor-General, in particular in response to a comment from Senator Kemp earlier in the debate when he indicated that the Auditor-General just audits. Performance auditing has been a fundamental part of the Auditor-General's role in Australia for a very long time and is increasingly a significant part of the Auditor-General's role. Performance auditing goes way beyond just auditing; it actually covers the fundamental issues of effectiveness, value for money and delivery against performance standards. From that point of view, the Democrats believe it is appropriate for the Auditor-General to continue to perform the role, which it has done effectively in Australia Post now for a good decade, and it is also appropriate that that role be enhanced in the way that has been suggested to cover the issues the government raised in its original bill in terms of mail delivery in particular regional areas.

The government's bill, just to recap, proposes a range of expanded independent oversight functions in relation to Australia Post which it proposes should be exercised by the ACA. The effect of the opposition amendments would be that some of the proposed roles of the ACA would be performed by the Auditor-General; others would not be performed at all.</para></talk.start><para>The Auditor-General's office is an agency whose principal function is that of auditing. The proposed expanded oversight powers in relation to Australia Post, which would deliver greater transparency and accountability to government and consumers, go much further than auditing. It should be noted that the Auditor-General outsources its current function of monitoring Australia Post's performance against prescribed standards to an accounting firm. The oversight function is clearly more appropriately carried out by the ACA, which performs a similar role in relation to the telecommunications industry. If the CEPU works out that there is outsourcing involved there, I suppose we will have another amendment from the Labor Party.</para><para>The ACA is an independent regulator with the requisite expertise to monitor and report on Australia Post's performance in the supply of postal services. It has seven years experience in developing processes and mechanisms to monitor and report on performance in the telecommunications market. The experience that it has gained over this time can be, I am advised, appropriately applied to establishing performance monitoring arrangements in relation to Australia Post.

The amendment will also simplify an adjustment mechanism included in the bill by avoiding the need for a separate process for adjusting an underpayment or overpayment made by Australia Post and creating a standing appropriation to deal with overpayments. The amendment is technical in nature and puts in place appropriate payment processes. As I said, it does not change the government's objectives or intentions—or the operation of the bill. It is disappointing that, because of the opposition's anticonsumer stance, the parts of the bill relating to the ACA have been opposed in this committee stage.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>22998</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move opposition amendments R(12) to R(18) on sheet 4149:</para></talk.start><quote><para>R(12)	Government amendment (1), heading to section 56A, omit “<inline font-weight="bold">ACA and the</inline>”.</para><para>R(13)	Government amendment (1), paragraph 56A(1)(a), omit “ACA's and the”.</para><para>R(14)	Government amendment (1), subsection 56A(2), omit “ACA's and the”.</para><para>R(15)	Government amendment (1), heading to subsection 56A(3), omit “<inline font-style="italic">ACA and</inline>”.</para><para>R(16)	Government amendment (1), omit subsection 56A(3), substitute:</para><para>	(3)	The Minister may, in a financial year, direct Australia Post to pay to the ACCC, on behalf of the Com-monwealth, the Minister's estimate of the ACCC's costs for that financial year, adjusted in accordance with subsection (7) or (8).</para><para>R(17)	Government amendment (1), omit subsections 56A(4) to (6).</para><para>R(18)	Government amendment (1), subsection 56A(9), omit the definition of <inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">ACA's costs</inline>.</para></quote><para>As the minister outlined, government amendment (1) contains technical amendments to proposed section 56A of the act. The amendment provides for an annual levy to be imposed on Australia Post to fund the new roles of both the ACA and the ACCC as provided for in the bill. The amendment omits the former proposed section 56A and inserts a new proposed section 56A. The new proposed section 56A ensures that the ACA and ACCC are able to collect the levy from Australia Post on behalf of the Commonwealth and, I am advised, obviates the need for a standing appropriation to deal with any overpayment made by Australia Post to either the ACA or the ACCC. As the minister said, they are routine technical amendments and the opposition supports them. </para><para>Opposition amendments R(12) to R(18) omit reference to the ACA with regard to the recovery of cost provisions in proposed section 56A of the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989. Proposed section 56A allows the Commonwealth to recover costs from Australia Post in regard to the new ACA and ACCC roles within Australia Post. While Labor support, for now, this section in regard to cost recovery for the ACCC, whose new role we support, we do not support the cost recovery for the ACA's role as we do not support the new ACA role as outlined. Opposition amendments R(12) to R(18) therefore leave the new cost recovery arrangements intact for the ACCC while removing reference to the ACA.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>22999</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Democrats will be supporting the amendments moved by the ALP. As I said earlier, we are in the process of trying to save the government money wherever we can. I think these amendments are particularly important in doing that. It is worth noting the evidence given by Australia Post to the Senate committee that the cost of ACA oversight would be $2 million up front to establish the model and roughly $2½ million per year in addition to that over the course of the coming years. In addition to that, of course, the cost of oversight by the ACCC would be $900,000 in the first year and $600,000 each year beyond that. So this bill is going to cost Australia Post roughly $3.5 million a year, which would be levied on an ongoing basis.</para></talk.start><para>All of that has to have a benefit. That is what we keep coming back to: what is the benefit? Despite all the various things the government has asserted the ACA will do, it certainly has not proven that there will be a benefit for that sort of money. So the Democrats are very pleased to be able to support these amendments today and save Australia Post around $2½ million a year in addition to $2 million in the first year. We can think of lots of ways we would like to spend that money but we are happy to leave the government to do that because it has a very large fiscal surplus to try to claw back.</para><para>In response to the minister's comments in his previous contribution that the ACA has had experience in dealing with the oversight of Telstra for over seven years, I suggest that, if we are talking about the performance of organisations, he compare the customer satisfaction ratings of Telstra with the customer satisfaction ratings of Australia Post. If they are an indication of how effective the regulation and oversight provisions are, then the Auditor-General is doing a very good job.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>22999</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Arts and Sport</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am intrigued by the accounting arrangements of Senator Cherry.

That is a debate which has probably taken up too much of the time of the Senate. We differ from the Labor Party on this issue, for all the reasons that I stated earlier.

It gives those electronic communications legal status. At the same time, it regularises and standardises format, language and process. Until now, all communications with respect to claims and lodgment of documents with DVA and its agencies have been exempt from the provisions of the Electronic Transactions Act. This act requires that electronic communications with the Commonwealth be given legal status unless an exemption is granted. That exemption was given with respect to the Veterans' Entitlements Act, pending resolution of the detail now contained in this bill.</para></talk.start><para>In making the provisions needed to bring veterans' matters into line, the opportunity has been taken to standardise processes, form and language in the principal act. These changes affect claims for most benefits, advice, applications for review, changes of circumstances, withdrawals and most other communications between veterans and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Therefore, the bill is purely technical, with significant housekeeping by way of simplification and standardisation. The bill is straightforward and non-controversial. It has been inevitable and, to some extent, it is overdue.</para><para>Electronic communication is, of course, now the standard method of transacting business. It is quick, efficient and effective. The ex-service community as a whole may not be online to the same extent as other sections of the community, but ex-service organisations certainly are. The BEST scheme has had an important impact here, as it is under that program that funding has been made available for computer hardware. Without that assistance, it is doubtful whether the take-up of technology would have been nearly as high or, indeed, as effective.</para><para>It must also be said that the development of the Compensation Claims Processing System, CCPS, in the Department of Veterans' Affairs is part of this electronic approach to claims assessment. For the information of the Senate, this is a computer based system which guides decision making through the legislation in testing all claims. Equally, the system is available to those making claims. Therefore, they can provide the detail required in the same format; hence the usefulness of this added electronic connection. Not only does the CCPS contain that decision-making tree but also it is self-contained with respect to necessary references to the statements of principal and other important databases. It is a very advanced approach to decision making in a quite complex area of law.</para><para>As with all systems, of course, there is scope for human error. Many claims are still rejected and succeed on appeal. Often, though, this is due to new information, not faulty decisions. This raises a most dramatic contrast. Despite these wonders of the electronic age, veterans' details are still recorded on paper. For those seeking to make claims for a service pension, war widow pension or disability pension these records are critical. Unfortunately, they are also the greatest weakness. Evidence given to the recent inquiry by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee addressed this particular problem in some detail. It is accepted in this jurisdiction that records made during wartime were and are often, subsequent to the war, at risk, hence the benefit of the doubt and hence the utility of other sources of corroborative advice. There are special provisions in the legislation which provide for this allowance. As well, the onus of proof of factual evidence is not with the claimant but with the department.</para><para>These are considerable concessions. They are understandable where service has been rendered overseas in dire circumstances. It is not understandable, however, in modern service circumstances. Yet it is clear that the state of defence personnel records is a shambles. This is the only conclusion which can be drawn from the evidence to date. Not only are there multiple copies of files; there are separate files for health and then there are separate health files for psychological records maintained and kept in different places. Veterans constantly complain that the files are incomplete. In some cases, they are totally missing. Even when there have been recent attempts to store files electronically or in photo form it is said that they have been lost. We have had a grand plan called HealthKEYS, which is reassuring, but veterans are not holding their breath.</para><para>Put simply, evidence at recent committee hearings suggests that the problem does not appear to be working a quick way to a solution. Even to this day, we hear from service people sent to Iraq that they have no idea of the type of vaccinations they receive. Indeed, it is only after prolonged questioning that some of the consequences of those vaccinations appear to have been understood or realised. Some veterans simply say that their records cannot be found. I do not want to reopen the anthrax issue but it is a very important case in point. The whole history of health care for veterans is littered with experiences where service people have little idea of what they have been exposed to. That is a separate matter, but record keeping does remain at the heart of that particular problem.</para><para>We do recognise that there are, in fact, hundreds of thousands of files. They are all stored at different locations right around the country and access is not always easy. We also know that, although it is not necessary, freedom of information requests are the major retrieval tool. In short, claims for veterans' entitlements are a big business. There are over 50,000 claims made each year. These are for disability pensions, pension increases, service pensions and war widows' pensions. Each one requires access to a file. It is only to be hoped that, at least for the future, the electronic age matures in a hurry. The current chaos is indefensible.</para><para>This legislation is timely. It focuses on the real need to get this problem fixed, but it is much bigger than simple communication. It is about the need to commit fully to the electronic storage of documents and their retrieval. So far we have only had bits and pieces. Unfortunately, we will probably never get to the situation where the current population of ex-service people might gain that benefit. The paperchase, we suspect, will continue for decades into the future. </para><para>We all know that Department of Veterans' Affairs has sought to take control of all records. The question is, however, whether it is adequately resourced to carry out the function which it seeks to do. History shows that Defence is simply not good at looking after ex-service matters. All overheads such as this are regarded as marginal. It is only the sharp end to Defence which seems to matter. We will watch this saga as the transference occurs and the bill becomes an act and is implemented in the department. The opposition support this bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>23003</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1978">Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Electronic Delivery) Bill 2004</inline> enables the Department of Veterans' Affairs to accept electronic lodgment of documents. It provides for electronic and physical receipt of claims, application requests and other documents relating to benefits paid. It is legislation that the Democrats support. The need to amend the Veterans Entitlements' Act flows from the passage of the Electronic Transactions Act 1999, which facilitated the development of electronic commerce in Australia by broadly removing legal impediments that prevent a person from using electronic communications to satisfy obligations under the law.</para></talk.start><para>The Department of Veterans' Affairs was originally specifically excluded from that act pending the development of procedures and technology. It is certainly now well and truly time, five years down the track, that the fuller benefit of electronic communications with government and agencies is passed to veterans and their families and, indeed, benefits the invaluable work that veteran advocates and ex-service organisations do.</para><para>We know that older Australians are steadily increasing their Internet use. There has been a 40 per cent growth in the number of people over the age of 65 using the Internet since the start of 2001. Indeed, judging by the amount and complexity of the electronic communications I receive from the veterans' community, particularly in relation to some of their campaigns for better treatment from this government, I would say that many of them are already adept at using the technology quite extensively. We also know that many older adults rely on informal sources—family and friends, for example—or established contacts such as doctors for information. Many still prefer face-to-face personal interactions as, of course, do some people of any age. That aspect must not be lost.</para><para>Retirement, previous positive experience, peer support and encouragement, and the desire to extend their knowledge parameters have all been major driving forces in the Internet take-up of Australians, including older Australians and veterans. Retired Australians are increasingly motivated to go online and embrace the benefits of new technology. This act, in effect, will enable them to do that more commonly and more effectively should they so wish.</para><para>The idea of veterans—the veteran community is perceived as being full of older people, but of course it includes some young people—being technophobes is simply not realistic. Indeed, seniors are the strongest growing group when it comes to the use of online technology. However, some people do not wish to use that technology, and they should have that option.</para><para>It goes without saying that the Democrats insist that the department comply fully with the information privacy principles under the Privacy Act with regard to electronic communication and the collection, storage, use and disclosure of personal information in its possession. I think it is fair to say that, whatever your age, there is still greater distrust about the security of material and information that is transmitted electronically. We need to ensure that everything is not only done but seen to be done to protect that security and privacy. Electronic information is no less valuable than paper records and is in many ways more efficient in an administrative sense. There must be a secure environment and a reliable system, a secure mechanism, when people are seeking or providing personal information. </para><para>We need to make sure that electronic communication options do not inhibit open, direct verbal communication—telephone communication—by veterans and their families with the department. Despite the high take-up of the Department of Veterans' Affairs 1300 and 1800 telephone numbers, many veterans still tell my office that they would prefer to have an individual staff contact point. So we need to ensure that electronic communication and telephone options complement the improvement in the delivery of services. We certainly need to have the minister monitoring the performance of electronic communications against service charter standards. I am sure all of that will be done and I am sure we will hear about it very quickly from the veteran community if there are problems with the broadening of the usage of electronic communications that will be enabled by the passage of this legislation.</para><para>I would like to briefly take the opportunity, as I often do when speaking to any legislation dealing with veterans' affairs, to give recognition on behalf of the Democrats to the staff of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, who we know are dedicated and who operate under the mantle of frequently changing legislation and regulations, such as we have seen recently and such as we will see again perhaps later this week, and now in a new technical environment. It is pleasing to note a recent report by the Commonwealth Ombudsman that the number of complaints received in the Defence jurisdiction has been decreasing over the last few years and the further comment by the Ombudsman that comparatively few complaints are received about the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I trust this is a reflection of the increased standards of service by the department and of the access by veterans and their families to well-established avenues of appeal within the portfolio and further rights of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</para><para>I note that items within this bill extend electronic means of communication to requests for review. Certainly it is our hope that this further means will support and enhance the practice of veterans exercising their full rights of review and appeal. There will inevitably be problems. As always, part of the task of all members of the parliament representing their constituents—certainly the Senate—is monitoring the operation of the government to ensure that any problem areas are scrutinised properly and that we continually strive to further improve standards of service delivery.</para><para>We should always acknowledge that we owe the veteran community a special debt. At present we have service personnel most notably and controversially still in Iraq, but personnel are also serving, much less prominently but just as importantly, in many other regions of the world. Today's service men and women are tomorrow's veterans. We owe them the specific debt of ensuring that we do not just give them a welcome home parade but provide ongoing assistance and recognition of the service they have provided.</para><para>It is always worth reinforcing, and taking the opportunity to state, that despite differing views about whether or not personnel should be in places like Iraq there is a close to unanimous feeling of support amongst the Australian community—and certainly it is unanimous, as far as I am aware, in this parliament—for our personnel in the work they are doing. They have to operate under instruction from the government and they do their job as effectively as possible. We acknowledge that and it should be reinforced every time we have the opportunity to debate veterans' legislation—even a bill like this, which in effect is technical legislation dealing with what are seen as arcane matters to do with lodging forms by the Internet and other sorts of things. It is all about improving service, getting a better deal for veterans and ensuring that they are assisted and are able to access their entitlements as effectively as possible. The fact that this bill provides a mechanism to do that is welcome and is the reason the Democrats support it. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>23005</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Arts and Sport</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Over the years Australia has developed a comprehensive repatriation system to serve the veteran community.

The changes made by the <inline ref="R1978">Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Electronic Delivery) Bill 2004</inline> will improve the efficiency of the delivery of those benefits and other services that are provided to veterans and their dependants under the Veterans' Entitlements Act.</para></talk.start><para>The bill is designed to achieve two purposes: firstly, the unification of all the existing lodgment provisions in the Veterans' Entitlements Act and, secondly, provision for both the electronic and physical delivery of documents to the Department of Veterans' Affairs.

The bill will complete the integration process of the two bodies—at least in terms of the legislative program—by bringing the protective service officers, the PSOs, under the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 and repealing the Australian Protective Service Act 1987. While there are, I suspect, many operational issues that will still have to be finalised and gone through to ensure it becomes a seamless operation, our part in the process looks like it is nearly complete.</para></talk.start><para>The integration of the Australian Federal Police and the APS has long had Labor's support. Indeed, it was our commitment at the 2001 election. The bill amends the Australian Federal Police Act to create a new category of AFP employee—as I said earlier, the protective service officer—and to confer the existing functions, powers and duties of the APS on them. The Public Service Commissioner will make a determination under section 72 of the Public Service Act 1999 that APS officers cease to be Public Service employees and become employees of the Australian Federal Police. Under that section, the transferred employees will be entitled to remuneration and employment conditions no less favourable than those they enjoyed before the transfer. To give effect to this requirement, the Australian Federal Police Commissioner will make determinations under section 24 of the Public Service Act and section 27 of the Australian Federal Police Act 1979, preserving the remuneration and employment conditions currently in force under the section 170MX award currently applying to Australian Protective Service employees.</para><para>A number of issues surrounding the merger of the two bodies were raised at the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee inquiry into the bill, in which I participated. As the bill raises fairly complex issues of industrial law, the committee was assisted ably by the CPSU, representing APS officers, the Australian Federal Police Association and the Australian Government Solicitor. The Australian Federal Police and the Attorney-General's Department also assisted in the process.</para><para>The committee welcomed the fact that employee representatives appeared to have been consulted more extensively on the development of this bill than they had been in the past. The committee inquiry presented an opportunity for outstanding concerns to be raised. I will not take the time of the Senate to raise all the issues that were raised during the committee of inquiry or go through all of the finer points. The committee of inquiry report I think deals adequately with the substantive issues. What I want to draw out are those issues that the committee focused on and dealt with in a more substantive way.</para><para>One of those issues was about employees and the impact on employees transferring from the APS and their integration into the Australian Federal Police. As I mentioned earlier, the bill uses the machinery in the Public Service Act and the Australian Federal Police Act to confer a transfer of the employment conditions currently in force under the section 170MX award. The committee recognised the desirability of all AFP staff being employed under an integrated employment framework to provide operational cohesion to the newly integrated agency. However, the committee was troubled by the uncertainty faced by Australian Protective Service transferees in the transitional period. Until a new certified agreement is negotiated to cover the integrated work force, the employees, we were told during the committee of inquiry, will be in a position where they have terms not less favourable than they are currently under—which is the 170MX award.  </para><para>The 170MX award has its own history. Perhaps I might be doing it a little injustice but, in short, what occurred during the whole process was that the parties—the Attorney-General and the Australian Protective Service employees and their representatives—were unable to reach a certified agreement and, as a consequence, it went to the Industrial Relations Commission where, subsequently, a 170MX award was made. At the next juncture I expect that the parties will be able to sit down and negotiate a fresh certified agreement to cover the terms and conditions of employment. It will be open to the parties to determine the conditions that might prevail during that process. </para><para>I and other members of the committee thought there was a period when there may be a little uncertainty surrounding the issue. It would require the Australian Federal Police to ensure that their statements and their position were quite definite so that employees' terms and conditions and other matters surrounding the terms and conditions were clearly articulated to them and they had confidence in the Australian Federal Police dealing with all of those matters. I have that confidence in the Australian Federal Police through their commissioner. But when you have heard from the various parties during the committee of inquiry it does require a little extension of faith sometimes to ensure that all of these things do work out in the end. Hopefully they will, and I understand that we will have an opportunity to revisit that.</para><para>It emerged from the evidence given by the CPSU representing transferring Australian Protective Service officers that there is still concern on the part of these officers about their capacity to maintain their safety net of remuneration and conditions and to access independent review of AFP decisions that affect employment arrangements during this transitional period. There was a strong concern that the Australian Federal Police would be given a free hand to make unilateral decisions altering remuneration and conditions and that those affected would not be able to seek review of those decisions by the relevant independent authority. In the Australian Federal Police this authority is a board of reference constituted under the Workplace Relations Act. It is not fair to APS transferees to face such uncertainty, in my view, and it is plainly against the national interest for people tasked with such a critical protective security role to experience such a fundamental insecurity in their employment arrangements.</para><para>On these issues, the committee made two relevant recommendations. Firstly, the government should clarify that there are no legal obstacles to the conferral of jurisdiction on the board of reference to discuss and settle disputes over the remuneration and conditions of APS transferees and, secondly, in the light of these concerns about the employment of APS transferees the AFP should report back to the committee within 12 months on the progress of the integration. I will be listening closely to what the minister has to say about these issues at the end of this debate when he rises to sum up, and if necessary I will pursue the matter further in the committee stage.</para><para>In respect of the investigation of state offences by the Australian Federal Police, I should simply record Labor's support for the second aspect of this bill, which is to enable the AFP to investigate state offences that have a federal aspect. This refers to a situation where either, firstly, the subject matter of the offence is a subject on which the Commonwealth has the constitutional power to legislate or, secondly, the investigation of a state offence is incidental to the investigation of a federal or territory offence. This measure gives effect to a resolution of the April 2002 Leaders Summit on Terrorism and Multijurisdictional Crime. It remedies the potential duplication of police resources that presently arises where the AFP and state police services need to investigate different aspects of the same criminal conduct. Clearly, it has our support. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>23008</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak to the <inline ref="S406">Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 [2004]</inline> before us this morning. The bill implements the final stage of the integration of the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Protective Service. We Democrats note that the AFP already has fiscal and legal responsibility for the APS. However, the two agencies continue to operate under separate legislative and employment arrangements. This bill goes to the heart of that and deals primarily with transitional employment arrangements. The bill will also invest with the AFP the proper power to investigate state offences that may have a federal aspect—namely, offences that come within the constitutional power of the Commonwealth or where the investigation of a state offence is incidental to the investigation of a Commonwealth offence.</para></talk.start><para>We Democrats have previously indicated that we do not oppose the amalgamation of the AFP and the APS, although we have stated our concerns relating to the process of that amalgamation at various times. In particular, we believe the government has been very tardy in working towards the completion of this process. It has now been a very long time since the introduction of the initial legislation for the amalgamation of these two agencies. We Democrats have also expressed concerns about specific legislative provisions at different times throughout the process. For example, during debate on the Australian Protective Service Amendment Bill in this place last year, we expressed concerns regarding the frisk powers invested in APS officers. We felt that there were a number of ambiguities arising from the way in which these provisions were drafted and we successfully amended them with the support of both the government and opposition. We also expressed concerns about the implications of the bill on the right to silence and the privilege against self-incrimination as well as freedom of political communication. Again, we sought to amend the bill to address those particular concerns.</para><para>In the context of this legislation, the main issues arising from the inquiry conducted by the Senate's Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee related to the transitional employment arrangements which will apply to APS officers. The union—the CPSU—argued that there was some doubt as to whether the AFP would maintain the current conditions that apply to APS officers. On the other hand, the Australian Federal Police Association argued that the machinery of government changes—that is their term—provision in the Public Service Act contains sufficient protections for the entitlements of transferred APS officers. So we Democrats look forward to the committee stage during which senators will have more of an opportunity to tease out some of those issues with the minister.</para><para>I foreshadow that the Democrats will be moving an amendment, circulated in the name of Senator Bartlett, to ensure that the police commissioner cannot be dismissed for expressing an honestly held opinion if he or she believes that it is in the public interest to communicate that opinion, whether publicly or privately. I will explain the purpose and intention of that amendment at the appropriate stage. </para><para>Finally, I would like to take the opportunity to acknowledge that the AFP recently received the award for the most outstanding large business in the National Work and Family Awards. In achieving this recognition, the AFP competed against a considerable number of private sector businesses as well as other government departments. Other finalists included the ANZ Bank, the National Australia Bank, Aurora Industries, the John James Memorial Hospital in the ACT, Minter Ellison, Monash University, Education Queensland, St John of God Hospital in my home state of Western Australia and the University of South Australia. I take this opportunity to congratulate the AFP on becoming the first law enforcement agency to receive that gold award. Congratulations to them. The Australian Federal Police Association web site notes:</para><quote><para>The Awards, presented by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Business Council of Australia, recognise significant initiatives taken by business to help employees balance work and family.</para></quote><para>I note that the most recent AFP certified agreement introduced seven weeks recreation leave and more flexible working hours for all AFP employees. We Democrats have a longstanding commitment to achieving a better work-life balance in all Australian workplaces, and we believe the Commonwealth government needs to take more responsibility towards achieving that. Whilst agencies such as the AFP have done an outstanding job on this front, many other Australian workplaces are lagging behind. Many Australian families continue to struggle with the difficulties of the competing demands of work and family commitments. The Democrats will be taking a range of carefully targeted work and family initiatives to this year's election as part of an ongoing commitment to achieving work and family balance for all Australians, but I think the example and illustration we have here today with the AFP is a commendable benchmark and, again, I congratulate them for that.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>23009</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We have before us a bill which, although it may not be known to many, is nonetheless important. The <inline ref="S406">Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 [2004]</inline> deals with the integration of the two services of the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Protective Service. It consolidates and enhances Australia's national security framework and continues the government's efforts toward protecting all Australians from terrorist attacks and honouring our obligation under international law to protect foreign diplomatic and consular officials and their premises. I must say at the outset that I have recently been in the Solomon Islands and I have travelled to places such as East Timor where I have seen excellent work being done by the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Protective Service working side by side.</para></talk.start><para>We have had a two-stage approach to integrating both organisations, and this has allowed the Australian Protective Service to continue to deliver a range of services for which it is funded and contracted without disruption. It has allowed for detailed consideration of relevant workplace relations and commercial, financial and organisational issues. It has also allowed for full consultation and negotiations with employees of both organisations about the integration, and I think that this has to be remembered. This was not something that was going to happen overnight; we did not say that it would. It was the bringing together of two organisations with personnel serving under different arrangements. It was therefore necessary to take time to get it right. I notice that a CPSU publication on their web site stated: </para><quote><para>AFP have shown strong commitment to ensure all bases are covered with regard to APS transfer issues, having just engaged in lengthy, comprehensive and constructive negotiations, with the CPSU, over this conciliated settlement.</para></quote><para>I think that that spells out from one of the key stakeholders in this integration the approach that has been adopted in relation to consultation. If it took a bit longer, so be it, as long as we got it right—and we consulted with the people concerned to ensure that that was so.</para><para>The integration of the APS with the AFP is one part of a much broader government approach to maximising the effectiveness of Commonwealth counter-terrorism and transnational crime resources. It is a win-win for both organisations and the Australian public generally. This integration will allow the Australian Federal Police Commissioner to ensure the closest possible cooperation between protective service officers and police officers when conducting joint operations and providing protective security services.</para><para>The amendments in the bill also implement an important resolution of the leaders summit in April 2002. Federal, state and territory leaders made a commitment then to enable the AFP to investigate state offences incidental to multijurisdictional crime. These amendments allow the Australian Federal Police to access federal investigative powers to investigate state offences with a federal aspect. I will give you an example. You might have a case where there is importation of illicit drugs from overseas and during the course of that there is the commission of a state offence such as a domestic sale or supply. These amendments will allow the Australian Federal Police to investigate that without having to bring in state police and duplicate resources. This proposal is much more efficient in allowing the Australian Federal Police to simply deal with the matter that is under investigation. This is a very important step forward for the Australian Federal Police, and I certainly would regard this as a key recommendation to come from the leaders summit.</para><para>I would also like to take this opportunity to record my thanks to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for its consideration of the bill in a very short time frame. It has been important that we get this bill up and running, and I am obliged to the committee for its efforts in that regard. The government will be moving a number of amendments to the bill during the committee stage. A number of these government amendments stem from consideration of the bill by the Senate legal and constitutional committee, including some minor technical matters identified in the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest No. 78</inline> of 2003-04, while others are based on further advice received by the government to ensure the resolution of the leaders summit is fully implemented.</para><para>The government has accepted the recommendations made by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee in its report on this bill. The committee's first recommendation was that the bill should be agreed to. The second recommendation sought advice on whether there would be any legal obstacles to the conferral of jurisdiction on the board of reference to settle disputes over the remuneration and conditions of APS transferees. Upon examination of this issue it became clear that, given the AFP board of reference was provided for under the current AFP certified agreement, it would have no application to APS transferees at the time of transfer. However, advice received by the AFP following consultation before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission made it clear that the disputes procedures set out in the Workplace Relations Act will apply in their entirety to APS transferees. The third recommendation was that the AFP report back to the committee within 12 months on the progress of the integration, and this has also been accepted. </para><para>The government amendments will also finetune the amendments in schedule 3 of the bill which implement the resolution of the Leaders Summit on Terrorism and Multijurisdictional Crime. I referred to these previously. They are amendments which merely ensure that the AFP can use all of its existing powers to investigate the state offences with a federal aspect, as I referred to earlier. The bill, as introduced, provides for this in relation to Crimes Act powers but does not pick up some powers that are in the Australian Federal Police Act. These concern the use of listening devices—which hopefully later this year, with the passage of the Surveillance Devices Bill 2004, will be replaced by surveillance devices—and some residual constable powers. The amendments also clarify constitutional aspects of the proposal.</para><para>The complete integration of the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Protective Service is an important step in the government's efforts to protect Australians from terrorist attacks and to consolidate and enhance national security initiatives. This brings together two fine organisations which have been acting independently of each other previously. By bringing them together, we maximise resources, we increase efficiency and we also provide career paths for those involved in those two organisations which I believe hitherto were not there.</para><para>I want to place on record the government's appreciation of the great work the Australian Federal Police is doing and the great work that the Australian Protective Service is doing as well. What people might not realise is that the APS is responsible for the air security officer program, a crucial program involved in aviation security. People might not be realise that the APS is involved in the counter-terrorism first response at our major airports, and we have seen that increased from 240-odd personnel to 400 personnel. The APS is also involved in the protection of diplomatic posts, and of course that is an essential part of Australia's international obligations. Importantly, we have seen the APS overseas working side by side with the AFP. I saw the great work they were doing together in the Bali bombing investigation and under difficult circumstances.</para><para>The work of the Australian Federal Police is exceptional. I believe it has world's best practice in policing and is regarded internationally as one of the finest national police forces in the world today. Its range of obligations and duties flows from counter-terrorism at one end of the spectrum through to the investigation of domestic organised crime which involves all manner of criminal activity, be it drug trafficking, people-smuggling, sex trafficking, paedophilia or fraud—the Australian High Tech Crime Centre is an example of the fine work that the Australian Federal Police is doing in that regard—and it carried out magnificent work in relation to the investigation of the Bali bombing.</para><para>One of the most outstanding aspects of the Australian Federal Police is perhaps the recognition that it gets internationally and the fact that it is represented in more than 25 countries overseas. As a result of these relationships, it is able to gain intelligence in order to not only serve Australia's national interest but also interdict criminal activity which could result in the illegal importation of drugs and other prohibited imports into this country. The fine work that the Australian Federal Police has done in relation to the war on drugs is on record, and this is an issue which all Australians are concerned about. </para><para>I will finish by saying that recently the AFP was awarded recognition for work life diversity. Providing a family friendly and flexible work environment in a rapidly evolving organisation has won the Australian Federal Police the top prize in the national work and family awards of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Business Council of Australia. This gold award is the highest award for outstanding achievement in providing for the work life needs of employees, while the large business award recognises the most outstanding applicant with more than 500 employees. To win the large business award the AFP was selected from a strong field of over 70 private and public sector organisations and received the top prize from a field of the top 30 applicants. This recognises in particular the fine work done by the Australian Federal Police Commissioner, Mick Keelty, in not just addressing the workplace practices of the AFP but also going further and looking beyond the officer in the field to those aspects which support that officer such as home life and the pastoral care that is needed for the men and women of the Australian Federal Police and the APS. I commend the AFP and Commissioner Keelty for the attention that they have given to the personnel serving within those two organisations and long may it continue. I commend this bill to the Senate.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>23012</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill—by leave—taken as a whole.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>23012</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendments to be moved to this bill.

Listening device powers are an integral part of the Australian Federal Police's investigation powers and should be amended consistently with the amendments to the investigative powers contained in the Crimes Act. The existing restrictions on the types of offences for which listening device warrants are available will also apply to state offences with a federal aspect. Under the proposed amendments the AFP can only access a warrant for the use of listening devices when investigating a state offence with a federal aspect where that state offence also has the characteristics of one of the serious offences that falls within the existing definition of a class 1 general offence or a class 2 general offence. </para><para>The government amendments to section 9 of the Australian Federal Police Act, which prescribes the powers and duties of AFP officers, will ensure consistency with the existing amendment in the bill to section 8 of the Australian Federal Police Act, which prescribes the functions of the AFP. The bill amends section 8 to add the function of the investigation of state offences that have a federal aspect. The relevant government amendment to the bill will amend section 9 of the Australian Federal Police Act to clarify that an Australian Federal Police member has the powers and duties that are conferred or imposed on a constable or an officer of police in the place in which the member is acting when investigating state offences with a federal aspect.</para><para>The government amendments also include minor improvements to the definition of `state offence that has a federal aspect'. These amendments clarify that the conduct rather than the elements of an offence determine whether it is a state offence with a federal aspect. This definition of `state offence that has a federal aspect' will also be aimed at including a specific reference to the external affairs power. A state offence has a federal aspect if, assuming that the parliament of the Commonwealth had enacted a provision that created an offence penalising the specific acts or omissions involved in committing the state offence, that provision had been a valid law of the Commonwealth. A state offence is taken to be covered by this provision if it falls within one of the specified areas of Commonwealth constitutional power.</para><para>The government amendments include the addition of the external affairs powers, one of the specified areas of the Commonwealth's constitutional power. A state offence would be a state offence with a federal aspect where the conduct constituting the state offence is a matter in respect of which an international agreement to which Australia is a party imposes obligations to which effect could be given by the creation of an offence against the domestic laws of the parties to the agreement and is a matter that affects the relations between Australia and another country or countries or is otherwise a subject of international concern. The remaining amendments correct a discrepancy in terminology to ensure that a state offence that has a federal aspect includes an ACT offence that has a federal aspect. Schedule 3 of the bill as introduced provides that a state offence that has a federal aspect includes a Northern Territory offence but not an ACT offence. </para><para>These amendments follow on from others in relation to the leaders summit, as I stated earlier. They clarify aspects of it and improve on the operation of this ability of the Australian Federal Police to investigate a state offence which has a federal aspect, and I previously outlined an example which could be dealt with under these provisions. This has its genesis in the leaders summit of April 2002. That put forward, I believe, historic recommendations for law enforcement in this country so that our states and territories would not offer any haven for criminals operating in an organised fashion, especially across state and territory borders. It also provided for efficiencies such as this. It makes commonsense that the Australian Federal Police have this ability to investigate a state offence which has a federal aspect rather than calling in state police and having two policemen working on one matter which, really, one policeman could deal with quite easily. It has, of course, the support of the states and territories. I commend these amendments to the committee.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>23017</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As with the first amendments, the opposition fully supports these amendments. They concern, in part, some issues which are technical, and the majority appear to be addressing some drafting errors. There are two significant ones. Proposed amendment (22) would enable the Australian Federal Police to use the listening device powers in part II, division 2 of the Australian Federal Police Act when investigating state offences with a federal aspect. This is broadly consistent with the proposed provisions of the Surveillance Devices Bill, which is currently before a Senate committee. Labor has already indicated in the House its in principle support for the cross-jurisdictional character of that bill. Accordingly we support this amendment. Proposed amendments (6) to (22) also clarify when an Australian Federal Police member has the powers and duties conferred or imposed on a state constable or police officer when investigating state offences with a federal aspect. We see no apparent difficulty with this and are prepared to support these amendments as well. I will also take the opportunity to associate myself with the remarks by Senator Ellison praising the Australian Federal Police and Commissioner Keelty in their work, and also with Senator Greig's recognition of the Australian Federal Police awards.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>23017</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Again, we Democrats will be supporting the amendments for the reasons outlined by the minister.</para></talk.start><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>23017</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move Democrat amendment (1) on sheet 4210 circulated in the name of Senator Bartlett:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Schedule 1, page 24 (after line 11), after item 27, insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">27A After subsection 22(1)</inline></para><para>Insert:</para></quote><para>	(1A)	For the purposes of subsection (1), misbehaviour does not include the expression of an honestly held opinion by the Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner, if the Commissioner or Deputy Com-missioner believes that it is in the public interest to communicate that opinion, whether publicly or privately. </para><para>This amendment goes to the heart of what we might loosely call public interest commentary. What we are aiming to do here is target the recent uncomfortable political issue which rose between the Prime Minister and the commissioner. The amendment arises out of that incident involving Commissioner Keelty. What emerged from that scenario was that the government had seemingly exerted what we believe was inappropriate pressure on Mr Keelty regarding some comments he had made about terrorist risks during a television interview in which he was talking freely on a range of issues. In exerting that pressure on the commissioner, we believe that the government not only interfered with his independence but, arguably, abused its executive power.</para><para>To recap briefly on the circumstances of that situation, Mr Keelty was interviewed on the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday </inline>morning program on 14 March this year. During that interview he made some comments in relation to the tragic Madrid bombings. In particular Mr Keelty said the following:</para><quote><para>If this turns out to be Islamic extremists responsible for this bombing in Spain, it's more likely to be linked to the position that Spain and other allies took on issues such as Iraq.</para></quote><para>Shortly after that, the Prime Minister and some other government ministers publicly slammed Mr Keelty's remarks. The Prime Minister said it was too early to ascertain who or what was responsible for the bombings. He chided Mr Keelty by saying that Mr Keelty's responsibility was operational police matters and that the kind of analysis that he had offered did not come from within that area. Similarly, the Attorney-General labelled Mr Keelty's remarks as simplistic and inappropriate. By the Tuesday evening following Mr Keelty's original remarks, he had issued a statement which was described as clarifying his views. Mr Keelty said that his remarks had been taken out of context. Allegations then emerged that the Prime Minister's chief of staff had rung Mr Keelty shortly after the televising of that interview to rebuke him for making the comments. It was also alleged that the Prime Minister's office was directly involved in the drafting of Mr Keelty's statement of clarification.</para><para>We Democrats firmly believe that the police commissioner, whoever they might be, should have the freedom to express genuinely held views if it is in the public interest for those views to be expressed. In this case, the commissioner was making remarks regarding things that were directly relevant, we believe, to the risk of terrorism within the Australian community. If Spain had been put at a greater risk of terrorist attack because of its involvement in the Iraq war, then it was highly likely, and it remains highly likely, that Australia faces an increased risk of terrorism here too. Mr Keelty's opinion was consistent with opinions of terrorism experts at the time. It was clearly one of public interest and one for the Australian community to be made aware of at the time.</para><para>We believe it is vital to prevent any current or future government from abusing its executive power in that way. Certainly that is how we see it. Therefore, the effect of the amendment before us now would be to change the grounds upon which the police commissioner may be dismissed. The legislation currently provides that the commissioner may be dismissed for misbehaviour. That is appropriate. The Democrat amendment seeks to clarify that that misbehaviour does not and cannot include the expression of an honestly held opinion if the commissioner believes that it is in the public interest to communicate that opinion, whether publicly or privately. This will hopefully ensure that the government is not in a position to threaten, coerce or harass a police commissioner, with the possibility of being fired, if the commissioner believes it is in the public interest to speak out on an issue. I think that that is clear—certainly we aim for clarity in the amendment—and I think the argument is fair. I commend the amendment to the Senate. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>23019</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Labor will be supporting this amendment. Senator Greig highlighted some of the issues but I think the matter deserves ventilation in this chamber again. Australians will not easily forget the way Commissioner Keelty was harangued and treated by this government for simply expressing what could only be taken as an honestly held view of his about the increased threat to Australians resulting from Australia's participation in the war in Iraq. We now know that the government's bullying had a devastating effect on Mr Keelty and led the commissioner to wonder, as I understood it, whether he retained the confidence of the government or whether he should resign. Such an outcome would have been a major setback in the war against terrorism and it would have been entirely the responsibility of the Howard government.</para></talk.start><para>This decent police commissioner has devoted himself to fighting al-Qaeda. His reward for that effort was to be slandered by the foreign minister and accused of repeating al-Qaeda propaganda. He was subjected to a haranguing telephone call from the Prime Minister's puffed up chief of staff and the humiliation of, as we understand it, being asked to sign a retraction drafted for him by the government. Even after the statement was issued and senior ministers were falling over themselves to substitute flattery for slander, the Attorney-General went on Sunday television and delivered, in my view, the final insult by telling Commissioner Keelty to deliver his advice to government ears only in future. Australians were, I think, rightly upset by the government's disgraceful treatment of Commissioner Keelty and, like Labor, would no doubt welcome this amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>23019</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The comments we have heard from the opposition and the Democrats have no relevance to the amendment before the committee. Perhaps I might just instil some relevance into the debate in relation to what has been put here by the Democrats. This amendment deals with a provision in relation to the termination of the appointment of a commissioner or deputy commissioner. That provision allows for the termination, under certain circumstances, of the appointment of a commissioner or deputy commissioner by reason of misbehaviour or physical or mental incapacity. It is a reasonable provision. The Democrats are saying that this misbehaviour: </para></talk.start><quote><para>... does not include the expression of an honestly held opinion by the Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner, if the Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner believes that it is in the public interest to communicate that opinion, whether publicly or privately.</para></quote><para>Without dealing with the cheap political point that is being made here, or that they are attempting to make, let us look at this provision as it might work. That is what our job is in the committee stage in the Senate. What we have here is a proposal which would have as an exemption to misbehaviour a very subjective belief on the part of a person who would be making the comment. In the laws of the Commonwealth, there is no exception based on subjective belief alone. This is a remarkable departure from the laws of the Commonwealth with similar provisions.</para><para>What we would possibly have here is the situation where a commissioner or deputy commissioner could make a statement which was repugnant in some way. For example, it could be racist. Notwithstanding that, as long as that person held the belief honestly and believed that it was in the public interest to express it, that would not constitute misbehaviour. In many parts of the world we have seen people making statements which would be repugnant to the average, reasonable person. Those statements are made with an honest belief. They are held honestly, albeit in a very prejudiced way. They are also made on the basis that that person thinks they are in the public interest. </para><para>Police commissioners and deputy commissioners are human beings like the rest of us. Unfortunately, we have seen examples in Australia in the past—very few—where there have been people in these offices who have not been fit to hold them. We have seen statements made by people in authority overseas in similar positions which have not been acceptable to the community. If a police commissioner or deputy commissioner made a statement which was racist or showed prejudice and that person turned around and said, `I hold that view honestly and I believe it is in the public interest to do so,' that would be an exception to misbehaviour under the provisions of the act. It would be based purely subjectively—that is, you would look at the person themselves and see if that particular person held that view honestly and thought it was in the public interest. That not only is bad law, I submit, but it also opens the way for a potentially serious problem where a commissioner or deputy commissioner could make a statement of a view which they honestly held and made in what they believed to be the public interest but which was totally unacceptable to the Australian community, and you could do nothing because this exception would say that you have to judge it subjectively.</para><para>Let us deal with this amendment on the face of it. Let us deal with it on the effect that it might have. On that basis, the government opposes this amendment for those reasons. Bringing in recent events which have no relevance is really a political ploy—a political stunt. What we saw recently did not involve the termination of any appointment or an attempt to do that in relation to any misbehaviour as contained in section 22 of the legislation. What we have here in the Democrat amendment is a vehicle to try to make a political point—a vehicle which could produce problems which, I suggest, could be very serious indeed. I remind the Senate that dealing with the appointment and the termination of the appointment of a commissioner or deputy commissioner of police is a very serious matter indeed. It is not done lightly. Misbehaviour is grounds for termination of appointment, and everyone would think that that is appropriate.</para><para>Obviously if a commissioner of police or deputy commissioner of police were engaged in misbehaviour of a sort which required action, the community would expect the government of the day to take action. But to say that an exception to misbehaviour is based purely on a subjective belief by the person concerned—a subjective belief that it is (a) in the public interest and (b) held honestly—and to allow that without qualification is, I believe, a very dangerous situation. You could find yourself in a position where you might not be able to take action against a commissioner or deputy commissioner who had made a statement which the community found entirely unacceptable. Let us look at this on that basis and not on the basis of recent events which have no relevance to the proposed amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>23020</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will say two things in response to the minister's position. On the face of it, the minister seems to have a reasonable argument. But where it falls down in part, is, I believe, on these two points. Firstly, we are talking about a very senior public office holder—a police commissioner. We are not talking about the average Joe Blow in the street; we are talking about someone who is appointed by government. Therefore, any sincerely held personal views they may have are open to genuinely valid assessment of what they might be saying. </para></talk.start><para>The minister went on to say that the appointment of a police commissioner is an incredibly important and comprehensive thing and `not to be dealt with lightly'—I think they were the words he used. I agree. I would hope that, in the course of selecting and appointing a police commissioner, the government of the time would be aware—to follow the minister's analogy—of any racist views that might be held by that person. Again using that analogy, let us say for example that some police commissioner in the future, Commissioner Bloggs, expresses the sincerely held view that black people are a threat to society and there should be stronger Commonwealth laws to crack down on black people. The minister might argue that this amendment would facilitate that and protect that commissioner from dismissal on that basis. But no; that is not the case, because that person would also, invariably, be in breach of state and/or Commonwealth laws dealing with racial vilification and so their dismissal could still take place on those grounds.</para><para>So it is a question of not just what the views might be but also whether their expression is in the public interest. That is where the government has the retort and is still empowered to dismiss a commissioner lawfully: on the grounds of the views being sincerely held but not necessarily in the public interest. That is where the power for the appointment, protection and preservation of that particular employment remains. That is why the minister's argument, in my view, is false and why the premise behind what I am proposing here still holds.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>23021</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I need to respond to that aspect—that if a statement is so outrageous it will attract criminal sanction. That could well be true, but I remind the Senate that you could have a situation where the commissioner or deputy commissioner was charged over a statement which involved racial vilification and whilst that was pending you could not rely on that person because of the exception. If that charge were defended, it could go on for some time. In the meantime, you would have your deputy commissioner or commissioner in the job. I do not think relying on a conviction is an ideal situation, because there is misbehaviour which does not necessarily entail a conviction but which still requires the government to act to dismiss the police commissioner or deputy police commissioner.</para></talk.start><para>High standards are expected of the people who hold those offices. So to say that if the behaviour was so bad there would be a conviction anyway and you could rely on the conviction for termination of appointment is an inappropriate basis on which to advance this proposed amendment. One can envisage a range of misbehaviours which would not entail a criminal conviction but which could demand the termination of appointment. That really would be putting the cart before the horse. Certainly a conviction would be grounds for termination of appointment. But offensive statements could well be made which may not attract criminal sanction, and the person who made the statements could say, `Look, I honestly held the view and I believed it was in the public interest.' Remember, a person who is racially prejudiced can hold that belief honestly. An honest belief is one which you genuinely believe in. A dishonest belief is a belief you espouse but do not really believe in. You say `honest belief', but they can hold that view honestly—albeit a view that is repugnant to a vast majority of the community. To wait for a conviction before termination is inappropriate. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>23022</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do not want to deal with the distance we have covered in this debate in relation to that particular scenario.

We think that a very poor attack was made on Commissioner Keelty for expressing a view which the Australian public were entitled to hear.</para></talk.start><para>We have not heard from the minister how, if he disagrees with the Democrat amendment, he proposes to ensure that Commissioner Keelty can, without fear or favour, express a view which the public expect him to state in his role as the Australia Federal Police Commissioner. That is the germane point. I think the Democrats are trying to ensure that the commissioner can make his point. Without some legislative backing, Commissioner Keelty clearly had to consider whether or not his position was untenable. That is not appropriate, given the state we are now faced with in relation to the war on terror.</para><para>Labor think that the government needs to address the uncertainty that the flurry of activity around that issue raised, because it could happen again. The government has not indicated that it will not happen again, so clearly there is still potential for this circumstance to happen again. The government may have put press statements out after the fact saying that it would not happen again, but they did that after the damage had been done on the way through. Labor support the amendment because we are concerned—and I suspect the Democrats are too, although I cannot speak for them—to at least provide a clear basis on which the police commissioner can act so that he cannot be undermined in his invaluable role.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>23022</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I cannot let those statements go unchallenged. I have to say that the police commissioner's role has been an independent one and remains so. Knowing Commissioner Keelty as I do, I know that he is a fiercely independent person. He makes judgments according to what he thinks is best. That is the position and I reject the allegations made by the opposition and the Democrats. The Commissioner of the Federal Police will continue to be an independent police commissioner. If we are going to go down the path of people attacking the police commissioner, I can easily remind the Senate of comments made in this chamber in relation to the Federal Police and rather personal comments made in press releases issued by the opposition in relation to the Australian Federal Police Commissioner, Mr Keelty, and his evidence to a Senate committee hearing.

Under the member for Werriwa—the chameleon member for Werriwa, who changes his tune to suit the circumstances and whose budgetary record on the Liverpool City Council in Sydney gives further cause for alarm—Labor is running headlong back into the past. He has re-cemented the Labor Party's relationship with the ACTU—to the extent that it is often difficult to tell them apart. It is clear that both the ALP and the ACTU want to reimpose the closed shop and bring back the one size fits all style of union run workplace policy that Labor itself junked in the 1990s. In fact, neither the ALP nor the ACTU has any interest in small business, the area of the economy in which most Australians work. We know that Labor does not have anything to offer small business. Former leader Kim Beazley said so, publicly. He said that Labor had never pretended to be the party of small business. At least he was honest about it. Under its present leader no-one knows what Labor stands for in the most vital area of the economy—small business.</para></talk.start><para>Last night in the House of Representatives the Treasurer presented his ninth budget. It is a budget that responsibly adds to the support mechanisms available to Australians, emphasising family and the home. It responsibly outlays funds whose receipt by Australians will enable them to enhance the choices they make on how they run their lives. It is a budget that looks after our security, spends money on defence in a newly dangerous world, adds to the education and welfare infrastructure, and still provides a surplus. It does all of this in a global environment in which there are dangers, economic and otherwise, that make budgeting particularly difficult.</para><para>The Treasurer has been able to deliver this sensible ninth progression in our national economic fortunes because, among other things, the Howard-Costello government's business policies—particularly its small business policies—over the past eight years have been consistent, and consistently strong. With strong business policies comes strong economic growth, and with strong economic growth comes the realistic opportunity for a government like the Howard-Costello government to deliver—as it did last night—more help for families; income tax cuts; massive boosts in retirement savings; very significant increases in spending in the vital areas of health, education, national security, the bush, and road and rail infrastructure; and, significantly for small business, real reforms to the GST administrative processes which will reduce paperwork.</para><para>I want to say more about the budget at a later time. In this speech the matter of public interest to which I draw the attention of honourable senators is Labor's industrial relations policy. The advantages that have been enjoyed by small business under the Howard-Costello government for the last nine years—and the additional advantages announced in last night's budget—would be utterly negated by Latham's industrial relations policy. A Labor government that imposed on small business the outcomes that are predicated on its industrial relations policy would be a complete disaster for this country and for small business.</para><para>Labor has no answer when it is confronted on the fundamental issue of growing employment opportunities. It would prefer—presumably at the behest of its paymasters in the big unions—to send small business broke by imposing employment conditions on it that are not only unconscionable but also unfair and, frankly, quite stupid. It would make small business play the big business game—with all the attendant big business costs—in matters such as unfair dismissal actions. It would say that it was doing so because it wanted to be fair to the employees of small businesses. But it would be wrong. I believe that it knows it would be wrong; therefore, it knows that what it is trying to sell to the Australian voter is a lie. </para><para>In fact, what Australia needs to hear from the Labor Party is that it has some vision for our country's industrial relations future that does not rely for its inspiration on ideas that are fixed in the increasingly distant past. Labor should listen less to its old union mates and more to the voices of other industrial organisations—for example, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The ACCI is not a class enemy, after all. In the 21st century the notion of class enemies is not only derisory—and it was always derisory in Australia—but also, plainly, old hat.</para><para>Much has been made lately of the fact that union membership is creeping up again. Labor doubtless sees this as a vindication of its policy of reinventing the past. But it might just as easily be the result—and I know that honourable senators opposite will not admit this—of the positive employment policies that the Howard government has pursued with vigour and courage over the past eight years. I am here today to take some credit on behalf of the government for the increase in union membership that some of the good senators across the chamber boast about. The reason for that is that we have created more jobs—more people in employment—and, of course, some of those people have chosen to join a union.</para><para>Record job creation has put many more people into secure employment, in larger companies as well as in small businesses. But, even so, union membership in the private sector—and this is instrumental—is at a historic low. Our workplace legislation means that people can belong to a union if they wish to—we on this side of the chamber are not about compulsion as a matter of policy—and the fact is that the evidence shows that a large majority of employees see no point in joining a union. That is a problem for the union movement. It is one it could solve quite easily, if it could find the will to do so, by moving to become relevant in today's workplace. It is not necessarily a problem for the Labor Party—if you forget about the $40 million the unions have pumped into the ALP over the term of the Howard government. The Labor Party's problem is that it, too, must find a way to become industrially relevant.</para><para>In a paper produced after the Labor Party's national conference in January, the ACCI said some very interesting things. In particular—and I recommend that those opposite take particularly close note of this—it said:</para><quote><para>For business observers at the conference and for industry more generally, it is the policies of the Australian government and those of the Opposition that matter most. Whereas trade unions campaign for a change of Australian government to suit their political colours, commerce and industry want an Australian government of whatever political colour to embrace policies that are in the national interest and best for economic development and jobs.</para></quote><para>The ACCI is an independent, fair dinkum, unbiased organisation. The ACCI noted:</para><quote><para>An interesting measure of the Australian Labor Party's 2004 industrial relations platform is to compare it not just with federal Coalition government policy but with the industrial relations policy of the most recent federal Labor government, that of Paul Keating. Prime Minister Keating expressed the ALP policy vision in these terms in 1993:</para></quote><para>...	...	... </para><quote><para>“It is a model which places primary emphasis on bargaining at the workplace level within a framework of minimum standards provided by arbitral tribunals.</para><para>It is a model under which compulsorily arbitrated awards and arbitrated wage increases would be there only as a safety net.</para><para>The safety net would not be intended to prescribe the actual conditions of work of most employees, but only to catch those unable to make workplace agreements with employers.”</para></quote><para>Now isn't that interesting? What a difference of substance—I am talking about the structure envisaged, not the refinement of it or the difficult issue of delivering such an outcome—really exists between what Paul Keating described in 1993, 11 years ago, and what the Howard government has delivered in office since 1996. It may be that Paul Keating knew that he could never deliver what the country needed in terms of industrial relations. Judging from the performance of those opposite since they went into opposition in 1996, I would have to say that he probably knew that he would never deliver. He has form for non-delivery, after all. We all remember the l-a-w tax cut that turned out to be an l-i-e. Nonetheless, a policy of workplace bargaining within a framework of minimum standards and a regime not intended to prescribe the actual working conditions of most employees were Labor Party policy in 1993. That simply cannot be denied.</para><para>Mr Keating was able to enunciate that policy without the sky falling in or the earth reversing its orbit around the sun. I would like to think that the light on the hill may even have flickered more brightly—just for a moment, before it returned to the glum glow that is its usual state—at this evidence of forward thinking and the faint hope that somewhere in the leadership of the post-socialism Labor Party there existed some grasp of the fact that forward momentum is essential for real progress, particularly industrial progress. That was, as the ACCI says in its post Labor Party conference paper, a visionary position. The ACCI gives credit where credit is due. It headlines its paper `ALP should match Keating vision on industrial relations reform'. There is a great opportunity for the Labor Party here—a genuine opportunity to go back to the past. It only needs to go back 11 years to rediscover commonsense and positive policy.</para><para>The 2004 Labor platform, the one dictated from ACTU House—like the earlier 2000 platform of a similar provenance—talks of `comprehensive, contemporary and relevant awards', of `giving a greater role to the independent Industrial Commission' and of `increases in wages and conditions through the award system and industry based arrangements' and promises only to lead to new or additional regulation. In short, it is not a roadmap to the future—a future in which more and more Australians have more and better choices and greater freedoms. It is a signpost to the past—a past where everyone made do with the one-size-fits-all arrangements that suited union bureaucrats, workshop enforcers and enterprise-numbing restrictive practices. This is what the Labor Party proposes to foist on Australia if it is elected to government. This is the Latham plan for modernising our country—to clamp it back in a union mandated straitjacket. It is simply madness.</para><para>The national unemployment rate is 5.6 per cent seasonally adjusted—the lowest in 22 years. Long-term unemployment is the lowest in 13 years. As the ACCI points out in its excellent paper—I recommend it is closely studied by those opposite—unemployment has been reduced through a combination of economic growth and labour market reform, including changes to industrial relations policies and practices. It says that a freeze or, worse still, a regression on labour market and industrial relations reform would put these outcomes at risk. </para><para>For small business, undoing the reforms of the past eight years—incomplete though they may be because the Labor Party will not recognise reality and prefers politicking to policy making—would be an absolute disaster. The Labor Party would make small business liable to the ruinous costs of big business's unfair dismissal rules and make every enterprise the object of union rights of entry. Perhaps nothing better describes the Labor Party's complete inability to understand small business than those two facts.</para><para>The Howard government has the runs on the board. The people of Australia are the beneficiaries of greater industrial flexibility and greater employment opportunity. In the face of this benefit—in the face of consistently lower inflation, higher productivity, higher real wages, lower interest rates, fewer disputes and strikes, record employment and lower unemployment—Labor wants to re-regulate employment. Its platform expresses support for the goals of economic development, competitiveness and productivity. It commits to `full employment' and `an unemployment rate sustainably below five per cent'. Yet it proposes to regulate wages and employment conditions by a collective system and to abolish all statutory individual agreements, including Australian workplace agreements, that form the legal basis of the wage and employment conditions of 455,000 Australians and 7,600 businesses. That is not only stupid—it is also unfair. It shows that Labor in 2004, under Mark Latham, is interested not in freedom of choice or expanding opportunity but only in giving back to big union power its former right to call the tune. It shows that Labor in 2004 is no option for Australia or its enterprising employees and employers, particularly small businesses, which are the engine of growth in our economy. They are genuinely concerned about the employees that they have taken on, unlike those opposite here in the Senate and in the other place.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Rural and Regional Australia: Health Services</title><page.no>23026</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>23026</page.no><name role="metadata">Stephens, Sen Ursula</name><name role="display">Senator STEPHENS</name><name.id>00AOS</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I begin by advising the Senate that today is International Nurses Day. I ask and encourage all honourable senators to acknowledge the important contribution to Australia's health system that nurses make. They certainly belong to a dedicated and undervalued profession and need to be supported and appreciated by us all. Today I rise to speak on a matter of public interest and that is the provision of rural and remote health services in Australia. I draw the Senate's attention to two important recent government publications. The first is a document entitled <inline font-style="italic">Connecting government</inline>, released by the Management Advisory Committee, and the second is the report of the National Audit Office performance audit of the Department of Health and Ageing's management of the Multipurpose Services Program and the Regional Health Services Program.</para></talk.start><para>Over six million Australians—that is, 34 per cent of the total population—lived in rural or remote areas in 2001. That is a significant proportion of the population. Typically, the health of those people is worse than that of people living in metropolitan areas. For example, life expectancy is higher in metropolitan areas and death rates increase with remoteness. You may not know this, but they are 10 per cent higher in regional and remote areas compared with major cities and 50 per cent higher in very remote areas. Rates of hospitalisation are also higher for remote Australians compared to those living in capital cities. As we have heard from all the Medicare committee inquiry consultations, the rate of general practitioner consultations is also lower. In general, health workers and pharmacists are underrepresented in rural and remote areas. Therefore, access to health services is likely to be much more limited for people living in rural and remote areas compared to people living in major cities. Additional contributors to poor health and higher mortality in rural and remote areas include lower socioeconomic status, higher risk of injury as a result of the types of work and conditions experienced, lower quality roads, Indigenous health needs, physical inactivity, overweight and obesity, smoking, hazardous or harmful alcohol consumption and poor diet. That is a long litany of contributors. </para><para>The purpose of my contribution to today's debate is to focus on the Multipurpose Services Program and the work that multipurpose service centres provide in rural and regional Australia. Health services in Australia are provided by a combination of public, private and not-for-profit organisations. State governments, partly funded by the Commonwealth through Australian health care agreements, are responsible for the provision of health services through the public hospital system. The Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing is responsible for implementing the Australian government's rural health policies and priorities.</para><para>The Multipurpose Services Program, which was the subject of the recent audit, is a joint program between the Commonwealth and state governments. It aims to provide a flexible and integrated approach to the delivery of health and aged care services to small rural communities, so it is a very important program for rural and regional Australia. The services provided by multipurpose services vary, but they can include residential aged care, acute care, community and allied health, rehabilitation and health education. The Commonwealth funds the aged care portion of MPS and the state government funds the other identified health needs. The Commonwealth is the minority funder of the program, providing around $45 million a year. Commonwealth funding of an individual MPS is contingent on the commitment of the relevant state government to providing the recurrent funding and the capital funding where necessary. The total Commonwealth and state government funding to the 86 MPS operational last August amounted to almost $188 million a year, which is a significant proportion of the health budget.</para><para>The Regional Health Services Program, which was the second program in the National Audit Office performance audit, is a Commonwealth program that helps small communities expand their local primary health care services. Services provided by a regional health service may include allied health care, health promotion and prevention and general practitioner services. The Commonwealth funded 152 regional health services as at 31 August 2003.</para><para>The objective of the audit of the National Audit Office was to assess the effectiveness of the Department of Health and Ageing's management of both the MPS Program and the Regional Health Services Program. Generally, the ANAO found that there was effective management and that the performance indicators developed for the two programs were consistent with the programs' objectives. But the ANAO raised some very specific concerns that I want to put before you today. First of all, the ANAO found that Health staff do not have confidence in the integrity of the data held by the central rural health database, and this is a very significant finding. In fact, it was found that Health staff have independently developed effective systems to monitor services that shadow the centrally developed rural health database and that that has led, of course, to inconsistencies between the data held in the database and that held by the state offices. Those data inconsistencies combined with the limited access to the database have meant that the database does not meet the needs of state office staff, so the department of health's central office staff do not have confidence in the integrity of the data held by the database. </para><para>Significantly again, the ANAO found that the performance information is not being used effectively, that the data on individual services is not collated or analysed systematically and that Health is not using service performance data to identify good practice or potential improvements to the programs. In addition, Health does not have baseline information on health service provision or health outcomes and consequently is not able to measure the progress of the two programs against their respective objectives. That hardly seems to be good enough.</para><para>A third finding, and another concern, of ANAO was that Health has developed a risk management plan for the Regional Health Services Program but not for the MPS Program. There is no risk management plan for the MPS Program as a whole. That, again, is of concern to us all. The ANAO found that there is a systematic approach to identifying MPS sites and that once these are identified they are assessed against the selection criteria, which is consistent with the program's objectives and ensures that MPS are placed in communities most significantly in need of what is a very flexible model. The ANAO found that the principle of that flexible, pooled funding that forms the basis of an MPS funding model is also consistent with the objectives of the MPS Program. That is an important point that I want to come back to.</para><para>The ANAO found that one-third of the MPS are operating with extended funding agreements, with almost half of the extended agreements originally expiring in or before 2001. Therefore, MPS are operating with agreements that may be implementing service delivery plans that are not current or relevant to current community needs. The ANAO expressed concern that targets included in the MPS funding agreements—which of course are bed numbers and budget figures—are input measures that guide funding levels but are certainly not adequate measures of outputs or outcomes. In addition, the bed numbers are only indicative. Applying the principle of flexible funding, funding provided to MPS may be used to provide any appropriate aged care services. Therefore, as bed numbers are not an accurate description of the actual services provided, they are not a useful target. It was found that the financial controls and management of the MPS were sound but that the department of health's knowledge of state government contributions to the MPS Program was limited. However, the ANAO noted that the Commonwealth and state governments have recently agreed to change the reporting arrangements. This, again, is an important point that I will come back to.</para><para>Significant for rural Australia is the fact that the ANAO found that Health has identified a significant financial issue in the level of underspent RHSP funds. Funding was increased by 9.6 per cent in the last budget but $6.6 million was not spent by the Regional Health Services Program during this two-year period, which really is not good enough for small rural and regional communities where health services are stretched to the limit. The ANAO found that Health has not identified or systematically analysed the reasons why rural health services are not using available Commonwealth funds.</para><para>I will now move to the second report, <inline font-style="italic">Connecting government: whole of government responses to Australia's priority </inline><inline font-style="italic">challenges</inline><inline font-style="italic">.</inline> I am not sure whether you have heard of this report, but it is a very significant document that was released only a few weeks ago by the Management Advisory Committee. It is an important document as much for what it does not say as it is for the approach to service delivery and decision making it promotes. The document promotes whole-of-government thinking and action and it provides case studies of how this is happening at the Commonwealth level. Dr Shergold, Chair of MAC, launched the report. He said:  </para><quote><para>Australians rightly demand the delivery of government programs and services in a seamless way. That is what they see and, to a significant extent, that is what Centrelink delivers.</para></quote><para>Centrelink was one of the case studies. He continued:</para><quote><para>They should also expect that, behind the scenes, all the resources of government will be coordinated in the search for innovative solutions to complex policy.</para></quote><para>He went on to say:</para><quote><para>Good policy will always be undermined by poor implementation. Bad policy will always result if it is not informed by the operational experience of those who deliver programs and services at the front desk, in the call centre or by contract management. The problem of structural demarcations exist at least as much within departments as between them. That is why, too often, program managers in Canberra believe that their regional staff are insufficiently aware of the environment of political contest in which they operate and why, conversely, regional staff are inclined to the view that the national office is unable to comprehend the challenges they face implementing policy on the ground.</para></quote><para>He then went on to say:</para><quote><para>A whole-of-government approach also requires knowledge of how a policy is likely to be perceived by those who are to be affected by it. It is entirely appropriate that a public servant facilitate discussion with those bodies who seek to represent, advocate or lobby for interest groups.</para><para>In a real sense citizens are stakeholders in the making of public policy.</para></quote><para>There are some important lessons in both these publications. The ANAO report suggests that guidelines for the MPS Program are effective but that guidelines for the Regional Health Services Program are inadequate. The Regional Health Services Program state office guidelines were developed in the first year of the program but were found not to assist Health staff with program management, to be out of date and to contain inaccuracies. So, in fact, those kinds of guidelines were not being used by staff. On the one hand we have the Multipurpose Services Program, an innovative and responsive model for the hard decisions about service delivery in the regions, which needs whole-of-government thinking—and that was not demonstrated in the ANAO report. On the other hand we have the <inline font-style="italic">Connecting government </inline>document promoting whole-of-government practice, which needs to be translated into genuine action on the ground in the regions in a much more proactive way than is currently the norm.</para><para>The MPS Program and the Regional Health Services Program are a small but significant response to the challenge of service delivery to regional Australia. The programs rely heavily on good relations between the Commonwealth and state governments and on a genuine partnership approach with communities, which depends on those communities being supported in making some difficult choices about their health service mix. As I said before, the pooled funding model used in the MPS Program is a very good model for dealing with those challenges, but we do need to ensure that we have connected government, a whole-of-government approach and departments working together to deliver those outcomes for regional Australia.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Budget 2004-05</title><page.no>23030</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>23030</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tomorrow night, as is traditional for the Leader of the Australian Democrats, I will be giving a full response on behalf of the Australian Democrats to the government's budget proposals that were tabled in this chamber and in the other place last night. But I want to outline now our responses to some of the core components of the budget and, indeed, go to a core lesson and a core message that can be taken from this government's behaviour in just the last 24 hours with respect to the budget and the situation in Iraq. In just the last 24 hours I believe this government has demonstrated once and for all that any notion that it is strong and responsible on economic management or that it is strong on national security has clearly gone out the window. Any suggestion that it is a careful manager of money or that it will spend it appropriately in the public interest has gone out the window. This highlights again the importance of the Senate in trying to ensure that public money is spent responsibly and effectively, not just stashed away to the side for a tidal wave of pre-election spending every three years. </para></talk.start><para>The budget is dishonest because it is not economically responsible, and the Senate must more clearly acknowledge and take credit for its role in ensuring that the economic fundamentals of this country are much stronger than they would otherwise be. The Senate must continue to try to ensure that the public expenditure passed by this parliament is as economically responsible as possible. That is why we must scrutinise this budget's spending measures, particularly the huge amounts of largesse being dished out on an election eve. This government has long tried to argue that it is the only one that is economically responsible. This budget, nonetheless, as many economic commentators have said, runs the real risk of increasing interest rates by putting $4.2 billion extra cash into the economy before 30 June, with another $8.2 billion to come in a tidal wave next year. Household debt, as the budget papers show, is now 150 per cent of household income. In 1996 household debt was only 75 per cent of household income. It has doubled in the life of this government. In the early eighties it was only 40 per cent.</para><para>The last thing that Australia needs is the risk of another interest rate increase. We probably will not get it before the election, particularly if this government rushes to the polls, but that will not stop Australia facing the consequences after the polls. That will particularly be the case if the Labor Party's response is to pass all this spending and then to promise some extra spending to fill in the gaps for those people who missed out. The massive increase in household debt and the fact that the government has so much money is of course in part due to the housing boom that has fuelled housing unaffordability. Measures such as tax breaks for high-income earners—which they already get through negative gearing, through the capital gains tax discounts and through building allowances—have fuelled the investor driven housing bubble. It has failed our health and education system but is actually saving nothing for the looming intergenerational crisis. It is putting the economy at risk by putting in such a tidal wave of money leading up to an election.</para><para>The government are also dishonest in saying that they are strongest on making Australia safer. There is the intelligence money, for example. The Democrats welcome that. We have repeatedly said that we welcome more resources for the intelligence community, but clearly there is a cloud over the effectiveness of the operations of our intelligence agencies. I know we are very careful about acknowledging our sources these days, so I acknowledge <inline font-style="italic">The Chaser </inline>magazine as the source of this appropriate headline: `Mr Howard doubles ASIO budget, demands twice as much faulty intelligence.' There is no point putting extra money into intelligence agencies when there is clearly a need to ensure they work more effectively first.  </para><para>Similarly, there is continuing evidence about significant wastage and gross overspending in defence purchases. Not enough is being done to address that. It is one thing to say you are putting extra money in, but unless those areas are working properly you are putting good money after bad. That is more economic mismanagement and it does nothing to make Australia safer. We are continuing to waste defence money on patrolling Australia's oceans to keep out refugees and asylum seekers. We are continuing to waste money on mandatory detention and the Pacific solution. All of that does nothing to make Australia safer; it misdirects the energies of the defence community. </para><para>The budget is dishonest because it has not properly addressed the long-term structural needs of families. It might address the short-term electoral needs of the government—we shall see. What we need is responsible expenditure of money that actually addresses problems in a sustainable, ongoing way, not in a short-term, lump sum handout way. The short-term, cynical funding in the budget encourages people to go forth and multiply; it does not consider the ongoing needs of the average Australian family and must be condemned. Again, it is dishonest. The vote-buying lump sum family benefit payments are not going to bring the 700,000 children and their families out of poverty. Any extra money is obviously welcome, but to spend it in such a one-off irrational way is clearly not the best use of public money. </para><para>There are no real incentives to address unemployment and underemployment, which is around 13 per cent, other than this extraordinary exhortation from the Treasurer to work more overtime to reach the higher tax brackets and benefit from the government's absurd tax cuts. At a time when we are supposedly trying to fix the balance between work and family, the Treasurer is saying that low-income earners can benefit from this by just working more overtime. The fact is that over one million Australians are living in poverty, despite living in a household where one or more adults are in employment. The tax cuts will do absolutely zero for those people. </para><para>The overwhelming conclusion of most submissions to the recent Senate committee inquiry into poverty and financial hardship is that this government should offer a hand up and not a handout to those living in poverty—something you would think the conservatives would support, but this budget has failed to do that. The government is dishonest in talking about these tax cuts as being aimed at middle-income Australians. Mr Howard talks repeatedly about middle-income Australians. He says, as he did again this morning, that hardworking middle-income Australians need an incentive. I do not begrudge extra tax assistance for middle-income Australians; I just wish they were actually getting some. Frankly, I do not begrudge extra income tax assistance for people earning higher amounts, but the suggestion that high-income earners need tax cuts as an incentive to work harder but low-income earners do not get tax cuts as an incentive for them to work harder is grossly offensive and again dishonest. </para><para>The statistics clearly show that these tax cuts will help less than a quarter of taxpayers—around 2 million people who have taxable incomes over $52,000. That is not in the `middle' in anybody's language. I am not saying that people on an income of $52,000 do not deserve some extra assistance, that they could not benefit from it, that it is a huge income or that they are rich. Let us not see more dishonesty from the government by misrepresenting what the Democrats are saying here. The fact remains that the vast majority of Australians are below the so-called middle level of $52,000 a year that the government has highlighted. The suggestion that people earning $60,000 or $70,000 a year—as the Prime Minister is saying—are middle-income earners is simply not correct. That does not mean that they cannot do with some assistance but, from the Democrats' point of view, it certainly means that people who earn less than that will miss out on assistance.  </para><para>Unlike the Greens, the Democrats do not say that noone should get an income tax cut. We recognise, as was quite clear in the Senate inquiry into poverty, that tax relief for low- and middle-income earners in particular is a very important way of helping people out of poverty. The Democrats have repeatedly said that in the lead-up to this budget. People who are on middle- and low-incomes actually pay the highest effective marginal tax rates—higher than people in the top tax brackets. So of course they should get some income tax relief; the fact is that they are not getting any. The Greens do not want to give them any; they do not want anybody to have income tax cuts. The Democrats say that it is fine if we are going to have income tax cuts but that they should be shared more fairly. If we are going to spend that amount of money—and it is an enormous amount of money; bigger than we should have, in our view—then any form of income tax relief should be spread fairly. The government's continued insistence that this is a fair budget is again dishonest. </para><para>One of the most frustrating aspects is that the opportunity to improve this budget—which is the Senate's responsibility, as it has always been—is apparently going to be lost because the Labor Party appear to have chosen to vacate the field and allow all this through. That is despite statements by Mr Latham saying that this budget is deeply flawed and unfair. Well, that bit is honest, but their response is still to let it through. The problem is that there is no rewind button on legislation: once it is passed, it is through. If it is deeply flawed and unfair and it is passed, then it is locked in as deeply flawed and unfair.</para><para>It is important to emphasise that that would not be the first time. For all the talk about Mr Latham taking a new approach compared with the small target approach of Labor in the past, I think it is worth revisiting Labor's record under Mr Beazley, for example. I draw the attention of the Senate to an article written by Margo Kingston in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> nearly five years ago now, on 27 November 1999, in which she pointed to the occasion when the Labor Party, the party of labour, agreed to capital gains tax changes which `overwhelmingly benefited the wealthy and dramatically disadvantaged small business compared with big shareholders'. Mr Latham was actually quoted in that article as saying, `Under this government, the more you earn the bigger proportion of your earnings you receive in a tax cut. It's a multibillion dollar free kick for the rich.'</para><para>Using Mr Latham's language, it was a multibillion dollar free kick for the rich that Labor passed five years ago because Mr Beazley wanted to vacate the field and focus solely on the area on which he wanted to fight the election. It appears we will have that same thing happen again. People are elected to the Senate to actually do the job here. You cannot do the job in the Senate for two years out of three and then say in the third year, `There's an election coming up so we'll just let all the bad stuff through and let people make another choice at the election.' There is a reason why the Senate has fixed terms that are not cut to the election cycle—that is, so that we can continue to assess legislation as it is put before us in terms of the best needs of the Australian people, not the best needs of the Prime Minister's election timetable. It is very important that we get the opportunity to address some of these flaws. </para><para>As this government has to acknowledge, when it is not engaged in political rhetoric, the Democrats have shown that we will be constructive and responsible in the Senate. Over the last month leading up to the budget we put forward a range of proposals. We repeatedly said that funding should go to services first, and I believe the majority of the community want that. This budget has failed in that regard. It has not put the extra money into housing, health, education or the environment, where it is clearly needed. We also said that, if there were income tax cuts—and we all knew that was going to happen in a pre-election environment—they should be shared fairly. Clearly that has not happened. These are government proposals. They are not government imprimaturs from on high that must be forced through without change. All parties in the Senate have at times voted to amend or reject income tax and other tax changes; there is nothing special about these tax changes that says they must be pushed through just because there is an election around the corner. Indeed I would argue that the fact that there is an election around the corner makes it all the more important to properly scrutinise them rather than allow them to be rushed through.</para><para>The family payment changes, as welcome as they are, maintain the dishonesty of saying that they meet the needs of working mothers, because they do not put in place a legislative entitlement to paid maternity leave. Australia's working women should have an automatic entitlement to take leave to have a child, in the same way that they have an entitlement to sick leave, holiday leave and other leave. We have still fallen short of that and, whilst it does provide welcome extra assistance, to suggest that this package meets even the basic needs of something as important as maternity leave is dishonest. </para><para>So there is a lot that needs to be scrutinised. Let me remind the Senate and the public that there are only nine Senate sitting days before the end of June. If we have an election in August, that is all the time we have in which to pass all this legislation that the government wants to rush through, let alone everything else it has backed up. That is bad governance and bad policy, and it is something the Democrats do not believe the Senate should be a part of. It would be dishonest of us to say that we will run for the election and be a part of the Senate if we do not then do our job properly. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Western Australia: Labor Government</title><page.no>23033</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>23033</page.no><name role="metadata">Johnston, Sen David</name><name role="display">Senator JOHNSTON</name><name.id>00AON</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Honesty and integrity have taken flight from the Western Australian branch of the Australian Labor Party. One of the first things the new Labor government in Western Australia did in 2001 was to let the Attorney-General, Jim McGinty, continue his obsession with changing the state's electoral laws to disenfranchise voters in regional Western Australia. Mr McGinty took his fight to the High Court of Australia, at taxpayers' expense. This was his second attack to get to the High Court, having twice previously failed in the state Supreme Court. Once again his argument was thrown out.</para></talk.start><para>McGinty, the first law officer in Western Australia, proclaimed his assault to be in the name of electoral fairness—one vote, one value. Hypocrisy and deception run all the way to the top in the Labor Party government in Western Australia. Mr McGinty is one of the principal beneficiaries of an internal vote-rigging scandal currently unfolding in Western Australia. The aggravating fact is that this rorting and corruption have been alive and well inside WA Labor for more than five years. Indeed, many Western Australian Labor members and senators in both the federal and state parliaments owe their positions to the flawed and corrupt internal voting processes inside their state Labor Party. </para><para>Labor in WA is a party dominated by factional war lords, usually union heavyweights, who will stop at nothing in their relentless pursuit of power and privilege. These war lords meet deep in the bowels of Curtin House to divvy up the spoils of preselections and party leadership positions according to who has the most votes on the state executive, all based on the number of members belonging to a specific union or branch. Put simply: the more members in a union or branch, the more votes on preselections. So much for one equal vote to each member of the Labor Party within Labor Party voting processes. It is a textbook definition of hypocrisy and is light-years away from any fair notion of one vote, one value. Where is Mr McGinty's obsessive zealotry for electoral reform when it comes to reform of his own house and his own party? He should resign. He is obviously a person unsuitable to be in charge of the administration of justice in Western Australia.</para><para>This factional warfare had its historical genesis in October 1999, when a deal was done between the ALP factional heavyweights around Perth to create two new alliances. Unions associated with the far Left, and controlled by de facto premier, Jim McGinty, formed an alliance with current state Labor president, Michelle Roberts, and the federal member for Perth and shadow immigration spokesman, Stephen Smith, in a grouping that is now known as the New Right. The New Right does not have a large union base, but relies overwhelmingly on branch memberships—the bigger the branches, the bigger its influence, and I will say more about this later. This Left and New Right grouping has become the dominant faction within the Labor Party in Western Australia, guaranteeing its hack members all the spoils of power in terms of party positions and winnable seat preselections.</para><para>The losing factions from this alliance were those associated with former Labor Premier Brian Burke, of the Right, and the Centre Left, headed up by CFMEU chief, Kevin Reynolds. Things came to a head when Brian Burke wanted a senior public servant, Darryl Wookey, to be preselected for Ballajura at the last state election. The problem was that the federal member for Perth, Stephen Smith, had promised the seat to his close friend and former campaign manager, the Mayor of Bayswater, John D'Orazio. So came the great split of the Right, enabling the ambitious Michelle Roberts to take the party presidency and the despotic Mr McGinty to take control of Labor Party affairs in Western Australia.</para><para>Premier Gallop, who was the state Labor opposition leader at the time, harboured paranoia over the power and influence of Burke and Reynolds in the party and supported D'Orazio. It became a show of strength and Gallop, supported by McGinty and Roberts, won. D'Orazio was duly elected at the 2001 state election and is now chair of the powerful Public Accounts Committee within state parliament. What Gallop unwittingly did was create a monster. The short-term gain in defeating Burke and Reynolds conversely empowered McGinty and Roberts who, with Smith, now control every aspect of the Labor Party in Western Australia. As a further consequence, state cabinet is now dominated by factional hacks dictated to by McGinty, Roberts and Smith.</para><para>Prior to the last state election much commentary came from all quarters on just how unfair and undemocratic the Labor Party in Western Australia was in handling its own preselection issues. An article on former Keating minister Gary Johns was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin </inline>on 18 April 2000, which said: </para><quote><para>Johns has spent three years researching a PhD on preselection procedures. His research reinforced the view that Western Australia's Labor Party had the most “crooked” preselection of any ALP branch. “Local branch members have no say in preselection, there is no sense of democracy in WA—it [has] the most overwhelmingly union-dominated preselection rules. Branch members are irrelevant—it is whatever the main union characters at the time think.</para></quote><para>Vote rigging has been endemic inside Labor in Western Australia for more than four years now and has only lately been understood by the media. The first hint of the magnitude of this scandal was during a parliamentary debate on ministerial standards and codes of conduct on 22 November 2000. The then coalition state government minister for planning, Graham Kierath, revealed that the current minister for consumer affairs, John Kobelke, had been caught red-handed in vote rigging. He was dobbed in by a Labor Party member who had had enough of the lies, deception and large-scale vote rigging that was the modus operandi of powerbrokers inside WA Labor. In the state parliament, Minister Kierath said:</para><quote><para>I have a photocopy of a calling card from John Kobelke, the member for Nollamara. On the back is a hand-written note which states—</para></quote><para>John payed for your membership to his branch the Balga-Nollamara Branch only to find you were a member of the Girrawheen Branch. Please sign the enclosed form, and you will then be transferred to our branch. </para><para>Thank you</para><para>Ann Roberts—</para><para>the electorate officer of Kobelke. The quote goes on:</para><quote><para>The Leader of the Opposition—</para></quote><para>as Mr Gallop then was—</para><quote><para>intended to clean up the pre-selection process of the Labor Party, and now we find the member for Nollamara paying for other people's branch memberships, in contravention of his own new constitution, which was designed to clean up the Labor Party.</para></quote><para>Kobelke responded the next day, saying that this was an isolated case and he was only helping out an old pensioner. This explanation was not true. This was in November 2000, nearly five months after 30 June when the membership was renewed. The person who signed the note on his behalf was not only the membership officer for the branch but also his electorate officer.</para><para>Minister Kobelke had been caught red-handed and, unbelievably, his disingenuous explanation was swallowed whole by both his party leadership and the media. The pensioner involved actually came into the then office of the Premier and cabinet and handed over the calling card from Minister Kobelke to one of the Premier's advisers. He told the adviser that he had not been a member of the Labor Party for years and was disgusted to find out that his name was being used for blatantly corrupt political purposes.</para><para>The second event signifying the extent of WA Labor's vote-rigging rorts was revealed by senior investigative journalist Tony Wright in an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> on 16 January 2001. In this episode, two members of staff in the office of the Labor member for Swan were found to have rorted the parliamentary travel allowance scheme to the tune of $9,000. Why would they do this? What was the motive? Who was the beneficiary? The answers are simple—factional powerbrokers and the chance to boost the membership of the branches in the electorate of Swan. The two staff members in the member for Swan's office were foot soldiers of the emerging New Right faction, jointly headed up by the now shadow minister for immigration, Mr Smith, and ALP President, Michelle Roberts. </para><para>Simple mathematics tells you that $9,000 goes a long way to paying the party membership fees of a lot of people. In his <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> article, Tony Wright said:</para><quote><para>Rumours circulating widely within the ALP have it that some of these memberships are in the names of “ghosts”—people who are dead, who don't exist or who have been signed up without their knowledge. </para><para>However, senior insiders who have spoken to the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> are more inclined to believe that if there are indeed ghosts on the books, they are likely to be people who joined the ALP years ago, who had allowed their memberships to lapse and, without their knowledge, have had their annual membership fees paid. In this way, there would be no unusual jump in membership numbers—they would appear to remain stable, even though some former members might have moved away, or thought they had quit the party, or had even died. A sum of $9,000 is enough to pay for several hundred memberships. One long-time ALP figure put it simply: “The more branch members you have on the books, the more influence you have in the party.”</para></quote><para>The upshot of this is that the two staffers had established in the member for Swan's office a de facto headquarters of the shadow minister for immigration's New Right faction, with membership numbers in the branches totalling around 1,200. All of a sudden the New Right had some factional muscle, courtesy of the blatant vote-rigging subterfuge within the office of the member for Swan.</para><para>An internal review by the Labor Party—doesn't that sound familiar!—cleared the member for Swan. Surprise, surprise. However, the review was not so kind to the loyal factional staffers. Both were given their marching orders. The third person employed in the office, a member of the Left who actually blew the whistle on the other two by copying their personal computer files, remained—protected, no doubt, by factional allegiance. Four years later, Western Australians now know that these examples were not isolated cases of vote rigging—they have been entrenched and endemic throughout Labor Party processes in Western Australia for years and years.</para><para>It has recently been revealed—and admitted by the member for the state seat of Ballajura, John D'Orazio—that he and his brother have been involved in vote-rigging scams for a number of years. Respected investigative journalist Paul Murray reported on the extent of vote rigging by the D'Orazio clan in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline>on Saturday, 3 April. He said:</para><quote><para>I'd been alerted to a secret investigation being held by the secretary of the Labor Party, Bill Johnston, into allegations of branch stacking in the Cowan electorate council, particularly in the branches affecting the State seat of Ballajura, held by John D'Orazio.</para><para>I'd been told to pay attention to people who had been signed up who lived outside Ballajura.

The extent and seriousness of this corruption has not had the spotlight from anybody on my side of politics. The whistleblower is a member of the old Right faction, headed by former Premier, Brian Burke. On 7 April in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline>, Tim Clarke reported: </para><quote><para>Senator Bishop claimed two unions—the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union ... and the AMWU—inflated their membership figures.</para><para>He said the votes altered the balance of power in a series of contests, including preselection for a Legislative Assembly seat, and also helped install Police Minister Michelle Roberts as party President.</para></quote><para>Documents evidencing these grubby matters have been forwarded to the Police Commissioner and the WA corruption commission for investigation.</para><para>On radio 6PR on 7 April this year, the Police Commissioner said that fraud allegations indicated a criminal offence.

In WA we are now confronted with the possibility of the Police Commissioner investigating, or worse, his minister. If the WA Premier has any regard for notions of good government, he should at least stand her aside until the inquiry is completed and the Police Commissioner delivers his verdict on what charges should be laid, if any, and against whom.</para><para>A recent secret internal review of Labor branch stacking conducted by State Secretary Bill Johnston produced an adverse result for police minister Michelle Roberts and shadow minister for immigration, Stephen Smith. The New Right faction has been found to be responsible for blatant branch stacking and vote rorting in Labor Party branches over a number of years. It has been revealed that more than 30 per cent of ALP members in the New Right faction cannot be verified. Paul Murray, in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> on 22 April this year, said:</para><quote><para>Forged signatures and fake membership forms have been uncovered in a preliminary investigation into branch stacking in the WA Labor Party.</para><para>ALP State Secretary Bill Johnston says `hundreds and hundreds' of Labor's 5700 WA members may be caught up in the rorting, mainly in the so-called phantom memberships.</para></quote><para>The following day the state Labor member for Perth, John Hyde, a member of the New Right-Left alliance, alleged in a confidential report that high school and foreign students had been signed up as party members without their knowledge.

I want to speak to the Senate today about the next step in the sorry saga of the Howard government's disregard for the wishes of the people of South Australia. We know that South Australia has been chosen by this government as the site for a nuclear waste facility, despite other suitable sites being identified through the EIS process. We know that this government has ignored enormous opposition from the South Australian community in proceeding with its plans to dump nuclear waste in South Australia. We also know that this government has ridden roughshod over the wishes of the elected state government, compulsorily acquiring the land for the site without negotiation—a matter which is still the subject of legal challenge before the South Australian Supreme Court.</para></talk.start><para>Now the next sorry step in this saga has also been revealed. We know from freedom of information documents obtained by the South Australian government that this government has embarked on a taxpayer funded campaign to change the minds of the people of South Australia so that we will no longer oppose this dump. We know that the federal government has engaged expensive consultants to try and change the community's mind through various means. Frankly, if you read the FOI documents what is disclosed is a range of what can only be described as Big Brother tactics by this government as it seeks to spread misinformation and its own propaganda about the nuclear dump. We also know from the freedom of information documents that the government kept the door open on the possibility of a medium-level dump and the possibility of a high-level dump, sourcing nuclear waste from overseas, being placed in South Australia.  </para><para>Let me give some background regarding this issue. The federal government has for a number of years been seeking to construct both a repository for low- and medium-level waste and also a high-level waste dump—known as `the store'—which would be capable of receiving waste from around the world. It is also well known in South Australia that the American company Pangea Resources had a proposal to site an international nuclear waste repository in South Australia. This would involve South Australia receiving nuclear waste from around the world—hardly the sort of export earner one would have thought that we would want for our state.</para><para>It is a matter of history that there was enormous opposition to both of these proposals in the South Australian community and in the face of this furious opposition, prior to the last election, Senator Minchin did an about-face on the issue of a high-level dump. Whilst he had previously left the door open for both the repository—that is, the low- and medium-level dump—and the store, or the high-level waste dump, being sited in South Australia, he ruled this out prior to the last election. He also ruled out, despite having previously left the door open, the Pangea proposal for a high-level dump receiving nuclear waste from other countries being sited in South Australia. He ruled this out in February 1999—it was a relief to many people in South Australia that he did so—but, thanks to the FOI documents which have been released, we now know that, despite this categorical denial by the minister, the federal government kept its options open. The federal government engaged consultants to conduct polling in December 1999, June 2000 and February 2001, which included questions about not only the low-level dump, which was government policy, but also the Pangea proposal to receive high-level nuclear waste from other countries into South Australia—to import nuclear waste.</para><para>The question is: if the minister did categorically rule this out in February 1999, why was it necessary to use taxpayers' money to fund a campaign to conduct polling—including on the issue of the Pangea proposal? It probably, to any fair-minded observer, calls into question the reality of the denial by the minister that this proposal would proceed; it also calls into question other commitments that this government has given regarding the siting of a high-level dump in South Australia. Why, if Pangea's proposal for a high-level dump, including foreign waste, was dead and buried in February 1999, was this government still exploring this option through its consultants, its research and its polling of the South Australian community?</para><para>This raises serious questions regarding the assurances the South Australian community has received from the federal government on two issues: first, that it will not allow the importation of foreign nuclear waste and, second, that it does not intend to site the store for high-level waste in South Australia. An equally disturbing impression one gets when reading these freedom of information documents is the extent to which this government is willing to engage in its own version of Big Brother, its own version of propaganda, to try and change the minds of the South Australian community. These documents reveal quite a conscious campaign to turn South Australian voters around. I assume most senators know that it did not work; the vast majority of South Australians and the state government are still implacably opposed to the dump. </para><para>But the FOI documents really are an example of the way in which this government is seeking to use taxpayers' money to get out its own message. We all remember the A New Tax System ads—a shameful example of taxpayers' money being used to further a political agenda—and in these documents we see the government seeking to use public funds to try and achieve a political result to its liking. One example is the discussion in the documents regarding the `I'm with Ivy' campaign. For those of you who are not from South Australia, Ivy is a South Australian pensioner who led the community based campaign against the nuclear dump and sponsored a petition, which many South Australians signed, opposing the low-level and medium-level dump in South Australia. Interestingly, what we have here is an email to a public servant from someone above her which says: </para><quote><para>The minister wants a short biography of our main opponents in the Ivy campaign by about 11 a.m. our time (pre-rally).</para></quote><para>What we have here is a minister wanting to check up on those in the community who actually opposed him. The only comment I would make, apart from the obvious one that this is not the way we should be spending taxpayers' money, is that he would have had a very long list if he wanted a biography of everyone associated with that campaign. Another disturbing document in the FOI file we received was from the government's consultant to a public servant. In this document the consultant describes his conversation with a journalist, whom I shall not name, and he describes people opposed to the nuclear waste facility as `antinuclear anarchists'. If that is the definition, it seems that we have a pretty anarchic state given that over 90 per cent of South Australians oppose this dump.</para><para>The freedom of information documents also detail, in the brief to the minister, quite a detailed public relations scare campaign seeking to change community opinion on the issue. This brief says:</para><quote><para>This would involve a concerted program of letters to the editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> and responding and participating on talk radio programs. A significant public forum such as business lunch, for example—</para></quote><para>and a certain business organisation is named—</para><quote><para>... may provide a relatively secure forum for a well-known proponent of the repository to address opinion leaders in South Australia.

They are Big Brother tactics, tactics to try to disseminate misinformation about an issue to which the South Australian community is quite rightly opposed.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Western Australia: Labor Government</title><page.no>23041</page.no></subdebateinfo></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Budget 2004-05</title><page.no>23041</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>23041</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I take the opportunity in summing up this debate on matters of public interest to note with very great concern the revelations made by Senator Johnston on the corruption, vote rigging and rorting in the Western Australian branch of the Labor Party. That is the sort of thing that I think would concern all Australians: the vote rigging, the buying of votes, the signing up of non-existent people—the sort of thing that really is un-Australian. I would certainly hope that the more honest elements of the Labor Party would do something about the Western Australian branch. </para></talk.start><para>It seems that if you need a morbid, depressing and despondent view of anything, you can always rely on my Queensland colleague Senator Bartlett to put it, and he was in his best form of despondency in his views on life today when speaking on the budget. I was surprised that Senator Bartlett did not mention the very positive things in the budget for middle income earners and lower income earners. The significant advances in family tax benefit A will see $600 going to those people immediately and another $600 going to them very shortly. I am surprised that Senator Bartlett did not mention the very great initiatives in aged care, new funding—$6 billion more—for education, and the significant increase in spending on defence matters.</para><para>Senator Bartlett shares that very left-wing view of his party and the Greens particularly, having cynicism about intelligence. They never seem to appreciate the need for intelligence. I was just concerned that Senator Bartlett had to have this depressing view of the budget when there is such good news in it for most Australians. I think most Australians appreciate that this government's good financial management has allowed the government to be able to pay some of that back to the taxpayers, and that is what it is all about. It is important to emphasise that the money that is available in this year's budget did not just float down from heaven; it is there by a lot of hard work by Mr Howard, Mr Costello, Mr Anderson and the rest of the government in properly and very carefully managing our economy over the last several years. It is as a result of that hard work and very sound and careful financial management that we have been able to provide a budget that I think will provide benefits to most Australians.</para><para>Most importantly, I was surprised that Senator Bartlett, as a fellow Queenslander, did not highlight the additional $656 million that will be available to the Queensland government next year as result of the federal budget and as result of the sound economic management of the Howard government. Now, $656 million extra to the Queensland budget is a very significant injection to my home state of Queensland. With that additional money, I am quite confident that Mr Beattie will be well able to afford, in his budget, reductions in stamp duty on family homes and reductions in that insidious tax that state governments involve themselves in—that is, payroll tax. With all of this additional windfall money that the Queensland government will get from the Howard government, I am sure Mr Beattie will be able to do a number of good things. I would simply urge Mr Beattie to look more widely than Brisbane when he spends this money.</para><para>As someone who lives in the country up in North Queensland, I am always concerned that the Queensland state government's view of Queensland seems to finish at the boundaries of the south-east Queensland local authorities. While it is good to see south-east Queensland getting money, the Queensland government has spent an inordinate amount on things like the Lang Park redevelopment, the Goodwill Bridge across the Brisbane River—a walking bridge, I might say—whilst, up in the sticks, we get little of Mr Beattie's largess. But he now has 656 million new dollars to help Queenslanders provide more schools and more hospitals, and I am certainly looking forward to seeing how Mr Beattie will spend that windfall from the Howard government. </para><para>The other two things I was surprised Senator Bartlett did not mention include the structural adjustment money that has been made available for the representative areas program of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. That will provide structural adjustment for fishermen who will lose income, for communities and other businesses that might be in some way impacted upon by that very sound approach and sound environmental management of the Great Barrier Reef. I am also surprised Senator Bartlett did not mention the money that has been provided—some $444 million—for the sugar industry, which is such an important part of Queensland. The sugar industry supports many communities up and down the coast of Queensland, and the injection of $444 million will help the industry through a very difficult time that has occurred through no fault of the sugar industry. It is quite clear that farmers and businesses up in that area did need some support, and that has been provided for in this budget.</para><para>The budget is obviously one which has many benefits for all Australians. We are able to provide these benefits because of the very good financial management by the Howard government over the last several years, and I think most Australians would agree with us in thinking that this is a budget for all Australians. It is certainly a budget that will keep Australia moving forward and keep the economy heading in the direction it should.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>23042</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Budget 2004-05</title><page.no>23042</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>23042</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to Senator Coonan, the Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Revenue.

The government's 2004 budget tax cuts come on top of those already delivered through the new tax system in 2000, which were $11 billion per year, and a further $2.4 billion in tax cuts in 2003. When taken together, these three tax cuts will have more than returned bracket creep since 1996. In 2004-05, someone on average weekly earnings—around $40,000 under the new tax scales announced in the 2004 budget—will be about $550 better off than if the tax scales had been indexed to the CPI. The finding that taxpayers are better off is true for those earning half average weekly earnings or twice average weekly earnings. As a result of the government's tax cuts, over 80 per cent of taxpayers will face a top marginal tax rate of 30 per cent or less. Reductions in tax rates combined with real growth in wages over the past nine years will have increased the real disposable income of the average individual earner in 2004-05 by 13 per cent.</para></talk.start><para>The notion that bracket creep is not returned is completely unsustainable. This government is continuing to deliver ongoing tax reform and structural tax reform. As a matter of fact, the combined effect of three stages of tax reform has delivered significant tax cuts for all Australians. There has been some suggestion that this is only for the rich. That is also nonsense. Taxpayers earning $20,000 paid $2,770 in tax prior to the new tax system. They now have a reduction of around 23 per cent in tax. For those on $50,000 the reduction is around 21 per cent. By July 2005, if the Labor Party do not muck around and they pass this tax package, those on $90,000 will get a reduction of around 18 per cent. These are ongoing structural tax reforms that benefit all Australians and the economy. </para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>23043</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

Senator Conroy appears not to understand that bracket creep occurs when inflation pushes taxable income into a higher tax bracket, and of course this government has a very good record on inflation. The government has a record of low inflation, averaging 2.4 per cent since March 1996. Interestingly, by contrast, under the previous Labor government inflation rose to 11 per cent, an average of 5.4 per cent over 13 years.

Last night's budget continues the Howard government's outstanding record of strong and responsible economic management. The budget for the year ahead will deliver a surplus of $2.4 billion, the seventh surplus for this government. This budget is designed to keep the economy strong. The economy is strong because the government took the hard but necessary decisions to get the budget back into surplus. We remember that the Labor Party opposed almost all of those decisions. Because of our commitment to responsible economic management we can again deliver a dividend to Australian workers and their families. This is a government that promises and deliver tax cuts—$12 billion of tax cuts in the tax reform package, $10 billion of tax cuts in last year's budget and now a further $14.7 billion of new tax cuts announced in last night's budget.</para></talk.start><para>These latest tax cuts will mean that more than 80 per cent of taxpayers will have a top rate of 30 per cent or less. In addition to the tax cuts, we are also delivering further assistance to Australian families, with increases in the family tax benefit, a new maternity payment of $3,000 and more child-care places. In total, we will be investing more than $19 billion in Australian families. We have delivered more money for aged care, more money for education, more money for health, more money for the environment and more money for national security. We are giving greater assistance to Australians who are saving for their retirement. These commitments are fully funded within a budget that is in surplus. We do not spend money that we do not have. We will maintain, again, a responsible surplus—this time one of some $2.4 billion. </para><para>By contrast, the Labor Party say they will support our new tax measures, but they claim that on top of that they will give even greater tax cuts. We know that they have made promises already of over $8 billion. We have a surplus of $2.4 billion and the Labor Party offer an extra $8 billion in cuts. What does this mean? This means the same old recipe of going back into deficits—that which Australians experienced before with the consequence of higher home loan interest rates, job losses and ultimately higher taxes. Their policy platform, passed just four months ago, supports budget deficits. We know their record: nine budget deficits in just 13 years. Labor broke their promise on the l-a-w tax cuts, they wrecked the Australian economy, they put a million Australian workers out of work and they crippled Australian families with interest rates on home loans of 17 per cent. If they are given the chance, they will do it again with irresponsible, unfunded promises to anyone who will listen. The lesson is: you cannot trust Labor to manage the economy. The contrast is stark. We have seen the benefits of the good economic management of the last years. There is a chance for more of that if the Howard government is given the opportunity. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DISTINGUISHED VISITORS</title><type>Distinguished Visitors</type><page.no>23044</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

Now I am telling you what our tax policy does. The government believes that the tax burden on all Australians should be kept as low as possible, consistent with being able to provide services that the community expects. People on middle incomes, for instance, who have been the beneficiaries of the threshold changes in this particular round of tax reform—there have been three—should not face the top rate of income tax. The tax cuts that were announced last night reflect the reality that people on $60,000, whilst they might be relatively well-off, are certainly not rich and should not be taxed at top marginal rates. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Conroy seems to be complaining that we are a high-taxed population. By the same token, here we are now doing something to reduce the tax burden on people who can actually earn money, participate in the work force and be globally competitive and Senator Conroy seems to be complaining about that. The tax cuts will make Australia more internationally competitive. A more competitive income tax structure will assist us in retaining and ensuring the return of highly skilled workers, who are increasingly internationally mobile.</para><para>The tax burden on the people on the two highest thresholds should be raised so that there is much more competition and there is much more incentive for people to actually work. At the moment you have situations where people on quite modest incomes actually end up having a disincentive from ever doing overtime or from taking any kind of promotion because they are going to get into the high tax bracket. The whole policy of the government—we are not a high-taxing government by OECD standards—is to reduce the tax burden on Australians where we can, consistent with delivering good services.</para><para>These tax cuts will increase incentives and they will particularly assist people who can actually make this economy zing—those people who could actually make a greater contribution by working overtime, by looking for promotions and by acquiring new skills. Over 80 per cent of taxpayers will face a top marginal tax rate of no more than 30 per cent for the next four years. That is very important. Why does the government want to achieve that? It wants to achieve that so that there is incentive in the tax system, so that people will take these opportunities and so that there is much more fairness in the system. People on the two top tax rates missed out on tax cuts back in 2000 due to the blind opposition of the Labor Party. It will be a fairer system, it will create incentive and it will put much more equity into the tax system. That is why this government is not the highest taxing government and why it will continue to provide incentives in the tax system. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>23045</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

Also, unlike Labor, we will deliver on our promises. In net terms we have now reduced by $70 billion the $96 billion of Labor's debt that we inherited. People know that when you reduce your debt you reduce the interest paid, and we are now reducing the interest that we are paying on Labor's debt by $6 billion a year. As a result we can give families a social dividend. We can give more help for families. </para><para>Our More Help for Families program will help more people into the work force. It will make it easier for mothers or fathers who are juggling paid work or part-time work with the nurturing and raising of a child. This is a $19.2 billion package over five years, the largest package for families that any government has ever given families. It delivers a $600 increase per child this year and it delivers an increase in family tax benefit for those who are able to get family tax benefit A, an increase of $600 this financial year and every financial year afterwards. This means that all these families will be eligible for an additional $1,200 per child in the next 12 months. The Labor Party do not want to hear this because it is good news for families. We have relaxed the income test for this benefit, which will give more families access at higher rates. </para><para>There has also been a change in the income test for family benefit B, which will allow more mothers—or fathers if they are the secondary income earner—access to this payment while in part-time work. From 1 July 2005, when the mother or father returns to work the income from employment will not be counted against the eligibility for the benefit already received. That is, the family can keep the benefit they have already received when the mother or, in some cases, the father re-enters the work force. </para><para>We will provide a new maternity payment without qualification for every mother on the birth of a child. The payment will be a lump sum of $3,000 from 1 July and will rise to $5,000 from 1 July 2008. We will also dramatically increase the availability of child-care places to help mothers and fathers to balance their work and family commitments. In addition to announcements made in December the government will add another 30,000 outside school hours places to bring the total of new places announced since December 2003 to 40,000. With regard to family day care places, an additional 1,500 family day care places will add to the 2,500 places announced in December. That brings the total since December 2003 to 4,000 additional new family day care places—an 85 per cent increase in child-care places since this government was elected.

The 47 per cent threshold is to be increased from $62,000 to $70,000. From 1 July 2005 the 42 per cent threshold will be further increased to $63,000 and the 47 per cent threshold to $80,000.

I am very proud that there is additional support for young carers, and that is a very important part of our budget—a social dividend for good economic management.</para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Budget 2004-05</title><page.no>23047</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>23047</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to Senator Coonan, the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer.

What I was saying in response to an earlier question from Senator Conroy is that what the government has done is to embark on ongoing structural tax reform that has been a work in progress. People who got benefits in various tax cuts are as follows. The new tax system, introduced on 1 July 2000, represented a major restructuring of the Australian tax system and it continued in the 2003-04 budget with thresholds being further adjusted across the board. In this budget, the top two tax thresholds have been specifically targeted to ensure that the tax system continues to support rewards from working. The combined effect of the three stages of tax reform has been to deliver significant tax cuts for all Australians.</para></talk.start><para>Let me remind the Senate of what the benefits have been. Taxpayers earning $20,000 paid $2,770 in tax prior to the new tax system, including the Medicare levy, whereas taxpayers on that income would now pay only $2,145, a reduction of around 23 per cent in tax. For taxpayers on $50,000—around average weekly earnings—their tax reduction is around 21 per cent. And by 1 July this year, if the Labor Party stops mucking around and passes the benefits of the tax package, a taxpayer on $90,000 who paid $32,902 in tax prior to the new tax system, excluding the Medicare levy, will pay $26,912 in tax in 2005-06. That will be a reduction of around 18 per cent. So it is certainly true that the Prime Minister has said—and it is being delivered—that all Australians will benefit from the tax cuts. This government has in fact governed for all Australians.</para><para>The rationale for adjusting the threshold is clear: many highly skilled Australians, including our young people, are internationally mobile and can choose to work anywhere in the world. Why would they work here if the tax thresholds and the tax rates are simply prohibitive? The personal income tax system is simply one factor in the decisions of Australian skilled workers to seek work overseas and in attracting skilled people from other countries who are considering coming to work in Australia. Obviously the Labor Party has also opposed our doing something to help expats with tax. </para><para>The significant increase in the top tax threshold will improve Australia's ability to compete as a preferred place to work. It returns incentives. It helps all Australians, when you take into account this is a staged process, and it returns some fairness to those who were otherwise denied tax benefits in 2000 when the Labor Party opposed the opportunity to increase those thresholds in the Senate. So not only does it return incentives and increase competitiveness but it actually returns some fairness in the tax system that was devised in 2000 that was so short-sightedly opposed by the Labor Party.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>23048</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

They have certainly been significantly increased from when they were under Labor. Lower- to middle-income earners—anyone who is on a low income—will also significantly benefit from the co-contribution arrangements; it is simply not true to say that lower-income earners will get nothing from this budget. Lower-income earners have got a restructured tax system that has delivered them substantial reduction in their tax rates over the staged process of these tax reforms. They are going to get benefits from the co-contribution, and certainly families are front and centre of getting the benefits of these tax cuts. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq: Treatment of Prisoners</title><page.no>23048</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>23048</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Defence, Senator Hill.

If they are eligible for FTBA, they will get an increase of $600 in their family tax benefit for each child. That is what they will get: a $600 increase in their family tax benefit for every child if they are eligible for FTBA. Labor cannot cope with the fact that we have managed the economy and we are able now to deliver to families this year. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health and Ageing: Aged Care</title><page.no>23053</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>23053</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator FERRIS</name><name.id>5L6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Ageing, Senator Ian Campbell.

It is one of the great and important issues facing Australia. We have an ageing population. We have strong demand for aged care accommodation. Senator Ferris would know that the government commissioned Professor Hogan to review arrangements in aged care, particularly the pricing of aged care. I know all senators have taken a close interest in the progress of that review and of course the government's response. I am pleased to report to the Senate on behalf of the Minister for Ageing that the Treasurer announced last night a $2.2 billion package—a historically large figure—for the funding of aged care in Australia. It addresses the issues raised by Professor Hogan's report. I think in some ways it is fair to say, from the reading that I have done on the package and the review which I have had a chance to look at overnight and today, that in some respects it has gone further and come up with some even better ideas than the Hogan review itself.</para></talk.start><para>The core of the package seeks to address the operating revenue for aged care facilities. It provides for an initial up-front payment of $3,500 per aged care place across Australia prior to 30 June. It therefore assists with not only operating grants but also capital structure, with about a billion dollars going into the capital requirements of aged care facilities across Australia. Very importantly, it provides something like 27,875 new aged care places, which include aged care facilities but, very importantly for many older Australians, a doubling of the number of places outside aged care facilities. It has measures to ensure more older Australians can get care outside aged care facilities to stay with their families and stay in their homes for longer. A doubling of that will be welcomed by many Australians.</para><para>Senator Ferris will be particularly pleased to know that, as part of the 13,030 places that will be available in the next 12 months across Australia, there will be 650 places in her state of South Australia. Over the next three years, this will build up to a total of 1,675 new places in South Australia. I have the figures. If any other senators from other states need details I am sure the minister, Julie Bishop, or I would be happy to provide them. For example, in my home state of Western Australia, 770 new places will be available in this first year, building up to 1,890. In the big population centres, such as New South Wales, there will be another 8,575 places. In Victoria, there will be 6,555. I know many Tasmanians are interested, and you would have a particular interest, Mr President. There will be 635 places in Tasmania. </para><para>The funding package is a very important measure. It is addressing not only the capital needs but also, very importantly, the governance of aged care facilities. There are conditional payments for aged care facilities that improve their governance. More money is being put into scholarships for nurses. Opportunities to ensure aged care workers receive better remuneration and better training, and improvements across the board, will see that the quality of aged care continues to improve. I have been asked about alternative policies. We know what wreckage Labor left in the aged care sector when they were in power. We have not seen any alternatives to date. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>23054</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator FERRIS</name><name.id>5L6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

We have reduced the debt repayment burden by delivering budgets with surpluses. We have reduced the amount of money paid on debt interest servicing by $5.57 billion a year. That is $5.57 billion that the alternative government—the Labor Party—when in power used to pay back in interest on their massive debt. They used to spend more on paying off debt than they did on education. By strong economic management year after year, running surplus budgets, we have been able to reduce interest payments, which has allowed us to provide better care for older Australians and to fund this very important community and social infrastructure.</para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Family Services: Child Care</title><page.no>23054</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>23054</page.no><name role="metadata">Wong, Sen Penny</name><name role="display">Senator WONG</name><name.id>00AOU</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to Senator Minchin, Minister for Finance and Administration and Minister representing the Treasurer.

We were surprised by that decision because there is no doubt that there is a direct connection between a general wage rise of that order and the impact on employment prospects. A lot of commentary was sensibly made about the lack of wisdom of that decision and its impact on the job prospects of many Australians. The point was also made that the on-costs for employers of that particular wage rise would match the wage rise, equally having a deleterious effect on employment prospects and the subtractions from it. </para></talk.start><para>Obviously there is a tax system and there is a tax obligation on those in employment to pay tax. The point has been made repeatedly that we had a cohesive program for tax reform, which we brought down in the year 2000, that specifically addressed the problems in the income tax system right across the board. The whole point of the goods and services tax reform was to take the extraordinary burden of taxation in this country off income tax. This country had got into a very dangerous situation where the burden of overall taxation was increasingly falling on personal income tax.</para><para>We had to do something to reform the system of indirect tax and the disastrous wholesale sales tax system that we inherited from Labor. That was the whole point of bringing in an across-the-board goods and services tax—an across-the-board indirect tax system—which relieved the burden on personal income tax. Despite the opposition of the Labor Party, we did manage to get through this chamber substantial tax relief for lower income earners as part of that comprehensive reform of taxation. The one thing we did achieve was tax reform and tax reduction for lower income earners as part of that comprehensive package.</para><para>Unfortunately, we were not successful in having the full comprehensive goods and services tax applied. Therefore the tax reform which we wanted to bring in in relation to higher income earners, given the disincentive effect of very high marginal income tax rates cutting in at relatively low income levels, was not successful because of the opposition of the Australian Labor Party—who ensured that the very high income tax rates continued to cut in at relatively low levels. This budget endeavours to complete the process of income tax reform that we began in 2000, despite the trenchant opposition of the ALP, to ensure that not only low-income earners—who did receive the benefit of income tax changes back then—but also those on middle incomes are prevented from beginning to pay the 47 per cent rate. I am very proud of the fact that, as a result of the package we brought down last night, we will have a situation where 80 per cent of Australian income tax earners will pay a marginal tax rate no higher than 30 per cent. That is a critical reform. It comes on top of the very important reform of tax in relation to lower income earners which we did manage to introduce back in 2000.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>23055</page.no><name role="metadata">Wong, Sen Penny</name><name role="display">Senator WONG</name><name.id>00AOU</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

It is a case of big talk but no action. This $1.9 billion is less than the famous `milkshake and sandwich' tax cut of last year that was given to Australian families. It does not compensate for the bracket creep next year. The government gives $1.9 billion in tax cuts but claws back $2.5 billion in bracket creep from the same people it is giving the tax cuts to. This is a government that gives with one hand but takes with the other.

Senator Collins, I am sure you will remember that we voted on the GST. It is a Commonwealth tax but according to this government it is not a Commonwealth tax. So they try the fudges again, year in and year out. Do not worry about the Bureau of Statistics or the Auditor-General; they say: `It's a Commonwealth tax. Stop fiddling the books.' This is the highest taxing government in Australia's history and there is a reason for that. I would like to repeat the figures that I mentioned in my question—so ineptly avoided by Senator Coonan earlier. I mentioned earlier that in 1995-96 the average taxpayer paid $10,000 to the government. In 2003-04 that figure is now $15,500.

I commend to you the <inline font-style="italic">Budget at a Glance</inline> document that the government has issued. It gives a marvellous summary of what the government has done. The only reason we could do so much for families, cut income tax and boost retirement savings is that we have been responsible since 1996—unlike the Australian Labor Party. The other day I was listening to the ABC—I listen to the ABC—and Mr Keating was on the radio. Mr Keating said: `The only reason it is so easy for the Liberal Party these days is because they have adopted our franchise. The Labor Party made all the reforms. The Liberal Party has adopted our franchise and now it's all easy. It's easy for Costello. It's easy for Howard. It's easy for the government.'</para></talk.start><para>I think it is a good thing, as Senator Conroy mentioned, to talk a little bit about history. Let us talk about the franchise of the Labor Party. Their franchise was net government debt of $100 billion. We have paid back about $70 billion and, as Senator Ian Campbell said today in question time, we have saved billions of dollars in interest in so doing. Inflation under the Labor Party averaged about 5.2 per cent—do you remember that? Under the Liberal government it is now under three per cent. Inflation, which corrodes society and corrodes investment, was part of the Labor Party franchise. </para><para>Remember that mortgage rates were up to about 17 per cent? The average Australian battlers could not afford to buy a home and they certainly could not afford to repay the loan. That was part of the Labor Party franchise that Mr Keating spoke so glowingly about. The Labor franchise was high mortgage rates. Worse still was the unemployment rate under Labor. Do you know what their franchise was? They had a franchise on an unemployment rate of over 10 per cent. That was the franchise of the Labor Party. More than one million people were unemployed. That was their franchise—and worse again.</para><para>Mortgages rates today are down below seven per cent and the unemployment rate is below six per cent. The franchise of the Australian Labor Party for all those years in office was fundamentally flawed. Do you know what the flaw was? The flaw was the big lie of the accord. Their franchise was the big lie of the accord, under which the living standards of average Australians actually fell. That was their franchise. Government debt was way up, inflation was way up, mortgage rates were way up, unemployment was way up and real wages were right down. That was the Labor Party franchise. The only reason we can do all the things in this budget—which is a terrific budget for Australian families, for investment, for business and for the future—is because we did not borrow their franchise; we developed a new one. Do you know what we are going to do? We are going to give the Australian people a fiscal outlook of $2.4 billion in surplus and we are going to spend $36.7 billion in new assistance to families, tax cuts and increased incentives to boost retirement savings. </para><para>This budget also includes the largest package of assistance for families ever, with an additional $19.2 billion over the next five years. That is more money than has ever been given to families in the history of this Commonwealth. That is our franchise and we can only do it because of responsible economic management under the Howard-Costello government. There has been a lot of talk today about cutting income tax. Reductions in personal tax worth $14.7 billion over four years will improve work rewards. This was our promise: more than 80 per cent of taxpayers will have to pay a top marginal tax rate of 30 per cent or less. Just the other day Mr Latham said, `We need to make the Australian tax system fairer and put some incentive back into the Australian economy.' In his speech to the national conference in January, Mr Latham condemned the fact that nearly one million Australian families faced effective marginal tax rates of at least 60 per cent.

The budget claims to deal with families who are suffering under financial pressure. The critical question is: why are they suffering under financial pressure? Senator Conroy highlighted the first aspect of that: they have been suffering under the bracket creep that this government has not addressed and there are many people—as, again, Senator Conroy highlighted—who get nothing at all out of this budget.</para><para>Even where the government represents to be delivering benefits to families, it is no surprise to people who have followed the history of this government's record with families to see what misleading things are occurring there as well. The question I asked Senator Patterson today about the cameos highlighted the fact that the Treasurer is counting benefits that will not even be delivered for 12 months in these cameos. It is blatantly misleading to tell families that they will be getting this increase in their weekly incomes when it will not occur for another 12 months. That is completely misleading, and I note that Senator Patterson was not able to address that issue at all. She sledged Mr Swan, but could she deal with the issue that was raised before her? Not at all.</para><para>Another reason that families have been suffering under financial pressure is family tax benefit debts. This is where the raw cynicism of this budget comes into play. Australian families remember from last election the $1,000 waiver that they were going to be getting to deal with the new family tax benefit system. But, by God, they also remember the next few years, when they got nothing—when they got the debts and they got nothing. So let us consider this $600 payment as just a slightly different creature. This time the government is being a little bit more sophisticated about it. It is saying to Australian families, `We won't give you a $1,000 election bribe this time; we'll give you a one-off payment of $600 and we'll continue $600 year after year into the future.' Australian families know that their average debt has been $900, so they are still $300 worse off.</para><para>Senator Patterson today highlighted that they have done a little bit of tinkering to deal with the issue of women who return to work after having a baby. But, again, the government show that they do not understand the realities of everyday family life. They are not the only issues. They are not the only problems affecting families grappling with the family tax benefit system. I highlighted in my question issues such as unexpected overtime. Maybe that money should ultimately go back to the Commonwealth, but where a child unexpectedly decides to go and get a job and not continue with school those families will still have to pay back their full debt. There is no exemption for them. </para><para>It is going to be very interesting in estimates when we come down to the qualifying criteria for this special deal for mums who return to work. There are no objective criteria that the government can use to say who should be allowed to keep the payments that they have received to date in a financial year and who should not. How can you justify that? Rather than fix the system, the government has just put in a little ad hoc measure because the public, rightly, has been concerned about work force re-entry issues for women after they have had children. But lots of other cases have not been addressed at all.</para><para>The next issue is maternity payment problems. Yes, it is great that we have finally got a maternity payment. But, again, look at history. Labor introduced the maternity allowance as a first stage. Our intention in the next government—back in 1996—was to add the second stage, and that would have covered 14 weeks of minimum income support. This payment, many years on, is at a more generous level, and that is great. But it should have been in place since 1996, and it is this government that never delivered it—never delivered at all. It is the same with child care. It is great that we have 40,000 places now, but they are only outside school hours care places. Nothing has been done about the shortages in child-care centres—nothing at all. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>23060</page.no><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name><name.id>TH4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I find today's debate absolutely fascinating.

Senator Collins says: `You know the answer to that. You should just listen to the news.' The fact of the matter is that that does not tally with what Senator Collins said in this chamber just before that. She has complained about it, she has grizzled about it, she has said that it is inadequate and all those things, and yet now she says: `Don't you know what we're going to do? We're going to vote for it.' Really and truly, what is the Labor Party on about? Senator Collins just concluded her remarks by grizzling about the maternity payment. The maternity payment that we are talking about pays a lump sum of $3,000 for each newborn child. The Labor Party never did that in 13 years in government. This payment will increase to $4,000 from 1 July 2006 and increase again to $5,000 from 1 July 2008. This new payment will incorporate the existing maternity allowance and baby bonus. This payment is not means tested and is to be paid in full.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let us look at the alternative: the current Labor Party policy. As opposed to the government's policy of having this payment paid to all, the Labor Party's payment—by their own admission—will not be paid to all. Not only that—the Labor Party's baby care payment will be reduced by 30c in every dollar if the family income is above the FTB A cut-out threshold. No such policy exists from the government, and yet the mob on the other side are complaining about the maternity allowance. They know, sitting here today, that their current policy is for a payment that will decrease depending on the amount of family income and that it will not be given to 100 per cent of mothers. How can they possibly come in here and complain about an allowance that will be given to all, will not be means tested, will be paid in full and will increase over the forward estimates? It defies any logic. But one gets used to not trying to look for logic in Labor Party arguments. </para><para>This budget will see Australian families benefit to the tune of $19.2 billion in the increase in family assistance over the next five years and yet the Labor Party complain about it. I think that is pretty darn low but, once again, how much lower can you get from a mob that did not do anything for families in 13 years of government? This budget represents the largest package of assistance ever for families. It will help them with raising children. It will improve the rewards for work and help families balance work and family responsibilities. This package gives people a choice. The Labor Party do not want to give anyone a choice; they simply make a demand based on what they think is best for somebody else. Let us not contemplate that they will complain about a maternity payment that is paid to all in full and increased over the forward estimates when theirs does the reverse.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>23061</page.no><name role="metadata">Wong, Sen Penny</name><name role="display">Senator WONG</name><name.id>00AOU</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on Senator Conroy's motion in relation to answers given today on the budget. As we all know, the budget that was handed down last night is a budget which creates a new class of forgotten Australians. Four out of five Australian families and singles will get no income tax relief from this budget. It is a budget which creates a class of forgotten Australians, a budget which gives with one hand and takes with the other. As Senator Conroy said, we know from the figures that $2.5 billion additional tax was harvested by the government in this financial year as a result of bracket creep—$2.5 billion. Now they come to an election year and they want to hand back $1.9 billion by way of tax cuts and they expect the electorate to be grateful.</para></talk.start><para>In question time today I asked Senator Minchin a question about child-care workers. Child-care workers are those people in our community who do a fantastic job of looking after the children of Australian families and who are paid an absolute pittance. The minimum wage for a full-time child-care worker is $24,300 a year. Just recently, child-care workers received a minimum wage increase as a result of a decision of the commission. What did we see from this government? Did we hear it saying, `It's good that these low-paid workers who are doing important things for the children of Australia are paid a reasonable wage'? No, it did not. The Howard government opposed the wage increase and was critical in the media of the commission's decision. In relation to those child-care workers, apart from opposing their wage increase what else have we seen from the Howard government in this budget? Child-care workers and others like them receive not one cent in tax relief as a result of the budget decisions announced last night.</para><para>The tax relief that is proposed by this government in its budget is unashamedly, apparently, directed at those earning over $52,000 a year. It was extraordinary to see Senator Minchin trying to answer this question today in question time. He was asked: `Why aren't you doing anything for workers, such as child-care workers? Why should someone on $24,300 a year get not one cent in tax relief from this government while the Treasurer and others in the high-income bracket get $42 a week?' Could he answer it? Frankly, he could not. His answer was pathetic and all he could do was bleat on about the introduction of the GST. Again, that is another one of over 100 new taxes that this government has introduced. </para><para>What this government is doing—and it has been demonstrated in question time again and again—is forgetting many Australian families and taxpayers: all those who earn under $52,000 a year, who will not see any tax relief under this budget. The government, through bracket creep, has harvested more and more income tax and now it is handing back only a proportion of what it harvested and only to the high-income earners. It is a budget which is inherently unfair.</para><para>Senator Knowles was critical of many things, of Senator Collins and others, and critical of the Labor Party saying: `We don't know what you'll do.' I can say one thing. Mark Latham has indicated that our position is that we would seek broader tax relief because that is what Australians want. What we have is a budget which creates a class of forgotten Australians. Those who earn under $52,000, four out of five Australian families and singles get no income tax relief from this budget and three out of five get nothing at all. As for the child-care workers and other people who are low paid but in important jobs, they receive nothing by way of tax relief from this government.</para><para>The LHMU, the union which covers child-care workers and has been running a great campaign to try to improve the wages and conditions of those workers, said in a recent survey that 70 per cent of workers indicated that they could not afford to work in child care in the long term. There is not much point in announcing that you are going to create new child-care places if you do not deal with the issue of providing reasonable wages and conditions and a fair tax system for people on those sorts of incomes. We do not see that sort of fairness from this government. We see it opposing minimum wage increases in one week and in the next week ensuring that those people do not receive any tax relief and that the tax relief is almost exclusively targeted at high-income earners—people in the top income tax bracket. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>23062</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise on behalf of the Australian Democrats to acknowledge the questions asked particularly by the ALP today and to take note of the answers particularly in relation to this so-called family friendly budget. The Australian Democrats have already put on record our grave concern about the lack of assistance for low- and middle-income earners during the period of this government but I emphasise, in particular, the concern that we have about tax cuts aimed at high-income earners instead of equal tax cuts and an increase in services for those in our society who suffer the most.</para></talk.start><para>This budget looks very generous at face value when you deal with not only the tax cuts but, in particular, some of the so-called family friendly provisions. Most Australian families would readily acknowledge that they will be paying increased costs and have been paying an increased amount in the form of user pays over the period of this government for services such as health and education and through the social security system, particularly in light of means testing arrangements and the government's penalties in relation to overpayments when it comes to social security.</para><para>It comes as no surprise that, having tabled the first ever piece of paid maternity leave legislation in this place, I have an interest in the maternity payment that this government put forward last night. While the Democrats are on record as acknowledging that this is a welcome and long overdue measure, it is still a measure that slaps working women. It hits hard at working families, particularly those where a woman is in the workplace. </para><para>In the last few hours in the debates in this chamber and on television last night, I have heard continual references to the `average worker'. One reference I heard was to an average worker `who has a wife and children'. We are talking in this debate as if women are not the average—as if they are not part of the community. I say that as a warning to senators opposite, particularly government members and ministers, who seem to forget, when they talk about family friendliness and inclusiveness, that women are 52 per cent of the population.</para><para>Another figure worth remembering for this government is that two-thirds of Australian working women did not have access to any payment upon the birth of a child if they were in the work force. I acknowledge that the government has changed that. Last night the government talked about a $3,000 payment applying to all women upon the birth of a child. I commend the so-called universality of that payment—it was certainly a problem I had with the Labor Party's so-called baby care payment. But $3,000 is still not good enough. I know that working women and women around Australia who have children are desperate for some kind of payment, but $3,000 is a real token effort.</para><para>I put forward a private member's bill on this matter years ago, as senators would know. I costed my model based on paying 14 weeks maternity leave. That is the ILO recommended period that women should have off work when they have a child, for biological and other imperatives. For 14 weeks women should be paid at least the minimum wage. The minimum wage over 14 weeks would amount to around $6,400, and this payment is $3,000—less than half of that payment. That is not good enough. Any workers out there—male or female—with families, who are bringing up kids or who have just had children will understand that, while $3,000 is good and no-one sniffs at it, it is not enough. It is not enough to end the systematic discrimination that takes place against women in the work force who decide to have a child.</para><para>Women often put off having a child. In particular, families put off having a second child because of the increased costs of living in our society. Some women decide not to tell their workplaces that they are pregnant because of the possibility of discrimination and indeed termination of employment. Women worry that they will not get their jobs back after having a child. Of more concern from a health and social perspective are the women who go back to work too quickly. We heard during a Senate inquiry the story of one woman who, two weeks after a caesarean, returned to the office.</para><para>You have to remember that women are often the heads of sole parent families, which have not been adequately assisted by the budget package that came down last night. Australians are conscious of the need for increased services as well as the need of some families for tax cuts, but these tax cuts are not equitable, they are not fair and they do not deserve to be passed in this form. As for the maternity payment, the Democrats will acknowledge that it is a start—but talk about the longest gestation period in history for a policy!

I am pleased to advise Parliament that the JCPAA is now satisfied that the estimates are sufficient to enable the Auditor-General to properly exercise his functions and powers under the Auditor-General Act 1997.</para><para>At a meeting in March this year, the ANAO had advised the Committee that its budget allocation of $56.316 million would enable the ANAO to meet its statutory responsibilities and undertake a comprehensive audit program for 2004-05 at broadly existing levels. </para><para>However, the Committee was also advised that the ANAO would need an extra $2.71 million to meet two additional measures that could not be accommodated within its base funding. </para><para>The first additional measure was to meet additional costs to the ANAO arising from bringing forward the deadlines for completing the audit of agency financial statements. The ANAO would have continued to meet its statutory financial auditing obligations, but this would have been at the expense of other activities—potentially including the breadth and depth of its performance auditing. </para><para>The second additional measure was to enable the ANAO to respond to the Senate Resolution request of May 2003 that the ANAO conduct an annual report on progress of major defence projects. This would be a major exercise, again outside the ANAO's base resource capacity.</para><para>The Auditor-General has been able to advise the Committee in the last two weeks that it will receive additional funding to cover the consequences of compressing the financial statement auditing timeframe. This will amount to $2.035 million in 2004-2005 and $1.626 million in out-years. The Committee is persuaded that this will adequately compensate for the additional demand on audit resources.</para><para>The Auditor-General also advised the Committee that the ANAO would not receive additional funds in 2004-2005 to allow it to undertake the audit work requested by the Senate in relation to the major defence projects. The question of whether to provide funding to allow the audits will be deferred by the Government until the 2005-2006 Budget to give the new Defence Materiel Organisation time to establish its procedures.</para><para>In light of the Government's decision, the Committee has been advised that the ANAO proposes to defer consideration of the Senate's request until its audit program for 2005-06. Thus, the Committee considers that the ANAO's immediate budgetary concerns are resolved—for the 2004-2005 year.</para><para>The ANAO has foreshadowed to the Committee increasing cost pressures in the longer term that it faces in both the financial statement and performance audit areas. </para><para>The continuing attention to sound corporate governance in both the public and private sectors, including the increasing recognition of the importance of effective financial management and the implications of CLERP9 legislation, are all contributing to an environment which may significantly increase the cost of the ANAO's financial statement audit program.</para><para>The proposed adoption of international accounting standards and the harmonisation of Government Financial Statements and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles will also place additional burdens on the financial statement audit program. </para><para>Furthermore, the increasing complexity of the public sector environment continues to increase the level of resources required to meet the ANAO's performance audit responsibilities. In particular, the growing importance of information technology for communication, record keeping and service delivery means that the ANAO needs, for example, an ever increasing IT audit capacity.</para><para>These additional cost pressures on financial statement and performance audits are expected to continue for the foreseeable future. Consequently the cost of meeting the Audit Office's statutory obligations is expected to increase in 2005-06 and the three forward years. </para><para>Nevertheless, prudent financial management has resulted in the Audit Office's overall financial position remaining adequate at this stage. The Audit Office also has sufficient cash reserves to meet ongoing liabilities, including employee entitlements, and to fund future capital acquisitions.</para><para>As I indicated at the beginning of my statement, the Committee is now reassured that the Auditor-General has a sufficient budget allocation to allow him meet his statutory responsibilities for 2004-2005.</para><para>The Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit in line with its statutory responsibilities as the Audit Committee of the Parliament will also continue to monitor closely the demands placed on the Auditor-General's resources by way of ad hoc audit requests. This will ensure that the Audit Office's wider scheduled program of performance audits is not compromised.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NATIONAL DRUG RESEARCH STRATEGY</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>23070</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Return to Order</title><page.no>23070</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—On behalf of the President, I present a response from the Minister for Health and Ageing, Mr Abbott, to a resolution of the Senate of 8 October 2003 concerning a draft national drug research strategy. </para></talk.start></interjection></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>IMMIGRATION: VISA APPROVALS</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>23071</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Return to Order</title><page.no>23071</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>23071</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—On behalf of Senator Vanstone, I refer to an order which arises from a motion which was moved by Senator Ludwig as agreed by the Senate on 1 April this year. It relates to documents relating to the exercise of ministerial discretion under sections 351 and 417 of the Migration Act 1958. I wish to inform the Senate that the committee was advised during its inquiry that the minister was not going to provide some of the information now being sought again in the Senate motion. Firstly, the committee's request had very significant resourcing and workload implications for the department. Secondly, there were also fundamental issues of privacy, given that the files and other personal information requested by the committee related to individuals who were not themselves the subject of the inquiry. The motion casts an even broader net and would have greater resource and privacy impacts. I note that the committee found no evidence of wrongdoing or impropriety on the part of the former minister.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>23071</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the statement.</para></motion><para>Given the scheduling of a number of matters today, I do not intend to take up a significant amount of the Senate's time. I may, however, seek leave to reserve comments in relation to this for another time. It is important to understand that Senator Vanstone in her reply is denying the order for the production of documents. The minister has not been able to indicate why order No. 47 on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper </inline>for the production of documents relating to the Select Committee into Ministerial Discretion has not been complied with. Three spurious reasons have been raised: workload, issues of privacy and it seems that the matter was also addressed by her in a letter to the committee. They are not arguments that deserve to be ventilated here without proper expansion and without a detailed reply. Senator Vanstone has not even come to the chamber herself to argue the case but has provided a short statement which does not go to the detail but simply provides a broad sweep.</para><para>The minister has not answered why, in truth, order 47 should not be complied with. Can the minister answer whether the order for the production of these documents will be complied with at some later stage? It is vital to understand that these matters are germane and they were germane to the work of the select committee. Without those documents the select committee could not investigate fully the claims that were being made—and it said that in the report. The order agreed to on 1 April this year clearly showed that vital information had been withheld from the select committee. The committee sought to investigate claims of impropriety by the former minister for immigration, the Hon. Philip Ruddock, which were raised during the cash for visas scandal. What we have now is the inability of the minister to meet the same request for documents by the Senate that the select committee made to the minister.</para><para>This is a mean and tricky government that refuses to be held accountable. It is not the first time, of course, that this government has withheld information but it should be the last. This order for the production of documents highlights the government's contempt for the committee process. In effect, by refusing to produce the documents the government is saying that immigration processes and accountability in those processes are not the business of this Senate even when the Senate appoints a select committee to investigate and report on claims of impropriety. </para><para>The government is wrong about that—dead wrong. In fact, since 1996 the Senate has initiated 179 orders for the production of documents. The government has consistently failed to comply with the order on many of those. The government has not been able to come to the Senate and say why they have failed to comply with those orders. On 52 occasions the orders for the production of documents have not been complied with by this government. That is, on 52 occasions the government has ignored section 50 of the Constitution and not provided information to the Senate which the Senate is empowered to receive and to make orders about. </para><para>This highlights, in my view, the position this government has adopted throughout this debate. The government spends much more time on quick fixes than on proper management of its system. It does not and cannot provide accountability for its departments or for its processes to ensure that it is held accountable for all of those issues. Standing order 164—I remind Senator Campbell and the Senate—states:</para><para>(1)	Documents may be ordered to be laid on the table, and the Clerk shall communicate to the Leader of the Government in the Senate all orders for documents made by the Senate.</para><para>(2)	When returned the documents shall be laid on the table by the Clerk.</para><para>This time, as for 52 other times, this Senate has not had the benefit of the government providing those documents. It continues to flout the order that has been provided by the Senate to produce documents to ensure that this government is open and accountable. This government continues to remain behind a smokescreen, behind words such as `workload implications' and `privacy concerns'. It is a poor justification—in fact I do not think it is even a justification. It is an excuse for ensuring that this government cannot be held open and accountable. The work of Senate committees cannot be completed if this government continues to ignore reasonable requests for relevant documents, as were made in this instance. This government should be held accountable, and it will be held accountable.</para><para>Question agreed to. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX ARRANGEMENTS BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>23072</page.no><id.no>R1946</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Report of Economics Legislation Committee</title><page.no>23072</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>23072</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator FERRIS</name><name.id>5L6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the Chair of the Economics Legislation Committee, Senator Brandis, I present the report of the committee on the New International Tax Arrangements Bill 2003, together with the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be printed.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2004 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>23072</page.no><id.no>R1988</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Report of Economics Legislation        Committee</title><page.no>23072</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>23072</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator FERRIS</name><name.id>5L6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the Chair of the Economics Legislation Committee, Senator Brandis, I present the report of the committee on the Tax Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 1) Bill 2004, together with the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be printed.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>TREASURY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS) BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>23072</page.no><id.no>R1957</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Report of Economics Legislation Committee</title><page.no>23073</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>23073</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator FERRIS</name><name.id>5L6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the Chair of the Economics Legislation Committee, Senator Brandis, I present the report of the committee on the provisions of the Treasury Legislation Amendment (Professional Standards) Bill 2003, together with the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be printed.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (TEACHING PROFESSION) BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>23073</page.no><id.no>R1999</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>23073</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 29 March, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Abetz</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para><inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>23073</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1999">Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004</inline>. Let me say clearly that Labor oppose this bill, which seeks to make changes to the Sex Discrimination Act. We oppose the government's approach to this bill because in truth it represents a simplistic and ineffectual way of dealing with a very complex policy issue. The government claim that the bill facilitates measures to address the problem of imbalance in the number of male and female school teachers and the particular effect of that imbalance on the educational outcome for male students. It adds a new exemption to the Sex Discrimination Act, or the SDA, which will allow the offering of student scholarships disproportionately to one sex over the other, with the purpose being to, as they say, `redress gender imbalance in teaching'.</para></talk.start><para>Labor's reasons for opposing this bill when so many other better initiatives could have been taken have been set out by my colleague the shadow Attorney-General in the House. However, as senators and the Deputy President should know, the bill was also referred to a Senate committee, of which I am a member, after it was introduced into parliament, and the report from the committee of inquiry was tabled only yesterday. Labor and the minor parties provided dissenting reports to the government members' majority report and, in Labor's dissenting report, we outlined the reasons why we would not be supporting this bill here today. Essentially the reasons are that insufficient evidence was provided to the committee to show that there is a structural discrimination against males entering or remaining in the teaching profession. Similarly, there is no evidence which suggests that increasing the number of male teachers will enhance educational outcomes for boys, nor that the perceived lack of role models for boys in schools is in any way linked to their educational outcomes.</para><para>Evidence brought before the committee from the 17 submissions received and the seven organisations that appeared to give evidence overwhelmingly suggested that a lack of males in teaching is caused by factors such as the status—or the perceived lack of it—of the profession, and salary and career opportunities. Further, the evidence strongly suggested that it is the quality of teaching and learning provisions and not teacher gender that has the most profound impact on educational outcomes for both boys and girls. The gender disparity between males and females, particularly in preschool and primary school teaching, is a multifaceted issue that requires long-term strategic planning to be able to accomplish the end point.</para><para>These are all issues that Labor raised earlier in the debate on the bill, and much of the information has been previously provided in the House of Representatives committee inquiry report into the education of boys, <inline font-style="italic">Boys</inline><inline font-style="italic">:</inline><inline font-style="italic"> getting it right</inline>, tabled in 2003. The report recommended a number of measures for addressing the low educational outcome of boys, but there was no recommendation to change the Sex Discrimination Act and no suggestion that doing so would achieve the purpose claimed by the government in this bill. However, the government referred to the House of Representatives committee report as part of the reason for introducing the bill we have before us now. Anyone following this issue in detail would see the complete lack of logic and rationale in the government's approach. However, they seem to be relying on the fact that most people are in fact not following the detail of this debate. They are simply trying to muddy the public debate by asking people to believe them when they say that they are concerned about getting better outcomes for boys in schools and that changing the Sex Discrimination Act is the most effective way of doing that. </para><para>Since the bill was originally introduced into parliament, the circumstance that provoked the amendment—that is, the Catholic Education Office proposal in New South Wales—has sensibly been resolved. But, instead of gracefully withdrawing this particular amendment to the bill, the government continues to push its own wheelbarrow, arguing that this change is needed to address a gender imbalance. In fact, the government has many other options and levers that could be used to deliver this outcome without needing to amend the act to do so. This is an ill-conceived and intellectually flawed attack on the Sex Discrimination Act.</para><para>The government announced this package before the Senate committee had finished its inquiry into the new legislation, so clearly the education minister and the rest of the government were not even remotely interested in assessing the evidence presented to them before going ahead with further commitments. This demonstrates that this bill is also about tricky politics and not about providing decent policy outcomes or decent solutions for the serious issues of providing better educational and social outcomes for boys in primary schools.</para><para>Other evidence presented to the recent inquiry that the government chose to ignore was from its own Department of Education, Science and Training. This submission, and further evidence provided in person to the committee, showed that, while the number of males completing primary school teacher education courses had decreased, the number and percentage of males enrolling in these courses has in fact increased. Therefore, the government argument that financial incentives in the form of scholarships are needed at the front end to encourage more men into starting these courses is based on nothing more than bubbles of thought from the education minister.</para><para>There is also evidence that, while there has been a decline in male primary teachers in government funded schools, the number and percentage of male primary teachers in the non-government sector has increased slightly. This move out of the government sector is compounded by the fact that there is a major exodus of male primary school teachers from the classroom to senior positions in the administration of schools, particularly amongst the ranks of school principals. Submission after submission went on to dispute the government's proposition that just getting more male teachers into primary schools will have some magic impact on the educational outcomes for boys. As I said earlier, there was no evidence provided to show that this is the case. In fact, several submissions argued that evidence based research both here and overseas shows that the quality of teachers is far more important than the gender of the teacher.</para><para>This confirms evidence put before the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission when it considered the initial application by the Catholic Education Office and found no persuasive evidence for allowing a change to the Sex Discrimination Act in order to provide 12 male scholarships. That is what this amendment is all about: 12 male scholarships. The evidence has not changed; the facts have not changed. Yet the government refuses to change its approach to the matter, insisting there is some kind of causal link. </para><para>Labor has been calling on the government to withdraw the bill from the day the idea was first floated as a bubble from the education minister. Rather than this opposition being based on any ideological problem with changing the Sex Discrimination Act, as the government has consistently tried to claim, it is because the bill is simply bad policy and has not little but no merit other than to try to provide a diversion from the fact that the government has completely failed to address the issue of boys' education since it came to office eight years ago.</para><para>The background to the introduction of this bill is as follows, which may give us a little understanding of how we came to be here with this particular bill. In August 2002 the Catholic Education Office in Sydney applied for an exemption under section 44 of the Sex Discrimination Act in order to offer 12 teacher training scholarships to male HSC students. The application for the exemption was considered by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and on 22 February 2003 the commission declined to grant the exemption. This decision was made only four months after the initial application. The CEO was appealing this decision to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Due to a whole range of procedural and internal matters, the hearing date was set for April 2003, as I understand it. The government pre-empted this appeals process by introducing an amendment to the SDA. The CEO publicly stated that they did not seek an amendment to the SDA.</para><para>The Attorney-General was questioned about the reasons for the change. His answer was that he had been asked to make the changes by others. But who are these `others'? It has since been established, as far as our inquiries have led us, that the only person asking him to make these changes was his cohort the Minister for Education, Science and Training. I am happy for the Howard government to tell us otherwise. There were no community groups, no educational institutions and no research bodies urging the Attorney-General to make the changes in the interests of boys' education. It was simply an idea that the minister for education dreamt up as a way to divert attention from his lack of action and to try to attack those who would oppose the measure. All the evidence now points to the fact that the government and the minister for education seriously misjudged the issue and have seriously compromised the integrity of their claims to be doing this in the public interest.</para><para>The government also tried to claim that somehow the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission was at fault for the length of time taken between the original application and the final solution of this matter. However, it is clear from the way that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission dealt with the matter that it was dealt with properly and efficiently. The government should withdraw any inference that there was a pre-emptive strike on the SDA because of the way the matter was handled by HREOC. There was not. In its original decision HREOC recommended that the CEO undertake further investigation of those issues and possible solutions before returning with a new application for consideration. The decision also refers to other options such as offering an equal number of scholarships to men and women as another way of achieving the CEO's aims. </para><para>Since the introduction of the bill on 10 March I understand that new negotiations have been held between HREOC and the CEO resulting in their original application being withdrawn, their appeal to the AAT being withdrawn, a new application being submitted and an exemption being successfully obtained for a five-year period. The full decision is available on the HREOC web site for those who are following the debate. The new application was for—surprise, surprise—24 additional merit based scholarships: 12 for males and 12 for females. This was the position that Labor had flagged as an alternative to what was being sought. This proposal still required the granting of an exemption by HREOC, which it granted on 19 March this year. The commission flagged in its decision that the proposed scholarship scheme will not by itself address the issue related to the gender imbalance in the primary teacher profession and has encouraged the CEO to investigate and implement further non-discriminatory strategies in order to address those issues. This series of events demonstrates two things: that the government's pre-emption of the decision by the AAT and HREOC was completely unnecessary and that the procedure set up within HREOC to deal with such matters is adequate.</para><para>I will now deal with the arguments against supporting the bill. As well as being absolutely clear that we do not support this bill, for all the reasons I outlined earlier, Labor want to make it crystal clear that we do support the objective of getting more men into teaching. Labor will also support sensible and evidence based measures to get more men into teaching, but this particular mechanism chosen by the government will not work. Making changes to the Sex Discrimination Act is not the most effective mechanism for doing this, as it does not deal with the underlying issue of why men are choosing not to enter the teaching profession. Recruitment, pay scales and career opportunities for teachers ought to be the issues under the spotlight here, not sex discrimination legislation. Indeed, we know there is no barrier preventing men from enrolling in teaching courses or from progressing within the teaching profession. If anything, statistics indicate that whilst fewer males are in primary schools a disproportionately large number of men are moving into senior positions within schools, including that of school principal.</para><para>The government's proposal has no developmental impact on the education system, invests nothing in the future of boys' education and does not make any significant attempt to address the real underlying issues. Labor on the other hand has put forward a number of propositions. In contrast to the government, Labor has a five-point plan to address the real problem of getting men back into the teaching profession, particularly at the primary level. It includes establishing a national campaign to attract quality entrants to teaching, targeting men with relevant skills and backgrounds; encouraging more male mentors, including fathers, to work with schools and parents by reading to students and using technology, vocational education, music and drama and sporting activities; having incentives for quality teaching, including for teachers who have the skills needed to improve the learning outcomes for boys; targeting improvements in teaching skills for boys in the Commonwealth professional development program and in the development of national teaching standards; and, lastly, having student discipline and welfare programs, much of which will be targeted at boys.</para><para>Labor have also recently announced further details of our proposed campaign to target boys in years 10, 11 and 12 and in university to promote the benefits of becoming teachers. Our new Buddy Up program, which is a mentoring plan to give primary aged boys contact with men who can act as role models and mentors, will form part of Labor's national mentoring program. The Buddy Up program has been allocated something in the order of $5.7 million over the forward estimates, and another $3 million has been allocated to increase the number of male teachers through our Bright Futures program. These are real initiatives with real and practical benefits for boys in primary school and are consistent with an evidence based approach to the issue. They highlight the fact that the lack of men in the teaching profession is not due to a systemic discrimination or disadvantage that they face in applying for teaching courses or positions but due to men choosing not to enter the profession for other reasons. Labor's five-point plan for quality teachers will be more effective than any attempts by the government to deal with the serious issue of educational outcomes for boys by playing games with amending the Sex Discrimination Act. </para><para>In short, all of the evidence provided to the Senate committee and all the evidence provided to the government shows that this bill is not only unnecessary but also flawed. There is no evidence that it will meet the stated objectives of the government. There is no evidence that providing scholarships will lift the rate of males studying primary school courses. There is no evidence that it will address the gender imbalance among classroom teachers in schools. There is no evidence for why the government should have ignored the recommendation of the earlier <inline font-style="italic">Boys: getting it right</inline> report that recommended against the provision of scholarships to address this issue. The minister for education, I suggest, has been off on a folly—wasting the time of the department in drafting this bill and of the parliament in dealing with this bill when it could have been dealing with other more pressing legislation. In light of all of this, we will not consider supporting the insertion of a permanent exemption of this nature to the SDA when existing provisions can be used. Labor, as I have said, oppose this bill. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>23077</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak against the <inline ref="R1999">Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004</inline>, the reasons for which have already been covered most eloquently by my colleague Senator Ludwig.

The minister would have us believe that he is deeply concerned about the gender demographic of teachers in our schools, especially our public schools. He is particularly fond of telling the story about the gardener who is the only male member of staff in over 200 public schools, and we are supposed to choke on our tea at the news of this shocking development. It sounds as though the minister did, so he has decided to take what he believes is decisive action. He is going to fund some male-only scholarships—$1 million worth in a budget of $50 billion in expenditure—and he intends to amend the Sex Discrimination Act. </para></talk.start><para>This is where the bill comes in. Essentially, it is needed to legalise what is clearly a discriminatory initiative. The Greens reject this approach as being ineffectual, discriminatory and cheap. The Greens recognise that a lack of male teachers, particularly in our primary classrooms, is worthy of our concern; the Commonwealth may even be justified in acting to address the situation. But, assuming that this is a problem worthy of our action, it will not seriously be addressed by the measures announced by the minister. If he were serious, he would address the well-recognised disincentives to entry into the teaching profession: poor pay, low status of the profession and, particularly for male students, concerns over child protection issues. But the minister has instead tossed a relatively tiny amount of money at some scholarships whilst creating a fuss over discrimination to get some headlines.</para><para>As I said, this is little more than a legislative stunt; but we have to deal with the bill, and the Greens have many concerns. The Greens do not support the minister's notion that the relative lack of male teachers is a national emergency but we recognise that the failure of the profession to attract more male students is symptomatic of broader problems that public school teachers in particular have had to endure, including pay and status under this government. We are not opposed to moves that encourage more men into teaching but what is much more important—and this came up numerous times during the committee hearings into the bill—is the need to attract high-quality students into the profession. As the committee report into the bill notes:</para><quote><para>At the hearing, Dr Ken Rowe from the ACER—</para></quote><para>the Australian Council for Educational Research—</para><quote><para>gave an example of an extensive, long-term strategic program in a number of Scandinavian countries to address the teacher shortage issue. Remuneration is part of the program, with teachers now paid up to 2.5 times higher than their Australian counterparts. As a result, in these countries it is actually harder to get into teaching than medicine or law courses, with a consequential increase in the quality of the teaching staff. </para></quote><para>I am sure that we can all remember our formative years as primary school students and that we remember our teachers. What is usually front and centre in this memory is not whether the teacher was male or female but whether or not they were good, bad or indifferent. Our anecdotal evidence is backed up by many evidence based studies. The committee report reveals that several submissions argued that evidence based research, both here and internationally, suggests that the quality of the teacher is far more important than the gender of the teacher. The Australian Council for Educational Research, in its submission, notes that the quality of teaching and learning provision are by far the most salient influences on students' cognitive, effective and behavioural outcomes of schooling, not teacher gender. Interestingly given all the fuss on this issue, this appears to be the government's view also. In the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Training report <inline font-style="italic">Boys</inline>: <inline font-style="italic">getting</inline><inline font-style="italic">it</inline><inline font-style="italic">right</inline> it was stated:</para><quote><para>... the quality of the teacher is more important than the gender of teacher ... many teachers recognise the positive effect the right type of men can have when they work with boys, but the emphasis is on the right kind of men.</para></quote><para>Why shouldn't it be a matter of commonsense? As Dr Ken Rowe from the Australian Council for Educational Research said:</para><quote><para>... it does not matter a hoot whether or not the teacher is male or female; it depends on the quality of the teaching ... providing teaching scholarships for persons of one gender is missing the whole point.</para></quote><para>But clearly the minister was not convinced. After all, why should we let commonsense get in the way of a classic emotive wedge issue just prior to an election? The Catholic Education Office played a role in sparking this debate but they have taken a more sensible approach than the minister through their discussions with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. There was an original application from the Catholic Education Office for exemption from the Sex Discrimination Act, to offer male-only scholarships. This kicked off a round of handwringing from the minister's office. That application was, quite rightly, rejected by HREOC on the obvious grounds that men are clearly not discriminated against in attempts to enter the teaching profession and therefore the application of an obviously discriminatory measure is not justified on the allowable basis that it addresses an existing discrimination. </para><para>The HREOC judgment went on to note that the aims of the scholarship scheme proposed by the Catholic Education Office would not in fact be achieved by that approach. It is discriminatory and it will not work. HREOC then suggested that the Catholic Education Office might think of other ways to address their concerns and, as a result, they have applied to offer gender specific scholarships that are equally divided between male and female students. HREOC have approved this move, and so you would think that would be the end of the matter. No. Enter the minister from stage right, sniffing the opportunity to take up the cudgel against the minister's favourite foe, political correctness. Dr Nelson, without reference to the Catholic Education Office, pledged to introduce legislation to overturn HREOC's first decision. What followed has been a massive waste of parliament's time dealing with this bill in the wake of numerous media statements, mostly about the plight of gardeners, by the minister in his attempt to address boys' issues decisively. All this of course must leave the excellent, talented and hardworking female teachers in our public schools feeling somewhat bruised and bemused by the implied slur on their abilities. But Dr Nelson is not fair dinkum. We know this by the cheapness of his scholarship package—just $1 million that would translate into 500 scholarships to male teachers if this bill passes, which, of course, it will not. The minister will not mind too much because the media job has been done. He will call the opposition parties names and pretend to be the champion of male interests, thwarted by dastardly do-gooders.</para><para>The minister and this government are not prepared to do what really needs to be done to address the real problem with teacher recruitment. The findings of the HREOC report set out the key problems: `the status of teachers in the community, child protection issues and the pay and conditions of teachers relative to other occupations'. The Australian Education Union endorses this view, listing remuneration, physical conditions, class sizes, workload, appropriate in-service training and having opportunity for study leave and professional development as the key problems.</para><para>In my home state of New South Wales the Vincent inquiry into public education reiterated these observations, whilst also noting that the ageing of the teaching work force puts further pressure on governments to address the need to recruit more, good students to the teaching profession. The government can do something about it. It is well within the powers of the minister and his cabinet colleagues to address the key issue of pay. The Vincent inquiry notes:</para><quote><para>Salaries increased by only 76 per cent of the average increase in weekly earnings for males in all occupations during the period 1972-88. Between 1988 and 2002, when the increase in teachers' pay was 21 per cent less than the increase in average male weekly earnings. Between 1972 and 1988 the increase in teachers' salaries was 34 per cent less than the increase in average female earnings. During the period 1988-02 the increase in teachers' pay was 14 per cent less than the increase in average female earnings. </para></quote><para>This is the core issue for teachers' morale and the major disincentive for prospective students. As Vincent notes, the issue is not simply one of personal cash flow. Salary goes to the heart of the status of the profession, which has seen its standing eroded over the last 20 years or so as its relative salary levels have been eroded. Whilst the states are largely responsible for the funding of public schools, the Commonwealth also has a major role to play. But the government and this minister have deliberately downplayed that responsibility. Commonwealth funding to public schools, as a share of total Commonwealth schools funding, has declined from over 40 per cent—when the coalition first came to office—and in the mid-1970s from over 70 per cent to the record low of 28 per cent now. In the meantime, the funding that the Commonwealth has directed to the private sector has grown exponentially. This disturbing trend continued in the budget last night. Notwithstanding a couple of million dollars for another phoney war against political correctness—the minister's values program—public schools have no new money. In comparison, the private sector have scored a $360 million windfall over the next four years.</para><para>The government spent over $50 billion in budget measures but provided no new money for public schools. That means that for the 70 per cent of school communities in Australia, there is no new money. It does not sound to me very much like a commitment to teachers and students. It does not sound like the actions of a government that has a genuine interest in the recruitment of more good students to teaching or in even attracting more males into the profession. The single most effective measure that the government could have taken to address this advertised concern would have been to significantly boost the public schools budget, allowing salaries to rise. But it is not just a lack of funds from the Commonwealth to public schools that puts the lie to the minister's expressions of concern; the government actively campaigns to undermine the status of public schools and, by extension, their teaching staff.</para><para>We have seen the Prime Minister criticise what he calls `political correctness' and `a lack of values' and we have seen constant criticism of teaching unions who work hard to maintain and improve the status of teachers and the quality of our public schools. The Prime Minister has also invested his prestige in fronting generous funding announcements for the private school system, leaving parents watching in no doubt as to which system of schooling the government endorse. The government, who have undermined the funding of public schools, who have lauded their competitors and bankrolled their expansion and who have publicly and prominently belittled public school values and teaching practices, are expecting us to believe that they are genuinely concerned about attracting better students into the profession.</para><para>The Greens welcome the measures dealt with in the committee report that are targeted at achieving this goal. We appreciate the steps taken that were described in the committee hearings by the Victorian Department of Education and Training to actively promote teaching as a profession and to set up schemes to attract non-teaching professionals into teacher training and to encourage ex-teachers to re-enter the profession. But the Greens reiterate the need to address the core issue of funding in order to improve salaries, resources and class sizes and therefore morale, status and career development opportunities. At a federal level, that means opposing further increases in funding to private schools whilst the public sector suffers in comparison. The Greens will oppose the move contained in last night's budget, instead calling for a redirection of those funds into the public school sector. We also call for an end to the funding of the wealthiest private schools, a saving of around $1.5 billion over the next four years and for those funds to go directly into priority public school programs. </para><para>These are the kinds of steps that are needed if we are to make real progress in rebuilding the status and conditions of teachers and in recruitment. But while the minister is more interested in media friendly wedge issues, while he is more concerned with peddling the kind of legislative stunt that we are dealing with today, this important priority, the future of public education, will continue to be overlooked by this government. The Greens do not support this bill. It is mischievous, needless and discriminatory, and it will not work. It thoroughly deserves the defeat it looks set to suffer in the Senate. If only we could be voting for a bill that puts more money into our public schools, then we would really be addressing this issue.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>23081</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1999">Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004</inline> seeks to amend the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. In doing so it undermines the core purpose of the act, which is to address discrimination and disadvantage. There is no evidence to suggest that the difference between the numbers of men and women employed as teachers is in any way based on gender discrimination or disadvantage, nor is there evidence to support the view that any gap in educational outcomes between girls and boys is because of a lack of male teachers in schools. So, in my view, there is simply no sustainable argument that can justify such an amendment to such a critical act.</para></talk.start><para>A number of things have been said by the government, which are not based in fact and for which there is no evidence, about why this bill is necessary. If this is the best the government can do, I would argue that it has no interest in addressing the issues it claims will be ameliorated as set out in this bill. Let us look at what the government claims the bill is intended to do. The government claims that it addresses the so-called crisis of masculinity, that it is aimed at addressing perceived failures of our education system to meet the needs of boys, that increasing the number of male teachers will help turn around this so-called crisis and the perceived failing, and that discriminating against women by offering scholarships only to men will address the shortage of male teachers in our schools.</para><para>I believe the government is wrong on all counts. This bill does nothing to address the so-called crisis of masculinity. It is undoubtedly true that many men, particularly men who have traditionally found work in male-dominated, low-skilled jobs, are struggling to find their place in today's society. It is also true that relationship breakdown is causing considerable distress for many men, women and children in our community, and in particular many men are feeling aggrieved at how they perceive they are treated by the legal system following a relationship breakdown. These are challenges our society needs to face and issues that need to be addressed, but this bill does nothing in respect of these matters.</para><para>I would also argue that the so-called crisis of masculinity stems in large part from our community's belated rejection of the misuse of power and violence against women, with the result that some men are having to find new ways of existing and behaving in the world. I would like to pay tribute here to comments made by Senator Greig, who is in the chamber, in the media about this whole argument. I hope he intends to go to this issue again in his contribution. However, this government is not interested in addressing any of those issues. There was a perfect opportunity for the government to address some of the issues with the fully-funded, ready to release campaign against domestic violence, which was pulled out at the last minute on completely spurious grounds. If this is as good as it gets, the government is just not serious. </para><para>In October 2002 the report on the inquiry into the education of boys, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Boys: getting it r</inline><inline font-style="italic">ight</inline>, was tabled in the parliament. Dr Brendan Nelson chaired that inquiry, and I would suggest that the government go back to have another look at it. The report provides 24 recommendations that go to a range of different solutions that could be pursued. However, it is notable that this report does not recommend changing the Sex Discrimination Act. It is fairly obvious that what we have is a perceived quick fix to a particular circumstance that provides no real solution to the problems or to the issues raised.</para><para>So let us look at what the government could have done if it were serious in addressing the imbalance in the numbers of male and female teachers, and the effect of that imbalance on the education of male school students in particular. The funding of extra university places could have assisted approximately 2,700 men in 2004 to undertake further education in teaching, but the Howard government refused this extra funding. In fact, since 1997 the Howard government has turned away approximately 15,000 men from teaching. Labor, on the other hand, have a comprehensive plan to get more men teaching in our schools and to establish a mentoring plan to give primary aged children access to male role models and mentors.</para><para>We know that this government is quite keen to pursue several policies that have been released by Labor this year, and perhaps it could pick up a few initiatives that we have outlined with respect to this issue. We believe we have a solid plan to get more male teachers into primary schools, including a national campaign to attract and target quality entrants to teaching and to promote the benefits of teaching to boys in their later high school years and at university. Labor want to get the best teachers into schools and will do this by creating career pathways and raising the profile and status of teaching as a profession for boys. Furthermore, we aim to keep these men teaching by targeting improvements in teaching skills and implementing new financial and professional incentives.</para><para>We have also addressed the so-called crisis of masculinity through the development of a mentoring plan for primary school children, as I mentioned before. This includes an awareness campaign to encourage fathers and other men in the community such as sporting figures and community leaders to participate in school activities and to promote the value of mentoring boys. We plan by the end of 2006 to have 10,000 new mentors trained and practising. I believe these initiatives provide real solutions as they address the real issues.</para><para>An amendment to the Sex Discrimination Act does not tackle the real issues in either the short or the long term. Amending the act provides no solution to the gender imbalance or the issues confronting teachers. It will not be the ability to get a male only scholarship that will encourage men into the teaching profession, rather it will be by trying to tackle the serious factors of discouragement that currently exist, such as addressing the issues of remuneration, creating inducements to retain men in teaching and offering more attractive career paths to attract new teachers. </para><para>So let us look at another of the claims that underpins the introduction of this bill. There is a perception that our education system is failing boys and that boys are not achieving in schools. What that actually means, it seems, is that they are not achieving at the same rate as girls. The Australian Education Union's submission to the inquiry pointed out—and they in turn were quoting the Australian Secondary Principals Association's submission to the inquiry into the education of boys—that boys' underperformance and the extent of it:</para><quote><para>... reflect a trend identified in most northern European based cultures. The United Kingdom Foundation for Educational Research project `An Investigation into Gender Differences in Achievement' has been a landmark report in this area and many of its observations are very pertinent to this Inquiry.</para></quote><para>The ASPA's submission points out that, in keeping with the findings of this project in Australia, boys' achievement have not declined over the past 20 years. In fact boys' achievement levels have risen and continue to rise. The `problem' it seems, is that girls' attainment rates have risen at a faster rate. The ASPA asks, `What will constitute an acceptable rate of improvement for boys? Are we intending that boys must achieve as well as girls, when this has in fact never been the case?'</para><para>The ASPA also points out another intriguing finding of the UK report: `this Report has found that where schools have introduced best practice programs explicitly designed to improve the achievement of boys, it has achieved that end. However, the performance gap between girls and boys at these schools widened, as girls outcomes improved at a more rapid rate than before'. So it would seem that even where you base your attempts to improve boys' achievement rates on proven interventions, based on sound curriculum and quality teaching, the achievement gap does not necessarily narrow. But the government does not care about proven interventions or evidence, as this bill shows. I ask: where is the evidence that increasing the number of male teachers will in any way address boys' performance? Every report and every expert in this field has said that it is quality teaching not the gender of the teacher that matters.</para><para>Even the government's own inquiry—which I alluded to before—into boy's education found that, and yet the government begs to differ. Now the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Brendan Nelson, who chaired that inquiry, seems to have had a damascene revelation along the way different from that which was articulated in his report. Not only that, but this government suggests that teachers are needed to somehow be substitute fathers for boys—not necessarily for girls it would seem. As if a teacher whose role it is to teach can somehow compensate for fathers who are absent for whatever reason, or in some way be role models for boys. As PhD candidate Janet Smith wrote in her submission to the inquiry into this bill based on her research into the experience of male primary school teachers:</para><quote><para>The current demands for more male primary teachers erroneously conflates parenting and teaching. This is extremely confusing for male primary teachers who regard themselves as teachers and not substitute parents. If boys need more male role models, attention should perhaps be focused on greater involvement of fathers and other significant men in their lives. It is unrealistic for male primary teachers to be expected to be role models and father substitutes.</para></quote><para>However, in spite of all I have said, there may still be an argument for trying to attract more young men into teaching. I think that argument may well exist along the lines that schools, like our police forces, our medical profession and, dare I say, our parliaments should in their make-up reflect the make-up of our society. I therefore look forward to the Prime Minister's support for the introduction of an affirmative action policy for the preselection of Liberal Party candidates for public office. But I digress. Assuming we need to attract more men into teaching, is changing the Sex Discrimination Act so that we can discriminate against women and offer scholarships only to men the way to achieve that? Again, the glaring answer from anyone in a position to know is a resounding no. Again, I will quote from Janet Smith whose research leads her to argue: </para><quote><para>Changes to the Sex Discrimination Act would be justified if it could be shown that there are existing barriers to males becoming primary school teachers. This does not currently appear to be the case as the statistics reveal an increase in the number of males commencing university degrees to become primary school teachers over the past decade. There is also evidence that male primary teachers already receive positive discrimination when applying for jobs, as primary schools are so keen to employ more males.</para></quote><para>Whilst I do not necessarily agree that changes definitely would be justified, the basic argument is clear and irrefutable. It is not issues of discrimination or disadvantage that are stopping men from entering the teaching profession; therefore there are no grounds to use the Sex Discrimination Act to address any imbalance in numbers. In fact, one might suggest that, if the government wants to look at the issue of discrimination within the teaching profession, they could well be advised to investigate the disproportionate number of men in promoted positions, positions that often take them right out of the classroom and into a managerial capacity. Perhaps a few women teachers might suggest that a way of increasing the number of male teachers is to prevent men from being promoted over the heads of their female colleagues and out of the classroom, therefore leaving fewer male teachers. But no-one would consider that acceptable, would they?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator Patterson</name></talker><para>—Are you suggesting that for nursing?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name></talker><para>—Anyway, regardless of the intent, amending the Sex Discrimination Act and offering scholarships to men only will not increase the number of male teachers because it fails to address a couple of fundamental issues. Men are not attracted to teaching it seems—based on research, not anecdote—because teaching is perceived as `women's work'—and I note the comments of Senator Patterson, earlier—and as such has been traditionally undervalued and underpaid; hence this whole string of work value cases over the years. Compounding the problem is the perception that men entering teaching are somehow suspect in the light of growing awareness about sexual abuse of children. Discriminating against women will address neither of these issues. I have articulated some of the things that could have been done and that we intend to do if elected.</para></talk.start></continue><para>If this government were serious about addressing attainment levels in schools, it would look to addressing the most significant barrier to achievement, and that is socioeconomic status. But how does this government deal with that issue? It deals with it by pouring money into elite private schools and impoverishing the struggling public schools around this country. I cannot help but be left with the impression that this government has no intention of truly addressing issues to do with educational achievement of boys. Rather, it seems that it has picked up on a bit of internal polling, belatedly realising that education is seen as a key issue by the community and that it is way behind Labor in terms of having any cohesive plan—not assisted at all by the budget yesterday—or commitment to addressing the issue. So it has fallen back on the old trick of throwing up a smokescreen and pandering to the members of our community who are feeling disaffected and who want a target to blame for their feelings. So it is back to wedge politics 101—`Who can we blame?'—whilst doing nothing to seriously address the underlying issues. Will it be migrants, homosexuals, Aborigines? No, this time let us blame women. If only there were fewer women teachers, boys would be doing better. Well that is simply not good enough and it simply shows how tired and bereft of ideas and leadership this government is. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator Patterson</name></talker><para>—That is not true!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name></talker><para>—We will not be supporting this bill because it will not achieve anything for boys' education and, Senator Patterson, you know it.

However, let me signal from the outset that this is a bill which the Democrats will not be supporting. </para></talk.start><para>In his second reading speech, the Attorney-General outlined his rationale for the bill. He cited the fact that boys' education outcomes are falling behind those of girls and directly linked this problem to an imbalance between male and female teachers and a lack of male role models in schools. The Attorney went on to outline that teaching is not an attractive career option for men because of salary concerns and fear of child abuse allegations, and concluded that this bill is a vital measure to address the gender imbalance for the benefit of all students. The Democrats do not agree with that, and the evidence presented to the inquiry—which I attended and participated in—by numerous experts in the field also offers little, if anything, to support the Attorney-General's assertions.</para><para>In seeking to justify the need for this bill, the government has cobbled together a series of assorted facts and questionable half-truths to suggest that boys' under achievement and men's disinterest in teaching will be a step closer to resolution if the Sex Discrimination Act, or the SDA, is amended to allow male-only scholarships. In short, the government's analysis is simplistic, flawed and heavily reliant on a sexist analysis and gender stereotypes that we believe are contributing to the problem in the first place.</para><para>The government first raised the prospect of this bill in response to an unsuccessful application by the Catholic Education Office to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to be granted an exemption under the SDA that would allow it to offer male-only scholarships. HREOC denied that request. It found that, while it is true that there is a significant gender imbalance in the teaching profession, it could not be said that this was the result of discrimination. In fact, the reverse was the case: men tend to be overrepresented in positions of higher pay and greater authority. According to Janet Smith, a lecturer at the University of Canberra who has recently completed a doctoral thesis on this subject, the relative shortage of male teachers confers a range of benefits that include positive discrimination in employment and promotion, being mentored, noticed and appreciated, and developing specialisations. There is no evidence that the shortage of male teachers is the result of discrimination. In fact the contrary is true, and this marks the first reason why we Democrats oppose the bill. </para><para>Our second reason for opposing the bill is that the SDA marks a hard-won benchmark of protection against discrimination on the grounds of sex. To now amend that act in response to an issue that in itself is not the result of discrimination seriously undermines the act, is in conflict with long-established principles of equality and risks placing Australia in contravention of international law. This position is supported by HREOC, the Victorian Institute of Teaching, the Law Institute of Victoria, the Australian Education Union, the Independent Education Union of Australia, the WA Equal Opportunity Commission and the Australian Council for Educational Research. Rather than increasing the level of positive discrimination for men, the Australian Democrats have some sympathy for the view that addressing the apparent discrimination resulting in women's underrepresentation in the higher paid, non-teaching positions may be more effective. </para><para>Our third reason for opposing the bill is that in its original finding in the CEO case—the Catholic Education Office case—HREOC found that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that scholarships would have any discernible impact on the gender imbalance in the teaching profession. This was because the reasons for the imbalance could be reduced to three primary factors—as acknowledged by the Attorney-General in the other place, the <inline font-style="italic">Boys: getting it right </inline>report and submitters to the Senate inquiry looking into the bill. The status of teachers in the community, pay and conditions, and fears in relation to child protection issues all combine to make teaching an unattractive proposition to many men. </para><para>Most of the evidence presented to the Senate inquiry highlighted that the status, pay and condition issues are largely a consequence of teaching being seen as women's work. The Australian Education Union said that where professions have traditionally been dominated by women and seen as the work of nurturers, it has resulted in not only low professional status but also equally low remuneration. Teachers have been critical of wage levels for many years and some have quite rightly questioned why, now that there is a focus on men in the classroom, wages for teachers have suddenly been recognised as an important issue when women have been raising the issue of low pay in traditionally female occupations for many years.</para><para>We contend that offering scholarships of just a few thousand dollars to men will do absolutely nothing to change the status, pay or conditions and nor will it remedy the fact that, although the number of men entering education is currently on the increase, evidence indicates that few are staying to complete the course. It will do nothing to address the fact that the government's appalling higher education policies mean that this year alone almost 10,000 applicants—or 40 per cent of applicants—failed to secure a place in teaching at Australian universities. And a scholarship will not do much to respond to the issues of child protection fears. I was quite astonished and disappointed at how little focus was brought to that issue in the committee's inquiry. A range of strategies were identified, many valid, to respond to other factors that prevent men choosing teaching as a career—such as status and pay—but very little consideration was given to strategies to address child protection. In fact, the issue was not even explicitly referred to in the committee's findings.</para><para>What is wrong with a society in which so much community debate focuses on the desired role of men as fathers and teachers, identifies—rather sadly—that men fear having contact with children for fear of being labelled and then fails to seriously approach the issue? I have previously argued that this blindness amounts to a national psychosis that has at its base sexism and homophobia—and I am not alone in drawing that comparison. Janet Smith, from the University of Canberra, whom I referred to earlier, talks about these issues in relation to male teachers by referring to teaching as a `pink collar' profession for men. One of the problems that she sees is that men avoid teaching—and by my own extrapolation a range of other careers and activities—because by choosing to work in a feminine profession or to take up other stereotypical feminine pursuits they are seen to be homosexual. Additionally, by choosing to work with children, men are often viewed with suspicion and as potential child molesters.  </para><para>Of course, historically, homosexuality and paedophilia have often been seen to amount to the same thing. Leading the charge in this respect has most often been the Catholic Church—the very organisation instigating changes to the SDA to address the apparent shortage of male teachers. The Catholic Church has successfully ensured that the Sex Discrimination Act, the Workplace Relations Act and state based antidiscrimination legislation contain exemptions so that it can continue to discriminate in employment and in education on the grounds of sexuality. The Catholic Church has been at the forefront of lobbying against same-sex adoption, relationship recognition and freedom from discrimination. It almost always argues on the grounds of the safety and protection of children. In doing so, the Catholic Church has been guilty of contributing to the very system that also stops many men from choosing teaching as a profession. </para><para>Would-be male teachers are caught in an inescapable bind that, on the one hand, requires them to demonstrate more stereotypically feminine, caring and nurturing characteristics in their work with children but, on the other hand, leaves them open to suspicion as they fulfil that less than manly, possibly gay, possibly paedophilic, role. Yet, unbelievably and contradictorily, they are also expected to be good, strong male role models for boys. They cannot win, and it is hardly surprising that many of them stay away in droves. Interestingly, nowhere is this desired masculinity defined; but it is certainly desired to be heterosexual in nature, at least in church schools.</para><para>The subtext to the government's argument in favour of heterosexual male role models in schools can also be found in its arguments about same-sex parenting and single parent families—that is, there is some risk to boys that they will not grow up to be real men if their role models are too female or possibly gay. The fear is that boys taught by women will be effeminised and will fail to develop strong, male identities because of a lack of a strong, male role model. The reality is that, as long as these ridiculous notions about masculinity and male role modelling are reinforced, boys will fail to strive for academic excellence rather than for more stereotypically masculine pursuits like sport and physical bravado. To do otherwise, they will run the risk of being perceived as effeminate or gay; and men will fail to choose teaching as a career option, lest they be branded as gay or suspected of paedophilia.</para><para>At any rate, and hardly surprisingly, all evidence to the inquiry questioned the validity of the role model argument. What is clear is that it is the quality of teachers and parents, not their gender, that is the defining difference in a child's development. For these reasons, the Australian Democrats will not be supporting this bill. The bill undermines the integrity of the SDA in order to respond to an issue that has no basis in discrimination. The bill will not address the core reasons men do not enter the teaching profession—status, pay and child protection issues. The bill is based on a philosophy that is sexist and homophobic and contrary to the evidence. Instead, the Democrats have recommended that strategies identified in the committee inquiry process that respond to issues of status and pay be further explored. </para><para>In order to address those issues I have highlighted here regarding the detrimental effect of rigid gender role enforcement and discrimination, keeping gay teachers out of schools, the Democrats will be moving a number of amendments to the bill. We will be moving an amendment that extends the definition of `sex' in the Sex Discrimination Act to include sexual orientation. This definition is consistent with two United Nations Human Rights Committee cases. The first, from 1994, was the case of Toonen v. Australia, which led to the overturning of Tasmania's antigay laws, and more recently there was the finding last year in the case of Young v. Australia. In both cases, the UNHRC ruled that the definition of `sex' in articles 2 and 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights includes sexual orientation in matters of freedom from discrimination. We will also be moving amendments to change the definition of `man' and `woman' in the act to ensure it responds appropriately to alternative gender identities. </para><para>Finally, we will seek to amend section 38 of the SDA, which provides religious groups with employment exemptions in education, to now limit those exceptions to instances where that discrimination is in order to better enable the institution to be conducted in accordance with those religious tenets, beliefs and teachings. This amendment will look at the capacity for an educational institution to conduct its religious activities rather than whether an individual's religious susceptibilities might be injured.</para><para>We regard it as totally unacceptable that a religious organisation, be it Catholic or otherwise, should have the capacity to discriminate against the employment of some men because they happen to be gay, or perceived to be so, and then to apply for further exemptions under the act to discriminate in favour of employing others to make up the shortfall. Our amendments will ensure this cannot occur and will be one more step towards ensuring that sanctioned homophobia and the linking of homosexuality to paedophilia are removed from law. We Democrats believe that a cross-section of people should be found in all walks of life. This bill does nothing to achieve that. The committee clearly found that there were no legal barriers or specific discrimination preventing men from entering teaching. Therefore this bill is a nonsense in that it proposes to remove hurdles of discrimination that do not exist.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES</title><type>Notices</type><page.no>23088</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Presentation</title><page.no>23088</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>23088</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Manager of Government Business in the Senate</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the provisions of paragraphs (5), (6) and (8) of standing order 111 not apply to the following bills, allowing them to be considered during this period of sittings:</para></motion><para>Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (More Help for Families—One-off Payments) Bill 2004, and the</para><para>Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (More Help for Families—Increased Payments) Bill 2004.</para><para>I table statements of reasons justifying the need for these bills to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statements incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The statements read as follows—</inline></para><para>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MORE HELP FOR FAMILIES—ONE-OFF PAYMENTS) BILL 2004 </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Purpose of the Bill </inline></para><para>The Bill provides for the payment of the following one-off payments to families and carers who meet certain eligibility conditions on Budget night:</para><para>	a one-off payment to families of $600 per child;</para><para>	a one-off payment of $1000 to carers in receipt of carer payment;</para><para>	a one-off payment to carers of $600 for each care receiver for whom they are receiving carer allowance.</para><para>The one-off payments will be exempt from tax.</para><para>The Bill also provides for the establishment of an administrative scheme, by disallowable instrument, to provide payments in circumstances where the statutory one-off payments regime does not produce an appropriate result. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Reasons for Urgency</inline></para><para>Passage is required as a matter of urgency to enable the one-off payments to be made by the end of June 2004.</para><para>(Circulated by authority of the Minister for Family and Community Services)</para><para>—————</para><para>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MORE HELP FOR FAMILIES—INCREASED PAYMENTS) BILL 2004 </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Purpose of the Bill </inline></para><para>The Bill amends the family assistance law to:</para><para>	provide an ongoing increase in the maximum and base rates of family tax benefit (Part A) of $600 annually for each FTB child, to be paid on income reconciliation;</para><para>	reduce the income test taper rate for the maximum rate of Family Tax Benefit Part A, from 30 cents in the dollar to 20 cents in the dollar;</para><para>	introduce a new maternity payment of $3000 payable as a lump sum regardless of income from 1 July 2004;</para><para>	reduce the rate at which family tax benefit Part B is withdrawn under the income test, from 30 cents in the dollar to 20 cents in the dollar;</para><para>	increase the amount of income a secondary earner in a partnered relationship can earn before entitlement to family tax benefit Part B is affected, from $1825 to $4000 annually. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Reasons for Urgency</inline></para><para>The measures in the Bill commence on 1 July 2004.

As I rise in the Senate, I want to acknowledge the friendship and support of many people in the Liberal Party, without whom I would not have the opportunity and honour to represent my state and my party in the national parliament.

Richard Alston: 20 years at the bar, Victorian party president, a teacher of disadvantaged kids, aid advocate, Senate deputy leader, cabinet minister and Australia's longest serving communications minister. Richard has been a great servant of his party, his state and the nation. I want to record my gratitude for his support and guidance. Richard will be regarded in his post-parliamentary life as one of Australia's great senators and one of the substantial figures of Australian politics.</para><para>In many respects I do not come to this place with a typically Liberal family background. My aunt and uncle, I am afraid to admit, were political staffers in the Whitlam and Hawke-Keating governments. And my grandfather, Bert Fifield, served for more than 20 years as Federal Secretary and New South Wales President of the Printing and Kindred Industries Union. A left factional convenor from the other side of this chamber even gave the eulogy at his funeral. The turning point in my family's political views came when Prime Minister Chifley endeavoured to nationalise the private banks. My parents, both bank employees, saw that Labor was inherently opposed to enterprise and choice. They taught me early: do not look at what Labor says, look at what Labor does.</para><para>Mr President, I stand in this place as a Liberal because I am committed to opportunity and to choice. Each of us has our own world view—a frame of reference that informs the decisions we make—but, as legislators, we do not have the right to simply vote to impose our views on the community. We all have free will. The expression of that may not always please us, but it is the right of every Australian to exercise it. That is why in this place I will be influenced, but not driven by, my own personal convictions. My inclination will be towards maximising economic and personal liberty for Australians.</para><para>I have worked in politics for 15 years in and around the New South Wales, Victorian and Commonwealth parliaments. It is a profession of which I am proud. But the knowledge I have gained and the experiences I have had outside my professional life have shaped me and my approach to public life as much as those within—like those of my parents. Neither went beyond the third year of high school, but dad was fortunate to attend a selective high school, Fort Street High, in Sydney. Fort Street was an avenue of opportunity for working-class kids. It produced Neville Wran, Garfield Barwick, John Kerr and Edmund Barton. Through education it gave opportunity to working-class kids to become premiers, chief justices, governors-general and prime ministers. Although dad left school in year 9 to get a job at the end of the war, his schooling still afforded him great opportunities. That is why I am a Liberal today—because I know the importance of opportunity. </para><para>Education will always be an area where the Liberal Party and the Labor Party differ greatly. It is where the philosophical battle will play out most clearly. As Liberals, we stand for maximising choice; we stand for maximising opportunity. As a coalition government, we need to continually look for ways to maximise opportunity and to fight for it when it is being restricted. That is why I am passionate about the role of selective high schools in Australia. Opportunities are being lost in our state school systems through the failure of the states to establish schools based on achievement and excellence. Parents, above all, want choice. Every parent recognises the value of good teachers and good schools. They want choice between a range of quality education options. They want choice between a strong independent sector and a strong government sector. But parents also want, and students deserve, choice within these two sectors. There are a wide range of options within the independent sector, but choices are far more limited within the state sector.</para><para>Since 1996 enrolments in independent schools have increased by 13.3 per cent, while enrolments in state schools have increased by only 1.6 per cent. These statistics merely reflect parental choice. The Commonwealth's financial contribution to education facilitates choice. If the Australian government did not support the independent school sector, access would be confined to an elite, wealthy minority. Many of Australia's small, modest, independent schools would not be able to survive. Choice would be denied and the cost to the public purse would grow exponentially.</para><para>There are parents who, regardless of the choices available and standards within the state system, choose to send their children to an independent school. They do so because of personal philosophy, religion, family history, tradition. There are others who only send their children to independent schools because they feel the public system does not have the same commitment to excellence or sufficient choice in the types of schools on offer. For many parents today, the government sector is not offering the range of options for which they are looking and which they are entitled to expect.</para><para>Both independent and state schools must cater for students of all aptitudes, from gifted pupils to those with learning difficulties. Both ends of the spectrum represent specific needs and all students deserve the right environment to achieve their potential. Most Australian state governments do not willingly support a culture of achievement in their secondary schools—schools that foster and embrace excellence or which specialise in a particular discipline: music, sport, science, agriculture or technology. Most states do not even offer academically selective state high schools—those schools with an enrolment policy based on academic achievement and entrance exams.</para><para>Selective high schools are one way that states can provide a high-quality public alternative to independent schools and offer opportunities to students on the basis of merit, regardless of means. New South Wales has historically enjoyed a far more diverse state secondary school system than the other states. For instance, New South Wales has 17 fully selective high schools, seven high schools with selective classes and four agricultural high schools offering selective placements—in total, 28 high schools with a selective element. Some of these are general selective high schools like Sydney Boys High. Others, such as James Ruse Agricultural High, are centres of excellence and are consistently among the top academic schools in the state. James Ruse defies the stereotype of great academic schools. It is co-educational, it is a state school, it is in an outer suburb and it specialises in agriculture. It does not fit the stereotype we have in our mind of the great academic school: we think private, single sex, in an inner-city suburb and definitely not agricultural. </para><para>The only other state with fully selective high schools, Victoria, has just two: Melbourne High for boys and Mac.Robertson for girls. Both are exemplary schools whose students consistently perform among the best in the year 12 exams. But there are only two of those schools for Victoria. New South Wales also has centres of excellence in particular disciplines such as Cherrybrook Technology High, Conservatorium High and Newtown High School of the Performing Arts. The conservatorium and Newtown are not selective in an academic sense but do require auditions and interviews. There is a focus on excellence and achievement in a particular discipline.</para><para>The failure of the Australian state school system to provide a comprehensive range of merit based selective schools and centres of excellence is a national outrage. This is not the fault of principals, though. It is not the fault of teachers. State educators do incredibly well within the narrow confines imposed by the states. It is up to the state governments to have the vision to put the right framework in place to allow teachers to do their best for their students. State governments around Australia have been too terrified to claim and use the word `excellence'. They have been scared of the teacher unions and of being tagged as `elitist', as if aspiration is something to be ashamed of rather than something to be nurtured and encouraged.</para><para>Selective schools have served for over a century and a half as a ladder for talented kids regardless of means, regardless of background. I use the word `ladder' deliberately because Labor have no political copyright on it. It is easy to use and appropriate the language of merit and hope; it is much harder to have the courage to adopt policies that give expression and meaning to the rhetoric. Selective schools are an avenue of opportunity, but they are under threat from Labor. The New South Wales government has received a report calling for the dismantling of many of its selective schools. This must not happen. There is no lack of money in state government coffers to establish and maintain selective high schools and centres of excellence. But there is a lack of will on the part of state government leaders. This lack of will is denying students opportunity, it is denying parents choice and it is denying our community the strong and vital public education sector it deserves. It is strong competition between schools, between school sectors and within school sectors that will strengthen both state and independent education.</para><para>We know from the <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational Report</inline> of 2002 that demographic trends mean Australia will be reliant upon relatively fewer in the work force to finance the needs of an ageing population. We will be expecting more from future generations. In this context, second best for our students will not be an option. Why should state students put up with a monochromatic secondary school system, particularly in the state of Victoria? Why not have selective high schools, agricultural high schools, technology high schools, performing arts high schools, comprehensive high schools, co-educational high schools and single-sex high schools? What is wrong with each school having its own character, its own identity and its own areas of specialty?</para><para>Let's embrace choice, let's embrace variety, let's embrace difference and excellence. Let's even bring back the old `tech schools' in Victoria. Let's recognise that students have the right to have their potential and their opportunities maximised. Allowing people to reach their potential unrestricted is not the essence of elitism; it is the essence of true egalitarianism. Unfortunately, Labor is hostile to the very avenues of educational opportunity from which particularly low-income families have benefited and stand to benefit in the future. We need to give our children the opportunity to be their best. And if the states will not then perhaps the Australian government will need to take an even greater interest in school education. I will be asking the federal Minister for Education, Science and Training what avenues might be open to the Australian government to persuade the states to introduce selective schools and centres of excellence. </para><para>Mr President, those who have been given opportunity through education have a great responsibility to build and contribute to the communities in which they live. One of the most common cries today is that we have lost our sense of community. The paradox is we have never been more connected as a community by transport and technology but, at the same time, never more distant from each other. Contact and connectedness do not equate to proximity. It is proximity that gives meaning to human contact and to community. Ultimately what determines the true quality of our lives is the quality of the relationships we have. Community is what happens when we engage. This engenders relationships we otherwise would not have undertaken in circumstances we would not have otherwise found.</para><para>I propose a measure that could provide both incentive and reward for young people to become more involved in the community. Let us offer university students the opportunity to reduce their HECS debt by a few thousand dollars each year in return for undertaking weekly volunteer or community work. This measure would encourage community work and increase the likelihood these people would continue their involvement in later life. This would involve a discount on HECS fees for a certain number of hours spent each week with a recognised charity or community group. Part of the HECS debt could be forgiven in exchange for, say, five hours per week or 200 hours a year of community service with a recognised charity or community group. If each hour was valued at, say, $10 this would amount to a $2,000 saving each year on their HECS liability.</para><para>I fully support the HECS system. I supported the Labor government's introduction of HECS while at university, despite the opposition of its own party members on campus. It is right that those who derive the most direct benefit from further education make an appropriate financial contribution. But we can use the mechanism provided by HECS to foster greater community interaction and involvement. The scheme could be available to undergraduates undertaking their first degree and a similar scheme could be put in place to reduce the upfront cost for TAFE students undertaking vocational courses.</para><para>Students could tutor disadvantaged children, assist the churches in their charitable work with the young, or work with organisations that care for the aged. Young people would become more intimately acquainted with their neighbourhoods and the problems which confront them. There would be a slight lifting of the financial burden on students and a greater lifting of some of society's burdens. This measure would encourage greater community understanding—that misfortune befalls many people often through no fault of their own and that its remedies lie with people not just government. Hopefully, it would foster lifelong community involvement.</para><para>This is an idea I first raised with my preselectors in October last year and have discussed extensively as I have moved throughout Victoria. I have raised the idea with the Prime Minister and have commended it for his consideration. To be a compassionate society means being able to put yourself in the shoes of another and understand what makes them different and why they find themselves in their particular circumstance. This scheme would, in a small way, help engender greater community and rebuild social capital. It is only when we keep coming back to our core Liberal values of choice, independence and responsibility that we find the policies that facilitate opportunity. </para><para>I want to acknowledge the love and support of my extended family: the Fifields, the Fords and the O'Learys—especially my brothers, Scott and Matt; sister-in-law, Denise; John and Di Ford; and John and Annette O'Leary.

The Australian Bureau of Statistics report <inline font-style="italic">Schools, Australia, 2002</inline> highlighted the problem when it stated:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Between 1992 and 2002, the proportion of male school teachers (in full time equivalent measure) declined from 25.8% to 20.9% in primary schools and from 49.4% to 44.9% in secondary schools.</para></quote><para>This problem is even worse considering that the number of men currently in training to be primary school teachers across the nation is down to 18.8 per cent of the total number of teachers in primary training—in other words, less than one in five. That is a significant imbalance. Is the imbalance a problem? From my personal experience of parenting, the role modelling of two parents—a father and a mother—is essential. There is an enormous body of law and in-depth research that indicates that, for the proper development of an infant to an adolescent child, there needs to be the involvement of a mother and, I stress particularly, a father. </para><para>With respect to teaching, the imbalance of one in five, which I have indicated are the figures, is a considerable problem and is cause for alarm. In our current educational system, we have far too many children who are passing through infancy and the primary school system with no real male role models. This is cause for great concern. In regions with many low-socioeconomic and disadvantaged families, schools are educating children who have grown up without a father and who have gone to schools where there are no male teachers. This is a major and significant problem. </para><para>Male teachers do make a difference when educating students, particularly boys. They can reach out to boys in a way that female teachers cannot. I have a number of friends who are in the teaching profession at primary schools and high schools, and they impart to me their knowledge and understanding of the significant role that male teachers play, particularly in primary schools. A colleague and friend of mine, who was a principal in a disadvantaged area until fairly recently, told me that his greatest dilemma was in providing appropriate role models for his students as typically his school population was made up of third-generation matriarchal families, where mum was the only adult in the family and had never had a job and, for that matter, nor had grandma. At his school he had a student population of over 300 students with about 20 full-time teachers, and of those 20 only two were males. He told me that the other 18 female staff were all terrific teachers who performed above and beyond the call of duty in that difficult school. However, they were the first to admit that they could not provide the male perspective or outlook that so many of the children yearned for and, indeed, may I say, desperately needed.  </para><para>The aspiration levels of these children were of great concern to my principal friend. These children could not come to grips with the notion that, if you went to school and worked hard, you could gain either a good job or entry into a tertiary institution. As I said, mum had never had a job and nor had grandma. These children face a very bleak, narrow future. What really concerns me is that this scenario is painted many times over in disadvantaged areas throughout Australia. We need to do something about this and we need to do it very quickly. We need to get male teachers back into our primary schools, in particular. We need them to provide the sort of male role model that is desperately needed by so many of these children.</para><para>I want to talk about the research into why boys, in particular, need male teachers. Boys need diverse masculine role models. Male teachers fit the bill exactly, particularly with respect to playing sport and a whole host of other pursuits that involve a degree of physical exertion. Boys form a totally different relationship with male teachers than they do with female teachers. Male teachers tend to tolerate more and be able to accommodate more boyish behaviour. Male teachers tend to teach differently from females. They tend to be able to use more colourful language, more jokes et cetera. A recent report in the United Kingdom showed that males tend to assess student work differently. They are not so concerned with neat and precise work and handwriting; they more readily accept work presented in a form that is more acceptable to young boys.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7Y6</name.id><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator Crossin</name></talker><para>—Tell me you were never in the classroom; you'd better stick to law.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AON</name.id><name role="metadata">Johnston, Sen David</name><name role="display">Senator JOHNSTON</name></talker><para>—These are the sorts of things that are very important in primary school—things that I note the opposition are simply not prepared to accommodate. The opposition to this bill coming from the other side of the chamber is surprising given the statements of the Labor Party Attorney-General in the other place. In commenting on this debate, shadow Attorney-General Roxon said:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>As the minister says, it—</para></quote><para>that is, changing the Sex Discrimination Act—</para><quote><para>might encourage some men to go into teaching instead of into other courses. This report goes into great detail about the problem being retaining men in classrooms. So what is going to happen with these young men who are attracted to teaching if no other measures are put in place to keep them there?</para></quote><para>The fact is that we want to attract them into teaching in the first place. Indeed, Ms Roxon indicates that this measure will go some way towards attracting male teachers into teaching. That is what the measure is all about. The member for Port Adelaide in the other place, Mr Sawford, the Deputy Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education, which inquired into the education of boys, was reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald </inline>of 20 March 2003. The observation by the journalist in that paper was: </para><quote><para>Rod Sawford, deputy chair of the inquiry, acknowledges the male-only scholarships would have been preferable.</para></quote><para>So Mr Sawford acknowledges that male-only scholarships would have been preferable. The article goes on to quote Mr Sawford:</para><quote><para>“We thought the discrimination laws would be a problem. That's why we said 50 per cent. But 50 per cent of males is far better than the numbers we are seeing now.”</para></quote><para>So Mr Sawford acknowledges that this measure has merit. Those are two Labor Party people who acknowledge that there is some merit underlying this legislation.</para><para>The fact is that what we have from the opposition here is a complete ideological adherence to political correctness. What we see in the Labor Party is a significant dose of hypocrisy. When I look at what the Labor Party does in its preselections, for instance, I note that there is a requirement—indeed a guarantee, as I understand it—that one-third of all preselections will go to women. It is mandated. It is an objective in the Labor Party regardless of merit. So, on the one hand, when we want to institute a scholarship system that arrests a clear problem in teaching, particularly in primary schools, Labor says no. Labor has a problem in getting women into winnable positions in the Labor Party, so it says, `Let's mandate one-third, regardless of merit.' It is good enough for the Labor Party but not good enough for primary school students—not good enough to solve a problem in education.</para><para>I must confess that I am opposed to the sorts of mandating and dragooning formulas and the introduction of gender quotas to fill positions in any organisation. But knowing what I know about the Labor Party preselection processes and the corrupt nature of the way the Labor Party's internal processes work, I can understand why there is a need to have a mandate for 30 per cent. You have to protect women in the circumstances of the Labor Party. This internal corruption in numbers, and what we are seeing unfolding in Western Australia with respect to vote rorting, certainly means that you have a problem getting decent people, particularly women, into the Labor Party. I can see that there is a strong argument for mandating a 30 per cent quota.</para><para>The fact is that we have a problem here. We have a problem in primary schools that the Labor Party acknowledge. It is utterly irrational and unreasonable for them, in the face of the way they conduct their own affairs—the way they go about putting women into the Labor Party—for them to hypocritically now say that they are not going to support this move. This is a matter of political dogma. This is a matter of them being hostage to their own ideology. Ms Roxon and Mr Sawford have told the Labor Party that this measure is acceptable. Labor know this measure is acceptable. They know that this measure is right and will go some way to achieving a positive outcome with respect to the mentoring and the education of boys and to arresting the gender imbalance that is now present in our primary schools throughout Australia.</para><para>In other words, what you have is a politically correct bigotry on the part of the opposition in this place. So much for the sham and the facade of Mr Latham's platitudes in support of the education of boys. When it comes to political correctness the Labor Party will always revert to type and will go to ideology. Regardless of the merit, the positives or the likelihood of a successful outcome of a measure, if political correctness dictates then, notwithstanding their own practices, they will reject the measure. The report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee says that, in addressing an application by the Catholic Education Office, HREOC found: </para><quote><para>... there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that the gender imbalance in the primary school teaching profession is caused by matters, factors or circumstances that might be remedied by the CEO's proposed scholarship scheme ...</para></quote><para>So the opposition has founded their opposition to this measure on HREOC's finding that there is `insufficient evidence'. I have not heard of there ever being a scholarship scheme such as this being instituted in Australia before. Of course there is going to be insufficient evidence. This is a cop-out by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission inquiring into the authorisation of the application by the Catholic Education Office. Insufficient evidence? There must have been some evidence for it to be insufficient. Where is the threshold? This is simply political correctness and reverse bigotry in terms of gender bias in evidence for all to see. This measure should have been given support. This measure would have gone some way, by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's own use of the word `insufficient'. The inference clearly is that there are some positives that support this measure as delivering an improved outcome in primary schools.</para><para>Let us have a further look at the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. It stated:</para><quote><para>The report—</para></quote><para>referring to the earlier report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training <inline font-style="italic">Boys: getting it </inline><inline font-style="italic">right</inline>—</para><quote><para>also noted that once employed, teachers do not keep pace with salary progression ...</para></quote><para>It continues:</para><quote><para>Submissions commonly argued that amending the Act to offer scholarships for males will not remedy any of these issues.</para></quote><para>The Senate committee report quotes Pam Smith from the Independent Education Union of Australia:</para><quote><para>The issue of male teacher numbers ... can be remedied much more significantly and longer term by industrial and other promotional means, than a small number of scholarships and watering down important legislation.</para></quote><para>She went on to say:</para><quote><para>... we are aware that the impact of unfounded allegations [against teachers] can have a devastating effect, people can leave the profession ... that is more marked in the early childhood and primary sector.</para></quote><para>Pam Smith has not undertaken any real active study of what has been happening in primary schools with respect to numbers. There is a clear aversion to looking at the statistics and the figures. Dr Peter West in evidence to the Senate committee said a number of very positive things with respect to what might happen if there were some scholarships to encourage men into the education system, particularly into primary schools. He is quoted on page 16 of the report as saying:</para><quote><para>Boys' difficulties are entangled with two related issues: better fathering ... and the lack of males in teaching.</para></quote><para>He is the Head of the Research Group on Men and Families at the University of Western Sydney. This is a collision of so-called experts. Dr West went on to say:</para><quote><para>... it is not so much role models that seems critical here, but males modelling for boys the way in which they can become educated men ... it is important for boys ... to see ... models of thoughtful men who read and enjoy reading.</para></quote><para>Here is the evidence. Here is the suggestion that there is potential for a positive outcome, but Labor—notwithstanding all of their own internal practices—say, `We're not going to do that.' It really is quite a sorry, sad situation when a political party is so wedded to its warped, biased ideology that it cannot entertain a lateral thought or support a bona fide, realistic attempt to address a serious problem in education. Senator Mackay mentioned mentoring and role modelling at home by fathers. The precise point is that a lot of these kids do not have fathers at home. That is the issue. A lot of kids do not have a male role model throughout infancy and primary school. The sorry, sad fact is that there are a very large number of fatherless families in this country today. By not having male role models and male teachers, particularly in primary schools, the problem is exacerbated. </para><para>In closing, I want to say that it is really quite surprising that a simple, legitimate, bona fide attempt to encourage men back into the teaching profession has been opposed by the Labor Party for the most illegitimate of reasons. There is no substance to any of the arguments I have heard in this place today. All they have said is: `We think this is just not the way to go. There needs to be more money. There need to be other things done in education.' Even the education union does not have any suggestion or solution for how to introduce more male teachers into primary schools. Given the Labor Party's own internal workings and its quotas for the enforcement of the rights of women, I would have thought this measure—if only to avoid hypocrisy—would have received support. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>23098</page.no><name role="metadata">Kirk, Sen Linda</name><name role="display">Senator KIRK</name><name.id>00AOO</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1999">Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004</inline>, and I hope I will be able to address Senator Johnston's suggestion that there is a lack of arguments to oppose this piece of legislation. The bill proposes a new exemption to the Sex Discrimination Act. It inserts a new section that provides that it is not discriminatory for a person to offer scholarships to persons of a particular gender in respect of participation in a teaching course `if the scholarships are offered in order to redress a gender imbalance in teaching'. </para></talk.start><para>The major premise behind this legislation is that there is in fact a gender imbalance in teaching, particularly in the primary school teaching profession. The premise is that this has an adverse social or educational effect on young boys. I think it is fair to say that the jury is still out on this question. I do not think anyone—whether it is the government, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission or any other body—can claim that there is sufficient evidence to support this premise. However, we will assume just for the purposes of this debate that there is some value or substantive equality in gender balance of teaching staff in schools.</para><para>The bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for inquiry, and the committee has now tabled its report. I am a participating member of that committee, and I attended the hearings held a few weeks ago in Sydney. In the majority report government senators, whilst wary of the bill, recommended that the legislation provisionally proceed and that it be subject to a review in two years time against its stated aim—that is, to improve the gender balance of teachers in schools.</para><para>Labor senators submitted a dissenting report to this inquiry. It was Labor's view that the bill should not proceed. Essentially, the reasons—and I will detail our reasons more fully in a moment—were that we believed that this bill is inadequate to achieve its stated aims and is dangerous in its consequences, whether they are unintended or otherwise. As many senators would be aware, despite the rhetoric of the Minister for Education, Science and Training, this bill was not conceived by the government as an integral part of a comprehensive policy to ensure better schooling outcomes for boys. In fact, the government only conceived the idea of this piece of legislation following the application that was made by the Catholic Education Office for an exemption from the Sex Discrimination Act, to introduce male-only scholarships. As we know, the first application that was made by the Catholic Education Office was rejected by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. When this occurred, the government saw this as a great opportunity to take up the avenue available to it to try to undermine the Sex Discrimination Act. Essentially, that is what this legislation is all about. </para><para>Since the bill has been drafted and introduced into the parliament, a number of events have occurred which the government did not perhaps foresee. Of course, we know that there were subsequent negotiations between HREOC and the Catholic Education Office and that these resulted in a revised application being submitted to HREOC by the Catholic Education Office for an exemption. It was an application for an exemption in this case so as to grant 24 scholarships, each for five years, to university students applying to become primary school teachers—12 of these scholarships were to be offered to males and 12 were to be offered to females. So this had the effect that there would be a guaranteed number of males and a guaranteed number of females receiving scholarships. In other words, this would be consistent with the equality principle that underscores the Sex Discrimination Act.</para><para>The Catholic Education Office were granted their exemption on the basis of their revised application, and everything was fine. It seems that the CEO were happy with the outcome as they had in place their scholarships to encourage a guaranteed number of 12 men and 12 women into the teaching profession. It is interesting to note that the Catholic Education Office have advised that they did not request any changes to the Sex Discrimination Act, certainly not in the form of this bill. Furthermore, they did not take up the invitation that was extended to them to appear before our committee that inquired into the provisions of the legislation, which I referred to a moment ago. </para><para>Given this background, I think it is very difficult to understand the government's refusal to withdraw this bill, following the events that I have just outlined to you. Its refusal to do so has to be seen as nothing other than a cynical move to undermine the integrity of the Sex Discrimination Act; that is what this is about. It now lacked a reason for the bill, so a few weeks ago we heard the minister for education announce 500 male-only scholarships. The only purpose for making this announcement, it seems, was to actually give some underlying basis to this legislation, which otherwise would be completely unnecessary.</para><para>Even if it is evident that there is a gender imbalance amongst primary school teachers—and I think there is evidence to suggest that is the case—I think we need to look beyond the teaching profession and look at other professions across society. We all know that there are gender imbalances in the professions. Of course, traditionally women have been underrepresented in male-dominated professions such as science and engineering, and that continues to the present day. Women traditionally have been underrepresented in high-paying professions. </para><para>Let us look then at the teaching profession. We see that there are a higher number of females than males employed as primary school teachers in Australia. But what do we know about the teaching profession? What do we know of it as an occupation? We know that it is relatively poorly paid, it is of low social status in the community and there is very little opportunity for career progression. One might say it is no wonder that women dominate in this field, because after all this is the type of field in which women tend to dominate. Child care is another profession that comes to mind in which women are disproportionately represented. It is a kind of chicken and the egg situation—whether the low pay leads to there being more women or there being more women leads to there being low pay. So it is not a surprise to us to see that there is a significantly higher number of females than males employed as primary school teachers.  </para><para>There is no question that teaching does suffer from its long association as being women's work. Young men are not attracted to the teaching profession because they know that they can earn more money elsewhere in another profession and they know that their work will be regarded as of greater value if they work in one of the traditional fields of law, engineering, science or anything other than teaching. Taking a closer look at the statistics of where men are in teaching and teaching courses and what happens to them reinforces what I am saying here today. While there has been a significant decline in the number and percentage of male primary school teachers employed in government primary schools, the number and percentage of male primary school teachers in the non-government sector has actually increased. The committee did hear some evidence that non-government sector schools actively recruit male teachers, offering them attractive remuneration packages which form a significant component of what they are able to offer them in order to attract them into the profession. This really ties in with what I was saying a moment ago: if there is attractive remuneration and other benefits available to men, then quite often they will take up teaching as a profession because they will be rewarded.</para><para> Furthermore, while the number of males completing primary school teacher education courses has decreased, the number and percentage of males enrolling in primary school teacher education courses have actually increased. Therefore it seems that one of the great problems in this area is the retention of male teaching students. This issue would need to be addressed even more pressingly, I would suggest, if this bill were to pass, if only to ensure that the government scholarships, payable as they are on the successful completion of first-year teaching, would not be a complete waste of taxpayers' money.</para><para>Despite the small percentage of male primary school teachers, the majority of primary school principals are male. If you look at the statistical prevalence of males in leadership positions within the teaching profession, you will see that any male-female discrimination in the profession is not functioning in a manner that is contrary to the interests of male teachers. In fact, on the contrary, male teachers are becoming school principals. They are moving up the ladder, they are being rewarded, they are being promoted and, of course, attracting greater salary rewards as a consequence. It seems that male teachers either leave the profession mid-career because of poor remuneration or are promoted out of the schoolroom to become principals or assistant principals, as I described. This is a more general problem across the teaching profession. It seems that good teaching is often rewarded by a career progression, and this often means that good teachers become administrators. So those men and women who are the best teachers are promoted up the scale to the level of principal and then of course they are no longer able to be good teachers. Good teachers' skills in the classroom, therefore, become more and more underutilised as their careers progress. As the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Pru Goward, pointed out:</para><quote><para>Programs to stop this exodus and programs to encourage the promotion of a representative number of women teachers into senior administrative positions in schools would both result in more male teachers in the classroom.  </para></quote><para>When HREOC assessed the Catholic Education Office's initial application for an exemption, they found that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that the gender imbalance in the primary school teaching profession is caused by matters, factors or circumstances that might be remedied by the proposed scholarship scheme. Male teachers are not discriminated against in their entry into training in this profession. HREOC found that the scholarship plan was not designed to redress specific practices said to exclude disadvantage, restrict or result in an adverse effect upon male primary teachers, nor would the absence of the scheme `leave uncorrected the effects of past discrimination against men'. Rather, the plan was designed to redress the gender imbalance in the teaching profession, which had arisen for many other reasons, many of which I have referred to today. Despite such findings by HREOC, the government has maintained that there is a need for an amendment to the Sex Discrimination Act. As I said, that is a cynical position that has much more to do with undermining the Sex Discrimination Act than it has to do with ensuring better educational outcomes for boys. This bill, were it to pass and were it to amend the Sex Discrimination Act as intended, could have the effect of curtailing the special measures provisions already in the act. </para><para>In the time available I want to address the special measures provisions. Section 7D offers an existing and more flexible solution to the question of granting scholarships proposed in the bill. The government could, in fact, apply for a special exemption under section 7D to introduce its scholarships package. Ironically, the passage of this bill might endanger that facility. Passing this legislation could effectively limit the special measures that could be allowed under the Sex Discrimination Act to redress gender imbalance in teaching. A court could regard the specific provision in the bill dealing with scholarships as excluding that subject from the generalised provisions of section 7D. The overall effect could be that the flexible aspects of section 7D, as they now exist, could be denied to other proposals for granting scholarships. This poses potential problems for future initiatives in this area and undermines the overall integrity of the Sex Discrimination Act.</para><para>Of course, the government has not made any application for an exemption under this clause because it requires that a person does not discriminate against another person under sections 5, 6 and 7 of the act by taking special authorised measures. HREOC would be unlikely to grant a special exemption for this scheme for the reason that it further discriminates against women. Male only scholarships that serve to remedy no barrier are an affront to the many well-qualified, excellent women who enter teaching degrees at university and they serve only to further devalue their contribution as teachers. It is a slap in the face for all those women who go into teaching—it is what they want to do because they enjoy working with young children, despite the poor pay and low opportunities for career advancement—and struggle to pay off their HECS debts for degrees which, in the end, will barely push them above average weekly earnings. Two thousand dollars, I might suggest, is a very small inducement into a profession that in fact suffers from its long association with women and the label of women's work.</para><para>There are a couple of other legal issues that I want to raise in the time remaining. The Law Institute of Victoria made a submission to the inquiry. They said that they thought the bill may well be contrary to the stated objects in section 3 of the Sex Discrimination Act, which include the following: to give effect to certain provisions of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, CEDAW; to eliminate, so far as is possible, discrimination against persons on the ground of sex, in areas such as work and education; and to promote recognition and acceptance within the community of the principle of equality of men and women. You can see, when I read those stated objectives from the Sex Discrimination Act just why it is that this amendment is so contrary to the spirit of the Sex Discrimination Act.  </para><para>The Law Institute of Victoria in its submission argued that allowing educational institutions to offer such scholarships will mean that women will be disadvantaged by reduced access to teaching scholarships. This will not allow men and women to benefit equally from scholarships and may mean that the bill contravenes Australia's obligations under article 10 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, which states:</para><quote><para>States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women in order to ensure to them equal rights with men in the field of education and in particular to ensure, on a basis of equality of men and women:</para></quote><para>...	...	...</para><quote><para> (d ) The same opportunities to benefit from scholarships and other study grants;</para></quote><para>The committee members, from all parties, who inquired into this bill were concerned at the impact that piecemeal amendments, such as the one proposed here today, would have on the integrity and objectives of the act and at the impact on Australia's compliance with its obligations under CEDAW. May I also mention that there could well be some significant issues in terms of the constitutional validity of this bill and whether it can be seen as being within section 51(xxix) of the Constitution, which was the original head of power relied upon in order to enact the Sex Discrimination Act. As I outlined before, I think the manner in which this amendment is contrary to the stated aims and objectives of the bill, which reflect CEDAW, could well bring it under a constitutional question mark.</para><para>In summary, this bill is an ill-conceived remedy to a problem that requires a much more comprehensive response. It is a simplistic and ineffective approach to a very complex policy issue. We cannot even be certain that the problem it intends to remedy is a problem, as there is insufficient evidence to support the proposition that more men in schools will lead to better educational outcomes for boys. It also potentially contravenes Australia's international obligations to prevent discrimination against women. This legislation is not only a round peg for a square hole but a round peg of the wrong width and length, and I urge my fellow senators to oppose this legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>23102</page.no><name role="metadata">Santoro, Sen Santo</name><name role="display">Senator SANTORO</name><name.id>BOT</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1999">Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004</inline> is an important piece of legislation.

If it is, it will enable the government to provide 500 scholarships valued at $2,000 each next year, to be paid at the end of a successful first year of an undergraduate teaching program. An additional 500 male teachers in primary schools will potentially touch the lives of around 21,500 primary school boys over five years of age.</para></talk.start><para>At the outset, I want to say that it is a shame that the Labor Party has chosen to make a partisan issue of the scholarship plan proposed by the Minister for Education, Science and Training. It is not only an issue of attracting more men into primary teaching. It is also an issue of how—in fact, of whether—Australia can meet the educational and social challenges it currently faces, and it is in that context that senators and the community at large should approach this debate. </para><para>There is a lengthy list of grim statistics that demonstrates how urgent it is to reverse the decline in boys' academic performance. All of the evidence points to the need to commence that remedial work at the primary school level. Last year in this place I spoke on the special needs of boys in our education system. I am far from alone in taking the view that the need to reverse the present situation in which boys are failing to perform is urgent and absolutely vital. I don't know anyone who suggests that schools are, or indeed should be, surrogate fathers. But it is beyond dispute that boys, and for that matter girls, need male role models in their early lives, and just as much in the classroom as in the home. The need is acute for boys. They in particular need a balanced male presence in their primary school years, so that they respond to educational stimulus and get the best possible start on the ladder of learning. In Australia today, only one in five primary school teachers is a man and only 18 per cent of people training to be primary teachers are male. For early childhood teaching—that is, the critical entry point for children—less than four per cent of trainees are men.</para><para>According to the Labor Party, boosting the number of university places is the way to ensure more men choose teaching as a career. That is the view put forward by the Labor Party shadow minister in the other place. Other critics of the plan to produce more male teachers for Australia's primary classrooms say that teacher salaries, job and career satisfaction and social status detract from teaching as a choice for young men. It is certainly true that there is no easy solution to the problem. This bill to allow for scholarships is one approach towards an overall solution. That is all that it is and that is all that we on this side of the chamber claim that it is. The purpose of the bill is to amend the Sex Discrimination Act to provide a permanent exemption for the provision of gender specific scholarships which can be offered to students in a teaching course. These scholarships must be designed to address gender imbalance in teaching.</para><para>The bill is largely a response to a decision by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which refused to grant an exemption from the act to the Catholic Education Office of the Archdiocese of Sydney. A subsequent decision by the commission granted an exemption from the act to the Sydney Catholic Education Office on the basis that it would provide 12 teaching scholarships for men and women respectively. As a general principle, rules of equity are sensible and should be applied. There are no grounds for discriminating against anyone on the basis of gender. That is the position of the government. It is the position of everyone in mainstream politics and, I believe, of the vast majority of people in the Australian community.</para><para>The Nelson scholarships arguably breach the Sex Discrimination Act, which, while providing for some pre-existing permanent exemptions, appears not to provide the same for specific purpose male-only teaching scholarships. That is the basis on which this bill has been presented to the parliament. The legislative fact is that the supply of the proposed scholarships would, arguably, be a breach of the act, in particular of section 22(1). That subsection makes it illegal to discriminate on the grounds of gender in the provision of goods and services, and services include `the provision of grants'. Section 21(2) may also be violated by the proposed scheme because it deals with educational authorities and specifies that they should not discriminate on the grounds of gender. </para><para>In recognition of the fact that it may be appropriate to allow discrimination when the purpose behind it is to foster equality and counteract the historical effects of previous discrimination, the Sex Discrimination Act includes a permanent exemption for measures which are taken to redress such situations. These special measures allow discrimination when it is designed to achieve substantive equality—discrimination that would otherwise violate the non-discriminatory principles of the act. But the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission took the view that the Nelson scholarships were not designed to redress specific `practices said to exclude, disadvantage, restrict or result in an adverse effect' on male teachers. It also decided that the absence of the scheme would not `leave uncorrected the effects of past discrimination against men'. The commission decided that the plan was designed to redress the gender imbalance in the teaching profession which had arisen for other reasons.</para><para>The point is moot. The issue of whether the Sex Discrimination Act should be taken to apply in any form to the provision of scholarships is another matter—an argument for another time perhaps, or one we might be best avoiding altogether. But whatever the cause of the decline of male teacher numbers in primary education, whether it is salary expectations and social status, or the marginalisation of maleness as a perceived teaching attribute in Australia and other Western societies—and these are all factors that have been alluded to by other speakers on both sides of the Senate—the result of the collapse in numbers is plainly apparent and must be reversed. It bears repeating that children—girls and boys—benefit from an appropriate and proportionate gender representation in the education system.</para><para>There is no criticism of female teachers implied by that statement—by anybody, particularly those on this side—or implicit in the bill. It is not a question of standards, of classroom teaching or anything else; it is one of achieving effective balance and better outcomes for young Australians and, ultimately, for Australian society. It is a balance to which it is critical that our classrooms return. The government has moved quickly to draft and introduce this legislation. That is a measure of the urgency of the issue. The bill was introduced into the House of Representatives on 10 March and debated in the House in the week beginning 22 March. It should be given swift passage through this chamber in the interests of boys' education. Outside the home, teachers play the largest role in shaping children's lives. The modest change to the Sex Discrimination Act proposed in this bill is one step—a very positive and proactive step—towards a goal the community would clearly support. It is a targeted response to a specific problem, a measure the education minister has chosen in order to meet a particular need.</para><para>No-one would suggest that all we need to right the imbalance that is negatively affecting boys' education is 500 teacher training scholarships. Nobody is suggesting that. The scholarships and the minister's action in organising them are catalysts towards a far broader outcome that deserves to come to fruition, unmolested by the Sex Discrimination Act or the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Of course the quality of the teacher is more important than the gender of the teacher. That was the very point made by the parliamentary committee of inquiry in its report <inline font-style="italic">Boys: getting it right</inline>. In the overall context of the proposed scholarships and the inconsistency of that measure in terms of the Sex Discrimination Act, it is very hard to see why the Labor Party should object, or indeed, why anyone should. </para><para>Labor leader, Mark Latham, has led debate on his side of politics on this issue of boys' education. The teacher unions are not happy, but they should be. Only their ideology stands in the way of commonsense there. Labor's official position, as enunciated by Jenny Macklin, deputy leader and education spokesman, is that the scholarships are a bad idea and that more university places are a better idea. That particular suggestion has been echoed in this chamber during this debate, yet this contrasts oddly with the action of the West Australian Labor state government, which has acted firmly to urgently lift male teacher numbers. It clearly sees it for what it is—that is, a matter of practicality, not of politics, particularly for the Western Australian branch of the Labor Party. The fact is that opposition to the bill is primarily ideological, at least by Labor people in this place and in the other place.</para><para>Minister Nelson was right on the money when he characterised it as political correctness and said it would do Australia no good if we spend the next decade hand-wringing and clinging to misplaced ideological purity and produce a generation of young men who are disengaged from society. Prime Minister John Howard was right when he said that the ideological focus of opposition to the bill shows those who have a zealous commitment to the Sex Discrimination Act have more power in the Labor Party than those concerned about male role models for boys. As a Senator for Queensland I find it particularly galling that one union in my state concluded that the scholarships were `an exercise in superficiality and pure tokenism'. For my money that criticism could more aptly be directed at the Labor Party for its position on this legislation and particularly at its leader who, yet again, on this issue has decided to hunt with the hounds after having run with the hares.</para><para>The Leader of the Opposition who, before he assumed that position, sought to highlight the crisis of masculinity and the lack of male role models and mentoring and who continued with this view after he got the job—among other things in addressing the National Press Club on the issue—now says the Nelson scholarships are `just a drop in the ocean'. As the Prime Minister put it:</para><quote><para>It is one thing to talk the talk. It is one thing to run around the country for three months and profess your concern for the fatherless boys of Australia. But it is another thing, when you have got an opportunity to put your hand up and do something for them, to not do so ... On this occasion, the Leader of the Opposition has failed his own rhetoric.</para></quote><para>Labor still has an opportunity to do the right thing. It can change its mind and vote for this bill and be part of the solution. It should do so for the sake of Australian boys and Australia's future.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>23105</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise this afternoon to speak on the <inline ref="R1999">Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004</inline> that is currently before this chamber. I would like to begin by providing some historical context to this issue and to highlight the inadequacies of this piece of legislation—legislation that is no longer even relevant, as the situation has been adequately resolved. This year sees the 20th anniversary of the Sex Discrimination Act. In 1984 the Hawke Labor federal government created the Sex Discrimination Act to give effect to Australia's obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. It is no secret, the disregard and contempt this government has towards not only the Sex Discrimination Commission but also the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. This government intends to do away with HREOC as we know it and replace it with a body that has limited independence and capacity. </para></talk.start><para>As our deputy leader in the House of Representatives, Jenny Macklin, mentioned, this bill seeks to wind back Australia's antidiscrimination laws, laws which are there to protect every single Australian. The Prime Minister has been antagonistic towards antidiscrimination laws right from the start. During the third reading debate on the Sex Discrimination Bill in 1983, he said:</para><quote><para>... I am a profound sceptic of the value to our society of the Human Rights Commission.</para></quote><para>He went on to say:</para><quote><para>... I certainly have major reservations about the concept of affirmative action legislation and I certainly do not regard support of this legislation as being indicative of support for that.</para></quote><para>He has obviously changed his mind about that; he now proposes to change the Sex Discrimination Act to permit affirmative action—but for men to become teachers in this instance. Mr Howard's disregard for the informed opinion of the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, that to exempt Catholic schools from the act to enable them to award male only scholarships is not desirable, is staggering, although not uncommon from this Prime Minister. We have seen him on a number of occasions disregard the Sex Discrimination Commissioner and HREOC on a number of issues, so it is no wonder the Prime Minister wants to get rid of the Sex Discrimination Commissioner altogether.</para><para>No-one denies that the low number of male teachers is problematic. However, a well thought out long-term strategy is what is needed, not a short-term political fix full of a personal agenda that is seriously outdated and misguided. What the government also fails to see is this needs more than a quick fix solution, and this is in no way a recent phenomenon or the result of a bizarre trend by men. Essentially the lack of male teachers in our schools is a hangover from the period when teaching in Australia was largely regarded as an acceptable profession for females, who could undertake it until they were married or until they had children. In accordance with the Harvester judgment, men were entitled to be paid more than women because they were regarded as the sole breadwinner and because it was expected that women would quit work once they were married and had children; they did not require a wage adequate to support themselves or any dependent children, for example. It was assumed that when women were at work, they did not have any dependents, despite their actual circumstances. Women were seen as being able to participate in the work force as teachers as part of the service sector because it was regarded as an extension of their caring role in the community.</para><para>When I began my teaching career in 1978, it was the start of the change of the teaching profession and the role it had played previously. I remember being part of the formation of what is now known as the Independent Education Union of Australia. We worked and struggled for teachers to gain their rights to maternity leave—of course prior to the major test case on maternity leave won by Anna Stewart. In the late seventies it was certainly the case that there was an expectation that the only thing women ought to do when they left school was to become a nurse or a teacher. I went through teachers college with some outstanding male teachers who have become idols in the sports world—Gary Foulds and Justin and Simon Madden, all of whom played football for Essendon. Their reason for being in teaching was that it was a profession that had some respect and dignity in the community. They were not in the profession because they felt that there was a chronic shortage of male role models in the community and they were serving their duty; they were there because it was a valued profession. Unfortunately, as time has gone on, the value of the role that teachers play in the community, and the community's expectations of them, has severely diminished. </para><para>All of these factors contributed to the current situation where it is acceptable that in this day and age teachers are paid a minimal income but still require a university degree. Surely the government should look at the entire education system—wages that teachers are paid, the conditions under which they are employed, the relative respect teachers have in the community, the expectation that the community has of teachers—in relation to the lack of male teachers. These days teaching is not seen as an attractive profession by some adolescent males who are seeking to go on to university. Things have gone wrong, and some of the major issues include the lack of resources for education, the huge demands, the expectations placed on teachers and their administrative workload. The expectation of the community and its view of the role that teachers play has not been assisted at all by the attitude of this government, particularly in relation to teachers in the public sector system.</para><para>A few male-only scholarships will go no way to increasing the number of male teachers. If the government were serious about this, it would make teaching an achievable and attractive profession. However, the government has gone out of its way to make teaching very unattractive to potential teachers by increasing the cost of attending university, by undervaluing the role of the profession, by limiting the amount of resources given to public schools—which is where the majority of teachers are, as opposed to private schools. In fact, approximately 2,700 men were turned away from teaching in 2004 because this government refused to fund the extra university places that were required. Think of the ludicrous argument we have heard from this government: on the one hand it wants to amend the Sex Discrimination Act so that men only can access certain scholarships that are being presented by the Catholic Education Office and, on the other hand, it turned away 2,700 men from universities who were seeking to undertake a teaching degree. The hypocrisy just does not make sense to me. Since 1997 the Howard government has turned away approximately 15,000 men from teaching—thousands of men who could be in front of children in classrooms this very day. </para><para>It must also be noted that men have always occupied executive positions in schools and have been promoted at a faster rate than their female counterparts—not unlike in the wider work force. If we think of the hierarchy of the education sector as a triangle, we know that the majority of women are classroom teachers, section teachers within a school or assistant principals. The number of female teachers who go on to be principals, general managers in education departments, deputy secretaries or secretaries is much smaller than the number of men who hold those positions. The triangle is, in a sense, out of kilter. The number of women who enter the work force as teachers and end up in executive positions is relatively minor compared to the number of men who hold similar senior positions.</para><para>It is not surprising, though, that this government does not see that as a serious issue. At the same time as they are advocating that there ought to be an exemption in the Sex Discrimination Act so that men can access scholarships, they are not advocating that there ought to be professional development programs or executive management programs so that more women can access promotion within the system and become principals or even secretaries of departments. In fact, until the 1950s it was legislated in Victoria that women could only be principals of one-teacher schools, schools for the handicapped or all-girls schools. Married women could not even apply for a promotion or join superannuation schemes. They also suffered job insecurity as no leave was granted for confinement—that is, no paid maternity leave was provided to women in the teaching sector until the eighties, which is less than 30 years ago.  </para><para>In highlighting these facts, I am not suggesting that this still occurs. However, the current situation must be viewed within this historical context. The government must accept that this problem requires more than a short-term, quick political fix. This also illustrates the importance of the Sex Discrimination Act and the role of the commission in ensuring that there is equal opportunity and that workplaces are free of discrimination on the basis of sex. This piece of legislation is no longer required. It never was required; it was never needed. I trained in the Catholic system, along with the role models that I have just talked about, and male-only scholarships were not needed or required back then and to this very day are still not required. </para><para>The immediate situation has been resolved adequately and change is no longer needed to be made to the Sex Discrimination Act. If the government were serious about creating a balanced work force in schools, the Prime Minister would provide a serious policy proposal. In March, Pru Goward, the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, stated: </para><quote><para>There are any number of alternative programs that are not discriminatory and which do not need a legislative amendment, such as paying teachers more.</para></quote><para>That seems a very simple answer to me. Men and teenagers in this community would be attracted to university and to the teaching profession if, at the end of the day, they knew they would be paid the same as IT gurus who come out of university with some sort of computer knowledge or expertise. People who are qualified as accountants, economists or lawyers start on a salary far in excess of what a first-year-out teacher would expect. </para><para>The argument put forward by the government relates to the lack of male role models for young boys. There are a number of flaws in the argument to change the Sex Discrimination Act on that basis. This afternoon I heard a number of people from the government talk in this debate about how men teach better than women, how they behave differently in front of a classroom and how they have different ways of interacting with children—from my experience, no more than anyone else. Each and every person is an individual who behaves and reacts differently in front of a group of 30 kids on a day-to-day basis. That is the beauty of teaching; that is the nature of it. To have your child, year after year, sit in front of a different teacher is how they come across different personalities, whether teachers are male or female. Different techniques are used, whether teachers are male or female. I have taught with some wonderful teachers who were females. I have taught with some duds who were males. I have also taught with some great men. One teacher in particular whom I remember quite favourably is Bob Bekkers. He did a famous unit on the <inline font-style="italic">Titanic </inline>every year. It was a unit that he had developed, and it was something to be admired and commended. It is not because they are men that they teach better. It is not because they are men that they become better role models for kids in schools. It is their professional nature. It is the individuality of that teacher. It is the skills that that teacher has that makes them the teacher they are; it is not because of the gender of that teacher. </para><para>The government never mentions in a positive way the needs of girls or the role of women in this society. Sure it is good for boys to have good male role models to look to, but what about girls? Surely there is a need for girls to have good male role models as well. Male teachers will not rectify the lack of male role models available to young boys or girls. Increasing the number of male teachers does not remove the responsibility of fathers, brothers, uncles, grandfathers and, might I add, football players or politicians to be good role models for young people. The absence of male role models at home will not and cannot be rectified simply by having a male teacher in front of your child between the hours of nine and three every day. It is not going to happen. Not only has the government approached this in an ad hoc, short-term manner but also it has managed to trivialise the important contribution that female teachers make to the profession and the need for quality teachers in our schools as well as adequate resources. It is the professional development that teachers undertake—male or female. It is the skills training. It is building on their knowledge. It is the mentoring that occurs. It is the availability of good and first-class resources that will determine whether or not your child's education is at the standard of quality that is expected by parents.  </para><para>The government has failed to provide solid evidence which shows how this bill and specifically how these changes to the Sex Discrimination Act would, if passed, increase the number of men wanting to embark on a teaching career. The government has also failed to explain adequately why this hastily introduced piece of legislation is still being pursued, following the successful resolution of the issue between the Sydney Catholic Education Office and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Contrary to recent media reports, the Sydney Catholic Education Office did not request a change to the Sex Discrimination Act. They did not ask for this change. They did not want this change. They did not believe there was a need for this change. And they have achieved what they wanted. They stated:</para><quote><para>A far bigger challenge is the need to address the underlying reasons why more men are not attracted to teaching. These include the status of the profession, salaries and career opportunities. </para></quote><para>The bottom line is that the fundamental issue of improving educational outcomes for boys will not be addressed by the changes proposed in this legislation.</para><para>There is no evidence that males are not entering the primary teaching profession because of sex discrimination or financial disadvantage. They are not entering the profession because there are not enough university places. They are not entering the profession because there is not a high prestige status attached to being a teacher in this day and age in this country. The government's own report on boys' educational outcomes entitled <inline font-style="italic">Boys</inline><inline font-style="italic">:</inline><inline font-style="italic"> getting it right</inline> did not propose changes to the Sex Discrimination Act as a tool for addressing the substantive issues. This measure in isolation will not deliver on the stated objectives, yet the government refuses to move on the 23 other recommendations that were contained in the House of Representatives report.</para><para>The existing act provides sufficient flexibility for worthwhile initiatives. The government has failed to provide one good reason to support making changes to the Sex Discrimination Act. The Labor Party will not support this proposal. We believe, and I personally believe, that there is an ingrained problem within the teaching profession that this government has refused to acknowledge—in fact, the policies and the actions of this government have entrenched the problem—and that is the lack of resources. By that I mean there is a need for updated equipment. Teachers should have laptops. Computers should be available to all kids in the classroom. You will never provide quality education when a child goes home at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, switches on their computer, accesses the Internet and explores all the wonderful web sites but, when they come back to the classroom at 9 o'clock the next day, they are bored out of their brain, with just a pen, paper, chalk and a whiteboard in front of them. It will never work. Whether there is a male or a female teacher standing in front of them, the quality of their education will not improve until kids get modern, up-to-date technology with which they can learn. </para><para>So it is about resources in schools. It is also about providing teachers with the status that is afforded to people who have eminence in our society, such as lawyers and doctors. This is about the people who develop your child's mind on a constant basis from 9 o'clock until 3 o'clock, six hours a day, 100 days a year. These people need their profession to be enhanced, valued and well resourced. Anybody who enters the teaching profession needs to gain the recognition that theirs is a valued profession. Then people, regardless of whether they are male or female, would be queuing to get into that profession. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>23110</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>APA</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to start by putting a couple of facts on the table in this debate on the <inline ref="R1999">Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004</inline>. Firstly, far too few men choose teaching as a career. A lot drop out during their studies and a lot do not continue after experiencing teaching. Secondly, the results of the basic skills tests show that, on average, boys are not doing as well as girls. They are not picking up the basic skills as quickly as girls do.</para></talk.start><para>There is another set of facts that the government does not seem to want to acknowledge. In the Attorney-General's second reading speech, he said:</para><quote><para>Research shows that teaching is not an attractive career option for men for reasons including concerns about salary and the perception of a risk of allegations of abusing children in schools.</para></quote><para>HREOC agrees with the minister and says that men are dropping out of teaching, not choosing teaching or not wanting to be teachers for a raft of reasons but not because of any discrimination. They are choosing—they are voting with their feet—not to teach; hence, affirmative action programs are inappropriate. This bill arises because male-only scholarships would breach the Sex Discrimination Act, and the exemptions that are in the act do not cover scholarships. Lastly, it is women, not men, who are marginalised once we get people into the work force. </para><para>Let us look at how this debate started. It started because the Catholic Education Office applied for an exemption so it could award 12 male-only scholarships. That was sorted out. There was no need for the government to pursue this issue. It was sorted out by the Catholic Education Office coming back and offering 12 female scholarships—in other words, 24 in all—and the CEO was then granted an exemption. If the government want to persist down this route—and I argue strongly that they should not—they should go down the route that has already been suggested by a number of other speakers and look at what is it about teaching that is turning people away. If the government really want to go down the route of HREOC and equal opportunity, they need to look at areas where there is a shortage of women in teaching. One of the obvious places is in senior maths and science. There is a shortage of female teachers of physics, chemistry, biology and maths in those senior years and also a substantial shortage of women in promotional positions—principals and deputy principals—across our schools, both private and public. </para><para>If the government must pursue this, to balance out the boys why not provide 500 scholarships for girls who want to teach senior maths and science? I would like to encourage this government to look at 1,000 scholarships, for men and women, because we are running out of teachers. Some very bright students in schools I used to work in wandered off late in year 10 or early in year 11 because they either did not have the encouragement and support from their families to go on or they could not afford to stay on. In many cases they did not even see university as an option. Teaching was not something they would look at without some encouragement.</para><para>Let us look at what is discouraging men from taking up teaching. I will start with some of the stresses that teachers experience and the message that sends to the students, particularly the senior students. The shortage of teachers is now becoming more and more evident. It is worse in some states than others. It is worse in some subject areas, such as maths and science, than it is in others. Generally in rural and remote areas it is much worse than in our main capital cities and in larger centres.</para><para>We do need thousands more places for teachers in our universities, and we need them very quickly. We are looking at the average age of teachers being at or close to 50—indeed, in one state it is over 50—right across Australia now. We have to move before we have a major problem. Let us look at some of the situations that teachers find themselves in in my home state. These are issues that have been reported to me just this year, in the last few months. We have in South Australia students of more than one year level sharing a laboratory because there simply is not enough space in the school. There are several schools where there are simply not enough classrooms. There are several schools that have run out of TRT days—temporary relieving teacher support—for the year. What they do from now I do not know. If they have sporting fixtures and arrangements, or perhaps camps—although there are many schools in South Australia that cannot afford to give students the opportunity of those sorts of experiences—where teachers are needed to accompany students, I do not know what they will do. Indeed, one school recently reported to me that now there is rationing on the photocopy paper.</para><para>Let us just look at the sorts of stresses that all of that puts on not just the students but also the teachers. Some of them simply do not cope. Apart from going out on stress leave and having time off, some simply decide it is all too hard and find another profession where they feel valued and where they are not under those stresses. But one of the key issues for the teachers I speak to is that many schools cannot afford the resources to work more effectively with students that are playing up—students who are making mischief in the classroom, students who are disruptive and students who in many cases have a mental illness. This does not just impact on the teacher, obviously; it is a major burden on the rest of the class. Most schools now, particularly state schools in South Australia, do not have the resources to cope adequately with these students. When I was teaching, when there was not the requirement to teach as many lessons as there is now for South Australian teachers, there was often an opt-out option, extra school counsellors and ways in which these students could be supported. But today the reduction in resources and the increasing workloads of teachers mean that the classroom teacher and the homeroom teacher have to cope with these students with very little or no support. Other options—outside-of-school options and related options—that would help these at-risk students, such as Operation Flinders, are also struggling for resources. </para><para>The point I wish to stress here is that, if the minister is serious about attracting more men and more boys into teaching, let us get more women in as well and more teachers in general by increasing the standard of equipment and facilities across all our schools. Let us get a better method of funding our schools that are really under stress and that do not have enough classrooms. Forget about the school ovals that have to be watered and the pools that some schools are able to provide; let us look at those schools that do not have classrooms and adequate resources just for basic teaching.</para><para>I would like to look at one other issue: what happens after school. I have to acknowledge—and we all acknowledge here—that boys lag behind at some stages in some of those tests in primary and secondary schools but they soon catch up after university, particularly in those areas where it counts, where money, status and career opportunities are afforded them. I am not trying to trivialise the real problems that some students experience, but why are we not just helping all students who are struggling at whatever stage and in whatever particular curriculum area—it may be maths, reading or writing? Some kids simply do not pick up some of these skills until they are eight or nine. I have tested kids and found that they are not on the scale at eight, by nine they are reading at the level of a five- or six-year-old, and by 10 they are up at the level of a 15-year-old. Some kids simply learn at different stages. Let us help every student that is not coping.</para><para>Afterwards, as we look at students who have been through school and have graduated from university, we see that men certainly dominate the work force, particularly in those professions where a lot of money and prestige are attached. We see in Australia that only 8.4 per cent of senior executive positions are held by women. Just two of Australia's top 200 companies have a woman as their CEO. More Australian women are working part time now than at any time in the past and more than in any other OECD country. In many of these cases this is not by choice. Rather, it is for a raft of reasons, including lack of quality long-term day care. Because they are working fewer hours, women have less money with which to support themselves and their families and less money to put aside for their retirement. Average weekly `all employees total earnings' in November 2003 were: females, $578.70; males, $894.60. Starting salaries after graduation—and these are 2003 figures—were $38,000 for men and $36,300 for women. Women have been graduating in equal numbers from law for the last 25 years, yet fewer than 10 per cent of partners in legal firms are women. So, for a raft of reasons, I simply cannot support this legislation.</para><para>I make a final plea to this government and also to state and territory governments to work together to make sure that those students who at the moment are simply not getting a fair go in our high schools and those students who are often leaving well before they should can get some real opportunities to continue on and reach their full potential. Those students desperately need more scholarships. I am not suggesting for a moment that another 500 scholarships are not needed for teachers; indeed, I would argue that the government should make 1,000 scholarships and make sure that they are not going to take existing HECS places—and, by the way, HECS did not go up in the recent legislation because of the shortage of teachers. HECS places should be increased by at least 1,000 in the coming year with 1,000 scholarships. My only hesitation in not supporting this bill is that I do not want to lose scholarships for teaching, because we are going to hit a crisis in a few years. </para><para>I say to the government: please go away and rethink this. Come back with 1,000 new scholarships for teaching, regardless of whether they are for men or women—or at least 500 each—and come back with a package that you have worked through with state and territory governments that will really put resources into the schools that desperately need them, not into those schools where you have looked at some shonky assessment of what their parents' wealth is rather than what the wealth of the school is and the capacity the school has to meet the needs of its students.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>23113</page.no><name role="metadata">Buckland, Sen Geoffrey</name><name role="display">Senator BUCKLAND</name><name.id>009D2</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I was not going to say too much about the <inline ref="R1999">Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004</inline> except that I am quite concerned that the government wants to bring in changes that may well not fit the needs of our country. There has been an inquiry into this matter, and I was particularly pleased—not because I am on this side of the chamber—that my colleagues who were on that committee were unable to agree with the government on this and put in a dissenting report. We believe there is a need to implement something that provides for the development of a larger range of strategies and programs to address the issues and also the perceptions of the community when talking about having more men in teaching positions. It is something I can see a need for but it is not so essential that women cannot deal with many of the issues confronting us in our schools. We would all like to see more men in the teaching profession; we would all like to see more women—and young women—turning to this career.</para></talk.start><para>When I was at school—let me say, many years ago; I try to forget those years—the teaching profession was seen as a profession. The government has let education fall by only providing large amounts of money to the rich schools—the private schools—while leaving the public schools lacking, and this needs to be addressed. Until we bring back the professionalism and give respect to those men and women in our schools, the respect that they deserve for educating our young people to go on to further their careers, we are not going to attract anyone.</para><para>Many young people are not choosing teaching as a career because they see it as a dead-end job. When I was young the dead-end jobs were always in factories. Today young people see that no-one cares about education, so why should they put the effort in? You go to the schools—I regularly do because I still have a son at high school—and the teachers are dedicated but they see that no-one really cares. The government does not care. It does not provide the services. It does not provide sufficient resources to the poorer schools in our community, and this is where we are lacking. I am pleased that the Labor senators on the committee saw the need to take this a little further. The bill in my view is ineffective. It does not address the measures required to correct the gender imbalance. We have got to do that.</para><para>Senators need to understand that not all of us had the good fortune to go to a rich school. Some of us had to struggle. Our parents had to struggle to get us where we were. Many young people dropped out of school young, and that is a crying shame. I can recall not very long ago in my previous occupation having a 43-year-old man come to me. I had worked with this man for many years and watched him read the newspaper every day. I saw him pick up books and read them. He came to me to get some assistance with a work injury, and I asked him to fill out a form. The man could not write more than his own name. He could not read. He had to bluff his way through and look as if he was doing something. Unless we address this imbalance in schools, put the care back into teaching and make teachers feel appreciated, we are going to have more people who cannot read, write or address the issues of the world. In the short time I have, I have to say that this bill lacks the substance required to address the needs of our nation today when it comes to education. </para><para>Debate interrupted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES</title><type>Notices</type><page.no>23114</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Presentation</title><page.no>23114</page.no></subdebateinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allison</inline> to move on the next day of sitting:</para><motion><para>That the following matter be referred to the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee for inquiry and report by 11 August 2004:</para><para>The principles of the Government's schools funding package and the effect of these principles on:</para><para>	(a)	the capacity of all schools to meet current and future school needs and to achieve the Adelaide Declaration (1999) on National Goals for Schooling in the Twenty-First Century;</para><para>	(b)	the role and responsibility of the Federal Government, in partnership with state and territory governments, for quality, equity, efficiency and effectiveness in public funding for government and non-government schools across Australia;</para><para>	(c)	the effectiveness of accountability arrangements for state, territory and Federal governments' funding of govern-ment and non-government schools; and</para><para>	(d)	the application of the framework of principles for the funding of schools that has been endorsed by state and territory governments through the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs.</para></motion></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>23114</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">McLucas, Jan (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator McLucas)</inline>—Order!

The Perth-centric focus of this state government has rendered regional Western Australians the state's `forgotten people'. In Western Australia our farmers, miners, forestry workers and orchardists are among the most hardworking and productive people in the nation. To be treated as contemptuously as they are being treated by their state government in Perth is an outrage and a travesty in the minds of all fair and decent Western Australians.</para></talk.start><para>Recent legislative changes to environmental laws by the Western Australian Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Ms Edwards, were specifically made to appease the Greens and to secure the prized electoral preferences that the Labor Party so desperately need. This legislative direction is causing chaos and wreaking havoc in country Western Australia. It has got to such a critical stage that farmers are being forced to break the current laws just to go about their daily business on their private land. Recently we had the ludicrous situation in Western Australia where an 82-year-old farmer was charged by CALM officers for driving on a CALM reserve. This farmer is a great Western Australian, a great Australian and a great community servant in his district. He has devoted his retirement years to lobbying governments, on both sides of the political fence, to come up with workable solutions to Western Australia's No. 1 environmental crisis—namely, dryland salinity. This gentleman had been at a reserve investigating an increase in water levels and salinity problems in the area and, for his trouble, was booked by CALM officers for a trespass-like offence, carrying a criminal penalty. </para><para>Labor has passed laws in Perth removing the rights of farmers and land-holders—freehold land-holders—to remove even one tree, dead or alive, from their properties without permission from some bureaucrat residing often hundreds of kilometres away from the land that is being farmed. This is clearly an untenable situation for landowners. They are being forced to apply for clearing permits to remove even one plant. </para><para>Farm leaders are warning the state government that the new set of environmental laws that has been introduced is simply an accident waiting to happen in terms of the increased bushfire risk in many regional towns and centres, particularly those adjacent to CALM or conservation reserves throughout rural Western Australia. Under the provisions of these new environmental laws, there are fines of up to $500,000 for individuals and $1 million for companies for actions which farmers see as normal day-to-day practices, such as clearing fence lines and installing effective firebreaks. The <inline font-style="italic">West </inline><inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 5 February 2004 reported:</para><quote><para>... fire control officers fear that the fines will also apply to emergency actions taken to stop fires, such as back-burning without the regulated ministerial approval or sanction by Conservation and Land Management staff.</para></quote><para>The article goes on:</para><quote><para>“I've had a gutful,” former fire control officer and Jurien farmer Rodney Ward said.</para><para>He said it was bureaucracy gone mad and was turning everyone into policemen.</para></quote><para>...	...	...</para><quote><para>...

In essence, the legislation is imposing public ownership and control over private freehold property, with farmers having to apply for, and pay for, permits to go about their normal, routine daily activities. Farmers and pastoralists throughout the state will simply be unable to comply with proposed new limits involving firebreaks, fence lines, access roads, regrowth, firewood, shade and just the everyday run-of-the-mill maintenance activities that are part and parcel of farm life.</para><para>In the <inline font-style="italic">Farm Weekly</inline> on 5 February this year, PGA spokesperson Craig Underwood further said:</para><quote><para>Some of these impositions, especially those relating to fire control, will be life threatening. The Environmental Protection Act has been amended, and these regulations are being formulated to stop all land clearing in WA. But the bureaucrats are extending this ban to include twig snapping regulations that will make CALM's recent attempted prosecutions against farmers Alan Yandle and Laurie Carmody entirely tame by comparison. </para></quote><para>Both of the gentlemen mentioned in that article are recognised in their districts as outstanding servants of their communities. It is a very sorry, sad situation when the law is as ridiculous as that which the state government has enacted in Perth for people living in country Western Australia.</para><para>Breaches of these regulations can result in massive six-figure fines, as I have set out, with consequent property confiscation in the enforcement of them. These crazy laws are undermining farmers' efforts and providing significant disincentive to farmers to make investment in medium- and long-term conservation practices and capital works. I note that all of these measures have been implemented without proper undertaking as to any compensation to the freehold landowners.</para><para>But what is most galling is witnessing huge sums of money being spent on a concept in Perth called Bushplan and on other city initiatives—on the one hand, clearing for housing in wet-lands and bush areas but, on the other hand, offering only a paltry $1 million to compensate private landowners for the loss of thousands and thousands of hectares of productive agricultural land that they are no longer able to develop.</para><para>In Western Australia Premier Gallop has failed country people with his lack of policies and starvation of regional Western Australia of resources. Farmers and miners are not even guaranteed a reliable electricity supply in Western Australia. The reckless expenditure that is taking place in and around Perth in projects like the flawed Mandurah to Perth railway line is taking precedence over the $500 million at least that is necessary to upgrade the power grid infrastructure throughout inland Western Australia. It was an election commitment by the previous Court government but something that Labor in power has simply failed to commit to.</para><para>There are a number of other measures that I want to mention briefly which effectively amount to an assault upon people in country Western Australia. The planning minister has reduced the truckload capacity of transport companies, increasing the number of heavy bulk haulage vehicles on all country roads by 30 per cent. Recently, country school bus contractors were bludgeoned into accepting substantially less beneficial contracts, with the minister pointing a gun at their heads saying her terms were not negotiable and contractors had to sign the contracts on a take it or leave it basis. The same contractors also had to sign deeds of release and waivers acknowledging that they had no rights at law arising from undue influence or any other actionable conduct by the minister or the department. Country road funding in Western Australia by the state government has virtually halted and is now almost the sole province of the federal and local governments. In reintroducing the concept of Roads to Recovery the current budget has gone a long way to repairing and to seeking to catch up on the huge gap that has developed in the provision of adequate, safe and proper roads throughout Western Australia. Country people are desperately sick and tired of the maladministration they are being afforded by their government in Perth.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tay, Professor Alice Erh-Soon, AM</title><page.no>23116</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>23116</page.no><name role="metadata">Payne, Sen Marise</name><name role="display">Senator PAYNE</name><name.id>M56</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise this evening to pay tribute to a great Australian, Alice Erh-Soon Tay, AM, who passed away on 26 April 2004, aged 70. Professor Tay was President of the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission for five years from April 1998 and will be remembered for her work as an exceptionally talented legal academic, author and editor. She was fluent in Chinese, Russian and English. She held a distinguished tenure as Director of the Centre for Asian and Pacific Law at the University of Sydney and was the author, editor, co-author or co--editor of around 20 books and over 100 comprehensive articles. Her career in legal academia was most impressive and earned her an Order of Australia in 1986 for her `contribution to teaching and research in law'. </para></talk.start><para>Alice was awarded her PhD from the Australian National University in 1964. As Senator Mason, a graduate from the ANU Law School, advised me today, she was said to be one of the first doctoral candidates from the ANU Law School. She was recognised as a barrister-at-law at Lincoln's Inn in the United Kingdom, at the High Court of Singapore, at the Supreme Court of the ACT and at the Supreme Court of New South Wales. I understand her school education was at the Raffles Girls School in Singapore. She was the Challis Professor of Jurisprudence at the University of Sydney, a fellow of the Australian Academy of Social Services, Academician Titulaire of the International Academy of Comparative Law in Paris and a visiting professor in the Ministry of Justice in Vietnam.</para><para>Professor Tay was a part-time commissioner with the Australian Law Reform Commission, a member of the Australian Science and Technology Council, President of the International Association for Philosophy of Law and Social Philosophy and President of the National Office of Overseas Skills Recognition. Her skill and ability as a teacher have influenced countless students and her reputation as a challenging professor merely improved her stature among the legal fraternity. In fact, many lawyers in the community today gained much from her intellect when they were her students. I know that to have been the observation of the Attorney-General, the Hon. Phillip Ruddock, in his remarks upon her passing.</para><para>Professor Tay lectured in many countries throughout her distinguished career and acted as a visiting fellow in the United States, Canada, the PRC, Italy, Japan and Germany. Her work at the Centre for Asian and Pacific Law is noteworthy for the energetic commitment she showed to organising and conducting intensive legal training courses for Vietnam and the People's Republic of China both at home in Australia and in those countries, and sponsored by Australian and international aid bodies.</para><para>Most importantly I want to note tonight a number of her activities in the human rights area. She worked tirelessly as a defender of human rights both here in Australia and abroad within our region—always constructively, always with integrity. She was a staunch defender of the rule of law and saw in it the possibilities to advance her universal cause. Her humanity never wavered in the face of some of the most testing cases surrounding the protection of human rights in Australia during her tenure at the commission. Her cases included the legal interventions concerning the MV<inline font-style="italic"> Tampa</inline>, issues of legal representation of asylum seekers in detention and the clarification of the rights of children. Yet Professor Tay's deep conviction that we are all entitled to live our lives with the basic freedoms and responsibilities to maintain dignity enabled her most particularly to cut right through the politics of a situation and to work as an effective promoter of human rights in this country.</para><para>It is fair to say that she did not regard the Universal Declaration on Human Rights as a `noble aspiration' but as an essential legal principle. And she did not expect these principles to be adhered to unless they were backed by essential education on the role and importance of human rights in our society. Long-term progress towards the most effective observance of human rights is only possible when people are aware of the standards by which they can be held. Professor Tay was highly regarded both in Australia and throughout the world for her effort in the promotion of human rights and the rule of law and has made an enduring contribution with her life's work. Indeed, observations by the current President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, Justice John von Doussa, that Professor Tay continued work on her many interests following her departure from the commission a year ago despite her health should not be surprising at all to those of us who knew Alice. </para><para>She was committed to the promotion of human rights with Australia's regional neighbours, particularly the People's Republic of China, where she worked determinedly through the Australia-China human rights dialogue; Indonesia, where she gave support for the human rights commission, Komnas Ham; and through the Asia-Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions. It was in recognition of this life's work that the first Alice Tay Human Rights Award was presented last year through the Australia-China Council. I am very pleased that her work in promoting human rights in China has been recognised with such an enduring honour.</para><para>For my own part, I enjoyed the odd Alice Tay jurisprudence lecture at the University of Sydney myself, although not in fact as a student at the University of Sydney, as I was studying law at the University of New South Wales. My then boyfriend was attending jurisprudence lectures at the University of Sydney and—the things we do for love!—I went with him. The Alice Tay lectures were well reputed amongst the students at the university and the Eugene Kamenka and Alice Tay jurisprudence text was much thumbed through.</para><para>I know that, during her period as President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and my time as Chair of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, the relationship between the commission and the committee has been a very valuable one. I was always very pleased to have the opportunity to work with Alice on those important human rights matters. I also remember participating on behalf of the parliament with Mr Ripoll, a member in the other place, in the Australia-China human rights dialogue—one of the regular dialogues which was held in Canberra about two years ago. Alice, as President of HREOC, had flown in from points far—as ever—to participate in the dialogue, to bring her own perspective of the time she had spent training in human rights and in legal studies in the People's Republic of China and to bring her witty and amusing observations on the practice of Falun Gong and the approach of the government of the People's Republic of China to that. Ill, still travelling and still working, she was making an extraordinary contribution even that short time ago.</para><para>I know that Professor Tay as a person, as an academic and as an advocate of the observation of the most fundamental human rights is an individual, in fact a great woman, who will be very sorely missed in the community in Australia and most particularly at the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. It was quite clear to me in the latter stages of Alice's involvement with the commission that the people surrounding her, the people with whom she worked, were not just her friends and not just her colleagues but in many cases were like her family. I know that her passing is sorely felt at the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. </para><para>We as Australians, and any of us who are interested in the observation of and the support of human rights, the rights and freedoms that we as Australians all too often take for granted—and anyone who has been interested in the discussions of recent days about how human rights should be observed and about how those who support the rule of law and who fight for freedom and liberty should go about observing those human rights—will miss Alice Tay and recognise that we owe her a great debt of gratitude for her life's work. I want to offer her family and her friends my personal condolences and if I may, where it is appropriate, the condolences of my parliamentary colleagues.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Budget 2004-05</title><page.no>23119</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>23119</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to talk about dishonesty in the federal budget. The government is supposed to be abiding by a charter of budget honesty. Yet its presentation of its tax, family payments and superannuation changes last night was dishonest in the extreme and in my view has misled the Australian people. I refer in particular to the <inline font-style="italic">More help for families</inline> document released last night, which includes 15 cameos of how the package will benefit various households. The three family types modelled are those with one child aged under five; those with two children, with one aged under five and one aged between five and 12; and those with two children, both aged between five and 12. The modelling is done for a single income family, a family with a 50-50 income split, a family with a 67-33 income split and a family with an 80-20 income split. There is even a little table for individuals who have not yet done their patriotic duty and had children. The benefits outlined on that table are a little sparse, especially for those on lower incomes.</para></talk.start><para>The tables are misleading in the extreme. For a start, the family assistance is presented in both per annum and per week formats, but the government's benefit will not be available on a weekly basis and the $600 lump sum will be available only at the end of the year. For the one-third of families who regularly underestimate their income, the benefit will be a lot less than $600 a child after the overpayments are repaid.</para><para>But what really upsets me is the presentation of the superannuation tax changes. On every table the government superannuation co-contribution is counted as a tax benefit and added into the total per week benefit under the package. The government's tables of cameos do include a little note down the bottom that the benefit is the `difference between maximum contribution from Government under existing and new scheme'. Ignoring the grammatical errors, that is a lot different from saying that the co-contribution is payable only if a person is making voluntary contributions. There are three big problems with putting the contribution into these cameo tables. First, it is not payable on a weekly basis but it is payable only at the end of the year and it is payable only to your superannuation fund, not to your family. Second, it is payable only if the individual makes a voluntary contribution to super. On the government's own costings, only around 10 per cent of low-income earners are expected to make such a contribution and be eligible for the payment. So why include it in the tables for everyone? Third, the government forgets that the co-contribution is payable to low-income spouses of high-income earners. That means that its dual income cameos are misleading.</para><para>The 50-50 income split cameo acknowledges that a co-contribution can be payable on a family income of up to $110,000. But the 67-33 income split cameo assumes that only the dominant income earner will claim the co-contribution, because it runs out at a private income of $85,000. But what if a couple decides to pay the co-contribution into the lower-earning partner's super, which is what many are expected to do? On a 67-33 split, the co-contribution is payable to a family earning up to $174,000. The total benefit, even on the government's dodgy figuring, is underrated by $500 a year for a family on an income of $100,000. For a couple with an 80-20 income spilt, the co-contribution would be payable on an income of up to $290,000. Yet, the cameo table has it petering out at $70,000. Of course, the super co-contribution is only going to be picked up by a minority of low-income earners—10 per cent according to Treasury and 20 to 30 per cent according to the modelling of the superannuation industry. </para><para>The high-income earners surcharge cut is payable to 100 per cent of high-income earners, yet it does not rate a mention in the cameos. For someone on $100,000 with a nine per cent salary contribution to superannuation, the high-income earners surcharge provides a $225 per annum tax cut in 2004-05, which will rise to a $675 per annum tax cut by 2006-07. The tax cut rises with income, yet this tax cut is missing from the cameos. Again, the public is being misled. A family on $130,000 with an 80-20 split would be simultaneously eligible for the full superannuation co-contribution, the full high-income earners surcharge cut and the full tax cuts. But this is not mentioned in the cameos.</para><para>The treatment of superannuation and the misleading presentation of an annual family benefit as a weekly benefit make the cameos misleading, as I have said. It is spin at the worst level. No government should aim to mislead the public so much, yet this government intends spending up to $23 million doing so using these massively misleading cameos. So how did the media report these cameos and this document presented as official fact by government? I appreciate that covering the budget is hard work for journalists working to tight timetables, but when the government produces such a piece of misleading drivel and masquerades it as `factual information' we rely on our journalists to sort the story out. Nor does it help when the Treasurer keeps saying that the `average family' will be $50 a week better off, when the actual family assistance does not meet $50 a week for any family with two children or fewer unless they access the high-income earners tax cuts—in which case, of course, they cease to be `average'.</para><para>The <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> get full marks for their cameos. They completely ignored the government's cameos in its document and ignored the superannuation changes and presented the family assistance as an annual figure, not a weekly figure. The Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> also chose to ignore the superannuation changes in its benefit tables. The Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> did quite well: its tables had a column for the total benefit `with voluntary super' and `without voluntary super'. Other newspapers published the government's tables in full. The <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> at least included an explanation of the changes, pointing out that to be eligible for the superannuation co-contribution taxpayers must make one-third the size of that on offer from the government. The <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> replicated the government's footnote on the co-contribution in small print, as did the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline>. I regret to note that the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> also had a very large typo on the front page of today's paper, which I am sure they will move to correct very quickly as it implies a massive tax cut for low-income earners that does not actually exist. The worst performance, however, belongs to the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline>. It published a table with 11 cameos under the title `Helping Hand'. It replicated the final figure from the government tables with no breakdown and without any mention that it includes a superannuation co-contribution. The table is highly misleading in that it replicates two of the three government footnotes but omits the third one on super. In addition, the table publishes all of this on a weekly benefit basis, not acknowledging that the two payments on family and super are annual end of year payments. </para><para>The Australian people deserve much better than the misleading cameos presented by the government in its family cameos in this document published last night. Australians deserve to be told the truth about the tax and family package presented by the Treasurer yesterday. They need to know that only 20 per cent of Australians will get a tax cut—those earning above $52,000 a year. They need to know that the tiny percentage earning over $100,000 a year get two tax cuts—a superannuation tax cut as well as an income tax cut—and that if they have a low-income spouse they get a third tax cut by being eligible for the superannuation co-contribution and are possibly eligible for an increase in family tax payment part B. I hope that our media outlets do their job and produce their own cameos—cameos that the government has left out—which will show just how skewed this package is towards high-income earners and just how unfair it is for the majority of Australians.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 7.18 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>23121</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>23121</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following government documents were tabled:</para><quote><para>Treaties—<inline font-style="italic">Bilateral</inline>—</para><para>Text, together with national interest analysis and annexures—</para><para>Exchange of Letters constituting an Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of New Zealand to amend Article 3 of the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agree-ment (ANZCERTA) of 28 March 1983.</para><para>Treaty between the Government of Australia and the Government of the French Republic on cooperation in the maritime areas adjacent to the French Southern and Antarctic Territories (TAAF), Heard Island and the McDonald Islands (Canberra, 24 November 2003).</para><para>Text, together with national interest analysis, regulation impact statement and annexures—Australia-Thailand Free Trade Agreement, and associated exchanges of letters.</para><para>United Nations—Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights—Communications—</para><para>No. 1154/2003—Outline.</para><para>No. 1243/2004—Outline.</para></quote></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>23121</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><quote><para>Census and Statistics Act—Australian Bureau of Statistics—Statement No. 2 of 2004.</para><para>Corporations Act—Accounting Standard AASB 1047—Disclosing the Impacts of Adopting Australian Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards.</para></quote></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions on Notice</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>23122</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Sustainable Regions Program</title><page.no>23122</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1747)</subtitle><id.no>1747</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>23122</page.no><name role="metadata">McLucas, Sen Jan</name><name role="display">Senator McLucas</name><name.id>84L</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 8 August 2003:</para></talk.start><quote><para>With reference to the Sustainable Regions Programme's funding to the Atherton Tablelands region:</para></quote><para>(1)	What funds were allocated to the program.</para><para>(2)	What are the outcomes sought by the Commonwealth Government for this funding program.</para><para>(3)	How does the level of funding for the Atherton Tablelands compare with that allocated for other regions.</para><para>(4)	When was the funding for the Atherton Tablelands allocated.	</para><para>(5)	Over what timeframe have the funds been allocated.</para><para>(6)	What processes have been put in place to determine that strategic holistic regional objectives are identified and met.</para><para>(7)	Will all of the $18 million allocated which is reported to be allocated to the Atherton Tablelands, be provided;

ATSRAC identified priorities based on prior reports and community consultations and in the context of their local knowledge. In July 2002, ATSRAC released an Action Plan 2002-2005 and sought feedback from the community. In January 2003, ATSRAC released a Strategic Framework and Prospectus for Regional Development 2002-2005 and subsequently ran community consultation forums seeking feedback on the prospectus. When funding agreements are prepared with grantees, the Department of Transport and Regional Services includes the `regional priorities' to be addressed by the project in the contract (so that they can be quantified, measured and reported on). </para><para>(7)	The Atherton Tablelands Sustainable Region has been allocated up to $18m from the Sustainable Regions Programme.

Project approvals are available on the Internet at www.sustainableregions.gov.au.</para><para>(17)	The Minister for Transport and Regional Services values the frank discussions that form the basis of the Advisory Committee's advice to him and does not wish it to be constrained, as might occur if Committee members knew their deliberations would be made public. At the end of the day, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services is the decision-maker. </para><para>(18)	Yes. (a) Five, (b) and (c) In the interests of privacy, these projects and the committee members declaring an interest will not be made public. </para><para>(19)	(a) and (b) The general project criteria was determined by the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. `Regional priorities' were developed by the Sustainable Region Advisory Committee as per the process described in the answer to Question 6.

This includes project descriptions, funding contributions by proponents and from other sources and, where appropriate, the number and types of jobs created. As outlined in the answer to Question 10, the Programme uses an Expression of Interest phase prior to inviting formal applications. For this reason, only a few project applications have not been successful through not meeting the Programme criteria to a sufficient degree or through not successfully completing the due diligence assessment. I do not propose to comment on project proposals that are still awaiting a decision.</para><para>(21)	See the answer to Question 20.</para><para>(22)	During the assessment of the project the Advisory Committee and the Department of Transport and Regional Services consider the extent of the proponent's contribution to ensure the success of the project. </para><para>(23)	The Sustainable Regions Programme has a three-tiered due diligence framework for private sector applicants, dependent on the amount of money the applicant is seeking. Thresholds are indicative only. For projects requesting up to $50,000 a check of the applicant's legal status is completed. For projects seeking between $50,000 and $500,000, an applicant's financial history and corporate heath check is completed. For projects seeking over $500,000 a more detailed company and project viability assessment is completed where the Department of Transport and Regional Services considers it warranted.</para><para>(24)	15 out of 25 projects approved for funding have been private businesses or individuals.</para><para>(25)	Three applications.</para><para>(26)	Funding agreements (contracts) tie the achievement of outputs and outcomes to payment of grant funding.

Key performance indicators (outputs) are agreed to during contract negotiations between the applicant and the Department of Transport and Regional Services.

It provided an opportunity for all Ministers and organisational heads to establish personal relationships and discuss possible solutions to combat illegal fishing. It also gave me an opportunity to present Australia's position on illegal fishing and an outline of where the Government considers the key problems lie, in addition to emphasising our commitment to combat IUU fishing. My participation ensured that Australia will continue to be recognised as a world leader in the fight against IUU fishing and that our views on strengthening relevant international law and the governance regimes of regional fisheries organisations will be themes for future international work on the issue.  </para><para>A Ministerial Task Force on IUU Fishing was proposed by Elliot Morley MP, the United Kingdom's Minister for Environment and Agri-Environment at the OECD Roundtable. The Ministerial Task Force on IUU Fishing was formally launched on 1 December 2003. The Task Force will be led by Elliot Morley and will include Fisheries Ministers from Chile, Namibia, New Zealand and myself. The Task Force will operate for around 18 months and will develop a strategy to prevent and eliminate IUU fishing (with prioritised actions). The Task Force will work with non-government organisations and other countries to build support for the implementation of the plan.</para><para>(2)	No communiqu was issued by the meeting as the official invitations specifically stated it was to operate under Chatham House Rules and was primarily to inform and exchange ideas on the issue of IUU fishing.

Alternative detention options outside immigration detention facilities include:</para><para>	Residential Housing Projects (RHPs). RHPs provide a more domestic environment, enabling more autonomy (for example, in preparing meals). In addition to the usual recreational and social activities, residents are also able to go shopping and participate in community events. All women and children in detention are assessed against the guidelines for placement in a RHP or other detention arrangements. Participation in the RHPs is voluntary. Each individual family can decide whether to take up the RHP opportunity. RHPs operate in Port Augusta near Baxter IDF and Port Hedland near Port Hedland IRPC and a contingency RHP is at Woomera;</para><para>	Foster care arrangements with State child welfare authorities.

These are used in all States and Territories to varying degrees in locations where immigration detention centres are not available or for detainees whose criminal background or non-compliant behaviour cannot be effectively managed within an immigration detention centre. </para><para>(2)	All immigration detention facilities, currently in operation, are managed by a non-government Detention Services Provider (DSP) under contract to the Commonwealth. The operations of the DSP in all immigration detention facilities are closely monitored and scrutinised by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. Detention operations are also subject to a broad range of external scrutiny, including by the Commonwealth Ombudsman the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) and the Immigration Detention Advisory Group (IDAG). </para><para>(3)	The location of detainees as at 17 March 2004 is as follows:</para><para>	Baxter IDF		-	213</para><para>	Port Hedland IRPC	-	67</para><para>	Villawood IDC		-	484</para><para>	Maribyrnong IDC		-	71</para><para>	Christmas Island IRPC	-	52</para><para>	Perth IDC 		-	17</para><para>	RHPs			-	29</para><para>	Other 			-	105</para><para>				Total	1038</para><para>(4)	The Detention Services Contract between my Department and the DSP does not require specific numbers of staff, nor does it require reporting on this by the DSP to the department.

The Department's expectation is that the DSP has sufficient staff, and adjusts staff levels, to manage the needs of detainees at any given time. In this context, staff numbers will fluctuate in accordance with the needs of detainees and to ensure the safety and security of a detention facility. </para><para>A performance monitoring procedure has been built into the detention contract to ensure compliance with the IDS. Monitoring occurs periodically at all facilities to help ensure a continued high level of service delivery within each facility. However, if the Department and the DSP discuss staffing issues, it would be in the context of monitoring service delivery against the IDS. Where there are service delivery concerns, the range of factors leading to those concerns may include the adequacy and competency of staffing.</para><para>(5)	During the financial year 2002-03, the operating expense for all immigration detention centres and RHPs was $113.9M.

This usually occurs immediately upon arrival in Australia. Separation detention ensures that Australia's resources are directed at those with genuine claims for protection and not those who would use the protection process in an attempt to achieve broader migration outcomes. </para><para>(b)	Separation detention is also occasionally used to isolate unauthorised arrivals as a quarantine-type process until health screening is completed. It may also be used to isolate detainees with contagious diseases to protect the rest of the detainee population. </para><para>(c)	Detainees are sometimes segregated from the general population of a facility for observation in observation rooms or Management Units within Immigration Detention Facilities. These are used to monitor detainees who pose an immediate threat to themselves, to others or to the security and good order of the facility. For example, a detainee may be placed in a Management Unit for threats or acts of self-harm, property damage or violent behaviour toward others. From time to time detainees themselves request separation from the general population in a Management Unit for personal reasons.</para><para>(2)	Separation detention and the protection visa process </para><para>Detainees who are unauthorised arrivals and placed in separation detention because they have not raised claims or information which prima facie may engage Australia's protection obligations are advised of the reasons for their separation and their legal rights. Separation in these circumstances is usually in groups, not as individual separation.</para><para>In order to protect the integrity of the protection visa process, detainees in separation detention may not receive visitors, make telephone calls, send faxes or receive mail during the initial reception period. They may send one letter to a family member advising that they are safe. If a detainee requests a lawyer or contact with their declared Embassy or Consulate during this period, facilities for this contact are provided.</para><para>Detainees in separation detention who lodge a protection visa application are transferred from separation detention into a non-separation area where they have the ability to interact with the general population of the facility. All detainees in non-separation areas generally have full access to newspapers, telephones, reading material, television and radio services, pens, writing paper and envelopes. </para><para>Separation for health reasons</para><para>For certain highly contagious illnesses, detainees not requiring hospitalisation may be quarantined within a facility's observation or management unit(s) to limit the spread of a contagion. Quarantined detainees, in this circumstance, can return to the general population of a facility as soon as they have recovered from their illness. Individual medical management plans are assessed daily by a team of health professionals including doctors, nurses and other health care workers. These management plans are developed under the health protocols of the Detention Services Provider (DSP).</para><para>Separation for good order and security</para><para>In relation to a detainee in the circumstances outlined in (1)(c) above, an individual management plan for that detainee will be developed by the DSP. The aim of the plan is to equip the detainee to be able to re-join the general population of the centre as soon as possible.</para><para>Where appropriate (for example, if the detainee is assessed as at risk of suicide or self-harm), the detainee may also be managed by a Special Needs Care Team. This comprises senior DSP centre-based managers, a health services professional and any others determined by the DSP Centre Manager as appropriate to the circumstances of the case. It may include a psychiatrist, counsellor, doctor or mental health nurse as an individual case manager who determines appropriate treatment, including the level of observation required and what accommodation would best suit the needs of the detainee.</para><para>Subject to the individual management plan of a detainee and the security and good order of the facility, telephone calls and access to radio and television may be granted, where available. At all times, a detainee's access to their legal practitioner or other professional visitors will be facilitated.</para><para>(3)	The Department and the DSP can make decisions to segregate a detainee:</para><para>(a)	The decision to place detainees who are unauthorised arrivals and have not yet made claims that prima facie may engage Australia's protection obligations, in separation detention is made by my Department.</para><para>(b)	Detainees who have contracted a communicable disease are placed in quarantine on the advice of health professionals at the centre.</para><para>(c)	The decision to place a detainee in a Management Unit for reasons of good order or security is made by the DSP. In relation to detainees identified as being at risk of suicide or self harm, the decision will be made by a Special Needs Care Team.</para><para>(4)	Given the nature of the reasons for separation detention it is usually not possible to advise detainees in advance of a fixed period for such separation.</para><para>(5)	Please refer to (2) above.</para><para>(6)	Whilst the vast majority of detainees accommodated in a Management Unit are held there for less than five days, there is a range of reasons why a detainee could be held there for longer, depending on their individual circumstances including their response to their individual management plan. Please refer to answers to parts (1) and (2) above.</para><para>Individuals in Management Units, particularly those held there for longer periods, are carefully monitored. However, compiled data concerning the length of time detainees are accommodated in a Management Unit is not readily available. Its compilation would require manual searches of relevant records and, consequently, a large diversion of departmental resources.</para><para>(7)	If a detainee is accommodated in an observation room or Management Unit, the Department requires that it be advised by the DSP of the circumstances of that placement.</para><para>(8)	Separation or segregation is not to be used as punishment. Reading and music materials will be made available if this is consistent with the management needs of the detainee concerned. </para><para>(9)	Please refer to (2) above. Mental health professionals are involved where this is relevant to the particular circumstances of the case. Psychiatric support will depend on individual needs and is guided by professional medical advice.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Communications: Special Digital Data Service</title><page.no>23134</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2375)</subtitle><id.no>2375</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>23134</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator Lundy</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 10 November 2003.</para></talk.start><quote><para>With reference to the Digital Data Service Special Rebate:</para></quote><para>(1)	(a) How many people have applied for the rebate; (b) how many applications have been: (i) successful, and (ii) unsuccessful.</para><para>(2)	How much money has been allocated to this initiative, and of this money, how much has been spent.</para><para>(3)	Can a table be provided showing the grounds commonly given for rejecting applications and how many times each has been given.</para><para>(4)	On how many occasions did a rejection occur in an area which currently does not receive an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) service but is deemed to be potentially capable of receiving this service.</para><para>(5)	On what grounds would an area be deemed to be potentially capable of receiving an ISDN service, rather than not capable.</para><para>(6)	On how many occasions has an application for the rebate been denied because an area which cannot currently receive ISDN is deemed to be potentially capable of receiving an ISDN service, rather than not capable.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>23134</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Arts and Sport</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	(a)	There are two providers operating under the Special Digital Data Service Obligation (SDDSO), Telstra and Hotkey.

Hotkey advises that 16 applications for the SDDSO have been received.</para><para>(b)	Both Telstra and Hotkey advise that all applications for the rebate were successful.</para><para>(2)	The cost of the SDDSO is part of the funds appropriated by Parliament for the Universal Service Obligation. As with the cost of USO, however, the funds are recovered from industry through a levy. That is, the SDDSO, like the USO, is industry-funded. As such, it is not simply a question of funds being allocated to the activity and then being expended.</para><para>At the end of each financial year, SDDSO providers are able to submit claims to the Australian Communication Authority (ACA) for digital data costs incurred in fulfilling the SDDSO during that financial year. The ACA may make whatever inquiries it thinks necessary or desirable in order to determine whether or not claims correctly state the entitlement to an amount of the digital data cost of a provider. After making its inquiries, the ACA must make a written assessment, in respect of each SDDSO provider that submits a claim.</para><para>The costs claimed by a SDDSO provider relate to providing the customer rebate for SDDSO satellite equipment and installation. The total SDDSO costs accepted by the ACA are shared among carriers. The amount contributed by each carrier is based on its share of total eligible revenue. The ACA invoices carriers for their levy contributions, and the funds collected are then reimbursed to the SDDSO providers according to their digital data costs.

question: </para></talk.start><para>(1)	Since the Restaurant and Catering Industry Action Agenda commenced in November 2002, total departmental funding to be allocated to the Action Agenda up to June 30 2004 is estimated to be $596,326 (comprising an estimated salary allocation of $330,959 and an estimated allocation to `other departmental costs' of $265,367).</para><para>(2)	(a)	It is not possible to determine the totality of funds spent in developing the Action Agenda to date. The Department's funding has been limited to the provision of secretariat services, costs associated with the hosting of some meetings and some additional expenses such as research. Other costs such as time, travel and other expenses associated with industry participation, and participation by other departments in the Action Agenda, were borne by the companies and departments involved. Industry also hosted and bore the costs of a number of meetings of the Action Agenda. </para><para>(b)	See 2a above.</para><para>(c)	See 2a above.</para><para>(3)	The expenditure included departmental staffing and the normal administrative expenses associated with staff such as travel and meetings, as well as some research/consultancies. No program funds were allocated for the development of the Action Agenda. All departmental funds were expensed in accordance with the financial practices specified in ITR's Chief Executive Instructions. </para><para>(4)	The Strategic Industry Leadership Group (SILG) was established to develop the Restaurant and Catering Industry Action Agenda. The SILG comprised industry leaders with a vision and commitment to the future of the industry, representing both large and small companies across Australia. In addition, there was a departmental representative and representatives of training, education and research institutions.</para><para>The implementation of the Action Agenda is overseen by an industry-led implementation group comprised of key stakeholders (individual business, industry organisations and government). This group is required to report back to Government each year on implementation progress. </para><para>(5)	Action Agendas are means by which industry works with government to identify and 	then implement strategies to overcome impediments to growth. The Restaurant and Catering Industry Action Agenda seeks to address impediments relevant to its sector and to build an industry that:</para><para>	is sustainable and has mutually productive links with industry partners; </para><para>	is more skilled and professional;</para><para>	works within a more flexible workplace relations environment that better reflects the nature of the industry; </para><para>	is made more cohesive, adaptable and sustainable, through skilled and informed marketing and promotion; and </para><para>	is comfortable with technology and innovation as ways of increasing efficiency and competitiveness.</para><para>(6)	Yes. The Restaurant and Catering Industry Action Agenda, “The Business of Eating Out”, is a public document and copies can be accessed through the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources or via the Department's website (www.industry.gov.au/tourism)</para><para>(7)	Around 187 people either participated in the development of the Action Agenda through one of the 19 public forums that were conducted in metropolitan and regional locations around Australia, or provided a written submission. Collectively, there have been some 84 key stakeholders directly involved to date in development of the Action Agenda and in the implementation process. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs: ATSIC News</title><page.no>23181</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2728)</subtitle><id.no>2728</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>23181</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 24 March 2004:</para></talk.start><quote><para>For each of the financial years 2001-02 and 2002-03 and for 2003-04 to date:</para></quote><para>(1)	How many editions of the publication `<inline font-style="italic">ATSIC News</inline>' were published.</para><para>(2)	How many staff worked on its production.</para><para>(3)	What did the publication cost, including staff, production and distribution costs.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>23181</page.no><name role="metadata">Vanstone, Sen Amanda</name><name role="display">Senator Vanstone</name><name.id>7E4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Reconciliation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Services (ATSIS) has provided the following information in response to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	In the 2001-02 and 2002-03 financial years, three editions of <inline font-style="italic">ATSIC News</inline> were produced, two in 2001-02 and one in 2002-03.

Mr Gibbons gave the journalist a list of examples of such good-practice CDEPs.</para><para>Mr Gibbons has also informed me that Ms O'Brien's published article of 20 December interspersed comments which Mr Gibbons had made with her own points in ways which could have misled readers by not clearly distinguishing what Mr Gibbons said from other points and comments.</para><para>(3)	(a) (b) and (c)</para><para>As journalists do not reveal sources it was impossible to know and inappropriate to investigate who the initial complainant may have been that contacted the journalist to make allegations about the Goodooga CDEP. Similarly, it would have been inappropriate and unproductive to ask about the other sources of information that the journalist already had at the time she approached ATSIS.</para><para>When approached by Ms O'Brien, Mr Jeffries and ATSIS staff provided answers based on what was judged to be reasonable in the light of the public's right to know.

Within this area, the three nautical miles of ocean immediately adjacent to Australian coastline forms part of Australia's territorial sea. Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel have a broad range of powers to enforce Commonwealth law within the territorial sea. There is a range of legislation under which the ADF can act, including the Customs Act 1901, the Fisheries Management Act 1991 and the Migration Act 1958. </para><para>(c)	In the contiguous zone, a state can exercise the control necessary to prevent infringement of its customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws in its territory or territorial sea, and may punish infringements of those laws that have occurred within its territory or territorial sea. The Border Protection Legislation Amendment Act 1999 (No 60 of 1999) amended the Customs Act 1901 and the Migration Act 1958 to introduce new powers of boarding and inspection of ships in the contiguous zone. These powers are contained in Subdivision B of Division 1 of Part XIII of the Customs Act 1901 and Division 12A of Part 2 of the Migration Act 1958. These powers are routinely used in the course of Operation Relex II to intercept and apprehend suspected illegal entry vessels.</para><para>(d)	ADF personnel are routinely involved in enforcing a range of Commonwealth legislation within the exclusive economic zone. The Fisheries Management Act 1991 is one piece of legislation that ADF personnel normally enforce in their capacity as officers for the purposes of that Act. There are a number of other Acts which apply in the exclusive economic zone, such as the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 and the Offshore Minerals Act 1994, and a range of enactments dealing with marine environment protection such as the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, Protection of the Sea (Powers of Intervention) Act 1981 and the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981, some of which may empower ADF personnel to carry out enforcement functions.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Indigenous Affairs: Native Title Claimants</title><page.no>23187</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2761)</subtitle><id.no>2761</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>23187</page.no><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Sen Ross</name><name role="display">Senator Lightfoot</name><name.id>WP6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 26 March 2004:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	How many native title claimants are registered in the Goldfields region of Western Australia and its surrounding areas.</para><para>(2)	How many of these claimants are formally represented by the Goldfields Land and Sea Council in Kalgoorlie.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>23187</page.no><name role="metadata">Vanstone, Sen Amanda</name><name role="display">Senator Vanstone</name><name.id>7E4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Reconciliation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Services (ATSIS) with assistance from the National Native Title Tribunal (NNTT) has provided the following information:</para></quote><para>(1)	Information is not recorded as to the actual number of claimants within a particular area.
