AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</inline></para><quote><para>I am pleased to introduce the implementing legislation for the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement. This FTA has been several years in the making including eleven months of face to face negotiation. The outcome is an unprecedented opportunity for Australia and Australian exporters. </para><para>The Agreement will immediately extend and intensify Australia's trade relationship with the world's largest and most dynamic economy and largest merchandise and services exporter and importer. From the day it enters into force it will deliver real benefits and opportunities for Australian exporters. In the longer-term, dynamic gains from the Agreement promise to yield even larger benefits to the Australian economy and to Australian families.</para><para>Independent economic analysis suggests the FTA will result in a boost to the Australian economy of over $6 billion a year one decade after coming into force and create more than 30,000 additional Australian jobs.</para><para>While there are differences of view over the on-going dynamic effects of liberalisation and deregulation the critics in this academic debate ignore the practical evidence of the growth and dynamism of the Australian economy that has occurred with previous de-regulation and reform. And has seen an economic performance which has out- stripped the rest of the developed world for the past several years.</para><para>This legislation presents the Parliament with its opportunity to emphatically endorse this landmark agreement. Passage of this legislation through the Australian Parliament leading to the entry into force of the Agreement will see Australian industry benefiting from the immediate elimination of virtually all US tariffs on Australian industrial products. It will deliver the early removal of two thirds of all US agricultural tariffs (including lamb and horticultural products) and the elimination of a further 9 percent of agricultural tariffs within 4 years. Parliament's green light to the legislation will deliver significantly improved access conditions for beef and the immediate doubling of Australia's dairy exports to the US market. It will deliver the strong legal protections that will underpin services trade and Australian investment in the United States.</para><para>Of course Australia did not secure all its objectives in the Agreement. And neither did the United States. Reaching agreement with the United States Government required moderating some of our industry interests in the US market. The outcome on sugar was a particular disappointment. Similarly, United States negotiators wound back some of their ambitions in the interests of concluding the deal. This Government did not, however, compromise elements of public policy vital to the well-being of Australia and Australians. The Government preserved the critical elements of our quarantine regime, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the right to ensure local content in Australian broadcasting and audiovisual services.</para><para>Let there be no misunderstanding on this point. The Agreement I signed in Washington on 18 May—and the legislation I am introducing today—does not, and will not have any detrimental effect on the PBS. It will not cause drug prices to rise. It will not delay the availability of generic medicines. It does not touch legislation implementing the PBS. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee will remain the gatekeeper to the system, the Minister for Health and Ageing will remain the only authority capable of listing a drug on the PBS, and cost effectiveness will remain the basis against which applications to list a drug will be judged.</para><para>The Government's agreement to increased transparency and a review process is consistent with current PBS legislation. No change is required to that legislation to effect our commitment to the United States under this Agreement.</para><para>If a drug is not cost effective, no amount of transparency or review will make it cost effective and it should not, and will not, be listed. If a drug is cost effective, it will and should be listed—and increased transparency in PBS processes can only assist this. In fact, as we have seen in recent years increased transparency in the PBS benefits Australian consumers of pharmaceuticals.</para><para>The US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004 consists of 9 schedules amending relevant Australian legislation to fulfil our obligations under the FTA. Passage of this legislation is the primary process in our domestic implementation—prompt passage will allow us to meet the target date of 1 January 2005 we have agreed with the United States for entry into force.</para><para>In detailing the changes to Australian legislation incorporated in this Bill, I want to make clear that a number of these changes are consistent with legislation that was already in the pipeline or otherwise reflecting changes already under consideration. In other areas, legislative changes proposed in this Bill reflect Australia's own experience of policy and practice and particular Australian circumstances.  </para><para>Schedule One amends the Customs Act 1901 to incorporate the rules for determining whether goods originate in the United States, and are therefore eligible for preferential duty rates, and to introduce powers to allow Customs to conduct verifications of Australian exporters to ensure that the goods they export to the United States were produced in Australia. </para><para>These new rules have been endorsed by Australian business as a cheaper and easier way to prove origin. </para><para>For a long time, stakeholders in the agricultural sector have been arguing that innovation in new chemistry and alternative technologies has been stifled by existing data protection provisions. In May 2003, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator the Hon Judith Troeth, achieved agreement with key stakeholders, including all State and Territory Governments, on a suite of reforms. These reforms build into the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994 mechanisms encouraging early entry of newer innovation in chemical technologies and develop a system providing additional reward to those innovators who move to support the more vulnerable users within Australia's agricultural sector. The proposed reforms have been strongly supported and keenly anticipated by nearly all stakeholders, including manufacturers and users and all State and Territory Governments.</para><para>The obligations arising from the FTA are entirely consistent with the suite of reforms that had already been developed. Schedule Two of the Bill amends the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994 to implement the first part of Senator Troeth's reforms. It has not been appropriate, nor is it desirable, to inject additional measures into the AUSFTA Bill that might confuse the debate on the core rationale for its introduction. However, in recognition of the importance of these reforms to a very broad range of stakeholders, the Government remains committed to implementing the full suite of reforms in a second Bill as soon as is practicable after this Bill has been introduced.</para><para>Schedule Three amends the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980 to provide specific procedures for the owner of a trademark to object to the determination of an Australian geographical indication (GI) on the basis of pre-existing trademark rights and procedures for the cancellation of an Australian GI. This amendment simply codifies the existing practice of the GI Committee of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation and has been developed in close consultation with the Winemakers' Federation of Australia. </para><para>Schedule Four amends the Life Insurance Act 1995 to allow foreign life insurance companies to establish branches in Australia for the purpose of carrying out life insurance business in Australia. Currently only entities incorporated in Australia are able to conduct life insurance business in Australia.

Either, they must certify that the applicant does not propose to market those therapeutic goods in a way or in circumstances that would involve an infringement of a patent, or they may certify that the applicant proposes to market the therapeutic good before the expiry of the patent for such goods and that the applicant has notified the patentee about its application to include goods in the Register. </para><para>These amendments carefully balance the interests of the generic and innovator pharmaceuticals industries in Australia, while ensuring that the primary responsibility for resolving patent disputes remains with the patent holder and the party challenging the validity of a patent.

The amendments extend the grounds on which the grant of a patent can be opposed to include an invention not being useful or having been secretly used. The amendments also remove a ground of revocation (non-compliance with a condition of a patent) which is no longer applicable to granted patents. These amendments protect the existing grounds for revocation under Australian law.</para><para>Schedule Nine introduces a range of amendments to the Copyright Act 1968 to give effect to Australia's obligations under AUSFTA.

Delay or dismissal of this legislation will not simply defer the benefits of the Agreement. There appears to be a nave view among some opposite that delaying passage of this legislation, or consideration of the Agreement as a whole, would afford an opportunity to review at leisure the provisions of this Agreement, and even to renegotiate aspects of it. This is a dangerous delusion that ignores the reality of the negotiating process for a treaty with any sovereign government, let alone with the United States. The United States Congress is poised to vote on this Agreement. Once that vote is taken—and we are increasingly confident that it will be a positive vote—the idea that we could re-open the text of the Agreement, particularly at this stage of the US election cycle, to secure a different outcome, is completely out of touch with reality.

They are announcing to the media and to the Australian public Labor's response to these bills and to the overall free trade agreement. I have had the privilege of examining the agreement as a member of the Senate select committee, which is yet to table its report to the Senate. That matter will be canvassed at another time.</para></talk.start><para>Noting that the Senate has taken a decision to alter the membership of that committee at this very late stage in the process I indicate that it was rendered necessary on the basis that, if the committee needs to meet again, it needs to be fully constituted. It would have been the opposition's wish not to have disturbed the membership of the committee—because it was not our wish to replace Senator Peter Cook as a member of the committee—but, as I think everyone in this chamber is well aware, Senator Cook underwent surgery this morning and he will be unable to take part in the activities of the committee and this chamber, certainly for the duration of the debate on this legislation and the consideration of the committee's report, should that be required, later this week or, I expect, next week.</para><para>On behalf of Senator Conroy and I, I indicate that Senator Cook operated as chair of this committee in very difficult circumstances—he was placed under a great deal of pressure by coalition senators—and in a remarkably even-handed fashion. He was at pains to assure members of the committee that everyone would have a chance to ask their questions. That, of course, put the committee under time pressures in trying to deal with witnesses and meeting the timetable set by the committee. Senator Cook attempted to make sure that the proceedings of the committee were conducted in the fairest possible manner and in a manner conducive to getting onto the record the views of all of the witnesses, whether members of the committee found them agreeable or disagreeable. </para><para>I think that set Senator Cook apart from certain other members of the committee who thought it appropriate to effectively heckle witnesses whilst they were giving evidence, even though in some cases those witnesses had been invited by the committee to submit a point of view and to come and give evidence. I found in those difficult circumstances that Senator Cook handled himself remarkably well. I must say that I considered some of the activities in those proceedings to have been quite provocative of Senator Cook and that, in the true professional manner in which we have come to expect Senator Cook to operate when holding a position of such responsibility, he acquitted himself very well.</para><para>What do we now face with this legislation? Yesterday I took part in a press conference which has been described as an unusual one. Senator Peter Cook was the disembodied voice heard through a device sitting on the table at the press conference. I am sure that he would not have wished to have participated in such a fashion. But the medical realities being what they were and Senator Peter Cook's commitment to his task being what it was, it was appropriate that he participate and it was the only way in which he could participate and respect and cooperate with the advice he had been given. He could not travel to Canberra to participate and then return to Perth in time to be operated on this morning.</para><para>That press conference announced the position not of the Labor Party but of three Labor senators as to how they thought the parliament ought to respond to this legislation. I think it is important to recount part of what was described by me yesterday as the collective view of the committee—that is, the entering into the free trade agreement was an action which the US Trade Representative, Mr Robert Zoellick, told congress in March 2001 should be approached on a bipartisan basis within Australia. He said:</para><quote><para>... if we approach this—</para></quote><para>that is, the free trade agreement with Australia—</para><quote><para>I want to make sure that it's done in a fashion that has bipartisan support in Australia.</para></quote><para>This government did not listen to that advice. Instead, this government acted unilaterally and pursued a free trade deal which was more to do with politics than with free trade and in what we describe as an unrealistic negotiating time frame imposed on us by the US electoral cycle—and I suspect our own. This was a deal which the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anderson, described as potentially being unAustralian if it did not include sugar. Yet, at the end of the day, no sugar producer will gain a benefit from this agreement because sugar has been excluded—and it was excluded in breach of that commitment by the Deputy Prime Minister. The government repeatedly said that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme was `off the table'. But, frankly, it was on the table from day one. In the end, we were presented with a deal which included matters relevant to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme but which did not include sugar. </para><para>In asking for this legislation to be passed through the parliament and thereby onto the people of Australia, it requires us all to take this government on trust. There are some outstanding issues surrounding the agreement that are simply not addressed by this implementing legislation. Senator Cook, Senator Conroy and I have set out a number of recommendations to our colleagues in the caucus and to the parliament that seek to address these many and varied shortcomings and unknowns. We recommend that the parliament support the legislation in the context of the position which I will clarify further.</para><para>We announce quite a number of concerns that we have about the agreement. That is why we believe that it is necessary for the parliament to take steps beyond those contained in the legislation. I think I am at liberty to say that we will be supporting the legislation, but in two key areas—the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the protection of Australian media content, because these are so important to the Labor Party—we will move in this chamber relevant key legislative amendments. </para><para>Specifically, the amendments are to protect the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme by preventing drug companies stopping cheap generic drugs from coming onto the market through the use of what I describe as a `dodgy patent process'; to allay concern about any future reductions in local content for free-to-air television, pay television and radio; and to legislate the current local content standards in this process—in other words, not relying on the current process of imposition of local content standards but requiring the parliament to set those standards so that the only way that they can be reduced is by a vote of both houses of the national parliament.</para><para>Labor are committed to those amendments to the point that we will insist on them. We will not resile from those amendments in pursuit of the legislation. Those amendments should be carried—and, after all, we can see no reason why the government should not support them. Labor will say to the government that, if they seek to push the legislation through without them, we will be insisting on those amendments.</para><para>Concerning other aspects and consequences of the legislation, we think there are many things that ought be done and a Labor government will commit to doing those things. I am sure that that is what Senator Conroy is in the process of announcing to the media at the moment. Labor will enhance transparency in relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme by requiring that all documentation submitted to the independent review mechanism established to examine unsuccessful drug listing applications on the PBS be published on the Internet within 48 hours, subject to commercial-in-confidence constraints—I am talking about real constraints, not imaginary ones.</para><para>A Labor government will require the Productivity Commission to monitor and report annually on the impact of the free trade agreement on the PBS, including the impact of the independent review mechanism. If the differential between the US and Australian drug prices is narrowing, a Labor government will change the independent review mechanism. Each acceptance by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Council and the Minister for Health and Ageing of the recommendations of the independent review shall be reported to the parliament in a ministerial statement. The terms of reference of the medicines working group will include a commitment to the principle of universal access to affordable medicines. The medicines working group will not be charged with considering any policy issue that could be seen to undermine the principle of universal access to affordable medicines. Under Labor, the medicines working group will operate with appropriate transparency with regard to agenda items, minutes and recommendations. </para><para>Prior to entering any tender round involving blood or blood products, a Labor government would amend the Therapeutic Goods Act to ensure that any blood plasma fractionation products approved for use in Australia must be manufactured in accordance with Australia's policy of self-sufficiency using Australian blood and in accordance with currently established good manufacturing practice which requires dedicated processing facilities. Labor will ensure transparency in the plasma fractionation agreement currently being negotiated with CSL, the review of this agreement required by the FTA by 2007 and any subsequent tender process for blood plasma products.</para><para>Labor will ensure that the free trade agreement does not dilute the capacity of the government to regulate for local content on future media. Labor will legislate to ensure that the FTA definition includes but is not limited to future media already identified. Labor will establish an inquiry to examine further options for effective government regulation of local content on future media mechanisms. Labor will also announce a policy package to encourage investment in Australia's film and television industry before the next election. </para><para>Concerning copyright and intellectual property, Labor will require the Attorney-General to report annually to parliament on the impact of changes to the Copyright Act 1968 on universities, libraries, educational and public research institutions, particularly with regard to any increased costs that they might bear. To ensure there remains a fair balance between copyright owners and users, Labor will examine options for broadening the fair dealing and copyright usage provisions of the Copyright Act.</para><para>To ensure there remains a fair balance between innovation and consumers and owners of copyright in relation to technological protection measures, Labor will ensure it is permissible to sell, purchase and use legally manufactured video, DVD and related software items, including components equipment and hardware, regardless of place of purchase. Labor will set up a commission of inquiry to look at the impact of the FTA on Australian manufacturing, particularly automotive components and the textiles, clothing and footwear industry. We will be announcing terms of reference for such an inquiry.</para><para>In relation to agriculture, Labor will utilise the annual ministerial meeting arrangements which are established under the free trade agreement to seek for Australia a most favoured nation provision from the US—meaning that, if the US gives a better deal to someone else, we should have access to the same terms. Labor will closely monitor the government's sugar compensation package to ensure that it achieves significant reform in the cane farming and milling sectors because, if nothing else comes from the free trade agreement, something must come for the sugar districts—other than a one-off package to buy votes, which is what the government is involved in at the moment.</para><para>Concerning quarantine, Labor will require that both qualitative and quantitative science based risk assessment processes are used in developing import risk assessments and, importantly, in enshrining the <inline font-style="italic">Import risk analysis </inline><inline font-style="italic">process </inline><inline font-style="italic">handbook </inline>in regulations, requiring the consent of both houses before that process could be varied—in other words, that no process of the FTA could be imported into our current import risk assessment process without the support of both houses of parliament.  </para><para>Future trade agreements under Labor will operate under a quite different environment. Prior to entering into free trade agreement negotiations, a Labor government—and indeed future governments, if Labor were to implement these procedures—will table in both houses of parliament a document setting out its priorities and objectives. This will include an assessment of the costs and benefits of any proposals that may be negotiated. The assessment will also consider the economic, regional, social, cultural, regulatory and environmental impacts which are expected to arise. Once the negotiation is completed, a Labor government will table in the parliament the proposed treaty, together with any implementing legislation.</para><para>That is a comprehensive response from Labor to this agreement. We say that the legislation ought to pass, but we say it is critically important that those amendments which I have indicated that we will insist upon be part of the passage. The government, through its bureaucracy, has repeatedly assured the committee and the public that there will be no impact on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme from this agreement. The minister has tried to defend his pretty shabby negotiating process—and I absolve the negotiating team of responsibility in this regard, because this was, in our view, a politically managed process—but the fact is that more could have been done in relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Nevertheless, the government says that the scheme is not affected or jeopardised by the arrangements it has put in place. If the government is happy with the agreement as it stands, what stands in the way of the government supporting Labor's amendment to make sure that nothing it has done can ever come back and bite this nation on the backside? Frankly, there is a lot of concern about the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Mr Mark Latham said some time ago that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme was a deal breaker as far as the Labor Party were concerned, if it was found that there was a negative effect on the PBS.</para><para>We are moving amendments—and, in this regard, an amendment—to ensure that that there is not a hidden substantial cost of hundreds of millions of dollars to the taxpayer arising from this agreement. That amendment will be entirely consistent with the agreement and, if the government is sincere in its desire to maintain the PBS, it will support Labor's amendments. Equally, in relation to local content, if the government says there is no reason to reduce the current standards, we ask: what is wrong with legislating them and what is wrong with putting the power in the hands of the parliament to determine if they are ever to be reduced? Under this agreement, the ratchet clause means that, once reduced, they can never be returned to their current level. What Labor are saying is: protect the current levels. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>25330</page.no><name role="metadata">Ridgeway, Sen Aden</name><name role="display">Senator RIDGEWAY</name><name.id>8G6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R2118">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2111">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004 </inline>on behalf of the Australian Democrats. I have to say right from the very start that this is indeed a very sad day for Australia. It is a great shame that we are debating these bills at all, because the FTA is a disaster for Australia. It is very, very disappointing that we have arrived at this point today. The Democrats feel very strongly about this issue and firmly believe that the free trade agreement should never have been signed and certainly should not be supported, particularly when you consider the details of the agreement itself. All along we have been questioning the government's rhetoric about the deal, knowing that they have been so desperate to cash in on their support for the war in Iraq that they would accept anything America offered, even if it caused harm to Australia. It has been more about political expediency than what is in the best interests of Australia as a nation. </para></talk.start><para>What is particularly galling, though, is the decision that has now been made by the Labor Party in opposition to support the deal, because all along I think that the ALP have taken a very reasoned approach to the issue—wanting to analyse the terms of the deal, scrutinise the detail and then make their decision based on the merits of the argument about whether or not this is in the best interests of the country. They have done all of that. They have read the same text that we have. They have sat on the same inquiries. They have heard the same evidence from the various witnesses that have come before us at more than a dozen hearings held across the country. They know that this is a substandard deal. How they could support this is beyond me. Even from their own statements—when they talk about the agreement `on balance'—if the deal is so good, why would they qualify it not just once, not twice, but 43 times? Did it ever occur to the ALP that the 43 arguments that have been presented are 43 reasons why the free trade agreement is flawed and it ought not to be supported in the first instance?</para><para>I want to put on the record that the Australian Democrats support fair trade that is in the national interest. In our opinion, the free trade agreement that the government have negotiated with the United States could never, ever be described as achieving this. Keen to try to cash in on their support for the Bush administration's policies in other areas, the Howard government have accepted a substandard deal that will do more harm than good to Australia's future. I want to make a statement that I have already made on many occasions about this issue. That statement is about the question of what the national interest is, because I think in many respects it is much more than just looking at the basic economic bottom line. It includes looking at social outcomes, labour standards, the preservation and improvement of our environment and our national cultural identity. All of these factors have to be taken into consideration in any trade decisions, so it is critical that the terms of the agreement do not affect our ability to regulate freely in the national interest in the future. What we have done is effectively sign away our domestic capacity and our sovereignty to regulate on these issues. It is no surprise that the Labor Party qualify it 43 times, because they know that they have to try to regulate before the agreement comes into existence on 1 January next year. How far it goes depends on their capacity to keep in line with the terms and conditions of the agreement itself.</para><para>We supported the establishment of the select committee that looked at the free trade agreement. Given that the government has the power to enter into this agreement without the involvement of the parliament in any way whatsoever, it was extremely important that the Senate, as the house of review, was given the opportunity to carefully scrutinise and analyse the terms of the deal to determine whether or not it really was in Australia's interest. I think the inquiry has been extensive in conducting its analysis of that particular question. From the various views that were put forward on this agreement, I do not think anyone could say that, on balance, the evidence would justify the need to support what we are debating here today. I want to pause for a moment and thank the committee secretariat staff, who are to be commended for their incredible work and diligence throughout this process.</para><para>The government has based most of its sales pitch relating to the FTA on the assumption that it will bring significant economic benefit to Australia. While the Democrats believe that wide-ranging trade agreements of this nature should be assessed according to a broader set of criteria than just mere economics, it is also useful to look at the vastly divergent views about whether the government's loudly proclaimed benefit is ever likely to eventuate. We recognise that economic modelling in and of itself is an inexact science and that a range of different assumptions can be used to produce remarkably different results. We also believe that the government has deliberately misled the Australian people with respect to the benefit of the deal, and it has done so according to results from its own economic modelling study. Why is it that the government did not engage the Productivity Commission in undertaking a national interest assessment? That is a legitimate question that all Australians should ask and deserve to have an answer to. </para><para>The government, of course, commissioned the Centre for International Economics to model the impact of the FTA—the same organisation that predicted the FTA would be worth $4 billion if it got rid of all trade restrictions between the two nations. This time, the CIE told the government exactly what it wanted to hear and in fact decided that even though the deal left many trade barriers in place the projected benefits of the deal had ballooned out to $6 billion a year. What an extraordinary statement: a $4 billion benefit to the country with no trade barriers but a $6 billion benefit with trade barriers remaining in place. I do not know how they arrived at that sort of conclusion, but it is the sort of argument the government has been running out there to say that this is a great windfall for the country.</para><para>The CIE report has been criticised for using grossly overstated estimates and unrealistic assumptions. Dr Philippa Dee of the ANU was commissioned by the Senate select committee to conduct alternative economic modelling of her own. She came up with the far more realistic figure of $53 million a year. As Dr Dee herself describes:</para><quote><para>This is a tiny harvest from a major political and bureaucratic endeavour.</para></quote><para>Dr Dee's report also demonstrated how this agreement sets a precedent in a couple of significant ways. I think that this debate is worthy of noting what these issues are. First, Australia has accepted this agreement, even though it did not contain any access to the US sugar market, but rejected the EU-US proposal on agriculture in Cancun in Mexico last year, which, while not ideal, could have provided greater benefits for Australian farmers, because at least proposals back in Cancun in Mexico last year started to address the fundamental problem of a free trade agreement with the United States—that is, the question of US domestic agricultural subsidies.</para><para>This FTA sets precedents with respect to tailoring rules of origin based on tariff classification. In the past, all rules of origin were based on a relatively simple rule for regional value content of goods. The tailor-made rules that we have come up with have been criticised as being the result of protectionist lobbying by producer interests, and Australia can now rightly be said to be condoning such an approach right across the world. The fact that we have accepted such wide-ranging safeguard measures, especially for beef and textiles, is a step backward from the WTO practice. Of course, our extensive intellectual property commitments will also set a precedent for Australia's approach to IP regulation in the future.</para><para>One of the key examples made by Dr Dee about the overinflated assumptions used by CIE in their analysis related to the government procurement provisions of the agreement. The benefit to be gained from these types of opportunities depends on whether Australian businesses are able to take advantage of them. The CIE study considers that Australia might be able to achieve 30 per cent as much market penetration as Canada. However, Dr Dee also argues that this is doubtful given that Canada is a much bigger country and it is much closer to the United States than Australia, particularly given that 90 per cent of the Canadian population live within 160 kilometres of the US border, which stretches for over 6,400 kilometres. It highlights the point that the costs or the windfalls that the government so loudly proclaims diminish the further away you are from the marketplace, and Australia is down here in the Southern Hemisphere. </para><para>Geography and economy size play a significant role in trade. Trade volumes tend to increase with the size of the importing and exporting countries, and they decrease with the distance between them. Another point that needs to be made here in comparison is that the Canadian economy is almost 70 per cent larger than the Australian economy, and the Australian economy is almost 30 times further away from the United States. Therefore, I think it is more realistic to assume that Australia's trade with the US in government procurement could be expected to be four per cent as large as that of Canada and no more. Dr Dee's revised projections of the benefit, the $53 million likely to be achieved through this deal, reflect adjustments taking into account the rules of origin, trade diversion and the additional costs that were never factored into the CIE report, such as royalty payments resulting from the extension of the copyright term, the cost of administering the agreement and the long-term cost of the sugar package, which was excluded in this particular instance. In the Democrats' view the Dr Dee report demonstrates that the government's rhetoric about the overwhelming economic benefit of the deal cannot be taken that seriously.</para><para>In many respects the economic benefit is not the only thing that the government have lied to the Australian people about. They have repeatedly assured the Australian people that the important social policies that they themselves put on the table to be sold away have been protected. This is simply not the case when you look at the details of the agreement. The fact is that America now has a role in determining Australian policy. Even if we accept the government's assertions that they will resist any undue pressure for policy to be changed, the fact that another nation has a voice, a right to be heard, on issues that should be determined by Australians alone is simply unacceptable. Let us look at some of the ways in which our sovereignty has been compromised. My colleagues, in joining in this debate later, will also elaborate on these issues, but I want to touch on some of them very briefly.</para><para>I think the most significant goes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, because this is one that the Labor Party have hung their hat on all the way through. Perhaps the most controversial aspect of this deal has been the fact that it will affect the way in which the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme operates in this country. It is, I think, world's best practice and the United States would not want this system to be replicated in other countries across the world. Why? Because it effectively excludes many of the multinational pharmaceutical companies that operate out of the United States. This agreement sets a precedent in yet another way: it is the first trade agreement anywhere in the world that interferes with a nation's health system. It is a matter of national shame that we have gone down this path by allowing a trade agreement of this sort to set a precedent and allowing one country to interfere in the social policies of another nation.</para><para>The Democrats believe that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme should never have been included in the agreement at all. Good faith notwithstanding, it is unacceptable that US pharmaceutical companies should have a voice in Australia's health policy making processes. Given the fact that no real detail has been provided about how the new working group and the review mechanism will operate, it is unacceptable that the parliament should be asked to endorse the deal without receiving those answers. How can we take their assurances seriously? First, there was the lie about whether or not it would be included in the first place. Then they secretly sold it away, then they tried to fob us off with empty promises and then they provided no details as to how it would work in practice. And the Labor Party, which knows all of this, has decided on balance to support it, although qualifying it 43 times. </para><para>The issue of quarantine under this agreement also gives rise to significant concern. The signing of the free trade agreement is bad news for Australian farmers, who want to see Australia's rigorous, science based quarantine system protected. The agreement will, in effect, increase the pressure on Biosecurity Australia to water down Australia's tough stance against possible plant and animal diseases by allowing US trade officials to have a say in the import risk assessment processes.</para><para>The committee report outlined the concerns that have been raised about the new consultative committee on SPS issues that has been agreed through the FTA, especially pertaining to the apparently different interpretations of what the role of the committee will be according to the United States Trade Representative and DFAT-published material and statements. They do not say the same things. In some instances, they contradict each other. While the government maintains that there is no evidence to suggest that this deal will make Australia's quarantine system vulnerable to US pressure, concerns have been raised about the mere existence of a forum that will be used by the US to try and advance its trading interests at the expense of Australian environmental protection. We believe that the whole approach of making quarantine decisions on any criteria other than the best available science is unacceptable and grants a voice to US trade interests, again, against the interests of developing Australian environmental policy.</para><para>Later in the debate, I want to talk about the issue of intellectual property, but it is important to note that this trade agreement, unlike others, goes a lot further than just dealing with the question of trade between nations; it goes to the question of providing an entire chapter on intellectual property. This is significant in this agreement because it either pre-empts or directly contradicts the current Australian debate about appropriate reform to our copyright law. Some of the changes to the law in this bill go even further than the free trade agreement itself and further than current US copyright law. This government is changing Australian law through a trade agreement, which is completely unacceptable in terms of what those outcomes are going to be.</para><para>I have mentioned time and time again the question of the extension of copyright by an additional 20 years, because Australia, being a large importer of copyright material, will have to pay the cost of those additional 20 years of being able to access information that otherwise would have been freely available in the public domain after 50 years. The community consequences of the trade arrangement may essentially mean that our schools, libraries and all of those institutions involved in education and accessing information will have to pay copyright over an additional 20 years. That was never taken into account in the government's own analysis by the Centre for International Economics. Over the long term, it compounds the problem as far as social and education policy goes in terms of our young people and certainly our institutions of higher learning being able to access the information, which was always thought to be free in the public domain once it got there. Overall, when you couple all of this with the long-term damage that is being done to Australia's sovereignty and the ability of future Australian governments to set quotas for content levels in media or invest in the domestic film industry, the damage that has been done as a result of this deal will never end. We cannot go back once we put it in train. </para><para>I want to finish by saying that, whilst we regard the deal as riddled with contradictions and devils in the detail, in the committee stage of this debate I do not believe anyone should take the government's rhetoric seriously. I think the ALP needed to show some nerve here at this crucial time and, quite frankly, they have let the country down. We will do all that we can to ensure that the impact of the FTA is limited as much as possible and that future generations do not pay the price of the major parties' desperation and political expediency in an election year. It should have been a decision based on what is in Australia's national interest, not putting the interests of American companies before the Australian people and certainly before this country. That is the only thing that should have been answered in this agreement, and that is what should have been stood up for.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>25335</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Arts and Sport</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I too wish to speak in the debate on the <inline ref="R2118">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2111">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004</inline>. I make the point, as I am required to do, that I am speaking as an individual senator and not as a minister. I understand that my speaking as a minister could lead to views that this contribution would close the debate on these bills.</para></talk.start><para>Having clarified my position, let me say that I listened carefully to the first two speakers in the debate, Senator O'Brien and Senator Ridgeway. Senator Ridgeway, I have to say that I am sorry that you have decided to adopt such an extremist position and to put such extremist views which are so poorly based. This is a government that rigorously pursues the national interest of this country. This government does not sign any treaty that in any way compromises the national interest of this country. I was interested to hear the Centre Left complain about this issue. I have now been in this chamber for over 14 years and I have seen Labor governments sign treaty after treaty which impinged on the sovereignty of this nation, and there was nary a word, Senator Ridgeway, from the party you belong to. Happily, this government put in the process by which treaties can be more rigorously assessed.</para><para>Senator O'Brien, gosh, what a mess the Labor Party have got themselves into. What an absolutely hopeless mess. The Labor Party laboured mightily for five months and could not make up their minds. They had the left, the right, the centre right and the centre nothings—all of them—having a view on this free trade agreement. After all this effort, after all this division, what have they produced? I will tell you what they have produced: severe question marks over the leadership of Mark Latham. That is what they have produced. Mr Latham, the leader of the Labor Party, was meant to give the Labor Party a new look. What we have seen over the last five months is vacillation and an incapacity to make a decision on an issue which is of fundamental importance to Australia, and I think that is the conclusion the Australian community are reaching. Yes, when you are in government you occasionally have to make tough decisions. John Howard, our Prime Minister, has a wonderful record of being able to take tough decisions and stick with them. Mr Latham, the new boy on the block, has made an absolute botch of this process. </para><para>I do not want to be entirely critical of the Labor Party because I think we should give some credit to Senator Conroy in this area. Senator Conroy was one of the famous `roosters', so named by Mr Latham because of his support for Mr Beazley. This rooster is entitled to crow. He has made sure that, in the end, Mr Mark Latham—as we all predicted he would from day one—supported the free trade agreement. Senator Conroy made the case for that. I certainly do not agree with everything Senator Conroy says, but I will say this: Senator Conroy is a strong supporter of the free trade agreement. He was faced by the Left of his party—by Senator O'Brien and others—and in the end Senator Conroy, the famous rooster, carried the day. I think we have to acknowledge that.</para><para>Where has this debate led? It has led to the Labor Party going around playing to different constituencies. The shadow business ministers have been saying to business groups: `Don't worry about what the Left are saying. The Labor Party will support the free trade agreement.' That is what they said privately. That led to the other shadow ministers going around to other groups—and Senator Lundy is one who immediately springs to mind—and saying, `Don't worry, the Labor Party will never sign the free trade agreement.' Senator O'Brien can correct me if I am wrong but I remember that Senator Lundy said that the Labor Party would not sign the free trade agreement if there was not a cultural carve-out. That was Senator Lundy on the record. Senator Lundy went around month after month pretending to her constituencies in the cultural area that the Labor Party would not sign this free trade agreement. I had a debate a couple of weeks ago with Senator Lundy, and she got up and ran the old Labor Party lines that it was going to do immense damage. It was absolute nonsense, but she ran those arguments. I got up and said, `Senator Lundy, I've heard you, but the truth of the matter is that the Labor Party will be supporting this agreement.'</para><para>The Labor Party has been caught out. The Labor Party has shown a dreadful lack of capacity to govern itself. The Labor Party has shown a lack of capacity to reach tough decisions. I do not think they are tough decisions. For heaven's sake, an agreement which will provide such an important boost to the Australian economy—that is, $6 billion a year when it fully comes into play—is hardly not in the interests of the Australian economy.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name></talker><para>—You will support our amendments, will you?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name></talker><para>—Don't you try to interject, Senator O'Brien. You are now supporting the free trade agreement. You were running lines for five months that you were not going to support it. Now I am agreeing with you and you are agreeing me that you should support the free trade agreement, and basically the Labor Party has made a complete goose of itself. The public out there will say, `Fortunately, it has been dragged kicking and screaming to finally supporting the free trade agreement, which is a good thing.' The public will like that. But then the public will ask: `Why did we go through this for five months? Why was Mr Latham unable to reach a clear decision on this issue? Why were Labor shadow ministers going around pretending to groups that they would never sign the free trade agreement? Why? Why? Why?' The reason is that the Labor Party is incapable of really pursuing the national interest, is hopelessly divided and finally had to listen to Senator Conroy—and I have given all credit to him for finally bringing a touch of commonsense to the Labor Party. How Senator Conroy will be dealt with in Victoria, I do not know. History will show that Senator Kim Carr and the Left run Victoria. There is no doubt in my mind that Senator Conroy will be targeted for what he has done, and we can all make a judgment on that. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The fact of the matter is that the free trade agreement is profoundly in Australia's national interest. That is why the Liberal-National Party coalition has strongly supported it, that is why farming interests support it, that is why manufacturing interests support and—Senator O'Brien, guess what?—that is why all the Labor premiers support it too. All the Labor premiers support this agreement. I refer you to the recent remarks of Premier Beattie in an article urging the Labor Party to get on with it, as he would. Why wouldn't he be frustrated after five long months of the Labor Party finding it difficult to make up its mind? I think the public will draw its conclusions. The public will decide that this party, poorly led as it is, was unable to deal with an issue of national importance in a sensible fashion.</para><para>Let me now make some remarks on the cultural sector. This is an area that has been the subject of some debate, which has been referred to by a number of speakers. Let me make this clear: the government has retained the necessary flexibility to support the cultural sector and to regulate audiovisual media to meet our cultural policy objectives now and into the future. It is unfortunate that recent reporting in the media has been fuelled by misinformation, coming largely from the Labor Party. It has been caught out. Having fuelled the misinformation, the Labor Party now has to explain why it has suddenly done one of the world's great backflips and is now supporting the free trade agreement.</para><para>In the time available I would like to dispel some of the misconceptions that may still exist. First, I would like to emphasise that, as part of the negotiating process, the government undertook full consultation with representatives of the cultural sector, including members of the film and television industry. I believe we kept the sector informed of outcomes as the negotiations progressed. This was part of our commitment to keep the process open.</para><para>In terms of the impact of the agreement on the cultural sector, the government has fully retained the capacity to support its national institutions and agencies. This means, regardless of what Senator Lundy may have been saying in the past, that the ABC, SBS and cultural institutions such as the National Library and the National Museum of Australia can continue to operate as they always have. Further, any government support for the cultural sector, such as grants and subsidies, is untouched by the agreement. This applies to federal, state and local level support. It also includes, let me stress, government support through the taxation system. There is nothing in the agreement that prevents the government from introducing new tax incentives or grants programs in the future.</para><para>Let me now turn more specifically to film, broadcasting and audiovisual media. There has been no effect on the government's ability to maintain the Australian Film Commission, to provide support to the local film industry; or the Film Finance Corporation, to invest in films made for and by Australians—quite contrary to the impression that is being created. Tax incentives that encourage local film production have been preserved. The agreement is quite clear that funding from bodies like the Film Finance Corporation can continue to be restricted to Australians and does not have to be extended to US interests.</para><para>There are a number of other issues that I would like to raise here today in the brief time available. I will now turn to the area of subscription TV. I make the point again that we negotiated an outcome that retains Australia's ability to adjust our local content requirements on subscription TV to respond to future market developments. In particular, we retain the scope to double the existing 10 per cent expenditure requirement for drama channels on subscription television. The free trade agreement provides us with sufficient scope to further increase that 10 per cent expenditure requirement if we decide that is required. </para><para>We have also allowed for the option to impose further expenditure requirements of up to 10 per cent on four additional program formats on subscription TV: arts, children's programming, documentaries and educational programming. This was another area where we considered it important to build in additional flexibility to respond to possible developments in the subscription TV area. The agreement explicitly allows for maintaining local content requirements in key program formats.</para><para>I would like now to address the issue of new media. Clearly, with the continuing advances in technology, the government needs to ensure that it will maintain the capacity to take action as new services are developed. This has been achieved by the agreement. The relevant term used in the agreement is `interactive audio and/or video services'. I have read in the newspapers of concerns that some believe this term is too broad. However, that is exactly the approach we decided to take. No-one can predict developments in this area. The term is a general concept and avoids constraining the capacity of governments in the future. In this way, the agreement will be able to apply to new types of interactive platforms that are yet to emerge.</para><para>There is another point that has caused misunderstanding, fuelled by misinformation coming from the Labor Party. There continue to be erroneous claims that the US government will have a veto on future government regulation. This is incorrect. While decisions about new measures must be made through a transparent process, I say again that there is no veto power for the US.</para><para>I believe I have made the case that the government has kept its commitment to the cultural sector—indeed, to the Australian people. Australians will continue to see and hear their voices and view their stories on television and on cinema screens. The Australian audiovisual market is already a very open one. I believe Australians will benefit profoundly from the free trade agreement. That is why this government is supporting it. I believe it is strongly in the national interest of this country.</para><para>I would also like to put on the record that Senator Cook, who chaired the inquiry into the free trade agreement, is not with us and is not well. Senator Cook and I, as many in this chamber will know, have had many robust debates—some very robust, I might say. But we all wish Senator Cook well and we all hope that he has a speedy recovery. For the time being we will certainly miss his presence in the chamber.</para><para>I see that Senator Conroy has come into the chamber. I know Senator Conroy was having a press conference. He may have missed the tribute that I paid to him as one of the three roosters. I did say, Senator Conroy, that you are entitled to crow. This is a rooster that is entitled to crow because of the work that he has done. I make the point that I do not agree with many of the things that Senator Conroy said, but the fundamental bottom line that I do agree with is that Senator Conroy supports the free trade agreement. He supported it from day one. He did not need five months to make up his mind on this deal, despite some viewing for the public as he considered some issues. Senator Conroy has been a strong supporter of the free trade agreement. He has been able, with the assistance of some colleagues, to bring the Labor Party with him. We congratulate him on that. We just hope that Senator Carr will not stitch him up in Victoria as a result of this. Senator Conroy's preselection may be threatened. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>—Live in hope.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name></talker><para>—Senator Conroy, we would prefer to see you in the chamber, because as strange as this may seem—</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Marshall, Gavin (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Marshall)</inline>—Senator Kemp, please direct your remarks through the chair.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name></talker><para>—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President.

This is a historic day. I believe the Labor Party decision, as announced today, shows that the government was on the right track—as we knew from day one. We congratulate Mark Vaile, the Prime Minister and those ministers who played a key role in bringing this important agreement forward. We now have access to the largest economy in the world, an economy that has shown astonishing growth capacities over the last decade. There are not only clearly direct benefits but also benefits that will flow from greater investment in this economy. There are benefits that will flow directly to sectors that are not immediately involved because it will create an even more prosperous Australian economy, an economy that is more dynamic and, as a result, an economy which is more prosperous. </para></talk.start></continue><para>All sectors will benefit from that, particularly the sector that I have a particular interest in, and that is the cultural sector. This is an important agreement for Australia. I believe that the cultural sector will benefit from this agreement. I believe that the misinformation that has been fed to this sector, particularly through the Labor Party spokesperson, Senator Lundy, has not only made it difficult for many people to understand precisely what this agreement delivers but also, I believe, damaged the Labor Party with the views she has put forward.</para><para>In conclusion, I am a strong supporter of the free trade agreement. This is indeed a historic day in this parliament. I reject the sorts of comments that Senator Ridgeway has made. I believe they are extreme. They are not based on fact, typically. They are designed to scare people where there is no basis for that. Australians can now look back on another major decision that this government has been involved in, a decision made in the national interest of Australia, a decision which will benefit Australians, industry, the agricultural sector and indeed all sectors of the Australian economy.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>25339</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We are debating today the legislation implementing the Australia-US free trade agreement negotiated by the government, the <inline ref="R2118">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2111">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004</inline>. When the government first indicated its interest in pursuing an FTA with the USA it made many promises to the Australian public. The government said that it would pursue a deal in the national interest—Australia's national interest, that is—in the interests of all Australians: families, workers, farmers, business and the community at large. Great claims were made about how much this deal would deliver to Australia, particularly how much it would deliver to Australian farmers—Australian farmers confronted by a distorted and corrupt international trading system, Australian farmers that asked for no more than a level playing field. Farmers are not after financial assistance or subsidies, just the opportunity to compete on equal terms in the international market. Minister Vaile promised so much in terms of improved access to the US market. On 23 January this year Mr Vaile said: </para></talk.start><quote><para>We've sought to do a comprehensive deal across all sectors, including agriculture, including sugar, and we've said that sugar must be part of the deal and we're not conceding that.</para></quote><para>The Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, said it would be un-Australian not to include sugar in the FTA. As we know, that is exactly what happened. Despite the great claims, despite the boasts, this package did not deliver in so many of the respects we were promised. There is no improved access for sugar in the package. Beef gets an increase in its export quota to the US of 70,000 tonnes but it takes 18 years to get there. Dairy gets a tripling of its quota to the US but Australian exports will continue to be constrained by tariff rate quotas.</para><para>Reflecting concerns about the FTA, Labor established a Senate committee to examine this deal in great detail. With over 500 submissions and many expert witnesses, the Senate inquiry enabled many issues of concern to be thoroughly examined and in many cases allayed. Yesterday, Labor senators on the committee reported their recommendations on what they believed should be in the agreement. But I want to come to some of the criticisms that John Howard and the parrots on the other side have been making day in and day out for the last few months: Mark Latham should show some leadership; he should stop dithering; he should make a decision; he should have made it five months ago.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>—Yes, that's right.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name></talker><para>—The peanut gallery is still with us.

George Bush, the President of the United States, has not signed the deal yet. That may come as a surprise to everyone in Australia because, from the way John Howard is pretending, it is a signed, sealed and delivered deal over in the US. George Bush, the President of the United States, has yet to sign this deal. The US Congress voted on this only three to four weeks ago. The implementation date is 1 January next year. Expert evidence from the departmental officials who negotiated this deal—some of them are in the chamber today—was quite clear: there was absolutely no imperative for this to be signed or rushed. We could wait until 31 December to vote this bill into legislation and make a decision to support it.</para><para>That was the evidence of the experts from the department, yet we have had the Prime Minister parroting on saying that this is a farce, this is stupid and the Senate inquiry is a waste of time. I am here to tell those on the other side of the chamber that that is dead wrong. The Senate inquiry process has been invaluable in getting to the heart of the facts ahead of the myths. Strip away the government's hype and examine the facts—and that is what we did. We have all heard about the $7 billion claim. Remember that it started off at $4 billion, then the author of the $4 billion claim said: `Once the deal is signed, you can't take any notice of the $4 billion claim. I didn't model the agreement; I just modelled free trade.' He modelled free trade the first time and got $4 billion. Then he got a paid contract from the government, went away and modelled the deal—which did not deliver free trade—and got $7 billion. It is truly remarkable. Not even Treasury officials were prepared to argue in support of the heroic assumptions the government's modeller made to generate the $7 billion. So we have to strip away the hype.  </para><para>We are indebted to Ross Garnaut, who, in the Senate inquiry—he is one of the country's leading trade economists and is internationally recognised as one of the world's leading trade economists—said, `This government study fails the laugh test.' We are indebted to him. The government's dodgy claim of how many benefits there were has failed the laugh test and it has now moved into the political lexicon. What did the Senate inquiry do? The Senate Select Committee on the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America commissioned its own report, its own economic study. It commissioned it using one of Australia's premier modellers of trade agreements, someone with eminent qualifications, who has worked at the Productivity Commission—the body that should have been empowered to examine this deal—and who currently works at the ANU. Her name is Philippa Dee. She made some far more realistic assessments of what was in this deal. She came up with a figure that showed a small, modest net benefit. When we stripped away the hype, stripped away the `once in a lifetime opportunity'—which is an absolute load of rubbish—we got a sensible view that allowed the members of the Senate committee to make a sensible, informed decision about this agreement, with none of the government's hype. The government's own Treasury officials were too embarrassed to support Andy Stoeckel's assumptions. </para><para>This argument about dithering should be seen for what it is—it is politicking by the Prime Minister to put his political interests ahead of Australia's national interests. If Mark Latham is a ditherer, George Bush must be a hell of a ditherer, because he has not signed the agreement yet. So let us put that matter to bed. The President of the United States is a massive ditherer.</para><para>What did Labor senators recommend should be included in the report and what do the Labor caucus endorse today? We have had two areas of concern. One we described as a deal breaker in the past: the PBS. The other concern has always been high on our list: local content. We want to address these issues in the Senate. We are offering an opportunity for this government to get its FTA up. It can probably have its FTA inside one week from today, depending on how long the debate takes. It can certainly have it before the end of next week. John Howard can get the FTA through. All he has to do is support Labor's two amendments. </para><para>These two amendments are to the TGA and the broadcasting act. They go to the heart of Labor's concerns. Labor's concerns are about ensuring that the PBS is not undermined by the free trade agreement. The amendment is designed to ensure that Australian voices and Australian faces will continue to be seen and heard on future media platforms, free-to-air and pay TV and whatever evolves in the future. Labor are addressing those concerns through these amendments. Let us make this clear now: these amendments are consistent with the spirit and the intent of the free trade deal. They do not contravene the free trade agreement: you can have these amendments and you can have the FTA. That is what is on offer today. Mark Latham has put that offer on the table to John Howard. He said, `Mr Howard, if you're truly concerned and you truly want this FTA, here are a couple of amendments that you can have and you'll get your FTA by the end of the week.' These amendments are consistent with the FTA text and will ensure that the PBS and local content are protected. </para><para>Labor will also introduce a comprehensive package to address many of the other concerns raised about the FTA. Labor assess that the deal is in the national interest, but we believe we can improve the quality of the implementing legislation. That goes to the heart of our desire to improve, enhance and protect the PBS and Australian voices through local content. The comprehensive package has to address other concerns. I want to go through our two amendments in detail so that the chamber, Senator Kemp and the government are fully aware of the opportunity that is on offer today. Our amendments are to protect the PBS by preventing and penalising drug companies that try to stop cheaper generic drugs coming onto the market by lodging dodgy patent claims. The validity of these claims would be determined by a court, not by the TGA or the government. </para><para>What we have seen in the US is pharmaceutical companies setting out to frustrate the flow of generic drugs. Once a patent runs out, a generic drug replaces it. In the US—and this will sound quite incredible if you have been unaware of these things—the day before a patent is due to run out the patent holder, the drug company, will apply for a new patent on the basis that they want to change the marketing package. They might change it from a red pill to a blue pill and they will say, `We want a new patent for 20-odd years for the blue pill instead of the red pill.' Because of the processes in the US particularly, the generic drug companies are forced to take these hugely wealthy drug companies to court. Ultimately, the court rules in favour of the generic company and says, `This is a spurious claim. This is a claim that is not fair dinkum. It is the same chemical compound in the drug even though it is in a different coloured capsule,' or it may be a dissolvable tablet rather than a `take with water' hard pill. Those are the sorts of games played in the US.</para><para>The government has said that it does not want evergreening, which is its colloquial name, to take place. It does not believe there is anything in the FTA that will increase the possibility of evergreening taking place. So the Labor Party say to the government: join with us. Let us make sure that those incredibly wealthy American drug companies, which champion George Bush's position, do not engage in that practice in this country. Let us move an amendment to the enabling legislation, similar to the amendment that this government is proposing to put in place, that says that, if a generic drug company files an incorrect or dodgy application and gets it wrong, the TGA are entitled to fine that generic drug company for putting in a wrong application. Labor say that we should add to this protection because it is important that patents are protected. This is not a debate about trying to undermine a patent; it is important that patents are protected. But if it is okay to fine a generic company for filing a false document let us make it that we can fine a drug company that puts in a bodgie patent claim that is not about the science or the chemical product but about its commercial interests. It is about wanting to play the system. It is about wanting to use the courts to drag things out for a year or a year and a half to slow down the introduction of a generic drug.</para><para>Why is that important? There are five major drugs currently listed on the PBS that are due to expire next year. If those drug companies were able to delay that expiry by even 18 months by fooling around with evergreening, it could see a $1.2 billion increase in the cost of the PBS to Australian taxpayers. That is why a couple of hundred thousand dollars in legal costs is worth while and that is why these companies play these games in the US. I genuinely do not believe the government want this to happen. Here is an opportunity for them to say, `We don't want it to happen and we're going to work with Labor in Australians' national interest to protect the PBS and to protect Australian taxpayers so that this bodgie practice can't commence in Australia.' This is not in breach of the FTA deal. This is complementary and worth while. I invite Senator Kemp to take it to the Prime Minister. Say that you have listened to Senator Conroy and you think he has some worthwhile ideas—I have got you on the record on that one, Senator Kemp. Tell him, `Here is another worthwhile idea from Senator Conroy.' The good news, Senator Kemp, is that I have two good ideas today. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>—A Labor record!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name></talker><para>—I have to confess that I was not alone in thinking up this next idea. Surprisingly enough, I had a few parliamentary colleagues who supported me on this next idea, which deals with local content. The issue here is whether we want Australian voices on television. This is a government that successfully fought the ambition of the US to try to reduce our local content. The government said, `No, we're going to keep the 55 per cent.' They did agree to something known as the ratchet clause—in other words, if our local content ever falls below 55 per cent, we are never allowed to put it up again. I genuinely do not believe the government would ever want that to be the case, so Labor are saying, `Why are we leaving the decision about local content in the hands of the Australian Broadcasting Authority?' They can just make an edict and we will have a new level of content, and if they ever decide to lower it we can never put it back up. I do not believe the government want this.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Labor's suggested amendment is that we should take the opportunity with this enabling legislation to put in place a strong guarantee of future local content. Let us amend the broadcasting act. Let us take the ABA out of the equation in the determination of local content and let us make it a vote of the parliament. Let us pass some legislation that will say that local content will remain at 55 per cent and that if any government in the future wants to reduce the number of Australian voices on television or wants to reduce Australian content it will have to be brought to the House of Representatives and it will be have to be brought to the Senate. That is the second amendment, consistent with the FTA, protecting Australia's interests and ensuring there are Australian voices long term on free-to-air television.</para><para>But, as I said, I cannot claim complete credit for that idea, because I had the support of other parliamentary colleagues. Some of those parliamentary colleagues are from the other side of the chamber. The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which examined this issue, unanimously supported this idea. That is right: half-a-dozen government members and senators agreed to and supported this provision being put in place. I cannot claim all the credit, because half-a-dozen members of the government believed in this amendment and thought it was a good idea too. I say again, Senator Kemp, that you can go to the Prime Minister and say, `It's not just Senator Conroy's good idea. This includes some of our own backbenchers. Andrew Southcott and other members of JSCOT signed off on this.' I think Senator Marshall might have been on that committee. Senator Marshall and half-a-dozen members of the government on that committee signed off on this idea. It is consistent. Nobody said it was inconsistent two months ago when JSCOT produced its report. No-one said that this would destroy or undermine the FTA or that you could not have the FTA. There they are: two amendments consistent with support for the FTA but protecting and enhancing Australian local content and protecting and enhancing Australia's PBS. Senator Kemp, that is the offer today to the Prime Minister of Australia: you can have the FTA inside seven days and probably by the end of next week—maybe earlier if the Senate gets through its business. Two sensible, reasonable, commonsense amendments, and the FTA is through. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>25344</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator FERRIS</name><name.id>5L6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have very good news for Senator Conroy.

Senator Conroy will be very pleased to know that the concerns he raised in his speech in relation to President Bush will be allayed tomorrow. </para></talk.start><para>It is with a great sense of optimism that I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R2118">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2111">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004</inline> that will bring into effect the free trade agreement between Australia and the United States from 1 January next year. This agreement, as we all now know, will bring significant benefits to the Australian economy for many years to come and for many reasons. I would like to mention just two of them today in the short time I have before question time. First of all, it provides export opportunities for Australia's farmers, for our industry and for Australia's service providers. Second, it will result in increased foreign investment in Australia's economy, something that I was interested to hear Premier Beattie outlining on a television program late last week as he appealed to the opposition—successfully, it transpires—to agree to this free trade agreement. That foreign investment will enable many of our fledgling industries to grow significantly in the years ahead.</para><para>If you believe in trade, if you believe in opening markets and providing opportunities for primary producers and for others and if you believe in supporting local industries, both big and small, through greater investment, then you will also be optimistic about this agreement which provides Australia with access to the world's largest economy. The Senate Select Committee on the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America, of which I was a member, carried out a thorough, exhaustive and transparent examination of the agreement. It was held concurrently with another thorough, exhaustive and transparent inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, chaired by my South Australian colleague the member for Boothby. So I can state at the outset that anyone who continues to suggest that there has not been a proper parliamentary scrutiny of this agreement is, frankly, deluding themselves. At this point can I say how much senators on this side wish the chair of the select committee, Senator Peter Cook, well for the serious surgery he is undergoing right at this time.</para><para>As a strong advocate for Australian agriculture, I can tell the Senate that the free trade agreement gives Australia's primary producers a significant boost in the US market. Two-thirds of all agricultural tariffs, including on lamb, on sheepmeat, on wine, on a range of horticultural products and on seafood will be eliminated immediately, and a further nine per cent will be cut to zero within four years. Witness after witness at our select committee outlined these benefits and the positive message conveyed to primary industries. The Australian Dairy Industry Council told our committee:</para><quote><para>The long-term prosperity of the Australian dairy industry is linked to export markets and international market access. </para></quote><para>	...	...	...</para><quote><para>The new access offers Australian manufacturers a unique opportunity to grow demand for dairy in the United States, with innovative customer tailored products, before our competitors can secure increased access via either regional agreements or multilaterally through the WTO.</para></quote><para>They went on to say:</para><quote><para>This will directly feed into greater exports, given the mature domestic market and sustainable downstream job creation in rural and regional communities where the dairy industry operates.</para></quote><para>That is where new jobs are desperately needed. The Australian Seafood Council agreed. Their analysis that was presented to our committee of inquiry showed that 48 American tariffs plus some other rates of duty expressed in cents per kilo are all abolished from 1 January next year under this agreement. They disappear from day one. Horticulture Australia had the same story; they also told the committee that, as it stands at the moment, 98 per cent of Australian fresh exports into the United States face tariffs but that, under the agreement struck so far, 99 per cent would be tariff free immediately and the remaining tariffs would be eliminated over a transition period. That does go out, in some cases, to 18 years but it is conceded that it is a significant plus for the industry.</para><para>The Tuna Boat Owners Association told the committee the same thing. They said they needed volume to survive. They have no substantial tariff protection for products coming into Australia and therefore they need global volume to survive. The United States and Europe have always been shut to the Australian tuna industry because of a 35 per cent tariff into the United States and a 25 per cent tariff into the European Union. So this will be the first significant opportunity the Australian tuna industry and seafood industry—industries so important to the South Australian economy—will have to get into the United States. As they told the committee, they did not expect such a positive outcome so early. One of the topics that were raised with us was the multilateral versus bilateral philosophical approach to trade. It was discussed extensively in the committee because, of course, Senator Peter Cook, the chair of the committee, is an avowed multilateralist. The committee was very interested to address this matter. When I continue my remarks, I will outline the issue.</para><para>Debate interrupted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS</title><type>Ministerial Arrangements</type><page.no>25345</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>25345</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—On 14 July 2004 the Prime Minister announced a number of changes to the ministry.

Senator Mackay raised an issue about Telstra's line rental increases. Telstra's ability to raise line rentals is constrained by the price control arrangements that are imposed upon Telstra. The government imposes retail price controls on Telstra to drive efficiency improvements and to lower overall prices for consumers in markets where competition is not yet fully developed. Within these constraints, Telstra, like any other company, may vary its prices as it considers appropriate. Telstra's compliance with the price controls is assessed annually by the ACCC. A breach of the price controls is a breach of Telstra's licence condition, and Telstra can be penalised with a $10 million fine.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The government has accepted the ACCC's and the Productivity Commission's advice that gradually increasing the line rental charges to reflect the costs of providing telephone lines is in the long-term interests of consumers. Labor, of course, dismisses this argument—and I expect Senator Mackay does—thereby showing little regard for the views of independent experts. The government is very conscious of the need to protect low-income consumers from what you might call the shocks of line rental increases. To protect low-income consumers, the government has imposed a licence condition on Telstra that requires it to offer an annual $170 million package of assistance measures for low-income consumers. The package of measures is assessed by the Low Income Measures Assessment Committee, made up of representatives from peak bodies.</para><para>Looking to the future, the government has directed the ACCC to review the existing price control arrangements, and the scope for further line rental increases will be considered as part of this review. The Low Income Measures Assessment Committee's assessment of the low-income protection arrangement was that Telstra has responded genuinely and comprehensively to the licence requirement to provide a program to assist low-income Australians to access telecommunications services.</para><para>It is interesting to note that this is an area—one of the few, I think, since I have been looking at what the opposition has been saying about telecommunications policy—where Labor has said it would freeze line rental increases and continue to call for price decreases. It is obviously simplistic to force Telstra to lower prices, and it would probably have fairly adverse consequences. Telstra accepts the impact on its revenue and profitability will be passed through to shareholders in the form of lower dividends. The other possibility is that Telstra will look to make up the revenue shortfall by increasing prices for other services, thereby affecting consumers. The point about this policy on line rentals is that it delivers an appropriate outcome for consumers and particularly for low-income consumers.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>25348</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

It is perfectly true—and I agree with the Prime Minister—that the government is not there to micro manage Telstra. The government is there to ensure that there is a regulatory regime that delivers for consumers proper outcomes and that will allow Telstra to operate within a commercial framework in such a way that it is not so constrained that it cannot actually operate. Obviously there is a balance to be struck and that has in fact been done with the benefits for consumers.</para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Howard Government: Economic Policy</title><page.no>25349</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>25349</page.no><name role="metadata">Chapman, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator CHAPMAN</name><name.id>FF4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill.

The Howard government has created more than 96,000 full-time jobs over the last six months alone. Compare that with Labor's 53,000 full-time jobs during its last six years of office. We have created more than 1.3 million jobs since coming to office. Again, contrast that with Labor's high of one million unemployed. More Australians are now in work than ever before. We are not resting on our achievements to date. We are committed to providing more jobs for Australians who want to work. We are committed to driving down unemployment even further. That is why this government continues to manage the budget responsibly. That is why it has kept a lid on interest rates and inflation. That is why it is pursuing better outcomes for Australian exporters. Greater access to the growing markets of the world means more exports for Australia and more jobs for Australian workers. It is a pretty simple equation.</para><para>The government have gone out and fought for a better deal for Australian exporters. We have secured free trade agreements with Singapore and Thailand. We have established a trade and economic framework with China—the fastest growing market in our region—and we have won a free trade agreement with the United States, the world's largest and most dynamic economy. This agreement will deliver billions of dollars a year to our economy, with an estimated 30,000 new jobs. It is a good deal for Australian exporters; it is a good deal for Australian workers and their families. Some have chosen to play the politics of fear with this agreement for nothing more than short-term political gain. The government are committed to real benefits for Australia into the future. That is why we won this agreement, that is why we have stood by this agreement and that is why we are pushing ahead with this agreement. It is time for those opposite to do the right thing by Australian exporters and Australian workers and get behind this free trade agreement rather than yet again muddying the waters. </para></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DISTINGUISHED VISITORS</title><type>Distinguished Visitors</type><page.no>25350</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

On the issue of the potential divestiture of Foxtel, my view is that at this stage it is difficult to see that there is any compelling case that would warrant Telstra divesting itself of its interest in Foxtel. However, it is true to say that there are many people around who do advocate structural separation, vertical separation, spin-offs from Telstra and hollowing out of Telstra. None of that really addresses what kind of industry you would have if you actually did that.</para></talk.start><para>So far as I have been able to tell, there is no cost-benefit analysis that indicates that there would be any net benefit if Telstra were required to divest itself of its interest in Foxtel. From the government's perspective, you would have to ask yourself: what would the industry look like if Foxtel were divested? Who would buy it? Would you have any increase in competition? Would it look any different to the way it does now? Would you simply be setting yourself up for a situation where once again Telstra might enter the market and build another network? What would happen to Optus? It seems to me that there are a number of issues that have not been thought out. The ACCC referred to the advisability of looking at whether there would be any benefit but, as I understand it, there certainly was not any conclusion that the ACCC had come to a view that this should happen.  </para><para>On the other hand, the government has always appreciated the costs and risks associated with any kind of vertical separation of Telstra or the spin-off of Foxtel. In fact, the government's position is supported by an OECD report, which I am sure Senator Lundy has read, which found that the benefits are likely to be limited and outweighed by the costs. Obviously, before you consider something as drastic as requiring a divestiture of a business you need to know what impact it is going to have on consumers, the cost to industry and whether or not you are going to end up with a more competitive environment. I understand that the Labor Party is really the only party to have flirted seriously with this idea in recent times when it was included in their `Reforming Telstra' paper, which I have read. As we all remember, it was one of the great policy backflips that characterise the Labor Party. Labor was forced to change its position and concede that in fact it was a flawed policy idea in the long run. The long and short of this issue to do with Foxtel is that it is a leap in the dark.

Lamb, sheepmeat and horticultural products tariffs will be eliminated straightaway. A further nine per cent of tariffs will be cut to zero within four years. The beef quota, currently 378,000 tonnes, will be substantially increased by something like 19 per cent over 18 years. Our exports of dairy, currently worth about $40 million, will increase to around $55 million. For the wool industry, there will be zero tariff for greasy wool immediately. There will be immediate tariff treatment for horticultural products—oranges, mangoes. The citrus industry will be saving nearly $700,000 alone in duties.

The immediate removal of the 35 per cent tariff on canned tuna will provide duty-free access to the $650 million US market.

I am the first to concede that any plans to sell the rest of Telstra—to be perfectly clear about my former answer—should be done in one lot. It must, of course, provide value for shareholders, and to get the value up is obviously going to be quite an issue.

It is obviously clear as well that, in relation to the roll-out of broadband, for instance, a lot of the technology that has been delivered to rural and regional Australia and the take-up of broadband technology have the opportunity to address some of those issues for rural and regional Australia and to address some of the issues that were identified in the original report. As Senator Stephens would be well aware, this government has undertaken many initiatives to implement the Estens report and will continue to monitor the effectiveness of those initiatives. But I am not going to stand in the Senate and I am not going to say anything publicly about the sale of Telstra that is not going to address those services.

Our other broadband initiatives include our Advanced Networks Program and support for eight major health education broadband projects funded through the National Communications Fund. This means a lot to rural and regional Australia because it means, for instance, that an area health service over scattered populations can actually save on travel time for meetings and can save even on fleet costs because people are not travelling around.

We are very proud of our record in that regard. But we did say that there were a number of areas where we have to safeguard Australian interests for very important reasons. One was the PBS, in terms of the security that it provides to Australians on health matters. Another was the area of quarantine. For obvious reasons, it is very important that we protect Australia's quarantine system. A third reason, which I thought was very eloquently restated by my colleague Senator Kemp earlier today, was to look after Australian interests in broadcasting—the so-called cultural environment. So, yes, we did negotiate an agreement that did not threaten the PBS system, and we are quite confident of that outcome. I restated it in my second reading speech today in the chamber.

We had children dying of measles; we had children dying of whooping cough; we had children dying of preventable diseases. What we did, through very clever policy, was to in fact encourage parents. Those who chose not to have their children vaccinated were still required to go to their general practitioner to actually have it explained to them why it is not good for them not to be vaccinated and why it is not good for the community for the children not to be vaccinated.

We indicate certain things for the United States side to enhance transparency and meaningful consultation and accountability in the process for selecting, listing and pricing the pharmaceuticals, which we believe to be a reasonable request from the United States side. As the honourable senator knows, because he is referring to this letter, it goes through the listing process, the role of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, an appeal process where a particular item is not listed and various steps that are being taken to ensure that the process is more expeditious. Then we get to paragraph 4, to which the honourable senator referred, which said that in effect an applicant still has got the right to apply for a price adjustment. My understanding is that an applicant has got the right to apply for a price adjustment today, and I say that this does no more than simply affirm what the existing situation is and therefore does not threaten PBS prices as a result of the free trade agreement. I will ask Minister Vaile to confirm my understanding but I am quite confident that what I have said is the case.</para></talk.start></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>25356</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

So, yes, there is an appeal mechanism to demonstrate good faith in relation to listing but not in relation to price. Therefore, I think if the bottom line of what the senator is putting is a concern about prices under the PBS then his concerns in this instance are without merit. I will ask Mr Vaile to confirm that but, again, I am reasonably confident that that is the case. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Taxation: Family Payments</title><page.no>25356</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>25356</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to Senator Patterson as the Minister for Family and Community Services.

The short answer to that is that it has a leader called Mark Latham who cannot tackle the hard issues, to be quite frank. This was a difficult issue for the Labor Party and it is one on which the Labor Party has allowed a debate to run for a very long period of time.

I am pleased to report to you, Mr President, that that is exactly what the government has done. I can assure Senator Lundy that the government has kept its commitment to the cultural sector and has retained the capacity to support the sector, to regulate audiovisual media and to meet our cultural objectives now and in the future. Importantly, the government's capacity to provide grants and subsidies, including tax incentives, and to support cultural institutions and agencies—including, for example, the ABC and SBS—remains unaffected.</para><para>In audiovisual services the government have negotiated an agreement with the US that retains existing regulations for local content, including on advertising.

We have the ability to impose expenditure requirements of up to 10 per cent on four additional program formats on subscription television—that is, on arts programming, children's programming, documentaries and educational programming. The agreement preserves our ability to direct money into new production activity. We have the ability to introduce local content requirements on new media—and this was one of the major demands of the cultural sector—and interactive radio or video services. The agreement can apply to new types of interactive platforms that have yet to be conceived. Most importantly, the decisions on these matters will be made by Australians.

There has been a lot of misinformation in the debate that has surrounded the content rules to do with the FTA, and I think it is important to separate fact from fiction. Perhaps the biggest victim of the misinformation campaign has been the debate about what the government has done to protect local content and Australia's cultural objectives. We do need to be very clear, as Senator Kemp outlined in great detail, that what we have done in this free trade agreement gives future Australian governments vast scope to preserve and to promote Australia's cultural identity and local content.</para></talk.start><para>With respect to local content we have done two things. We have completely retained the current local content requirements that exist to make sure that Australians can hear Australian voices and stories—that is, 55 per cent of programming and 80 per cent of commercials on free-to-air television—and we have secured for Australia the capacity to impose new local content requirements in the future, should it be necessary. It is very difficult to predict the future but it is important that we at least preserve the ability to deal with it as may be necessary. It is precisely because the future is unclear—particularly subject to reviews that are being conducted, as Senator Cherry mentions—that the government has negotiated an agreement that gives it the flexibility that it needs to introduce new rules for new forms of media.</para><para>To maximise this flexibility we have deliberately not sought to be constrained from defining matters such as new media in the agreement. In practice, we could impose a 55 per cent local content requirement on up to three channels per provider if we move to a multichannel environment. This gives us the capacity to triple the amount of local content available on free-to-air television. If it is considered necessary, we can also double the expenditure requirement for local content on pay TV. </para><para>Looking to the future, we can impose measures on new interactive platforms to make sure that Australian consumers can get appropriate access to Australian content. Rather than spelling doom and gloom and the end of Australian film and TV as we know it, this government supports these industries and supports our culture. The agreement allows the government to require more Australian content to be made available than we already enjoy. That has been a deliberate policy approach that the government has espoused in relation to content.</para><para>Obviously, I can see from Senator Cherry's question that he is still lukewarm, as indeed are the Labor Party, on embracing the free trade agreement. After five months of dithering and sitting on the fence by the Labor Party, they have now said that they want to espouse the local content requirements currently in legislation. That does not really do much to improve what we already have but we will look very carefully at the proposal.

The reality with respect to line rentals in particular, which relates to the question I asked, is that since March 2000 line rentals have tripled under this government. The minister says, `Okay, that's fine; we have put appropriate mechanisms in place to assist low-income people.' That is simply not the case.</para><para>It is not good enough for the Prime Minister, John Howard, to say, `I can't control the microeconomic policy decisions of the company.' That is a total cop-out on the face of it. To compound that absolute cop-out, the reality is that the government initiated, negotiated with the assistance of the Democrats and implemented the very changes that have allowed Telstra to triple line rentals in the last four years. In fact, Telstra admitted at the last round of estimates hearings that the latest increase alone will reap them $180 million. This is the same outfit that, when asked questions by me and others with respect to credit card fees and why they were charging people for paying their Telstra bills by credit card, effectively said, `Because we can.' It is that level of corporate arrogance that I was hoping the new minister would give some indication that the government was prepared to tackle. But if you are the government of the day, you simply cannot say, `It's nothing to do with us,' which is what the Prime Minister has said. If you are the government of the day, you simply cannot say, `We can't control the microeconomic policy decisions of the company.' If you are the Prime Minister of the day and you cannot control what is happening in a company of which the people of Australia are the majority shareholder, how on earth can you purport to manage the country? That is the reality. </para><para>The cost of line rentals has in fact tripled. The reality is, again, that there has been very slow progress at the other end of the spectrum with respect to assisting people on low incomes. The minister herself made comments with respect to the `shock'. She used that term when she said, `There are processes in place to absorb the shocks of line rental increases'—out of the mouths of babes and government ministers. To the average Australian a tripling of the cost of line rentals is a shock, which is why Labor have said—and we are unabashed about this—we will freeze line rental increases. Telstra were not particularly thrilled about that when they heard that statement at estimates or wherever. We say: `Too bad for them.' We are not elected as individuals and, if we are elected at the next election, we are not elected to represent Telstra. We are elected to represent the people of Australia and that is what Labor will do: we will freeze line rentals. We do not believe that a tripling of line rentals over a very short period is good enough. We know that Australian consumers do not believe it is good enough either. </para><para>The other thing of interest I noticed today, with respect to the comments of the new minister, is that she bluntly admitted there was a difference of position between herself and Senator Minchin. There is a difference of position between a lot of people and Senator Minchin. What is the minister's position? In the time she has been minister, 10 days into the new job, she has gone from announcing that she would continue the previous minister's policy and the government's policy of legislating to sell Telstra before the election to saying that she would legislate to sell Telstra after the election. Then today in the papers we read that she is proposing to split Telstra up—the very thing that Richard Alston vowed and declared he would never, ever do.</para><para>In terms of where this government's policy is, we have Senator Minchin saying, `Sell at all costs, we don't care about consumers.' We have Senator Coonan, who is not sufficiently across the matter, saying three different things in the first 10 days into the new job. The only party that is consistent is the Labor Party. We will not sell the remainder of Telstra; we will keep it in the hands of the shareholders of Australia. The way to keep Telstra in public hands is to vote Labor at the next election.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>25363</page.no><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator EGGLESTON</name><name.id>4L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the motion to take note of the responses given by Senator Coonan to questions asked of her today. Senator Mackay of course is taking the fixed Labor Party view about Telstra—that is, in order to provide a reasonable level of telephone services and other communication services to the Australian community the government must own that service. Of course, that is absolute nonsense. You do not need to own a service to regulate a service and that is the government's position. We believe, quite emphatically and without any doubt whatsoever, that the basket of regulatory regime factors surrounding Telstra is such that the public of Australia is guaranteed an excellent telephone service, regardless of who owns Telstra. </para></talk.start><para>It is a shame, I think, for the people of Australia that Senator Mackay, and other members of the ALP, are so ideologically committed to the socialist concept of state ownership and thereby the people of Australia are suffering. I am bound to call the attention of the Senate—since Senator Mackay talked about higher line charges—to what the practical impact has been of the government deregulating the telecommunication service. The government deregulated the tele-ommunication services and, as a result, we now have over 100 telecommunications companies in Australia providing services to the Australian people. The most important outcome of that competition has been a dramatic drop in the cost of telephone charges. The Australian people have benefited enormously from deregulation of the telecommunications system brought in by the Howard government. It would be a genuine tragedy no less for the people of Australia if we were to go back to the regime which existed under the Labor government, where there was a single provider and no competition whatsoever. That meant poor service, slow action in putting on new services, slow action in undertaking repairs and that technological innovation and variety in those kinds of services was never implemented in Australia, whereas it was in other countries.  </para><para>For many reasons, the ideological position that we on this side of the house have adopted—that is, a belief in the benefit of competition and that it is good for the customer—has been more than adequately proven, proven in spades in fact, by the experience we have had in the telecommunications industry. As I said, there are over 100 telcos these days, prices have dropped and Australians around this country, not only in the big cities but also in rural areas, have access to the most sophisticated telecommunications in the world.</para><para>The fact that we held a Senate inquiry last year into the sale of Telstra seems to have escaped Senator Mackay's mind, even though she participated in that inquiry. We found during the inquiry that people around Australia, and in rural areas in particular, were quite happy with their basic telephone service and they wanted more sophisticated services. They did not want just a basic telephone service anymore; they wanted access to broadband, fast fax and the Internet. Again, competition will bring those services. It is the competition to Telstra, from Optus in particular—who are offering very sophisticated communication services via satellite—which has no doubt led Telstra to introduce the concept of Telstra Country Wide, which has had a very dramatic effect on improving services in country areas and which has brought a great benefit overall to the people of rural Australia. Again, I state that were we locked into the socialist policies of the ALP and a single telecommunications provider in this country, the people of Australia would be much worse off than they have been under the competitive regime introduced to the telecommunications industry by the Howard government.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>25364</page.no><name role="metadata">Stephens, Sen Ursula</name><name role="display">Senator STEPHENS</name><name.id>00AOS</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I too rise to speak on this motion to take note of the responses given by Senator Coonan to questions asked of her today. I would like to focus my attention on her responses to my questions about regional services and the comments made by the government's appointee as the chair of the regional telecommunications inquiry in 2002, Mr Dick Estens, who only a week ago made the statement that many telecommunications services in the bush remain a shemozzle. This was a bit of plain speaking about what is actually happening in rural Australia in telecommunications services. In a media report, Mr Estens was cited as saying that he was having difficulties having some telephone lines connected in Dubbo. For those people who are not from New South Wales, Dubbo is a major regional hub and a centre that would be expected to have reasonable telecommunications services. The fact that Mr Estens was having difficulty in getting those telephone lines connected is an indication of just how difficult it is in the bush to have some kind of equity of access to telecommunications services. </para></talk.start><para>But we still hear stories, even in the media this week, that the minister will consider quite soon another attempt to sell off Telstra, despite the government's expert saying that regional telecommunications are not up to scratch. Of course, there is also the obvious absence of any comment or defence of that position by any Nationals representatives in this place. We are also very aware that the two internal documents leaked by Labor earlier this year show that fixed line and mobile networks are going backwards after years of Telstra staff and investment cutbacks. So we have a situation in all of regional Australia where the Telstra network is an unreliable mix of the technology superhighway and what I would describe as bush tracks or gravel tracks. The minister needs to get her head around what the facilities are for regional telecommunications. We have a motley collection of old, copper-wire technology. We have a series of quite soggy cables and underpowered exchanges which, as soon as there is any rain, are flooded and the services become unworkable. We have overlooked lines, we have temporary patches where pair gains are being connected and used as some kind of second-rate service delivery. We have a guarantee from Telstra of an Internet connection speed of 19.2 kilobits per second, which in many areas of regional Australia is a complete joke. Even where I live, only 15 kilometres out of Goulburn, the Internet connection speed on a good day is sometimes only 14 kilobits per second, which means it can take hours to download a simple virus protection program, for example.</para><para>So regional telecommunications services are still a joke for many people. The minister talked today about the move to use telecommunications services to deliver services for health and education. I have to say to the minister that she needs to take a bit of a reality check on how effective that can be when we do not have access to those kinds of services in many of our communities. We have a big push to take on satellite connections but, even so, we have the situation that Mr Estens commented on, which is that the combination of service providers and the deregulation of service providers mean that it can take weeks to get a technician to come to either install or repair any of those kinds of services. So regional Australia has been seriously let down by The Nationals and by the Liberal Party regional representation in this place. As Senator Mackay said, Labor are committed to ensuring that we maintain Telstra in public ownership for all Australians.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>25365</page.no><name role="metadata">Santoro, Sen Santo</name><name role="display">Senator SANTORO</name><name.id>BOT</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The contributions of senators opposite has given us a fairly clear indication today of just how the Labor Party would operate should they be given a chance to govern, which I suspect they will not be given for quite a long time.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BOT</name.id><name role="metadata">Santoro, Sen Santo</name><name role="display">Senator SANTORO</name></talker><para>—To use Senator Mackay's words, what they are interested in is microeconomic management. Unlike you, Senator Mackay, through you, Mr Deputy President, this government has confidence in the boards that it appoints, it has confidence in the management that those boards oversee and it goes about the business of government by not interfering. We do not interfere, we do not intervene and we do not go about the business of distorting the good work that government appointed boards do. If we are not confident in them we will replace the chairman or replace the personnel and we will move on with business. Telstra goes about servicing the legitimate telecommunications needs of Australians, particularly in rural and regional Australia, and it earns dividends for the government—dividends that the Labor Party would like to get their hands on to squander. What we have done in government, for example, is reduce the huge amount of debt that the Labor Party, the now discredited Hawke-Keating government, left behind for us to clean up. </para></talk.start></continue><para>We unashamedly support competition and we unashamedly support the operation of the market, but we also acknowledge that the competitor market does have some limitations. To overcome the limitations of the market the Howard government is supporting competitive outcomes with regulated consumer safeguards and targeted government funding. In a speech to a CEDA conference in May, the former minister said that the government believed this would achieve the best outcomes not only for the industry but also for all Australians. It is perfectly plain, and it should be to those opposite, that the Howard government is not going to divert from this basic policy framework. </para><para>The Australian telecommunications market has dramatically changed since it was opened up in 1997, and we heard that throughout the recent inquiry. A study conducted by the Allen Consulting Group on behalf of the Australian Government Communications Authority found that `competition resulted in consumer benefits of between $330 and $1,028 per household in 2002-02'. There you have real and sustainable consumer benefits. The consultants also found that the introduction of competition accounted for increased small business profits of $1.7 billion. Presumably senators opposite would want those particular benefits to remain with small businesses. The study found that that had resulted in 54,000 additional jobs and $12 billion worth of growth in the Australian economy. Again, these are very real and quantifiable benefits that we do not hear senators opposite acknowledge.</para><para>Only this month the government announced that telecommunications consumers will have stronger representation as a result of grants totalling $700,000 to 28 consumer organisations. The grants will ensure that the needs and interests of consumers are represented in the development of telecommunications industry codes and practices. A new feature of the grants for 2004-05 is the allocation of sitting fees to all members of the Australian Communications Industry Forum Consumer Advisory Council and the ACIF Disability Advisory Board. This funding means that consumer bodies who want to participate in the self-regulatory process in telecommunications have sufficient and appropriate financial support. Funds are also to be allocated for the representation of consumers in regional areas and consumers with disabilities. The peak representative organisations for residential and small business consumers, the Consumers Telecommunication Network, and small enterprise telecommunications centres will also receive funding. This will help them to employ staff with expertise and experience in telecommunications and representation for the long-term benefit of consumers. Organisations representing consumers with disabilities, including the Telecommunications and Disability Consumers Representation, Australian Association of the Deaf, Deafness Forum Australia and Women with Disabilities Australia, have also been allocated funds.</para><para>Under the Telecommunications Act 1997 the Howard government has allocated $4.6 million to consumer bodies for representation since 1998. What these particular figures and the government initiatives clearly show is that the Howard government is very committed to taking on the concerns of consumers and of the organisations that represent consumers, particularly those organisations that represent consumers with disabilities and those who may be disadvantaged by the tyranny of distance as a result of the size of our country. What really worries me during these debates is that you hear senators opposite and opposition members in the other place simply refusing to acknowledge the great benefit that has resulted from the deregulation of the telecommunications market as well as the great work that Telstra does. We are not into microeconomic management of the way Telstra goes about its business; we are all about delivering real benefits. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>25367</page.no><name role="metadata">Buckland, Sen Geoffrey</name><name role="display">Senator BUCKLAND</name><name.id>009D2</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I too rise to speak on the answers given by Senator Coonan to questions today. One thing that really does stand out about the difference between Labor and the government in relation to Telstra is that Labor will absolutely never sell Telstra. We will keep Telstra as a majority public owned company delivering decent services to all Australians—not the services that are provided by this government through Telstra. Labor is committed to serving the outback and to serving people in remote and isolated areas on the same basis that it serves city dwellers. We believe that Telstra should go back to the real basics—providing jobs and services to all Australians. I was interested in Senator Coonan's comment that Telstra was protecting charges for the long-term benefit of all consumers. There was a $180 million profit from the last increase alone, yet not all consumers have easy or good access to Telstra services. We talk about travel and we talk about mobile phone linkages between major centres. I can tell you that there is not clear access for mobile phones between Adelaide and Whyalla, Adelaide and Port Augusta, Whyalla and Port Augusta and Whyalla and Port Lincoln. Certainly, on the west coast, when you leave the confines of Port Augusta you cannot pick up a mobile phone signal again until you get to Ceduna, some 400-plus kilometres away.</para></talk.start><para>The same goes for the south-east of the state. If you go off the main highway you lose phone contact for many hours at a time. If you go north towards Alice Springs, Coober Pedy, Marla or Glendambo, you will get coverage between Port Augusta and Coober Pedy for 25 kilometres, if you are lucky, as you go past Woomera. That is the total service that you have for your mobile phone. Then you talk to the people who live in those remote outback areas, to the graziers in the areas of Oodnadatta, William Creek, Marla, Maree and the station country. They have difficulty getting landline access to their Internet services. In fact, in some locations they can wait two hours for simple emails to open—two hours to open an email because the service is so poor.</para><para>I am interested too in the attitude of The Nationals, particularly the Queensland Nationals. I thought at one stage that they were going to go to the wire on this and that it could have caused a bit of a revolt within the coalition. They were going to stick by Telstra forever and a day. But of course they say one thing in Queensland and another here. John Anderson stated at the Queensland Nationals conference on the weekend that he opposed the sale of Telstra until regional services were up to scratch. But the Deputy Prime Minister has voted twice in this parliament to sell Telstra, with no strings attached. John Anderson says one thing in Queensland but he comes to Canberra and he has a totally different attitude. But that is not all. The Nationals really do not know where they are going with this. They know that if Telstra is privatised services will get worse and prices will rise. Telstra will leave town faster than the banks, and The Nationals know it. But they are too afraid when they come to Canberra to say anything to their coalition partners. They just sit back, get their tummies rubbed, and all is good. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Trade: Free Trade Agreement</title><page.no>25368</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>25368</page.no><name role="metadata">Ridgeway, Sen Aden</name><name role="display">Senator RIDGEWAY</name><name.id>8G6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Hill) to a question without notice asked by Senator Ridgeway today relating to the Australia-United States free trade agreement and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</para></motion><para>I thought it extraordinary that the minister could not give an ironclad guarantee that the price of medicines in this country would not go up as a result of the free trade agreement with the United States, particularly given the government's words when this process began some 5½ months ago. Time and time again we heard from senior ministers—the government repeatedly stated it—that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme was off the table. Now we have an agreement that includes the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, with no exemption provisions and certainly no ironclad guarantee that the prices will not increase. As far as social policy in this country is concerned, the government has betrayed the national interest by giving in to pressure from the Bush administration and from multinational corporations to allow the PBS, which is world's best practice, to be put into the free trade agreement and to be put at risk by companies seeking reviews and including their drugs on the list in what would appear to be a very secret way.</para><para>One of the things that needs to be highlighted, particularly with respect to the process of the Senate Select Committee on the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America, is the unwillingness of the Minister for Health and Ageing, Mr Abbott, to provide any advice or information to the committee about how the new working group and review mechanism will operate. Mr Abbott was so contemptible of the Senate that, in his own words, he would not `bow in worship' to a Senate committee. The Senate has been asked to carry out its job of scrutinising, analysing and reviewing government policy, but the government have not been independent in this process. They did not ask the Productivity Commission to conduct a national interest assessment. They went out the first time and got a consultant who told them what they wanted to hear. The second time, the consultant told them even better things than the first time around. So the community is justified in having concerns about the effects of the free trade agreement in the short, medium and long term. When you look at the way that the government have handled this issue and how they have withheld information about the working group and the review mechanism, Australians are right to ask how the agreement will work and whether or not it will push up the price of medicines in this country.</para><para>The Democrats note that the announcement is the latest secret and is a part of the clandestine way in which the FTA process is set to push up medicine costs, particularly for the sick and low-income earners in this country. But let us be clear about it: it is going to affect all Australians. The review decisions for the listing of drugs on the PBS will be conducted behind closed doors by a government appointed expert, and this process will be subject to whatever pressure the pharmaceutical industry may wish to apply. We do not believe for one moment that this is a transparent system that will deal with the widely held concerns that have been expressed during the Senate select committee hearings across the country and as part of general debate out there in the broader community. It is extremely likely that, if more expensive drugs are listed on the PBS as a result of this secret review process, the cost of the scheme to Australian taxpayers will rise. At some stage in the future, presuming that the United States would not want to see world's best practice replicated in other countries, I imagine they would oppose it at every stance. </para><para>An apparent conflict of interest also needs to be put on the record. The chief trade negotiator and the deputy chief trade negotiator from the United States, who sealed the trade deal with Australia, have both accepted plum jobs with multinational pharmaceutical companies representing medical companies in the United States. Both of them have gone on to great jobs as a result of the work that they have done on the free trade agreement. If nothing else, I think some answers are required from the Australian government about how this was allowed to transpire in the first place. One has to ask whether they were not only working in the fair interest of the United States but also being fair-minded and objective in the way that they dealt with Australia as a trading partner. It seems to me that it has come down to thinking about jobs that they may inherit as a result of being involved in this process. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>CONDOLENCES</title><type>Condolences</type><page.no>25369</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Jenkins, Hon.

Harry Jenkins's career spanned some of Labor's most tumultuous times. He joined the Labor Party in Victoria in 1955 at the time of the split, which certainly showed he had bottle. From 1958 to 1961 and from 1964 to 1968, he was a member of the Victorian central executive of the ALP—a ringside seat to that state party's self-destructive internal conflicts and external feuds. In 1961 he became the member for Reservoir in the Victorian Legislative Assembly, gaining a parliamentary as well as a machinery perspective on Victorian Labor's troubles.</para></talk.start><para>He became Labor's spokesman on health, but his leadership ambitions foundered on the rock of the parliamentary party's deep hostility to the state central executive. Harry contested the leadership against Clyde Holding in May 1967, but lost by what the <inline font-style="italic">Age </inline>newspaper reported as a clear majority. A central executive loyalist, Harry had no chance of overcoming the Victorian state parliamentary party's prejudices against him. As Gough Whitlam was struggling to reform the Victorian branch to restore its ability to compete electorally and contribute positively to Labor's federal fortunes, Harry Jenkins made the move to the federal parliament. He became the member for Scullin as part of Whitlam's class of 1969. Then, three years later, he was part of the first federal Labor government for 23 years.</para><para>Such a rapid change in political fortunes—from the dispiriting vista of a divided and electorally incompetent state party to the excitement of a new era in federal politics—few politicians experience. But Harry's roller-coaster ride was not over. In 1975 the government of which he was a part was dismissed—an event which Harry described as `the most disgusting and shocking thing he'd ever seen in politics'—in my view, a very fair and sound judgment. After 1975 two more dispiriting electoral defeats followed, until Labor's 1983 election victory when Harry became the first Speaker of the House of Representatives in the Hawke government.</para><para>As we have heard, Harry Jenkins was born in 1925 and grew up knowing first-hand the hardships that could confront workers and their families. His father, a storeman and packer, was on `rationed work' during the Depression and, in their Melbourne neighbourhood, having one week's work in two made him one of the lucky few. Harry got his first part-time job aged 11 and worked his way through secondary school and a science and then a medical degree at Melbourne University. He married his life-long partner, Hazel Winter, always known as Wendy, in 1951. His political views were shaped by his own early experience, but he did not become politically active until his thirties. </para><para>In 1961 he won the seat of Reservoir for Labor in the Victorian parliament and, suitably for a doctor, eventually became the state opposition spokesman on health. Like many of us, Harry was drawn to the Australian Labor Party by his belief in fairness and decency. The promise of hope and opportunity—hope and opportunity for all—that has drawn Australians to Labor for the past century was a promise Harry fervently believed in.</para><para>He made his greatest contribution to the federal parliamentary Labor Party and to the federal parliament in the last years of his career. He became caucus secretary in January 1976, and he was a very good one. His minutes were extensive and accurate. And this is a classic case of an MP's interests and community involvement fitting him to the role he played in caucus and in parliament because the great involvement Harry had in the Lions Club had given him years of experience in taking minutes and chairing meetings—skills he applied first as caucus secretary, then when he became chair of caucus in 1981, and then as Speaker of House of Representatives in 1983.</para><para>As Speaker, Harry Jenkins was fair and balanced. He gave notice when he assumed the office that, while a Labor man, he was not a government stooge. He told the House and the government, `The answers by ministers should not be totally irrelevant to the questions or be ministerial statements.'</para><para>As Speaker, Harry defended the dignity of the House where he felt it was genuinely under threat—cracking down on unparliamentary language and inappropriate clothing—but he was always aware of the need for parliament to be accessible as well as orderly. He discarded the old-fashioned wig and gown garb of the Speaker and he did not insist that MPs wear ties. Harry also saw the need for parliament to embrace new ways of reaching its constituents. His time as Speaker saw the rules governing the televising of parliament relax considerably, and he looked forward to the days of continual broadcasting of both the House of Representatives and the Senate—I am not sure that he spoke of the likely ratings of those broadcasts.</para><para>Harry was famously even tempered. He was willing to take action to suspend unruly MPs and once suspended the unruly Alan Cadman, as well as Wilson Tuckey and then Deputy Leader of the Opposition John Howard, all in one day. But on the whole, Harry did not throw his weight around. During one stormy sitting then Prime Minister Hawke tried to have action taken against opposition leader Andrew Peacock, pointing out to Harry that Peacock's comments had reflected badly on the Speaker. `My skin is thick enough to cop that,' Harry retorted.</para><para>That was not the only occasion on which Bob Hawke tried to direct Harry's rulings. On one occasion Harry found it necessary to remind Ralph Willis to make his answer relevant to the question he had been asked. `That's exactly what he's doing!' snapped Hawke. He was no more successful in steering the Speaker than before. `I'm quite capable of understanding plain English!' retorted the Speaker.</para><para>Of course that was not the only occasion on which Harry clashed with Bob Hawke. After the 1975 election, in which Labor did so very badly, there was some movement to prompt Hawke to come into the federal parliament, which of course would have required a newly elected or re-elected sitting member to resign from politics. The story goes that the future Prime Minister first approached Harry, already suffering the early effects of the motor neurone disease which took his life, and proposed that Harry retire to give Hawke the safe Labor seat of Scullin. In no uncertain terms, Harry refused. He told journalists that while he certainly thought Hawke would have `something to offer' if elected, `a Labor leader is not selected from outside the caucus and that's that'. Harry did not retire until 1986, and then it was his son, Harry Jenkins, who succeeded him in the seat of Scullin. Bob Hawke, of course, some years after Harry had refused to make way for him, became the member for Wills. </para><para>Harry's long career in the ALP, in state and federal parliaments, as Ambassador to Spain and in community work—which he listed as one of his two recreations for <inline font-style="italic">Who's Who—</inline>was supported by the devotion of his wife, Wendy, to whom he was in turn deeply devoted. Wendy was extremely active politically, and served her time on the Victorian state executive. For 53 years, Wendy and Harry were a team in all aspects of their lives. Today, our thoughts and sympathies are with Wendy in her grief and also with Wendy and Harry's children, Tim, Mark, Jane and our colleague in the House of Representatives, Harry Jenkins. Knowing the younger Harry Jenkins as we do, a Labor colleague in the lower house, this loss is more personally felt for many of us on this side of politics.</para><para>In his final speech to the House of Representatives, Harry quoted the words of Jim Scullin, the Labor Prime Minister whose name is given to the federal seat that Harry held and his son holds today:</para><quote><para>Justice and humanity demand interference whenever the weak are being crushed by the strong.</para></quote><para>Harry chose to end his parliamentary career with that statement of the ideals he had aspired to as a boy and young man and as a loyal member of the Australian Labor Party and a respected member of state and federal parliaments. In his long career, those ideals were most completely expressed in his dedication to the institutions of parliamentary democracy. Harry had great faith in the capacity of democratic institutions: in their capacity to bring about change, to deliver justice and to protect the vulnerable in our society. This was the foundation of his defence of those institutions, of his determined but never unreasonable commitment to the effective operation of parliament. And he served our parliament and our democracy well.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>25372</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>NATS</party><role>Leader of The Nationals in the Senate</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I join in supporting the condolence motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill, and supported by the Labor Party. I remember Dr Harry Jenkins when I first came into parliament. He was the Speaker and, although we did not have a lot to do with each other, I met him on a number of occasions. He was a man who obviously put a lot into the ALP, not only in his role as the Speaker but also in the Victorian Legislative Assembly from 1961 to 1969. He had a long haul in federal parliament and was the 18th Speaker of the House of Representatives. He is said by his friends and colleagues in the ALP to have had a great sense of humour and dignity. He was firm as a Speaker. Any position he held, he held well and he was respected by all. He also was the Australian Ambassador to Spain from 1986 to 1988. He leaves behind a wife and family. I wish them well in their grief. I acknowledge a stalwart of the Labor Party who gave most of his life to that cause.</para></talk.start><para>Question agreed to, honourable senators standing in their places.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Simon, Mr Barry Douglas</title><page.no>25373</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>25373</page.no><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is with deep regret that I inform the Senate of the death, on 7 July 2004, of Barry Douglas Simon, a former member of the House of Representatives for the division of McMillan, Victoria, from 1975 to 1980. </para></talk.start></speech></subdebate.1></debate><petition.group><petition.groupinfo><title>PETITIONS</title><page.no>25373</page.no></petition.groupinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1</name.id><name role="metadata">The Clerk</name><name role="display">The Clerk</name></talker><para>—Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows:</para></talk.start></interjection><petition><petitioninfo><title>East Timor: Oil and Gas Fields</title><page.no>25373</page.no><no.signed>11</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>5F4</name.id></name.ids><names><name>Senator Calvert</name></names></petitioninfo><quote><para>To the Honourable The President and Members of the Senate assembled in Parliament:</para><para>We the undersigned appeal to the Australian Government regarding its conduct of negotiations with the Government of Timor Leste on the maritime boundary between the two countries and sharing of the Timor Sea oil and gas revenue.</para><para>We pray the Senate ensures the Australian Government:</para><para>negotiates a fair and equitable maritime boundary with Timor Leste according to current international law and the provisions of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS),</para><para>responds to Timor Leste's request for more regular meetings to settle the maritime boundary dispute between the two countries within a more reasonable timeframe,</para><para>returns Australia to the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice and UNCLOS for the adjudication, of maritime boundary,</para><para>commits to hold intrust (escrow) revenues received from the disputed areas immediately outside the Joint.

However, a significant redevelopment of Kinetica to improve access quality for library users is being proposed by the NLA and was announced on 3 December 2003.This redevelopment process is consistent with longer-term objectives of improving end-user access to databases of electronic and print resources generally. While the redevelopment of Kinetica will provide improved access through a simple, easy to use search interface and other enhancements, many small and medium sized libraries will not be able to afford to provide access directly to their users as Kinetica will still operate on a cost recovery model. Kinetica charges will remain competitive compared to overseas alternatives such as OCLC.Australian Government support provided to the NLA fulfils an important leadership role in library sector.

Representatives from community organisations awarded grants also participate in a two-day practical preservation workshop where they receive training and advice to apply to their own collections.The 2003 grants mark a decade of helping Australian community organisations preserve cultural heritage collections (through the current program and its predecessor programs). In 2003 a record number of grants (50) and funding ($219,000) were approved. The program, currently administered by the NLA, has five Australian Government funding partners. In addition to the NLA, National Archives of Australia (NAA) and the DCITA, two recent additional funding partners include the Department of Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and the Australian Film Commission (AFC). However, from time to time program adjustments are appropriate. As with many similar programs designed to support regional community needs, the program focus is reconsidered periodically to ensure that the program framework remains responsive to the needs of its target group. Plans for 2004 are in progress.3b) The Australian Government, through DCITA and portfolio collecting agencies (NLA, NAA, National Gallery of Australia, National Museum of Australia and the AFC), is currently undertaking an examination of digital collection objectives, priorities and outcomes as part of the Review of Cultural Agencies.

The repository's content will expand to include metadata about all Australian higher degree theses. The ADT project is a very important part of the wider national Systematic Information Infrastructure projects which have been announced by Dr Nelson and are overseen by the Australian Research Information Infrastructure Committee (ARIIC).Other projects that will also underpin Australia's Research Information Infrastructure Framework are:Meta Access Management System Projects (MAMS): MAMS will provide an essential “middleware” component to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of Australia's higher education research information infrastructure. It will develop a new conceptual architecture capable of supporting multiple, independent models, and which is implemented locally within organisations, with the potential for inter-institutional communication. Towards an Australian Partnership for Sustainable Repositories (APSR): APSR will have an overall focus on the critical issues of the access, continuity and sustainability of digital collections. It will also build on a base of demonstrators for digital continuity and sustainability, embedded in developmental repository facilities within partner institutions. The Australian Research Repositories Online to the World (ARROW): ARROW will identify and test a software solution or solutions to support best practice institutional digital repositories comprising e-prints, digital theses and electronic publishing.

In May 2002 all funded projects were completed and the program was finalised. The Australian Government is further investigating the matter of e-accessibility in discussions between DCITA and the Office of Disability. The Office of Disability aims to ensure that society is inclusive of people with disabilities, their families and carers. The Office provides a direct link between the disability community and government, working towards improving access and encouraging the involvement of people with disabilities as members of the community. This is achieved through developing policies that respond to people with disabilities needs and their capacities for participation.

It is the Government's view that innovative and competitively priced broadband services are ultimately best provided by a sustainable market. Government's role is to encourage the development of the market to provide services to all Australians by maintaining a flexible pro-competitive regulatory regime and to assist with targeted funding and leadership.Building on the work of the Broadband Advisory Group and the findings of the Regional Telecommunications Inquiry, the Australian Government has launched a National Broadband Strategy, developed in consultation with all State and Territory governments, and is currently working with them on developing an Action Plan for the Strategy. The Australian Government has allocated significant funding to deliver improved broadband outcomes across Australia. As part of its commitment to the Action Plan the Australian Government has committed more than $140m of new funding to boost broadband access and take up.However, the Government does not support the Committee's recommendation. It is the Government's view that regulatory settings that promote the competitive supply of broadband services together with targeted funding initiatives are the appropriate means for facilitating the delivering of sustainable low cost broadband services to users.As part of its contribution to the Action Plan of the National Broadband Strategy the Australian Government has provided funding for the Coordinated Communications Infrastructure Fund and the establishment of Demand Aggregation Brokers. Both schemes are designed to facilitate greater access to broadband in a number of identified priority sectors including regional, rural and remote areas, communities and education. It is possible that connectivity in libraries could be included in projects funded under these programs. 7b) It is not envisaged that further funding will be allocated from the budget to the Strategy to specifically target broadband access in libraries. Projects that will expand broadband connectivity in libraries may also be included in state and regional based programs that will be incorporated in the Strategy Action Plan.</para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>8Noting the requirement that the Copyright Amendment (Digital Agenda) Act 2000 be reviewed after three years of operation, the Committee recommends that that review consider the Act's extension to digital material. </para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Not Agreed.</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>The Government is already addressing the question of legal deposit of digital material through other processes.

It is a report of great interest and great importance to the Australian community and certainly to the Australian Senate. It is appropriate that we do note it, given the importance of the issue, and indeed that we do debate its content. I will certainly seek leave to continue my remarks to keep it on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> if others do not wish to speak to it now.</para><para>There are the narrow components of this report, which are the details and the minutiae within it, and the broader component, which is the political context in which it operates right through to the global context of the war on Iraq. The Democrats' view on the war on Iraq is well known, strong and consistent. We firmly believed that it was the wrong approach to undertake a pre-emptive strike and invade Iraq when there was clearly no significant threat. Even on the information that was provided by the Prime Minister to this parliament and to the public prior to that war, it was hard to see how that constituted an immediate and significant threat to Australia. We nonetheless invaded that country. Despite all of the debate since that time, including the sorts of issues that are covered by the Flood report, I do not think we should forget the fundamental single fact that our Prime Minister signed Australia up to invading another country that was not threatening us. That, I think, was a very dangerous act—an unprecedented act in the history of our nation, I would suggest. It was undertaken against the views of the majority of the Senate, which again I think is unprecedented in our nation's history. On top of all that we are now all aware that even the information that the Prime Minister presented prior to the war was clearly enormously flawed, leading in part to the report that we are debating here today.</para><para>Probably the one component of greatest concern to me, on top of all that I have outlined, is that not only did our Prime Minister decide to sign Australia up to invading another country that was no threat to us but he has since said that even with all the information in this report—even with the specific statements that some of the intelligence provided was not accurate, sketchy, thin or inadequate; even with what we now know of all the failings of the intelligence from the US and the UK; even though it is now firmly established beyond the tiniest skerrick of a doubt that there was absolutely no threat—he would do the same thing, even knowing what he knows now. That single statement alone is enough, from my point of view, to say that he should not be able to retain the power and the responsibility of being able to determine whether or not to send Australians to war, because he clearly has not got the ability to make the right judgments on such a fundamental issue. There are few things more significant than sending Australian men and women overseas, putting their lives at risk and engaging in armed conflict. To do so in such a cavalier manner and say that you would still do the same thing again is an absolute disgrace. </para><para>That bottom line has to be put every time we talk about the issues surrounding the conflict in Iraq, before we get into some of the narrower issues that are dealt with in the Flood report. The Democrats, as with many people, were sceptical about the adequacy of this report, because we felt it was narrow in its terms of reference and, in effect, internal. It was not fully independent and it was certainly not fully public. That is one of the reasons why it is not as comprehensive or fulsome as it should be. It does not compare well with what has been done in the United States and the United Kingdom. Both those countries, despite their culpability as well in the invasion of Iraq, have at least had far more comprehensive examinations of the issues surrounding the decisions prior to going to war and the issues surrounding the information that was provided by the government to their people and by the intelligence agencies to the government. We have not had that here in Australia. It is another example of our government and our Prime Minister having even greater contempt for the truth and greater contempt for honesty with the Australian people than even President Bush and Prime Minister Blair. That is a pretty big call, but the lack of decent process in Australia after the war reaffirms that we have had an even less adequate examination of the issues than the UK and the US public and parliaments have received. That is grossly unacceptable.</para><para>Despite my criticisms of this report, which I made publicly at the time and I do not propose to repeat here in detail, there are some components that I think need to be acknowledged. Firstly, a point which I certainly agree with—I think others have also emphasised it in recent times, even before the Iraq invasion—is the nature and importance of intelligence. Whilst I will remain critical about this Prime Minister's refusal to have a decent, open, proper, broad, independent inquiry, I do acknowledge that, by its definition, intelligence requires some degree of secrecy. Otherwise it defeats the purpose. Senator Ray has made this point a few times in the past. You cannot have an intelligence agency operating with absolute transparent scrutiny. Otherwise, obviously, they will not be able to do their job. It requires a balancing act. I believe that, particularly in this circumstance, where we have an unprecedented action by our government in invading a country that was not a threat and we have widespread information coming out subsequently of incorrect intelligence or the incorrect provision of information by the government to the parliament, that warrants a fair degree of openness, because public confidence in the effectiveness of our intelligent agencies is very important.</para><para>At the same time, whilst I do not wish to undermine that confidence, unless the agencies earn it and deserve it then you cannot continually spout a line that they are fully effective. You cannot do so when they are not. That is part of the concern expressed in statements by people like Lieutenant Colonel Collins, among others. When people in the know and on the inside say that there are major problems we have to stand up and take notice. </para><para>This report recommended extra resources for ONA. I am on the record, and have been for some time, as saying that we should be giving extra resources to our intelligence agencies. As this report notes, intelligence is probably more important in a defence and security sense for Australia than it has been at any time since the Second World War. Our intelligence agencies need to be resourced properly, and we need to look at whether to rearrange our prioritisation of funding in the defence and security area to perhaps give more resourcing to intelligence away from some of the more traditional areas. There is no point in doing that if your intelligence agencies are not operating effectively. You are just throwing good money after bad and creating a false sense of security if that is not there.</para><para>We are talking about the security and safety of Australians. It is not a political point scoring exercise; it is about ensuring that we can be confident. That is why the inability of this parliament and the public to trust what this government and this Prime Minister say is so serious. It puts all of the officers who work so hard in intelligence agencies—sometimes in very dangerous circumstances—in a position where their integrity is compromised and, once again, where they are likely to be used as pawns or scapegoats whenever the government gets into trouble.</para><para>One other recommendation I would briefly like to point to is the recommendation to expand the mandate of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD to cover other agencies. I would support that but I would also signal that I think it is time—in fact, it is well past time—to expand not only the mandate but also the membership of the committee. I think there are currently seven members, and they are solely Liberal Party and Labor Party members. I mean no offence to the people that are on it, but the situation is now such that it should have other parliamentarians from the crossbenches in the Senate or even the Independents in the House of Representatives to ensure that there is a wider degree of representation on such a fundamental committee.</para><para>I also note the recommendation that the Director of DIO, the Defence Intelligence Organisation, should be appointed on merit through a competitive selection process. That, of course, is a principle the Democrats have pursued in this chamber many times in a range of areas. It would be wonderful to see that initiative taken even in the one area of the appointment of the director of that important organisation. The fact that there is a need for a recommendation to do that clearly shows that we need to demonstrate that appointments to these important offices are done on merit, not on the basis of political favouritism or any other backroom arrangement. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>25393</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I rise to speak briefly on the same matter. I only want to make a few comments on this, because this is not the time for a full response to the Flood report. Senator Bartlett has made a few points. One of the last ones he made is that the DIO head should be appointed on merit, and he mentioned political favouritism. That is not the problem. The problem is military rotation, Senator Bartlett, where each service is supposed to have a shot at the title, so you go from Army to Air Force to Navy, irrespective of the quality of the candidates. One of the problems of DIO is that it has had some of the finest brains ever at its head—people like John Baker, people like John Hartley—yet I know on other occasions it has had people allocated to it who are not interested in that area and are just looking forward to the following posting. I think that is what Philip Flood was getting at. I do not think he was arguing that there was political favouritism or patronage involved. You should not necessarily rotate it through the three uniform services because it is their turn; you should go on quality and on merit, and on that I support him. </para></talk.start><para>Senator Bartlett talks about the size of the committee. There is a recommendation in this report to lift it to nine. That does not give much solace to Senator Bartlett yet, because the current act—and, of course, it is open to change—says that membership of the committee should be proportionate to numbers in the parliament. If I might explain it to Senator Bartlett, that is the sort of proportional representation that you have argued for everywhere else but on this occasion. To get your proportion up, you have to have about 22 Independents, Greens and Democrats. When that occurs, there will be representation for the smaller groups in the parliament.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator Bartlett</name></talker><para>—Seventeen—we are getting close.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>—If you get close to 22 after the next federal election, Senator Bartlett, I will give up hot meals for a whole week.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>—Close to nine, in their case.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>—Exactly. However, I also understand there is a problem here. If other parties think they are excluded from the process they will resent it, so I am not sure how to resolve the question of how we protect the rights of minorities yet have a normal and proper representation. It is true to say that in this place quite often minority groups get a higher representation than major parties on certain committees and other bodies. That is an inevitable recognition not of representation but of power. How we address that in this context I am not sure.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I think there is much of value in the Flood report, but I am not going to go into the details and respond to each of the recommendations. I was pleased to see the widening of the brief of the parliamentary scrutiny committee; I think that is essential. My biggest disappointment with the Flood report was the Prime Minister's reaction to it. I watched his press conference live on Sky. What was the first and biggest point the Prime Minister made? He puffed himself up and said: `See, I told you so. We are cleared of putting political pressure on intelligence agencies to provide us with the intelligence that we wanted.' What a wonderful knock down of a straw man that was. That was not an accusation I or other people in the Labor Party have ever made. In any event, the parliamentary committee cleared the Prime Minister of that charge some months before. This was no longer a major concern out there in the Australian community.</para><para>The concern was this: that the agencies got their intelligence wrong. I accept that intelligence agencies, because of the very nature of the material they deal in, will make mistakes. Of course they will make mistakes. What we are interested in coming out of the Flood inquiry is that they will make fewer mistakes in the future, that there will be proper resources devoted to them and that there will be proper analyses and proper judgments. We are not worried about a witch-hunt or about what happened in the past; we are worried about what happens in the future. If we have to commit Australian troops or Australian resources, we want to know that it will be done on a solid basis. We want to know that the intelligence will be relatively accurate or as accurate as you can expect.</para><para>But all that the government were concerned about was getting a political clearance. They wanted a tick to say that they had not interfered with the intelligence. I could have told them that. They did not need the Flood inquiry to tell them that. That then left the government in a position of political response throughout. They were more interested in getting up the right political spin than in finding out what went wrong. The real problem is the lack of vigour, the lack of an intellectual approach by ministers, in trying to find out what went wrong. We had the Butler report, we had the US Senate report and we had reports before those and before the Flood report all pointing to failures of intelligence agencies. In some cases, overseas in the UK and in the US, they wanted to know what went wrong. Here in Australia all that the government wanted to do was get a not guilty verdict. They have a higher responsibility in these areas to drive, to supervise, to energise the agencies to a higher performance, yet all they do is stand back. </para><para>I wonder how many of you followed Mr Downer's performance in July. He basically became a full-time critic of the Labor Party, not a foreign minister. Every night or every second night he was on <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline> or the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline> commenting on the Labor Party. He only took time off to go back and become foreign minister when he insulted Spain and the Philippines on the way through. This just is not good enough. We want ministers who are entrusted with these agencies to get in there and drive them, and I hope the Flood report stimulates them to do so. I am not saying they should be full-time supervisors on a day-to-day basis, but they have to think of the national interest just a little more than their own self-interest when it comes to intelligence matters. Flood very early on, in his diplomatic tones, hinted that governments should not use intelligence reports to publicly justify their political decision making. I could not agree more because that exposes the agencies to charges of political influence, that misuses intelligence and, when it all comes unstuck, that rebounds on the intelligence agencies.</para><para>In any event, I think the Flood report will advance the cause in this area. I am pleased the government have said they will accept all recommendations other than a change of name for the ONA. I am on side with the government on that. I do not see why we should spend $180,000 changing a letterhead just to have a different name. We could have employed a consultant for $300,000 to give us that recommendation. To accept the rest of the recommendations I think is good. I am sure the Labor Party will back the government on that, as will most senators in this chamber. It is clear that the ONA needs more resources. It is clear that the DIO needs to concentrate strictly on the military area. It is also clear that we need far more substantial parliamentary oversight in these areas in the 21st century.

Some weeks later a document was tabled in the House of Representatives which was claimed to be an internal Telstra briefing about the state of the network. On the basis of apparent contradictions between the evidence and the briefing, Senator Mackay raised this as a matter of privilege and the President granted it precedence.</para><para>The committee received further material from Senator Mackay and provided details of allegations to the Telstra officers concerned, who submitted a joint response to the committee.

In accordance with its usual practice, the committee provided a copy of the response to Senator Mackay and invited further comment.</para><para>Having received further comment and having analysed all of the material before it, the committee applied the criteria in privilege resolution 3, which, amongst other things, requires that it takes into account whether a person who committed an act which may be a contempt did so knowingly.

Some time ago, after investigating a number of these cases, the committee arranged for a reminder to be given to witnesses appearing before Senate committees and joint committees administered by the Senate that false or misleading evidence may constitute a contempt of the Senate. Concerned at the apparently widespread ignorance of parliamentary privilege within the Public Service, the committee recommended, and the Senate resolved, that senior public servants should study parliamentary principles to avoid committing offences through ignorance. The committee included a requirement of all departments and agencies to report on their compliance with the resolution. The committee reported on the outcome of the resolution in its 89th report.</para><para>In concluding its examination of this case the Committee of Privileges is recommending that Telstra, an organisation that appears frequently before Senate committees, be required to report to the Senate on measures it has taken to ensure that its senior officers are appropriately trained in their obligations to parliament.

catch and prosecute serious criminals. </para><para>One important tool is the use of surveillance devices which could be anything from a hidden microphone to an ordinary video camera.</para><para>Today, however, the powers available to Commonwealth law enforcement to use such devices lag sadly behind what the technology makes possible and what other jurisdictions permit.</para><para>This Bill began as an initiative of the Leaders' Summit on Terrorism and Multi-Jurisdictional Crime held on 5 April 2002. </para><para>A Joint Working Group of Commonwealth and State and Territory officials was established by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and the Australasian Police Ministers' Council. </para><para>The Joint Working Group developed comprehensive model laws for all Australian jurisdictions to improve the effectiveness of cross-border criminal investigations in the areas of controlled operations, assumed identities, protection of witness identity and electronic surveillance.</para><para>These model laws were released in a public discussion paper to solicit feedback from groups and individuals on the suitability of these proposed powers.</para><para>The Surveillance Devices Bill [No. 2] 2004 (the Bill) implements the electronic surveillance model Bill, tailoring it to the needs of the Commonwealth. </para><para>This Bill differs in a number of respects from the Surveillance Devices Bill [No.1] 2004 which is currently before the Parliament and is being introduced for the purposes of expediency so as to ensure that this important legislation is passed before the Winter recess.</para><para>The Bill will consolidate, expand and modernise the now somewhat outdated surveillance device powers available to the Commonwealth and provide law enforcement agencies with access to the surveillance tools necessary to protect Australians and to investigate and stop crime. </para><para>The Bill allows law enforcement officers of the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Crime Commission or a State or Territory police force or other specified agencies investigating a Commonwealth offence to use a greater range of surveillance devices including data surveillance devices, optical surveillance devices and tracking devices.</para><para>The Bill also allows for a surveillance device warrant or authorisation to be issued in relation to a wider range of offences. </para><para>Surveillance device warrants may be issued under this Bill, where a child recovery order has been issued by the Family Court to assist with the location and safe recovery of any child who is subject to an order.</para><para>The Bill also permits emergency authorisations to be given by a senior executive officer of the law enforcement agency to a law enforcement officer for the use of a surveillance device in circumstances that are characterised by urgency. </para><para>The Bill provides for three such situations: where there is an imminent threat of serious risk to a person or substantial damage to property, to recover a child the subject of a recovery order and where there is a risk of the loss of evidence in relation to important specified Commonwealth offences, including terrorism, serious drug offences, treason, espionage and aggravated people smuggling. </para><para>In recognition of the privacy implications of this Bill, the Bill imposes a range of strong accountability measures. </para><para>The most intrusive types of surveillance must be subject to the scrutiny of a judge or AAT member before the surveillance begins, or, in the case of an emergency authorisation, shortly after the authorisation has been given.</para><para>The subsequent use, disclosure or communication of material gathered by, or relating to, a surveillance device is subject to stringent restrictions.</para><para>Record-keeping requirements ensure that documents relevant to surveillance devices must be kept to establish compliance with the law.</para><para>Chief Officers of law enforcement agencies using Commonwealth warrants and authorisations must submit detailed reports, both after a warrant or authorisation has expired and also annually.</para><para>The Bill also imposes a duty on the Chief Officers to destroy surveillance device material when it is not longer relevant to one of the permitted purposes in the Bill.</para><para>The role of the Commonwealth Ombudsman as an oversight body is reinforced by this Bill. The Ombudsman must report on a six-monthly basis to the Attorney-General who in turn must table these reports in Parliament. </para><para>Importantly, the Ombudsman has the power to compel law enforcement officers to answer questions or produce relevant documents.</para><para>This Bill will greatly increase the capacity of Australian law enforcement agencies to investigate serious offences, including terrorism, while maintaining an appropriate respect for the privacy of all Australians.</para><para>This Bill differs from the Surveillance Devices Bill (No.1) 2004 in a number of important ways.</para></quote><para>	First, the Bill provides for the inclusion of State law enforcement agencies, such as the New South Wales Crime Commission and the Western Australian Corruption and Crime Commission, in addition to State and Territory police forces who may obtain Commonwealth Surveillance Device warrants for the investigation of Commonwealth offences.</para><para>	Second, the Bill implements 3 of the recommendations of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee report to provide: </para><para>-	for a requirement that surveillance device material held for more than 5 years be destroyed unless the Chief Officer certifies that it is still needed for a permitted purpose;</para><para>-	that the period before which an emergency authorisation must be brought before a Judge or AAT member for approval be reduced from `two business days' to `48 hours'; and</para><para>-	for a new civil remedies provision which allows those who have suffered loss or injury as a result of illegal use of a surveillance device by the AFP or ACC to sue the Commonwealth;</para><para>	Third, the Bill allows the Queensland Public Interest Monitor to have a role with respect to Commonwealth warrants that is consistent with its role regarding State warrants.</para><para>	The Bill also allows non-law enforcement officers to record conversations to which they are a party under the direction of a law enforcement officer. This means that an informant may wear a `wire' during a controlled operation. </para><para>	Importantly, the Bill allows for a recovery order issued by a Court other than the Family Court or with respect to a child removed from another country to be the basis for a warrant or authorisation and adds Child Sex Tourism Offences as offences for which a `loss of evidence' Emergency Authorisation may be obtained.</para><para>	Finally, the Bill includes provisions designed to clarify and refine the operation of the Surveillance Device regime by:</para><para>-	allowing for the substitution of an officer primarily responsible for the execution of a warrant or authorisation; </para><para>-	making the definition of `state offence with a Federal aspect' consistent with other legislation;</para><para>-	improving the operation of tracking device authorisations; </para><para>-	marginally changing the definition of `appropriate consenting official' to make extra-territorial use of surveillance devices more feasible; </para><para>-	allowing the Commonwealth Ombudsman to delegate to equivalent State bodies which are not actually Ombudsmen; and</para><para>-	giving the Commonwealth Ombudsman responsibility for the oversight of all ACC SD use, under either Commonwealth or State law;</para><quote><para>I urge that this Bill be passed as a matter of priority so that these important investigative tools are made available to law enforcement as soon as possible.</para></quote><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mackay</inline>) adjourned.</para><para>Ordered that the resumption of the debate be made an order of the day for a later hour of the day.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>TEXTILE, CLOTHING AND FOOTWEAR STRATEGIC INVESTMENT PROGRAM AMENDMENT (POST-2005 SCHEME) BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>25399</page.no><id.no>R2073</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT (TEXTILE, CLOTHING AND FOOTWEAR POST-2005 ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R2072</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>25399</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bills received from the House of Representatives.</para><para>Senator MINCHIN (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Administration) (4.29 p.m.)—I move:</para><motion><para>That these bills may proceed without formalities, may be taken together and be now read a first time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bills read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>25400</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>25400</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move: </para></talk.start><motion><para>That these bills be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>I seek leave to have the second reading speeches incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speeches read as follows—</inline></para><para><inline ref="R2073">TEXTILE, CLOTHING AND FOOTWEAR STRATEGIC INVESTMENT PROGRAM AMENDMENT (POST-2005 SCHEME) BILL 2004</inline></para><quote><para>The purpose of the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Amendment (Post 2005 scheme) Bill 2004 is to extend the Textile, Clothing and Footwear (TCF) Strategic Investment Program (SIP) for another ten years and to establish the TCF Small Business Program.</para><para>The Strategic Investment Program is the centrepiece of the Government's strategy for the TCF industry for the next decade. As announced on 27 November 2003, the Government proposes generous long-term assistance for the industry worth $747 million. The Government's package includes:</para></quote><para>	$575 million for extending TCF SIP;</para><para>	$25 million for a ten year TCF small business program;</para><para>	$50 million over ten years for a product diversification scheme;</para><para>	$20 million for a supply chain efficiency program from 2010 to 2015;</para><para>	$27 million for extending the Expanded Overseas Assembly Provisions scheme for a further five years; and</para><para>	$50 million for a ten year structural adjustment program to assist both displaced workers and encourage industry restructuring. </para><quote><para>By setting policy in place for a decade, the Government has given the industry long-term certainty to encourage investment and innovation.</para><para>A gradual reduction of TCF tariffs is integral to this package. As tariffs impose substantial costs on Australian families, and are ineffective as protection for local industry, the Government will lower tariffs in two steps over ten years. Two 5 year tariffs pauses are contained in the Customs Tariff Amendment (TCF Post-2005 Arrangements) Bill 2004. </para><para>The Government's policy was developed after 12 months of consultation. This consultation confirmed the Government's view that support must be focused on activities which will make a lasting difference and weighted towards firms in the sector facing the greatest adjustment.</para><para>The package is supported by peak bodies, such as Textiles and Fashion Industries Australia and the Carpet Institute of Australia, and leading companies. </para><para>The new Strategic Investment Program will be broadened and simplified. The current five grants will be reduced to two. New activities, such as brand support and non-production information technology, will be supported. With these changes, more firms can be expected to use SIP. Firms receiving support already account for 75 per cent of industry value-add and 63 per cent of jobs. </para><para>The subsidies offered in the new program are the most generous available to any industry. For the first five years, funding for SIP will continue at the current level of expenditure, that is about $100 million a year. Funding after 2010 will be limited to those firms still to face a tariff adjustment, namely firms manufacturing clothing and certain finished textile products. $100 million will be available to this section of the industry after 2010.</para><para>For small TCF firms which may not meet the $200,000 threshold for SIP claims, a new $25 million TCF Small Business Program will be available.</para><para>The Government will introduce a Product Diversification Scheme as an incentive for firms to increase their local production as well as to diversify their product range. </para><para>The Government has already extended for 5 years the Expanded Overseas Assembly Provisions scheme. </para><para>As clothing and certain finished textile manufacturers will face a tariff reduction in 2015, the Government will provide a $20 million Supply Chain Program to support major capital investments strengthening the local supply chain. The program will be open to manufacturers of clothing and certain finished textile products (and their related textile suppliers) who would otherwise not receive benefits under the Post-2005 SIP.  </para><para>In all, by the time the Government's plan expires in 2015, the sector will have received about $1.3 billion in direct assistance (and about $13 billion indirectly through tariff protection). </para><para>It is essential to recognise that TCF tariffs cost the community up to $1 billion a year, disproportionately affecting low income households. The 2.1 million Australians living in households earning less than $301 per week spend twice as much of their income on clothing as other families.</para><para>For its part, the industry is clear that firms benefit far more from direct financial support for innovation and investment than through tariffs. Tariffs do not make uncompetitive firms viable. Tariffs do not assist companies to invest or innovate. Tariffs provide just a flimsy margin of protection which can be easily erased by movements in the exchange rate. </para><para>For these reasons, the Government believes that TCF tariffs should be reduced to the general manufacturing rate. Consistent with the Government's 1998 decision, tariff reductions will be staggered to allow industry time to adjust. TCF tariffs will be paused at their 2005 rates for 5 years, and then the majority of TCF tariffs will be reduced to 5 per cent on 1 January 2010. The exceptions to this rule will be clothing and certain finished textile articles which will be reduced to 10 per cent on 1 January 2010, held at this level for 5 years and then reduced to 5 per cent on 1 January 2015. </para><para>To ease the impact of restructuring in the industry, the Government will establish a $50 million Structural Adjustment program. The program will assist retrenched TCF employees find new employment, assist TCF firms to consolidate into more viable businesses and, where necessary, support communities adjusting to the loss of employment in the sector. </para><para>The Government has taken a balanced approach in developing its policy. The policy assists firms to become more competitive by providing incentives to invest, innovate and diverse their product range; it reduces tariffs in a measured way which the industry can absorb; it will reduce the price of TCF goods over the long term; and it assists employees who might be affected by restructuring.</para><para>The Government's TCF plan is backed by ample funding. By any benchmark, $747 million is a significant amount of taxpayers' money. With the sole exception of the much larger automotive industry, the TCF sector receives far more assistance than any other part of the manufacturing sector and this support will continue for the next decade. </para></quote><para>—————</para><para><inline ref="R2072">CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT (TEXTILE, CLOTHING AND FOOTWEAR POST-2005 ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2004</inline></para><quote><para>The Customs Tariff Amendment (Textile, Clothing and Footwear Post-2005 Arrangements) Bill 2004 contains amendments to the <inline font-style="italic">Customs Tariff Act 1995</inline>. </para><para>Those amendments are complementary to the amendments contained in the<inline font-style="italic"></inline>Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Amendment </para><para>(Post- 2005 scheme) Bill 2004.

Under the current industrial relations system there is no review or appeal process to reconsider the merits of Test Case decisions made by a Full Bench of the AIRC. The Government strongly believes it is Parliament's responsibility to use its legislative power and authority to shield small businesses from the AIRC decision.</para><para>If this Bill is not passed, the vast majority of small businesses covered by federal awards will eventually be subject to redundancy payments for their employees in accordance with the AIRC's decision. If this Bill is not passed, small businesses that are constitutional corporations and that are covered by State awards will become subject to redundancy payments if the AIRC decision flows to State jurisdictions. </para><para>The Bill has three effects. First, it will remove redundancy pay for small businesses with fewer than 15 employees from the jurisdiction of the AIRC.</para><para>Second, it will cancel the effect of any variations that were made by the AIRC to awards from the time of the decision until the legislation commences. It will not, however, affect any redundancy pay provisions that were in awards prior to the AIRC's decision. It will also not affect any actual entitlement that arises before the legislation commences. The Government's objective is not to take away something that employees already have.</para><para>And third, the Bill will prevent flow-on of the AIRC's decision to small businesses that are constitutional corporations and that are covered by State awards. </para><para>The Government will also work to protect small businesses that are not constitutional corporations and that are covered by State awards from any flow-on of the AIRC's decision. The Government will seek to intervene in any relevant proceedings before State workplace relations tribunals to oppose any flow on, and will call on State governments to legislate to maintain the exemption of small businesses from redundancy pay.</para><para>It is vital that opportunities for continued growth and job creation for the 1.1 million non-agricultural small businesses in Australia be maximised. It is even more essential for the 3.3 million people employed by these businesses. This is nearly half of private sector, non-agricultural employment.</para><para>Small businesses are central to employment and economic prosperity in Australia. The small business sector has made a significantly larger contribution to employment growth over the last eight years than big business. </para><para>The small business sector is performing very well—it is very much the engine room of the continued growth and strength that our economy is enjoying. And without doubt many small businesses are profitable. </para><para>But we can't afford to confuse this profitability with an ability to make redundancy payments. Small businesses tend to be chronically undercapitalised and in general don't have the financial resources to cope with large, unpredicted commitments such as redundancy payments. Small businesses are twice as likely as larger businesses to go out of business in the earlier years of operation. Even after 15 years of operation they are still 1.7 times more likely to cease than larger businesses.</para><para>In the Government's view, the AIRC's decision seriously underestimates the impact that redundancy pay would have on small businesses. For instance, a typical retail small business with seven employees, each with six years continuous employment, would now face a contingent liability for redundancy pay of nearly $30,000.</para><para>An obligation on small businesses to make redundancy payments will result in a cost impost that is unaffordable for many small businesses. The end result will of course be a significant decline in job growth in the small business sector and likely small business insolvencies. Clearly, employees of small businesses will not gain anything from the AIRC decision if they no longer have a job to go to.</para><para>The undesirability of removing the small business exemption is widely recognised. None of the four State governments that participated in the AIRC test case supported the removal of the exemption—the Queensland and Western Australian governments opposed the removal, while the NSW and Victorian governments neither supported nor opposed it.</para><para>The Queensland Industrial Relations Commission recently agreed that small businesses are in a more financially constrained and precarious position compared to larger business. The Queensland Commission unanimously decided that the exemption for small business from redundancy pay obligations under the Queensland workplace relations system ought to remain in place. The Queensland Commission concluded that many small businesses operate in marginal circumstances and that their lack of financial resilience had not changed since 1994 when the New South Wales Industrial Commission also reaffirmed the need for the small business exemption.</para><para>The Queensland Commission also accepted that small businesses would generally have smaller cash reserves to meet redundancy pay requirements and that redundancies occurring would represent a greater proportion of the overall labour costs of the business. </para><para>In short, the Queensland Commission found that to impose redundancy pay obligations on small businesses had “the very real potential to result in the insolvency of a number of small businesses”.</para><para>This Government agrees with the conclusions of the Queensland Commission. We think it is imperative that the small business sector continue to be supported and encouraged to further grow and create new jobs for our economy and for all Australians. This legislation will lift the additional cost burden imposed by the AIRC's decision from small businesses.</para><para>Of course, we are not saying that by introducing this legislation small businesses can't reach agreement with their employees to make redundancy payments where they can afford it and where it is a priority for employees. </para><para>The Government has a strong history of encouraging employers and employees to reach agreement on a wide range of issues at the workplace. In our view, this is preferable to imposing an “across the board” obligation on small businesses which cannot afford redundancy pay. </para><para>In introducing this Bill the Government is demonstrating its ongoing commitment to the small business sector and its recognition of the vital and essential role it plays in ensuring Australia has a strong, thriving economy capable of employing all those who want jobs. </para><para>—————</para><para><inline ref="R2107">ANTI-TERRORISM BILL (No. 2) 2004</inline></para><quote><para>This is a Bill that continues the extensive work already done in improving Australia's counter-terrorism laws.  </para><para>They build upon legislation enacted since 11 September 2001 that allows us to more effectively provide for the safety of all Australians, here and abroad, insofar as legislation can achieve that end.</para><para>This package highlights the Australian Government's commitment to continuous review and modification of the law to meet new challenges as they arise. </para><para>In creating these laws, the Government is striving towards the twin goals of security and justice. </para><para>We do not assume that protecting national security is opposed to protecting our civil rights, particularly the most fundamental right of all—the right to human security.</para><para>The achievement of these goals should not be seen as separate ideals.</para><para>The measures contained in this Bill will have a real practical impact and are necessary.</para><para>The Bill updates the Criminal Code to improve our terrorism offence regime.</para><para>The amendments make it an offence to intentionally associate with a person who is a member or who promotes or directs the activities of a listed terrorist organisation where that association provides support that would help the terrorist organisation to continue to exist or to expand.</para><para>Unlike the offence provisions in Division 101 of the Criminal Code, this offence does not require proof of a connection with a terrorist act. </para><para>The new offence of “Associating with Terrorist Organisations” is aimed at the fundamental unacceptability of terrorist organisations as entities by making a wider range of activity which supports the existence or expansion of such organisations illegal.</para><para>The offence is directed at people who cannot be proved to be directors, members, recruiters, trainers, or financiers of a terrorist organisation under existing offences. </para><para>Under the new offence, what must be proved is that the person communicates or meets directors, members or promoters of a listed terrorist organisation and in doing so provides support intended to assist the expansion or continued existence of the organisation. </para><para>The maximum penalty of 3 years imprisonment is lower because such people are not necessarily directly involved in terrorist acts.</para><para>A wide range of exceptions are provided for in relation to associations with `close family members' and associations for the purpose of religious worship the provision of humanitarian aid and the provision of legal advice in connection with criminal proceedings or proceedings in relation to the listing of terrorist organisations.</para><para>Significantly, an exception is also provided to exclude the application of the offence where it would infringe any constitutional doctrine of implied freedom of political communication. </para><para>Australia's response to the terrorist attack in Bali was a very effective blow against terrorist activity in our region. </para><para>Capturing and convicting terrorists is not the end of the story. </para><para>Once a person is in custody for an offence, that person can raise security issues for the correctional facility in which they are detained. </para><para>In some cases it may be necessary to move the person to another part of the country for security reasons. </para><para>Under existing arrangements, it is only possible to transfer a prisoner to another State for trial or welfare reasons.  </para><para>The Bill provides a legislative basis for the transfer of prisoners between States for security reasons. </para><para>The provisions would be used only where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the transfer is necessary in the interests of security. </para><para>`Security' has the same definition as in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979. </para><para>Persons transferred for security reasons will be the subject of a security transfer order.

was making the point that a number of witnesses to our inquiry raised the issue of whether or not the bilateral free trade agreement with the United States would undermine our capacity to successfully negotiate multilateral trade arrangements in the future. I posed two questions: does the negotiation of this free trade agreement with the United States—and others with Singapore and Thailand—help or hinder our position within the current round of WTO multilateral trade negotiations; and what would be the impact of this agreement on Australia's position in the Cairns Group of fair trading agricultural exporting economies? I am proud to say that the Cairns Group was formed when I was working at the National Farmers Federation, which has always been a very strong supporter of the Cairns Group.</para></talk.start><para>This was a very interesting academic debate and one that I was pleased to take part in, but by far the most compelling evidence presented to the committee came not from academics or theorists but from those with direct experience at the coalface of international trade negotiations. Mr Bruce Gosper, First Assistant Secretary of Australia's Office of Trade Negotiations, told the committee:</para><quote><para>I cannot think off the top of my head of any Cairns Group member that is not part of a preferential trade arrangement or negotiating one—most of them are negotiating several. The Cairns Group continues to operate very effectively. It had a very successful meeting in February this year in Costa Rica at which this issue was not raised, either directly or indirectly.</para></quote><para>The highly respected trade analyst Mr Alan Oxley, who has extensive experience in international trade negotiations, provided another compelling statement to the committee in response to a question from Senator Cook. He said: </para><quote><para>You asked ... what would be the downside for Australia if we rejected the agreement. We would probably be regarded as the most bizarre country in the world for having rejected a free trade agreement with the world's biggest economy—an agreement that would actually give us access in agriculture, which is one of the most difficult areas, notwithstanding the fact that it is not perfect—when many other countries are lining up to have an agreement with them. I honestly do not know how any serious Australian government could justify that to the world at large.</para></quote><para>Mr Peter Corish, the president of the National Farmers Federation, told the committee:</para><quote><para>As I said in my opening comments, we have not seen any evidence of a negative reaction to either the reputation or the credibility of the Cairns Group or to Australia's general credibility and reputation in the WTO process. I say that because, since the conclusion of the FTA negotiations, there has been a Cairns Group ministerial meeting also attended by a number of Cairns Group farm leaders in Costa Rica. Certainly no negative comments were made to any of our farm leaders there nor, as we understand it, to the ministerial group about our negotiated agreement between Australia and the United States.</para></quote><para>There we have it: three highly respected individuals representing specific areas of expertise commenting positively on the operation of a bilateral agreement in relation to criticism about multilateral arrangements and how they might be affected by the signing of this agreement.</para><para>I turn to quarantine, an issue which was very significant in the inquiry carried out by the Senate committee and the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. There were some quite irresponsible assertions presented to the committee which claimed that in some way Australia's strict science-based quarantine system would be compromised by the agreement. Having thoroughly examined these assertions, I can clearly and unambiguously inform the Senate that it is now clear that they were nothing more than that—simply assertions. They were not based on fact, and they were not supported by any empirical evidence.</para><para>On this issue, Ms Virginia Greville, Special International Agricultural Adviser from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, told the committee on May 18:</para><quote><para>The best evidence is the text that has been negotiated. It explicitly preserves and protects the quarantine processes of each jurisdiction. Our import risk analysis process is well documented and, as you know, transparent and challengeable at a variety of points along the way.</para></quote><para>Mr Acting Deputy President Cherry, I think that you and I—as members of the Senate committee that is hearing some of these challenges for apples, bananas and pork—can attest to that transparent and contestable process. Ms Greville went on to say:</para><motion><para>That has been explicitly preserved, as has the US's system, and all that the text deals with is enhanced technical cooperation and exchange during that process ... At no point have we changed the outcome, sped up or fast-tracked any IRA process ... </para></motion><para>I thank Ms Greville for her quite substantial expertise that was made available to the committee during its inquiry. In relation to the Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Matters and the Standing Technical Working Group on Animal and Plant Health Matters that will be created under chapter 7 of the FTA, Ms Greville advised:</para><quote><para>What it will not do is have any impact on our level of protection or our conservative quarantine regime or our standards, no matter what they say.</para></quote><para>These statements were reinforced by Mr Andy Stoler, the Executive Director of the Institute for International Business, Economics and Law at the University of Adelaide—a very skilled and experienced trade negotiator. He said:</para><quote><para>There is nothing that one can find anywhere in the text of this agreement that suggests that either side has the slightest intention of moving away from scientifically based risk assessment procedures as the basis for quarantine actions. You will not find anything in the text. You will find references to facilitating trade to the greatest extent possible while preserving the rights of the parties to protect animal and plant life or health but nowhere will you find the suggestion that we are going to abandon that concept. </para></quote><para>In conclusion, the FTA will benefit all sections of the Australian economy. I have focused my remarks today on what it will mean for Australia's primary industries because this is a focus of interest for me. Trade liberalisation, both multilateral and bilateral, has served Australian industry very well, increasing productivity and competitiveness across all sectors. The FTA will deliver real economic benefits and will secure for Australia greater access to the world's largest and most powerful economy. It will ensure Australia has the capacity to compete against other suppliers from Canada, Mexico and other countries which currently enjoy preferential access to the US market. All major sectors of the Australian economy stand to benefit from the free trade agreement.</para><para>I state clearly and unambiguously to the Senate that assertions that this agreement will impact on Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme prices are simply groundless. These claims are not supported by the text of the agreement and are not supported by any genuine evidence. When examined by the select committee—and, incidentally, the treaties committee—they did not stand up to scrutiny. Furthermore, many of the claims that have been made in relation to intellectual property law changes introduced by this agreement are, in fact, baseless and wrong. Far from being detrimental, the intellectual property provisions of the agreement will provide substantial benefit to Australia's creative industries, which must compete within a global entertainment market.</para><para>Greater symmetry between Australian and US laws will provide the certainty needed to produce greater investment in Australia's creative talents and will deliver substantially improved growth and employment. I urge all senators who believe in trade, who believe in promoting export opportunities for our very valuable primary and secondary industries, and who believe in creating—ultimately—a wealthier and more economically secure Australia to support this legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>25408</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Greens will oppose the <inline ref="R2118">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2111">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004</inline>. This legislation is not about a free trade agreement at all—there is nothing free about this agreement; it is a restricted, pointed, biased agreement which favours our giant but friendly neighbour across the ocean, the United States, against the interests of this nation. We oppose the legislation because it is not in Australia's interests—albeit that it is in the interests of the United States, and in particular the corporate sector in the United States, which stands to gain most from it.</para></talk.start><para>I will move that further debate on these bills be adjourned until after the US-Australia free trade agreement has been subject to a review of the environmental impacts arising from the agreement. I want to say up front that there is no environmental impact assessment. Extraordinarily enough, if you look at chapter 21 of the agreement, you will find that under this section—which deals with institutional arrangements and administration—there is a tack-on at the end which says:</para><quote><para> ... At its first meeting, the Joint Committee shall consider each Party's review of the environmental effects of this Agreement and shall provide the public an opportunity to provide views on those effects. </para></quote><para>I understand that the US is undertaking a legislative environmental review, which started in March this year. I want to pose a few questions at the outset, because the environment has been left out of this debate. Where is the environmental review by the Australian government? How was it set up? How does the public feed into that? What are the parameters of that environmental review? When is it going to be brought to bear on the free trade agreement and how? These are some questions, amongst many others, that the Greens will be asking in the committee stages.</para><para>Here we have a bilateral agreement, in a world of some 200 nations, between Australia and the US. We live in a world, in the 21st century, where we have six billion people living diverse lives under diverse cultures, histories and economic circumstances. Our world is troubled by a breakdown between the haves and the have-nots. We live in an age where there is both mass communication and instant reportage about what is happening in communities in any section of the planet to communities in any other section of the planet. We have seen the inevitable spread of technology, used both for the good and the bad.</para><para>If we are going to aim for a secure future for what will be nine billion people on the planet by mid-century—before, hopefully, the population begins to decline to a more sustainable level—we have to ensure that fairness and a fair go are at the social forefront, that there is environmental protection and that there is democratic input into the way that the world works.</para><para>This free trade agreement stands against all those things. It does not foster the idea of a multinational trading arrangement which takes into account environmental, social and democratic imperatives in order to raise the level of fairness on the planet, to close the gap somewhat between the haves and have-nots, and to ensure that we bequeath to following generations a fairer and therefore more secure planet, instead of a more unfair and therefore less secure planet, which is the prescription that comes out of agreements such as this one.</para><para>However, when it is taken into a narrower focus, we have to ask: where is the democracy in this so-called free trade agreement? It was devised by the Howard and Bush administrations in order to fulfil the political goal of both of these conservative administrations, without reference to parliament. We get that now, at the tail end of proceedings and without the public input and discussion which should have been inherent in what is such a massively important and binding agreement for our great nation, not just for the next five years or 50 years, but, so far as we may judge as we sit here today, forever. </para><para>The agreement binds not only many of the processes in our society but also this parliament. It does so in a way that is out of the reach of this parliament, because once the parliament gives assent to this agreement—and that essentially means, on this side of the ocean, the Senate—changing it becomes conditional on the American interest being fostered. If you do not have that, it will not be changed in the future. Being able to alter the agreement will be out of the question unless the American interest is served. The only option would be to repudiate it further down the line. That, of course, is unconscionable when the option now is to repudiate it before it comes into force, with many fewer consequences for this nation—a nation which has an economy and population less than one-tenth the size of those of the United States.</para><para>It is very important to understand that the agreement is outside the reach of our democracy in both its formulation and its future impact on this country. This agreement is not subject to parliamentary scrutiny; it is not subject to parliamentary accountability; it is not subject to parliamentary alteration. It is another manifestation of the increasing wish by executive governments in this country, which has been refined and strengthened by the Howard government, to act as extra-parliamentary governing authorities, outside the ability of parliament to review and make alterations in the future. </para><para>We know that, in the Senate, the government is in favour of this free trade agreement and, in the main, the crossbench is against it. That has left the opposition, the Labor Party, holding the balance of power. What the Labor Party does in these circumstances is extraordinarily important. I would have expected that it would have stuck with what it felt about the legislation from the outset. That was: no sugar, no deal. That was: no control over and safeguard of our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, no deal. That was: no protection for manufacturing industries in this country, as against the bigger manufacturing clout of the US corporations, no deal. And it ought to have included: no protection for the Australian environment, no deal. But on all counts the opposition has collapsed. On all counts it is left to the Greens and the crossbench to defend this national interest from the impact of a much greater economy, a much greater corporate sector and, I believe, a much less responsive parliamentary system in Washington.</para><para>The question is: what is the Labor Party going to do about it? We have heard from Senator O'Brien that it will move two measly amendments which are at the margins as far as the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and cultural integrity are concerned. They are two minor amendments which go no way towards plugging the enormous holes that are created when you look at this agreement from the point of view of the Australian national interest.</para><para>One must ask: what does that add up to? It adds up essentially to the Labor Party saying: `We're going with Prime Minister John Howard. We're going with President George W. Bush.' They are saying they want a thin veneer of cover from two of the most outspoken groups within our community—those in the cultural sector of our community, who are outraged by this agreement, and those who are concerned about the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It must be remembered that Labor did a backflip just two months ago in this place when they agreed, at the Howard government's behest, to add a cost of $4.90 per prescription for families when they go to pharmacies. In the wake of the tax cuts for the rich, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme now becomes vulnerable to future appeal action by the gigantic multinational corporations, which have enormous clout in the United States, in ways that are unspecified but real.</para><para>We have had from the ANU one estimate that it may add as much as $1.1 billion per annum onto the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme five years out from now. All of those who saw <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners </inline>last night will know that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme becomes vulnerable to an extraordinarily powerful US drugs manufacturing sector, which lobbies enormously and has great power within the halls of congress. Advocates have already been in this country—witness Republican senator Jon Kyl—trying to promote the interests of these corporations. An active Republican senator says on that program—I am paraphrasing here, but the sentiment is correct—that, yes, he does expect that people like Australians should be paying more for what he alleges is the development costs of pharmaceuticals but which the program showed very clearly was for helping the profit line and the advertising impact of the drug corporations, which have left the United States with a delivery system for the sick and the ill far, far inferior to this country's. </para><para>This agreement will help line the pockets of pharmaceutical corporations in the United States. It inevitably moves us a step towards a far inferior system in the United States where the sick, the aged, the retired and the poor not only cannot afford many of the pharmaceuticals available but, as we know, cannot access hospital care in a country which is far worse served by the unrestrained market and the division between rich and poor than this country is.</para><para>Look at the manufacturing industries. What is the outcome there? The government predicts it may create 30,000 jobs. Much closer to the mark is the AMWU's prediction that there will be 40,000-plus jobs potentially lost out of the manufacturing industries in Australia, not least the car components industry.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name></talker><para>—They support the free trade agreement!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>—Where is the amendment to safeguard that? Where is the support for this industry that is going to stop that happening? I hear an interjecting Liberal senator from Tasmania opposite who is amenable to a manufacturing arrangement which says, `Open the door to Australia to all manufactured goods, remove the barriers,' but when it comes the other way it allows a restriction by the United States on the import from Australia of fast ferries. That is an industry that is very important to our home state and to this nation generally. There is a blockage put there because it did not suit the American negotiators. The Howard government collapsed and that senator opposite did not speak up for it. The opposition has not put an amendment in here to fix that either. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The reality is that any amendment coming into this place on this agreement, whether it be on manufacturing jobs, pharmaceuticals, the environment or the proper transparencies and processes overlooking this legislation, cannot be inserted into the free trade agreement, because it is signed outside this parliament. It is an agreement between Mr Howard and President Bush; it is extramural—it is outside the reach of this parliament. Labor has two amendments here which are at the margins and are acceptable, it says—we will see what the government says—within the free trade agreement. It dare not move outside the free trade agreement. It cannot. You accept it or you reject it. Labor accepts it. The Greens reject it because we do not believe it is in the national interest.</para><para>Look at water. We are in an age where governments, including this government, are moving to privatise water in this country—to give the God-given rains into the hands of the corporate sector. We know that US corporations are greatly interested in that. They have invested billions of dollars already into water rights in other countries like Mexico and Bolivia. Put down Australia next. What happens when you have a US corporation which owns water rights to a river system in this country and it is determined, as we are finding now time and time again, that we need a natural environmental flow to ensure that river's biodiversity and ecological health? That corporation will be able to overcome any legislation brought through this parliament and demand compensation for its ownership of God's rain falling on this country. It takes the money for something which it does not create and it should not own.</para><para>We have expropriation clauses right through this agreement blurring the time-honoured legal situation in this country of governments compensating for appropriation of property. But when it comes to wider rights, that is a different matter—it is not so here. The expropriation clauses enable American corporations in the future to sue governments here who want to implement the public right to a healthy environment, to a better social future and to a whole range of cultural amenity. The so-called expropriation right will end up being expropriation by American corporations of taxpayers' dollars in this country under this agreement. There is no caveat—there is no let-out clause.  </para><para>What happens when you say, `Who is going to adjudicate on this, for goodness sake?' You will find in chapter 21 that there is a joint committee. It oversees no fewer than eight other working groups, which it sets up. Does the parliament appoint this joint committee? Is there a democratic vote in here as to who will be appointing the judge, jury and executioner if disputes arise between this country and another? No, there is no say whatever. It is the minister for trade of the day and his American counterpart—again, it is the executive government outside the reach of this parliament who appoints those persons.</para><para>What are the rules? The committee sets the rules itself. There are no rules set by this parliament or agreed to by the US Congress. There are no rules under this Bush-Howard agreement—aren't they the great advocates of democracy and liberty?—which will allow the elected representatives of the parliament to determine such a matter. When the joint committee makes its findings, do we know about it? Is it open to the public? Will there be parliamentary debate? The answer is no for all those questions. What is this committee's bailiwick? It sets up a whole stack of other committees. It has committees looking at manufacturing and at intellectual property rights, which are going to go up for universities. The US patent rules rule, not the Australian patent rules. We are subservient. There is what is called a mickey mouse clause. It will not be mickey mouse for this country. It will add to costs right across the tertiary sector as well as the business sector. On and on it goes.</para><para>This is a sell-out of Australia's right to democratically determine its own future. It gives that to the White House under an agreement this parliament has had no input to. It should be rejected. I would expect the Labor Party to reject it and not just leave it to the Greens to argue for this nation's interests for ever and a day about an agreement that locks down and straitjackets the members of this parliament into the future. We will have none of it. We will be opposing it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>25412</page.no><name role="metadata">Kirk, Sen Linda</name><name role="display">Senator KIRK</name><name.id>00AOO</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak this evening on the <inline ref="R2118">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2111">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004</inline>. Free trade is one means of generating the growth necessary for enhancing the living standards of all Australians. In the past, Australia has directly benefited from trade liberalisation. Reducing trade barriers boosts our economic growth, creates a more competitive industry environment, provides benefits to consumers and builds stronger relationships with our trading partners. Labor has always fought strongly to ensure that the benefits of such economic growth are equally shared. The US-Australia free trade agreement promises all of this for Australia. </para></talk.start><para>The free trade agreement is designed to more closely integrate Australia with the United States, the world's most dynamic and largest economy, by reducing tariffs and improving market access. But it has also raised a number of concerns. Throughout this year, the position of the Australian Labor Party has been that we would judge the government's trade agreement with the United States on the evidence and ask whether it is a net plus or net minus for Australia. Labor members and senators have participated in a number of inquiries into the US-Australia free trade agreement. The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, of which I am a member, conducted an inquiry into the agreement. Our report was tabled during the last session. The report released yesterday contains the recommendations of Labor senators on the Senate Select Committee on the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America. Rather than stalling implementation of the agreement, the committee process has enabled the Senate to thoroughly examine all the facts, hear the arguments from those who stand to lose or stand to gain from the agreement and reach a conclusion as to whether the free trade agreement is in Australia's national interest. </para><para>The Australia-US free trade agreement has generated considerable debate in our community, which is evident both in the number of submissions to the inquiries and in the number of emails, letters and faxes that have been received by members of parliament. It is strongly supported by business and by state and territory governments. But there is also strong opposition to parts of the free trade agreement, and this has been voiced by some unions, community organisations and other interested parties. In particular, the sugar industry was bitterly disappointed at being left out of the deal. Concern has been expressed about the impact on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, local content in future audiovisual mechanisms, intellectual property and possible job losses. These are some of the matters I will be addressing in my remarks today.</para><para>Labor has listened to all the concerns of all those persons who have raised issues with the free trade agreement. From the very beginning, Labor's position has been that it will only support this agreement if the agreement can be shown to be in the national interest. This is not a decision it has taken lightly. The two committee inquiries into this free trade agreement have allowed for all the parties—both those for and those against the agreement—to submit their views. On consideration, both inquiries—the Senate select committee and the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties—found that, on balance, it is in the national interest to support this deal. Labor will support the government's free trade agreement legislation through the parliament but only if the government addresses key concerns in some very important areas, including protecting the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and maintaining Australian content in the media.</para><para>Labor does not want Australia to pass up the chance to achieve freer trade arrangements with the world's largest and most dynamic economy. But the facts of the matter are that this government has failed to negotiate the best deal possible for Australia and in a couple of areas there are serious flaws. The government no doubt could have achieved a better deal for Australia if it had pushed harder at the negotiating table, especially on behalf of our farmers. The government sold out many important Australian industries that were counting on the Prime Minister and his government to look after their interests. This free trade agreement has been incompetently negotiated. In particular, the government's uneven-handed pursuit of bilateral trade deals has meant a lack of focus on where Australia stands to gain the most. The biggest gains for Australia are in expanding opportunities for our agricultural sector, and the biggest hurdles to this require participation in the World Trade Organisation to negotiate down the levels of export subsidies and other types of agricultural support in parallel with all major subsidisers. The WTO is the only place where this can happen. Labor's policy preference is for multilateral trade liberalisation via the World Trade Organisation. </para><para>This bilateral agreement before us today will increase access to US manufacturing, agricultural, services and government procurement markets, although the gains will be far smaller than the figures that have been bandied around by the government. Bilateral agreements should not be at the cost of Australia's position at the World Trade Organisation. A consultant to the Senate select committee, the expert economist Dr Philippa Dee of the Australian National University, has estimated the benefits to Australia at $53 million a year. Over time, the free trade agreement will allow Australia to establish closer economic relations and integration with the world's largest economy, with increased two-way investment flow. Undoubtedly, this will be of long-term benefit to Australia. </para><para>Throughout the examination and debate surrounding the free trade agreement, Labor has raised a number of concerns about its social impact. Some of these matters have been addressed as more information has become available. The free trade agreement is a living agreement and it will continue to develop over time. Labor senators on the Senate free trade agreement inquiry made a number of recommendations to improve the implementation of this agreement. Drawing on these recommendations, Labor will put forward safeguard amendments to the enabling legislation, here in the Senate, to ensure that the free trade agreement does not undermine the PBS and the existing local content rules. The Senate inquiry into the FTA has put together a package of more than 40 recommendations that should be considered as complementary to the free trade agreement to ensure that Australia's national interest is maximised through this agreement.</para><para>The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, of which I am a member, made 23 recommendations in its report. Most of them related to action that could be taken at Australia's initiative or within Australia to ensure that the free trade agreement is a better deal. Labor members of that committee supported the recommendations of chapters 1 to 17, but we opposed taking binding treaty action at the time of the report's writing. In our dissenting report, Labor members stated they:</para><quote><para>1. Believe an extension of time should have been sought from the Minister for consideration of the Treaty to allow adequate time to review the evidence presented and to prepare the Report of the Committee.</para><para>2. Consider that given the interdependency of the consideration of the Treaty and the legislative, regulatory and administrative measures which must be taken to implement the various terms of the Treaty, it is not possible to determine if it is in the national interest for binding treaty action to be taken, without first considering the terms of such measures as </para></quote><para>	the appeal mechanism to be established with respect to the PBS and the implications for generic medications</para><para>	access by universities, educational institutions and libraries to copyright material under the proposed arrangements</para><para>	an environmental impact review of the Treaty</para><para>	legislative safeguards for local content rules subject to ratchet provisions of the Treaty.</para><para>These were the concerns that were outlined by dissenting members of the treaties committee. Following this, of course, we now have the report of the Senate select committee into the free trade agreement. A number of the concerns that we, as dissenting members on the treaties committee, had in relation to the free trade agreement have now been allayed by the Senate select committee's report. It has made more than 40 recommendations to ensure that Australia's national interest is maximised through this treaty. The Senate select committee inquiry found that the overall package is marginally in Australia's national interest. But, as it stands now, the deal puts at risk the PBS and also existing levels of Australian content on Australian media. We believe that, instead of rushing this ahead of an election for political gain, this government should have taken the time to negotiate a better deal for Australia and for Australians. Consequently, as has been foreshadowed here today, Labor will be proposing amendments which we consider are key and must be passed to safeguard Australia's interests. </para><para>Firstly, we consider that it is necessary to protect the PBS by preventing and penalising drug companies that try to stop cheaper generic drugs from coming onto the market by lodging spurious patent claims. Labor has said that it will require all documentation submitted to the independent review mechanism, which will be established to examine unsuccessful drug listing applications on the PBS, to be published on the Internet within 48 hours. The Productivity Commission will be required to monitor and report annually on the impact of the free trade agreement on the PBS, including the impact of the independent review mechanism. If the differential between US and Australian drug prices is seen to be narrowing, then a Labor government will change the independent review mechanism. If the independent review mechanism is used, each acceptance by PBAC and the Minister for Health and Ageing of the recommendations of the independent review will be reported to parliament in a ministerial statement.</para><para>The terms of reference of the medicines working group will include a commitment to the principle of universal access to affordable medicines, which currently underpins the PBS. This working group will not consider any policy issues that could be seen to undermine the principle of universal access to affordable medicine. This working group will operate with appropriate transparency in regard to its agenda items, minutes and recommendations. </para><para>Secondly, Labor has said that it will allay concerns about any future reductions in local content for free-to-air television, pay television and radio, through an amendment which will legislate the current local content standards. Of course, currently those content standards are determined by the ABA. Labor has said that it will ensure that Australians continue to see and hear Australian faces and voices through their popular media by ensuring that the free trade agreement provides flexibility to regulate local content on future media. Labor has said it will legislate to ensure the free trade agreement definition of `interactive audio and/or video services' includes, but is not limited to, future media already identified and it will announce a policy package to encourage further investment in Australia's film and television industry before the upcoming election.</para><para>Labor will not pass this free trade agreement enabling legislation without the two amendments I have just referred to, namely, the amendments that will protect the PBS and, secondly, those that will protect local content. Labor has also indicated that when it wins government at the next election it will put in place a package of additional measures to address a range of other community concerns that have been raised in relation to the free trade agreement. These include a commitment that prior to entering into any future free trade agreement negotiations a Labor government will table in both houses of parliament a document setting out its priorities and objectives in the negotiation of a free trade agreement. This document will include an assessment of the costs and benefits of any proposals that may be negotiated. The assessment will also consider the economic, regional, social, cultural, regulatory and environmental aspects which are expected to arise under the agreement. Once the negotiation is completed, a Labor government will then table in the parliament the proposed treaty together with any implementing legislation. These two stages that Labor will be putting in place preceding the formal consideration of a treaty will improve the process considerably and make the process more transparent. The process Labor is proposing is in stark contrast to the way that this free trade agreement was negotiated by the government. This free trade agreement was negotiated behind closed doors, with only minimal consultation with stakeholders and the Australian public. </para><para>Thirdly, in relation to copyright and intellectual property laws, a number of concerns have been raised about those aspects of the agreement. Labor has said that it will continue to provide a fair balance between the interests of creators, owners and users under copyright and intellectual property laws. Currently, in the United States there is a much more generous definition of fair use than in Australia, affecting access by libraries and researchers. Under the agreement, Australia has not been required to adopt the United States definition. The United States has a much higher standard of originality for copyright protection than Australia, requiring `creative spark', not just `skill and labour'. The changes made by the free trade agreement therefore are far more restrictive in the Australian legislative context, including a more prescriptive regime in creating limited liability for Internet service providers, allowing the transfer of copyright by contract, and an extension of copyright protection by an additional 20 years.</para><para>In Australia, the existing legislation provides for four categories for fair dealing purposes: research or study, criticism or review, reporting of news, and professional advice given by a legal practitioner or patent attorney. The United States legislation provides also for four, but four different, fair use aspects: the purpose of the use, the type of the work, the amount of the work used, and the impact on the market. It is clear that the United States legislation allows for a much broader application than the limited Australian legislation, where it is restricted to specific activities. Labor would address this by establishing a Senate select committee on intellectual property. The role of this committee would be to comprehensively investigate and make recommendations for an appropriate intellectual property regime for Australia in light of the significant changes required to Australian intellectual property law by the agreement.</para><para>Implementing the Australia-US free trade agreement without paying attention to how Australian legislation can be altered to maintain a balance between users and owners of copyright would result in significant costs, in particular for educational institutions. Labor would require that the Attorney-General report annually to parliament on changes to the Copyright Act affecting universities, libraries, educational and public research institutions, particularly with regard to any increased costs they may bear.</para><para>The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, of which I am a member, in recommendations 17 and 18 provides for the government to replace the Australian doctrine of fair dealing with one that resembles the US open-ended defence of fair use, and also that the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts review the standard of originality applied to copyrighted material with a view to adopting a higher standard such as that in the United States.</para><para>In conclusion, Labor have looked at the facts. We have waited until we have all the information at hand to enable us to make a decision in relation to the free trade agreement. The fact is that the government failed to negotiate the best deal possible for Australia, and in a couple of areas there are serious flaws. However, we do not want Australia to pass up the chance to deal with the world's largest and most dynamic economy, the United States of America. Labor will therefore support this legislation, subject to the passage of our amendments in the Senate. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>25417</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R2118">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2111">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004</inline>. I cannot think of any more politically motivated bill that the Senate has had to deal with than the ones that are before us today. The Prime Minister wants to shore up his `man of steel' reputation with the President of the United States, and persuade voters that the free trade agreement is good for us and that the United States alliance depends on it. The ALP has capitulated against all of the evidence that this deal is not a good one for Australia, but it needs to make up for its new leader's gaff in calling President Bush an incompetent. And that, I think, is what this is all about. All Australians will pay for these political motivations.</para></talk.start><para>The ALP are not fooling anyone. They are folding on the FTA because they think that the voters they are chasing are worried that the ALP will mess up our relations with the United States. I think it is as simple as that. I look forward to seeing the ALP's amendments to these bills. Senator O'Brien gave us a summary of what they might look like. They sounded pretty minimal. We will probably support them but we are waiting to see the detail. In fact as I understand it the drafting has not even begun.</para><para>This is yet another swindle in this whole sorry affair. We all know that the ALP will not insist on those amendments. It might pacify the Labor Left somewhat. They were willing to be rolled on the 30 per cent copayment increase. So who knows? They may be happy with this small gesture. But we all know that those amendments are not a serious attempt to fix the bills. They are not fixable, and the government will not in any case entertain changes. Publishing decisions on the Internet, Productivity Commission reports annually on the impact—and of course we know there will be one—are all very minor changes to what is a very damaging agreement. The ALP will not insist on their amendments. We know in this place that they rarely do. I think that people can see through that, just as people know that the government did not have the courage to walk away from the table when it became absolutely obvious that the free trade agreement was not about free trade and not about the overall benefits to Australia. I think that Australians have been misled on this issue since day one. The government said that it would walk away unless sugar was in. We all know that sugar is not in. It did not walk away, but we have got an agreement.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator Boswell</name></talker><para>—A $40 million package!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>1M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name></talker><para>—Senator Boswell says that we have got a package.

It has nothing to do with a free trade agreement except that it is another signal that it is a total failure.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The government said that the PBS was not on the table. Again and again I asked the question of Senator Patterson almost 12 months ago: is the PBS part of the free trade agreement negotiations? No, she assured the Senate. Not only was it on the table but it has become the sacrificial lamb. The PBS is what is going to make this so-called free trade agreement a total dud. Now the government says, `Sure, we have agreed to some transparency improvements on the PBS but of course they will not cost anything.' The evidence brought to the committee—indeed, the text if not the recommendations of the committee's report—says otherwise.  </para><para>The PBS is a world recognised scheme that provides equitable and affordable access to essential medicines for all Australians, and it is threatened by this legislation. It is a central pillar of our health system. Spending on pharmaceuticals saves us money by improving health and delaying the need for more expensive acute hospital based treatment. Access to pharmaceuticals also improves the quality of life for many Australians. The PBS covered around 161 million prescriptions in 2003. The PBS has been spectacularly successful in controlling the costs of these drugs, so successful in fact that it has been copied by other countries. And this is the rub. We are dealing with this legislation because the United States pharmaceutical companies do not want to see Australia's success repeated elsewhere.</para><para>So, despite the success of this system, the government has decided to open up the PBS to attack by the big pharmaceutical companies. These companies will not have keeping the cost of drugs down as their primary interest. They will not have keeping open future options for increasing competition within the pharmaceutical industry as their primary interest. Like any other corporation their interest is maximising profits, and no-one would blame them for doing that. That is a simple fact of life. Why, otherwise, would people in the United States be paying three to four times more for their drugs than Australians do at the moment? Why, otherwise, would Americans be going across the border into Mexico or into Canada to buy drugs that they cannot afford to buy in their own country? Australia's health care system and policy should never have been part of the trade negotiation. In fact that is what the ALP chair says in his report. Health and the products and services that contribute to our health are not something that should be traded away for elusive gains in beef or cotton or dairy. </para><para>The Australian government misled Australians on the FTA and the PBS. They told us that the PBS was not on the table. They are now telling us that the prices of drugs on the PBS will not increase as a result of the FTA and that any changes are purely cosmetic. If that is the case, then why bother? Why did Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and Medicines Australia lobby for these provisions within the FTA? If there is to be no real impact, why can we not remove any reference to the pharmaceuticals from the agreement? Labor's report has clearly outlined the myriad ways in which the FTA can and will impact on the PBS and the costs of medicines in this country. The report identifies point by point four major problems with the agreement as it relates to the PBS. These concerns were raised by consumer groups, professional bodies, industry groups and academics. The Doctors Reform Society said today:</para><quote><para>The ALP's acquiescence to the Howard government's capitulation to the power of the already hugely profitable US drug industry will see the cost of the PBS rise unnecessarily over the next few years. Our government's response will be to increase copayments to patients. More of our patients will simply not be able to afford the life-saving drug treatments that are available, and some will die.</para></quote><para>Labor is clearly aware of all of the problems and all of the risks contained within this FTA and acknowledges in the report that the agreement could have `unforeseen and unintended consequences down the track'. The FTA is in a sense a living agreement. Further work will take place in forums such as the working group set up under it. Many of the details of what it means and how it will be implemented will be sorted out later—trust us—possibly with the help of the dispute resolution mechanism. We cannot predict the actions of the United States or the dispute resolution mechanism into the future. The chair's report says: </para><quote><para>The PBS's capacity to contain drug prices affects all Australians and should not be traded off for the potential economic gains in certain areas of the economy.</para></quote><para>However, Labor is prepared to trade away the health of Australians and it limply says that it is `most unfortunate that the Australian government has allowed provisions affecting the PBS to be included in the trade agreement'.</para><para>Most unfortunate? Why don't we simply say that we are going to stop this? It is not only unfortunate; it is unwise. While it is true that the free trade agreement does not directly undermine the PBS, it still requires subtle and not so subtle modifications to the PBS which place at risk the effectiveness of the PBS in containing the costs of drugs. The Democrats accept that drug prices will not automatically rise, but there is ample evidence that this is highly probable. It would therefore be irresponsible to support the agreement and just hope for the best. The FTA will link Australia's health policy to the nation with arguably the most inefficient and inequitable health and pharmaceutical system in the developed world and one which has the highest health care and pharmaceutical costs in the developed world. It will give the US, and the US pharmaceutical companies in particular, a greater role in determining the shape and the cost of Australia's pharmaceuticals scheme.</para><para>There are many concerns in this agreement. Firstly, the FTA principles are about protecting the rights of the pharmaceutical companies. They do not take into account the principles of the rights of the consumer to equitable access to affordable drugs. The third principle contained in annex 2-C—the section on the FTA that explicitly relates to pharmaceuticals—emphasises the value of innovative pharmaceuticals, while the fourth is concerned with the importance of research and development. These principles will be used to guide changes to the PBS. However, annex 2-C contains no corresponding commitment to the importance and value of protecting public health and protecting universal and affordable access to necessary medicines. The rights of the pharmaceutical companies are explicitly documented, yet the rights of the Australian public are not—they are missing. Our PBS and national medicines policy are both founded on the rights of equitable and affordable access to necessary drugs, and yet these do not get a mention in the agreement.</para><para>When disagreements arise in relation to the FTA and the pharmaceuticals policy—and arise they will—a three-member panel appointed to adjudicate will use the principles set out in annex 2-C to interpret the agreement and to resolve disputes. These principles, which emphasise innovation and research and development, will be used to decide whether Australia is meeting its obligation in relation to the FTA. Therefore, whenever these are in dispute, under the terms of this agreement the rights of drug companies will be favoured over the rights of Australians to access drugs. The report of Labor's chair says:</para><quote><para>... it would seem that the principles set out in Annex 2-C do indeed reflect the agenda of the US pharmaceutical lobby. </para></quote><para>The report also states:</para><quote><para>... it must note with some concern the possibility that this part of the agreement could have unintended consequences should a dispute ever arise.</para></quote><para>Secondly, the pharmaceutical industry has made much of the need for greater transparency within the PBS process. It has been on about that for a long time. However, in this agreement there would seem to be a substantial imbalance in the provision regarding transparency within the FTA. Under the provisions of the agreement, pharmaceutical companies will be able to request a review of negative decisions to list their product. The Australian negotiators say that this is not an appeals process and will not be able to overturn decisions. But, of course, this begs the question: if this process does not have any influence on the decisions, then why bother to have the process? At the very least, it will introduce another layer of complexity into a listing process and will incur administration costs for the PBS, all in the name of satisfying the demands of the US pharmaceutical industry. At the very least, it provides yet another opportunity to put pressure on the PBAC to reward innovation and research and development. Rather than continuing to make decisions on the public's interest, the PBAC will face yet more pressure to give in to industry demands. A decision not to list a drug already places the committee under pressure from a range of interests, such as consumer groups, medical specialists and the media, and yet more processes can only fast-track the way to higher drug prices.</para><para>The pharmaceutical industry's call for greater transparency only goes so far. When it comes to greater transparency regarding the results of clinical trials on a particular drug, the drug companies are very reluctant for this to be publicly released. As many commentators have noted, the commercial-in-confidence rights of pharmaceutical companies are guaranteed within the FTA, yet the public are denied access to drug company data despite evidence that drug companies withhold information that could impact on decisions about the use of drugs. In the United States, Pfizer, the world's largest drug maker, pleaded guilty on 13 May this year to numerous civil and criminal charges for illegally promoting the off-label use of gabapentin, or Neurontin. Evidence provided in this case detailed how the company suppressed study results and promoted the use of this drug for at least 11 off-label uses—that is, uses for which it was not approved. I ask: are the pharmaceutical companies happy for this kind of transparency to be applied to them? The answer is obviously no.</para><para>In addition to the review process, the agreement sets up a special medicines working group which will contain health officials from the US as well as from Australia. Unfortunately, there is no role for consumers or public health organisations in this group, and we have no information on what the terms of reference for the group are or what processes they will use to meet the terms of reference. It is essentially a closed shop which allows another country to play a role in the design and implementation of Australia's medicines policy. Again, there is no evidence for this increased transparency that the industry is so keen on.</para><para>The Labor report says that it is unacceptable that the government has provided them with so little information on the workings of this group and that they are being asked to take on trust that the government will be able to look after the best interests of Australian consumers in the face of intense pressure from our most powerful trading partner—and pressure there will definitely be. There will not be a lot of trust, I imagine, when things start to go pear shaped, however. Deputy US Trade Representative Josette Sheeran Shiner recently declared in testimony to the US Senate Finance Committee that this group will: </para><quote><para>... provide a forum for ongoing dialogue on Australia's system of comparing generics to innovative medicines and other emerging health care policy issues.</para></quote><para>Senator Kyl told the US Senate:</para><quote><para>During our meetings in Australia we suggested such a working group as a way to guarantee that, if our pricing concerns could not be resolved in the FTA, we could continue to discuss the issue. The subject matters that the group might consider are not limited by the agreement, and therefore can be expected to include the importance of market-based pricing.</para></quote><para>So it is quite obvious that United States officials believe that this special working group will influence Australian pharmaceutical policy.</para><para>Thirdly, the FTA also contains proposals to put drug advertising on the Internet. This will facilitate direct to consumer advertising, known as DTCA, which is currently banned in Australia. Of course the aim of direct to consumer advertising is obviously to increase consumer demand, which it does very well. DTCA is frequently aimed at increasing the use of more expensive, but not necessarily therapeutically superior, brand name medicines. Already drug companies are getting around the restriction on advertising of medicines in Australia by producing infomercials about obesity, impotence et cetera that direct you to your doctor, and are using current affairs and lifestyle programs. Why should we be handing them a free pass? DTCA is legal in the United States but it is not here in Australia. It has led to a substantial increase in patient demand for, and use of, products that are often at odds with best clinical practice. Relaxation of advertising restrictions in the US resulted in a 41.7 per cent increase in sales of heavily promoted medicines compared with 14.4 per cent increases for other medicines. The other consequence of this advertising is the use of pharmaceutical approaches in the treatment of illness rather than the use of more appropriate lifestyle change and other therapies for conditions such as obesity.</para><para>Finally, the FTA increases barriers to generic drugs entering the market. The generic versions of drugs play a vital role in keeping drug prices down—and therefore the costs of the PBS down—through providing greater competition. Research at the Australia Institute estimates that, if changes such as those that will result from the FTA succeed in delaying by 24 months market entry of generic versions of just the top five PBS expenditure drugs due to come off patent, this could increase the cost of the PBS by $1.5 billion between 2006 and 2009. I remind the Senate that the stated gains to be made by the free trade agreement overall are $53 million. So we are prepared to give up $1.5 billion in this very small aspect of the PBS part of this legislation for a return of $53 million for farmers. The inquiry summary of the Senate Select Committee on the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America goes into great detail regarding the FTA provisions relating to generic drugs and concludes:</para><quote><para>The new notification requirement may dissuade generic manufacturers from taking a risk in bringing generics to market before the patent claim is settled. This would be to the detriment of the PBS, which benefits from accessing cheaper generic drugs before litigation is settled.</para></quote><para>Yet they are still prepared to pass this legislation.</para><para>There are many downsides with this FTA. The impact on the PBS is one. The FTA will open up the PBS to more pressure from pharmaceutical companies, less generic competition and more promotion of pharmaceutical use. All of these will ultimately result in higher drug prices. Will we see the copayment increased to pay for this? That remains to be seen. The government and Labor know of these problems and yet they have decided to trade our pharmaceutical scheme for the possibility of unlikely economic gains in some areas. The PBS will become just another example of collateral damage. The health of Australians is the real loser from the free trade agreement. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>25422</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>NATS</party><role>Leader of The Nationals in the Senate</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—That was certainly a Jeremiah type speech—a prophecy of doom. The Nationals are quite excited about the prospect of our being a major trading nation. We believe this is an absolutely historic achievement—a free trade agreement with the largest economy in the world, getting us into a $300 million market. It is an agreement under which, for example, from day one agriculture tariffs in the US go from 66 per cent to zero. Specifically, in horticulture 99 per cent of current fresh produce exports will immediately be tariff free, up from the two per cent that applies now.</para></talk.start><para>There will also be greater access for two of Australia's key agricultural exports, beef and dairy, including immediate elimination of in-quota tariffs. Importantly, all single-desk arrangements for export marketing of Australian commodities are preserved. For sugar, rice, wheat and barley the single desk remains, and our quarantine and food safety regimes are preserved. The benefit to Australia is estimated to boost the Australian economy by over $6 billion a year a decade after coming into force, with more than 30,000 extra jobs created. You can see why The Nationals are excited at these prospects.</para><para>In the words of my Queensland Labor Premier, Peter Beattie, `The free trade agreement is our best once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get jobs for Queensland—the best opportunity we've have for more than 100 years to expand into new markets.' His research shows improved export values for Queensland across beef, peanuts, sheepmeat and some horticultural products; improved demand for manufactured goods and light metals; and new market access for a range of sectors to supply the multibillion-dollar US government procurement market. Victorian Labor Premier Steve Bracks said: `We believe it is in Victoria's and Australia's interests to link ourselves with the biggest and most dynamic economy. We welcome the passage of the FTA through the US Congress and await its ratification in Australia.' Those two Labor premiers can see the obvious benefits of growth and jobs for a nation of 20 million people entering a free trade agreement with a market of 280 million people—unlike their federal leader, Mark Latham, who could not see the ladder of opportunity for all Australians at all and even today is making his approval conditional.</para><para>The trade agreement is broad ranging. It eliminates virtually all tariffs on Australian industrial products and it opens large markets for our efficient Australian exporters. To start with agriculture, despite the varying final outcomes all industries—including sugar, which unfortunately was not included in the agreement—praise the Australian government's efforts on their behalf. I take this opportunity to congratulate Mark Vaile for pulling this together and getting an achievement. Cane growers who were there for the negotiations said: `At no stage did we adopt a dog-in-the-manger, “if not sugar then no-one”, approach to the negotiations. We accept that, on balance, the FTA will deliver economic benefits to the nation. As a major foreign income-earning industry exposed to all sorts of distortions of the world market, we believe we are entitled to participate in those gains one way or another.' The government has understood their plight, with a $444 million reform package. Recently they have welcomed the EU announcement of a proposed radical overhaul of the sheltered EU sugar regime. </para><para>In their submission to the Senate committee's inquiry, the Cattle Council of Australia said of their participation in Washington:</para><quote><para>It is this insight which allows CCA to state that in its opinion, the Australian Trade Minister and the Australian negotiating team worked tirelessly to achieve the best outcome they could for Australian beef producers.</para></quote><para>CCA take exception to anyone who would criticise their efforts during the FTA negotiations. It is interesting to note that not one of the groups criticising the FTA was present in Washington during the final round of negotiations. Therefore their comments are not based on first-hand experience, unlike such groups as the Cattle Council of Australia. While CCA remain frustrated with the outcomes of the FTA, this is entirely targeted at the US and its inability to free itself from its protectionist shackles. </para><para>With beef, the agreement provides greater access. Our present quota of 379,214 tonnes becomes immediately free of the present 4.4c per kilogram tariff, increasing returns of around $20 million. There is access for an additional 20,000 tonnes in year 3 at the latest, which will increase to 70,000 tonnes in year 18, should we sign on to the free trade agreement. The out of quota tariff will be phased down from years 9 to 18, with an 18.5 per cent increase in quota volume over 18 years. At current prices that is valued at $245 million in the final year. Seeing that we have reached our quota only once or twice, that is a big opening for the cattle industry.</para><para>The dairy industry has also applauded the gains. In the <inline font-style="italic">Queensland Country Life</inline> on 22 July, Queensland Dairyfarmers Organisation President Wes Judd said:</para><quote><para>The current US FTA can provide significant, ongoing benefits to dairy producers, manufacturers and distributors across the country.</para><para>These stem from the FTA's inclusion of significant, ongoing expansions in dairy quota access for a wide range of dairy products and accompanying duty savings and investment opportunities.</para></quote><para>And it will help sustain Australian industry growth and income in coming years. For dairy, there is an immediate increase in annual quotas with ongoing growth at the average yearly rate of five per cent, which should amount to an extra $41 million in additional exports in year 1. I have heard it said that it is worth about $4,000 to every dairy farmer. </para><para>Previously excluded products will gain access, such as certain cheeses, butter, milk, cream and ice-cream products. For example, that equates to 7.5 million litres of milk, cream and ice-cream, 2,000 tonnes of European type cheese and 4,000 tonnes of whole milk powder. The Australian Dairy Industry Council urge all members of parliament to support the FTA, citing the industry's export success as being $2.5 billion last year and predicting a growth of $50 million to $60 million in the first year of the US free trade agreement. They also see it as having a social benefit in creating skilled and semiskilled jobs in the regions and elsewhere across Australia. The Murray Goulburn Cooperative, a large exporter, agree with these figures and urge ratification of the agreement because, on a cost-benefit ratio, they rate it as a big step forward for the Australian dairy industry in a market that has been one of the world's most protected.</para><para>Fishing and horticulture are pleased with their gains. In fact, the fishing industry think they have won the lottery. The fishing industry will immediately benefit from the elimination of 48 separate tariffs, ranging up to 35 per cent. That is estimated to be an extra $20 million to $30 million in exports in the first year. For example, tuna boat owners in South Australia are pleased that they will see the immediate reduction of the 35 per cent tariff on Australian tuna and the removal of preferential treatment for competitors, which will deliver a level playing field into the US. </para><para>Over 99 per cent of horticultural fresh produce exports valued currently at $71.1 million will become tariff free immediately. While pricing safeguards are there for 33 horticultural products, this only represents 2.8 per cent of all horticultural products, for many of which Australia is not a major exporter. Safeguards will only apply once the tariff reaches zero and, even if they are applied, they will be below the duty paid by our competitors who do not enjoy preferential tariff treatment.</para><para>New quotas will apply to tobacco, cotton and peanuts, increasing by three per cent per year. Avocados will receive two seasonal quotas from year 2 of 1,500 tonnes from February to mid-September and a further duty-free 2½ thousand tonnes between mid-September and the end of January. The outside quota will be eliminated over 18 years. This negotiated single tariff rate quota is seen as a huge positive for the avocado industry.</para><para>The retention of the single desk has worried every farmer who grows wheat, sugar, barley and rice. We have retained the single desk for all industries, which is what the industries wanted. The US wanted the abolition of the single desk along with extensive changes to our PBS. They did not get them—just as we also kept local content rules for Australian television.</para><para>The agricultural sector seems assured that there are no concerns with quarantine. Horticulture Australia's submission to the Senate committee said there is no alteration within the FTA to arrangements covering the negotiation of quarantine market access and that determinations will continue to be made strictly on the basis of science alone. On the two committees—the Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Matters and the Standing Working Group on Animal and Plant Health—they state: </para><quote><para>There appears to be nothing in this SPS chapter as likely to be of concern to horticulture. To the contrary, improved facilitation of quarantine market access processes will be welcomed by the industry.</para></quote><para>The National Farmers Federation believe that the FTA meets the objectives of ensuring Australia's scientific based quarantine system is not undermined by the FTA negotiations. They have no concern with the formation of the two committees, seeing them as developing and formalising closer working relations on SPS related market access issues and saying that `US representation on these committees has no power to undermine Australia's scientific based system or import risk assessment process in particular'.</para><para>During the Senate committee hearings there have been concerns expressed, most particularly about our world-leading PBS system and innovative generic drugs industry and patents, local content in the arts, copyright, foreign investment and the overall benefit to our national interests through various modellings. The government and the negotiators have assured us, the members of the committee, that neither our PBS system nor our generic drug industry is under any threat from the free trade agreement. The government has already announced the independent review mechanism for applications to list drugs under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which was our commitment under the FTA. It has been developed in consultation with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. The price of pharmaceuticals will not rise as a result and the PBAC will remain the gatekeeper of the PBS under the review process. Unsuccessful applicants will be able to specify the ground for review. An independent expert reviewer will be appointed and will make comments back to the PBAC, and at all stages information will be made publicly available to explain and justify the recommendations made. </para><para>The Australian Medical Association has welcomed the components of the review process and the government assurance that it will not allow the PBS to be threatened by this agreement. The government and the committee have listened to this community concern. The government is confident that the commitment it has made will have no adverse impact on the sustainability of the PBS. The independent review mechanism, together with other transparency measures agreed under the free trade agreement, will deliver improvements in the transparency of the PBS which will be of benefit to the pharmaceutical industry, prescribers, consumers and taxpayers.</para><para>The Senate committee has been assured by the chief negotiator that the prices of pharmaceuticals will not increase as a result of the FTA and that those prices will not come under institutionalised pressure from the US government on behalf of the US pharmaceutical lobby. The commitment is to recognise `the value of innovative pharmaceuticals' in the PBS listing and pricing system. Also, the PBAC will remain the sole authority recommending to the Australian government which drugs will be listed. The medicines working group is simply an arena for discussion and has no operative or decision making power. Negotiators also reassured the committee that generic drugs will not be affected or delayed in their introduction, with no threat from patent evergreening. Like all Australians, I was concerned that our PBS system should not be threatened in any way by the FTA. That was given a lot of attention by our committee, which has been assured that the PBS will not be adversely affected by the FTA. In response to the opposition's proposed amendments on the PBS for their political convenience, Minister Abbott told the House today that `no drug can be listed on the PBS without a recommendation from the PBAC'. As the Prime Minister said in relation to these amendments, it is not necessary.</para><para>Like the dairy, beef, horticultural and fishing industries and many others, I see this FTA with the US to be a giant next step for our future growth and development through our entry into the largest market in the developed world. Labor has made much of the threat of the FTA to our multilateral trade commitments. This agreement in no way diminishes Australia' s commitment to agricultural trade reform. In fact, the World Trade Organisation continues to be Australia's highest trade priority through Australia's leadership of the influential Cairns Group. In the World Trade Organisation we continue to push for reform for our distorted global agricultural markets and for better access for all our farm products. The proof that the World Trade Organisation negotiations have not been affected lies in the agreement to a framework for a new world trade agreement, reached in Geneva over the weekend. Since this FTA commenced we have signed free trade agreements with Thailand and Singapore. Similar agreements with China and Malaysia are in discussion. Meanwhile, the FTA with the United States is a giant leap forward in opening up trade opportunities with a market approaching 300 million customers—and that is a big market for an ex-salesman like myself—and with the most advanced economy in the world. Many industries, all democratically elected state and territory governments and many Australians have instructed the Senate committee, in their submissions, to ratify the agreement. The United States Congress have now met their legislative requirements and ratified it from their side. These bills being debated today will allow the agreement to be implemented. They are the final step in attaining the Australia-United States free trade agreement. I have the pleasure—and I consider it an honour—to support these bills on this historic event on this historic occasion. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>25426</page.no><name role="metadata">Wong, Sen Penny</name><name role="display">Senator WONG</name><name.id>00AOU</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R2118">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004</inline> and the related bill. It seems clear, from the analysis of the Senate committee and much of the analysis that has been done over the last months, that this government has not negotiated the best deal possible for Australia in this free trade agreement. Many have said this government has been outnegotiated, and I concur with that view. Perhaps that is because the government's primary focus through these negotiations has been not so much on the national interest as on ensuring its own electoral advantage as a result of the free trade agreement. Its focus has been on its political life and on getting re-elected, and insufficiently on Australia's national interest. In that process some key deficiencies in the agreement exist for Australia, which I will return to later.</para></talk.start><para>The political gamesmanship of this government over the last few weeks and months has been demonstrable and patent. There have been many occasions in the past where Australia's trade position has had bipartisan support. In a recognition that our interests are often best served by speaking with one voice there has been bipartisan support for liberalisation, for example, of trade in agriculture. As US trade representative Robert Zoellick told Congress, he wanted to make sure that the free trade agreement with Australia had bipartisan support. That was certainly his intention. That was certainly not the intention of this government. This government has played this debate in an attempt to gain electoral advantage. It has not sought genuinely to achieve bipartisan support and has resorted to quite a lot of cheap political point scoring in recent weeks. It has taken a partisan approach. It has held back key aspects of the detail of the agreement from the Senate committee and from the public—in particular the details of the review under the PBS, which is part of the free trade agreement. That was an essential part of the information needed for both Labor and the public to inform their positions.</para><para>The government has regularly been critical of Labor for requiring the scrutiny of this agreement by the Senate Select Committee on the Free Trade Agreement and has attacked us over the delay, it says, that that scrutiny has occasioned. These are actions of a government that is not interested in obtaining bipartisan support for an agreement; these are actions of a government interested in making a political point. The government has regularly berated the Labor Party and sought to use our consideration of this agreement as an element in its strategy to paint the Labor Party as being anti-American. As our leader, Mark Latham, said quite succinctly: Labor is not anti-American; we are pro-Australian. We opposed the war in Iraq—and in hindsight we were right to do so because it was clearly a decision based on a lie. In relation to the free trade agreement Labor has sought to discern the national interest and to make an assessment as to whether this agreement is of net benefit to Australia and whether the concerns raised by some groups about the agreement could be allayed or not. </para><para>It is important to note that, unlike some of the minor parties in this chamber, Labor has not taken a position of absolute and jingoistic protectionism over the last 30 years. This is the hallmark of some parties—and that is their right—but we say that they are wrong. It is undeniable that the liberalisation of trade has assisted some developing economies to dramatically improve the incomes of their peoples. It is also undeniable that many Australians in export focused industries have benefited from trade liberalisation. China and India, where there are substantial numbers of the world's poor, have been able to lift many of the poor out of poverty—in large part due to their capacity to sell their products on world markets. As Oxfam say—and they are not noted for their extreme right wing views: </para><quote><para>Trade can be a powerful engine for poverty reduction.</para></quote><para>It is also the case that many of the world's trade rules have largely benefited certain developed economies which spend far more on protecting themselves from poorer countries than they give in aid.</para><para>Labor's view is that there are benefits to be gained for Australians from trade liberalisation. I am also of the view that we can make trade work to benefit the poorer countries as well as Australia. Happily, our interests coincide in many areas, particularly in the area of the liberalisation of trade in agricultural products. Labor has consistently, over the last decades, pushed for gains through multilateral processes, not simply through bilateral processes. However, it is also the case that trade liberalisation is not some sort of magic bullet. It must always be accompanied by a transformation of the economy. There are Australian workers who are patently and potentially vulnerable to the vagaries of world markets. We cannot compete in low-skill, low-wage jobs. We must always have active industry development policies—policies that seek to create jobs for the future, that seek to enable diversification of our export base and that seek to assist people in reskilling and developing skills which will enable them to perform the jobs of the future.</para><para>Unlike the Howard government, which seems to have a hands-off industry policy, Labor governments have always sought to implement industry development policies with the recognition that trade liberalisation must be accompanied by economic transformation. And in some areas we were very successful. Look at elaborately transformed manufactures over the period of the Labor governments, let us say between 1988 and 1996. ETMs, as a share of our total merchandise exports in 1988, were 13.6 per cent. After eight years of Labor government that share had climbed to 23.7 per cent. That is a significant achievement because it demonstrates an ability to produce products which are valued added, which require a reasonable amount of labour input and which can command reasonable prices on the world markets. Unfortunately, the substantial increase in that measure of improvement under Labor governments has not been shared by the Howard government. We have seen the share of ETMs as a proportion of total merchandise exports fall under the Howard government. In fact, if the share of ETMs was now the same as in 1996 when Labor lost government, there would be almost $2 billion more in ETM exports. That is a substantial criticism of the Howard government.</para><para>Labor has also announced, consistent with this view, a new agenda for Australian manufacturing. I am sure Senator George Campbell, who is in the chamber, can tell the Senate more about this than I. We have announced a centre of excellence for advanced manufacturing, an Australian manufacturing council and a 10-year national manufacturing strategy to revitalise manufacturing. These are aspects of a view about trade that recognises that trade liberalisation can have negative consequences for certain workers and that governments have to intervene and develop industries to ensure that impact is minimised and that the benefits of liberalisation can be shared—that we can have productivity with a purpose and not simply leave people by the wayside.  </para><para>In contrast, what we see from this government is a hands-off industry policy—except, of course, when it comes to certain agricultural sectors where some National Party constituencies need to be bought off. This is a government that makes it harder rather than easier for people to reskill and upgrade their skills and that makes it more expensive for people to take on higher education. It is a government that has failed to engage in any real industry development across a range of manufacturing areas.</para><para>I return now to the free trade agreement. It is disappointing, particularly in the area of agricultural products, that there are some clear areas where Australia did not receive benefits. There are extended phasing-out periods for tariffs, the continuation of quotas in some areas and some let-out clauses which may in fact allow for the reimposition of tariffs in some areas. Notoriously, sugar has not been included in this agreement despite its non-inclusion being described as un-Australian by the Deputy Prime Minister—perhaps more evidence of the demise of the political power of the National Party.</para><para>However, there are some net benefits to the agreement. They have been wildly overstated by this government. As Ross Garnaut said, the economic modelling on which this government relied for its overblown claims regarding the benefits of the agreement failed the laugh test. Perhaps a far more accurate analysis is that done for the Senate committee by Dr Philippa Dee, which concluded that the agreement would be of some net benefit to Australia—but a substantially lower benefit than that trumpeted by the Howard government.</para><para>Labor's position, which we announced today, is that there are net economic benefits to Australia and on balance this agreement should be supported. But there are reasonable concerns which have been raised by the community, particularly before the Senate select committee, over some of the social impacts of the agreement, and we share many of these concerns. If you look closely at the announcement that Mark Latham and Senator Conroy made earlier today, you will see that Labor have taken an approach which seeks to safeguard against many of the concerns which have been raised by community groups regarding the social impacts of the agreement.</para><para>There are two primary ways in which we are seeking to do that. The first is by moving specific amendments in the Senate on two issues. The first amendment relates to the PBS and ensuring that there is protection against bodgie patent claims by drug companies—patents lodged in order to try to prevent cheaper generic drugs coming onto the market. The second amendment we will be moving will ensure that current local content standards are legislated into an act of parliament, which they are currently not. In addition to these legislative safeguards, we have announced a range of measures that, if elected, a Labor government would put in place to ensure that the implementation of this agreement did not have any unintended social consequences.</para><para>This is a test for the government in relation to our amendments. If, as the government says, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is not undermined by this agreement then the government has nothing to lose by supporting Labor's amendments. Similarly, if local content rules are not under threat then the government ought to support Labor's amendments. If it is the case, as Senator Boswell said when he preceded me, that there is no threat of evergreening of patent claims, which would of course have cost consequences for the PBS, then surely the government would support our amendments that ensure that evergreening—in terms of baseless patent claims being used to prevent generic drugs coming onto the market—does not occur. If the government opposes the amendment then I say the Australian public should be rightly suspicious of the position taken by the government and rightly suspicious of the government's claims that the PBS and local content are not under threat. </para><para>Finally, I want to speak briefly to the minor parties—who, I understand, have a different view on the agreement from that taken by the Labor Party today. You have trumpeted your concerns regarding a number of issues, particularly the integrity of the PBS and the maintenance of local content. Given that, Labor look forward to your support for our amendments—because we are seeking to protect precisely those things about which you have stated concerns.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>25429</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R2118">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2111">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004</inline>. The Democrats oppose the implementation of the free trade agreement. I want to focus in particular on two portfolio areas in which I have an interest, those being welfare and information technology. I would like to start off by talking about welfare. In doing so, I wonder whether the government or the opposition have examined or paid any attention to the deal of criticism they have received from interested parties, particularly those in the welfare sector, regarding the decision not to seek exemption from the government procurement provisions of the FTA for essential services—including health, welfare and education.</para></talk.start><para>There is no doubt that the Australia-US free trade agreement could have some significant impacts on community services such as child protection; youth services; the jobs network; telephone counselling services, such as Lifeline; emergency financial aid; aged care in all its forms, such as residential care, nursing homes and home and community care; child care; services for people with disability; accommodation services for people with special needs, such as people with mental illness; community housing; tenants services; services for homeless people; drop-in centres; family and relationship counselling; mediation; credit line; counselling for people with addictions, such as alcohol or gambling; Meals on Wheels; play groups and other support services for parents; services for recent migrants, refugees and asylum seekers; prison welfare services; services for victims of family violence; and so on.</para><para>Community services often help redress or prevent marginalisation and disadvantage. They are crucial to human wellbeing and a healthy community. The commercial sector is increasingly becoming involved in community services. Obvious examples are the jobs network, aged care and child care. Since the free trade agreement with the United States is a negative-list agreement, any area of policy that is not explicitly excluded is covered by the agreement. This means that community services provided by the commercial—that is, for-profit—sector and the community or not-for-profit sector are covered, as are any services provided by government in competition with commercial providers.</para><para>The chapters of the FTA which are likely to affect community services include the chapters on cross-border trade in services, government procurement, transparency and investment. We know that representatives of the welfare sector have been involved in some of the meetings between DFAT and the Australian Fair Trade and Investment Network, and they have raised the matter of community services in more than one discussion with them. DFAT officials seem to say that community services were not really the target of free trade negotiations on services which were more concerned with matters such as financial, legal, engineering and other mainstream services in the commercial sector. Despite this, we know that community services will be covered by this agreement. The documentation on the free trade agreement does not include any regulatory impact statement regarding community services, although it is an area where there is substantial government regulation and government procurement of services on behalf of service users. There can be no doubt that the terms of the agreement, in particular the chapters on cross-border trade in services and government procurement, have the potential to significantly limit the ability of government to regulate this area unless it is listed as an exception. </para><para>The costs will be borne by the users of community services, community organisations and the government. Any such changes deserve careful consideration—certainly more than either the government or Labor has been prepared to give—not just incidental coverage in an agreement not tailored to these sorts of services. Any diminution of the ability of government to regulate community services would have implications for the quality of services available to service users and for the costs incurred by both the government and those users. It is doubtful that international free trade in community services is the best way forward for the sector. The normal business practice of investing for short periods in a particular business and then moving to other investments is inappropriate in many community services where people need a stable and secure situation, such as long-term accommodation. It is with some trepidation that the welfare and community sector is obliged to face the Australia-US FTA, and it is true that very few agencies in the community sector have commented on this matter. This is likely to be because the community sector, by its very nature, has never before needed to have knowledge of international trade law and because the government has failed to analyse the implications and consult with that sector regarding the changes. The relative silence of the sector comes not from accordance or acceptance but rather from the difficulty of finding the time and resources to consider the impact. It is quite appalling that Labor, in its haste to sign the agreement, equally failed to give consideration or consultation to that sector. One could cynically argue that, once the terms of the free trade agreement with the United States become available, any concerns from the welfare and community sector would be effectively moot. The substance of the agreement has been negotiated, and Labor is now demonstrating undue haste to secure its ratification.</para><para>In the nervous scurrying to conclude the agreement, many key stakeholders were not consulted. This is an agreement that, at various moments, can deprive the Australian government of the ability to enforce policy decisions that will impact on trade. The decision to abandon Australia's sovereignty should have been the subject of wider community debate and deliberation. Given the deal's likely impact on the community, the lack of opportunity to have input into the negotiations is of great concern. Despite Canberra's rhetoric that this means more jobs and freer markets, sectors of the community have expressed understandable unease about the impact of further economic liberalisation. For a particular group of Australians—that is, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities—there remains significant scepticism that any benefits will flow to them, despite some exceptions under the agreement. In particular, there is concern relating to government contracts for the health and welfare of Indigenous people and to measures for their economic and social advancement. The other concern is about an exemption that allows for: </para><quote><para>... the right to adopt or maintain any measure with respect to investment that accords preferences to any indigenous person or organisation or provides for the favourable treatment of any indigenous person or organisation.</para></quote><para>These exemptions relate to goods and services; critically, they do not ensure the protection of cultural, intellectual property and other rights.</para><para>Another issue that is cause for concern is the ability for US companies to challenge prices under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and to potentially force up the price of medicines. This will have an impact on all Australians, but Indigenous people, with their plethora of health problems, will feel it acutely.</para><para>The decreased capacity to impose future local content restrictions is also a negative outcome for Australian culture in general and for Indigenous culture in particular. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities have rightly expressed concerns about the impact of free trade agreements, and this has been at least in part because of the experiences of indigenous people in North America, Mexico, the US and Canada. These countries each have significant indigenous populations, and their experiences under the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, provide some insight. As a poorer socioeconomic group, indigenous people are vulnerable—often more vulnerable than others—to economic shifts. The creation of low-waged employment in Mexico has been heralded as one of the great achievements of NAFTA, but this is hardly a situation Indigenous communities want replicated in Australia, particularly given the prevalence of Work for the Dole schemes over real employment opportunities in Aboriginal communities.</para><para>Disadvantaged Australians had no public process to review or recommend amendments to the draft text of the Australia-US FTA. Even this parliament could not stop the agreement being signed by our Prime Minister. The sole course of action available to the parliament in support of the welfare and community sector was to block at the domestic level the enabling legislation required to implement the agreement after it was signed. Today that option has been taken away by Labor's capitulation and failure to give the agreement full consideration. We Democrats urge the government and Labor to consider our proposal that community services, no matter who provides them, must be excluded from the Australia-United States free trade agreement and from all other free trade agreements.</para><para>I would like to turn briefly to the issue of intellectual property provisions under the FTA and their impact on the open source, open format sector in Australia. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has described the intellectual property outcomes of the FTA as harmonising Australia's intellectual property laws more closely with the largest intellectual property market in the world. Given the amount of power wielded by US corporations in the field of copyright and patent protection, this prospect gives rise to some real concerns. We Democrats have already warned against allowing the free trade agreement to go down the American route of giving extraordinary power and privilege to giant software companies which can then be used to stifle competition.</para><para>Aspects of the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act, DMCA for short, have seen the major software companies in that country frustrate and block smaller companies and IT research teams by using the law to threaten and financially exhaust any competition. The prospect under this FTA of software patents, rigorously enforced anticircumvention provisions and increased liability for Internet service providers are a matter of considerable concern to the Democrats. We strongly support the development and use of open source software and a diverse and competitive IT environment in Australia. We must retain our sovereignty in this area and resist any efforts to sell out Australia's successful proliferation of small and medium sized companies to US multinational giants—while stepping on civil liberties in the process. </para><para>The Electronic Frontier Foundation has investigated the operation of the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the impact it has had on the independent software industry in the United States. This investigation found that since enacted in 1998 the anticircumvention provisions of the DMCA, codified in section 1201 of the Copyright Act, have not been used as congress envisioned. The US Congress meant to stop copyright pirates from defeating antipiracy protections added to copyrighted works and to ban `black box' devices intended for that purpose. In practice, the anticircumvention provisions have been used to stifle a wide array of legitimate activities rather than to stop copyright piracy.</para><para>As a result, the DMCA has developed into a serious threat to several important public policy priorities. Firstly, experience with section 1201 demonstrates that it is being used to stifle free speech and scientific research. Lawsuits against a magazine, a research team and prosecution of Russian programmer Dmitry Skylarov have stifled the legitimate activities of journalists, publishers, scientists, students, programmers and members of the public. The Skylarov case involved a Russian programmer who had designed a program that allowed Adobe's protected eBook format to be transformed into the unprotected and more common portable document format, or PDF. The software he designed would only work on eBooks that had been legitimately purchased. The purpose of the software was to assist blind people to access eBooks and to allow eBooks to be moved from one computer to another. On a trip to the US to speak at a conference, the programmer was arrested.</para><para>Secondly, by banning all acts of circumvention and all technologies and tools that can be used for circumvention, section 1201 grants to copyright owners the power to unilaterally eliminate the public's `fair use' rights. Already the music industry has begun deploying copy-protected CDs that promise to curtail consumers' ability to make legitimate, personal copies of music they have purchased. In Australia we do not even have the `fair use' rights that exist in the US.</para><para>The DMCA also impedes competition and innovation. Rather than focusing on pirates, many copyright owners have wielded the DMCA to hinder their legitimate competitors. For example, Sony has invoked section 1201 to protect its monopoly on Playstation video game consoles as well as its regionalisation system, limiting users in one country from playing games legitimately purchased in another. Further, section 1201 has been misused as a new general-purpose prohibition on computer network access which, unlike the several federal antihacking statutes that already protect computer network owners from unauthorized intrusions, lacks any financial harm threshold. A situation where a disgruntled ex-employer, Pearl Investments, used the DMCA against a contract programmer who connected to the company's computer system through a password-protected virtual private network illustrates the potential for unscrupulous persons to misuse the DMCA to achieve what would not be possible under existing computer access regulation regimes. IT law expert Brendan Scott has written:</para><quote><para>These are prohibitions on accessing data which has been protected by a technological measure. The explicit purpose of these provisions is to prohibit data interoperability. If open source vendors are not permitted to implement data interoperability, they will face substantial barriers to entry in many important submarkets. In essence, a vendor will be locked out of competition merely because the current incumbent uses a protected format for customers to store their data in. </para></quote><para>He also wrote:</para><quote><para>These prohibitions were initially created to protect a small minority of content producers from competition from new technologies, particularly in respect of audio and video content. However these provisions have already been subject of much broader implementation in the United States. In particular they have been used to inappropriately suppress competition in respect of printer cartridges and garage doors ...</para></quote><para>Even pressing the shift key can be a breach of the US version of these laws. He continues:</para><quote><para>They can be used to anti-competitive effect on any article to which a computer chip can be attached—and there is every reason to suspect that if this category does not already encompass all manufactures, it will do so in the not too distant future.</para><para>While they have been characterised as applying to prevent unauthorised copying of music, it would be a grave mistake to think they will be restricted to this area in the future. The anti-circumvention provisions are a legislative imprimatur to the reduction of competition across the whole breadth of the economy. No analysis of the economic impacts of the FTA that I am aware of takes into account this extensive anti-competitive effect. At its worst it will shave percentage points off Australia's GDP. </para></quote><para>I will conclude with the words of Rusty Russell, a member of Australia's open source community who appeared before the Senate inquiry. He said:</para><quote><para>Let me make this clear: people in the Open Source industry feel directly threatened by the laws required by the FTA. We have seen threats issued against Open Source developers in the United States, and we fear the same thing here. This kind of fear, and this kind of uncertainty, as I have already noted, is toxic. It drives people from the industry, and it drives people from engaging in innovative activities. And that is a real shame, because currently in Australia we have some of the most talented, and innovative, Open Source developers of any country in the world.</para></quote><para>For those reasons and more we Democrats continue to strongly oppose the legislation before us.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>25433</page.no><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator EGGLESTON</name><name.id>4L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R2118">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2111">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004</inline>. At the end of the last session of parliament I attended a farewell dinner for the Canadian High Commissioner, who spoke of the free trade agreement the Canadians have had for many years with the United States. When asked what he thought was the greatest benefit of the free trade agreement he said that quite simply it was access to the United States market. So it will be with Australia. We will have access to the world's largest economy and a market of 300 million people under this free trade agreement. The benefits to Australian agriculture, industry and service providers are potentially immense. There is no guarantee that Americans will buy Australian goods but, by having access, we can compete in their market. That is, I believe, of great benefit to Australia.</para></talk.start><para>As Senator Boswell has said, the free trade agreement will be particularly valuable to the Australian agricultural sector and, in other ways, to various aspects of our manufacturing industry. The manufacturers of utility vehicles, which are commonplace in Australia but which are quite unknown in America, will benefit. We will be able to export utes and services. We will have access to the United States federal government procurement process and also to that of some 44 states. As the United States economy grows, as it inevitably will, so will the benefit of this free trade agreement to Australia grow, or so I and the government definitely believe. </para><para>In the very short time available to me to talk about this tonight, I would like to address two issues: the issue of the PBS, which has been raised several times, and the issue of our audiovisual and cultural productions, which other people have said will be threatened by this agreement, but I do not believe that that is the case at all.</para><para>It has been suggested that the price of medicines will be raised under the free trade agreement. As I understand it, the price of medicines under our PBS will not be affected by the free trade agreement with the United States. All that has happened is that we have agreed to a review of the process under which the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee authorises a medication to be placed on our pharmaceutical benefits list. There is no implication at all that prices will be increased. It simply gives American manufacturers a means of being informed why, if it is the case, their brand of some medication has not been authorised as a pharmaceutical benefit in Australia. It is a review process that provides information to the American pharmaceutical industry. It will not in any way provide any mechanism of appeal or challenge to the decision of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. As other people have said this afternoon, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which we have in Australia, is unique. It has provided the Australian population with quite cheap medicines by world standards. The government will in no way compromise that scheme, because it has been of great benefit to Australia. I would like to lay that particular concern to rest.</para><para>The other concern that has been consistently raised today relates to our audiovisual products. There have been claims made that local content quotas for broadcasting will be compromised by the free trade agreement. That is not the case either, in my view. The text of the agreement makes it clear that our right to ensure local content in Australian media and the capacity to regulate new and emerging media is respected and retained. Australia has successfully negotiated reservations in the services chapter that ensure that the government's continuing capacity to regulate for Australian content is preserved. There are, in fact, two reservations in two annexes to the agreement which allow Australia to maintain or adopt measures that enable us to maintain local content and ensure that our audiovisual productions are preserved. It has to be said that the US has recognised that Australia is already a very open audiovisual market. The binding commitment that Australia is making will give the United States certainty that we will not close our market in the future or introduce significant trade restrictive measures.</para><para>A lot of people have said that they would have liked to have seen in the United States free trade agreement a reservation for cultural products similar to that included in the Singapore free trade agreement—the so-called Singapore reservation. But the reality is that Singapore does not have a very big audiovisual sector—nothing, of course, like the United States movie industry, which, as everybody knows, is the biggest and most powerful movie industry in the world. So, in dealing with the United States, Australia has had to be cognisant of the fact that the United States has that great film industry. We have had to work out an agreement that allows for the interests of the American film industry.</para><para>We have had reservations built into this agreement which preserve our cultural identity and enable the government to retain the capacity to support the Australian cultural sector—including the film industry, cultural institutions and so on—through grants, subsidies and tax incentives. The regulatory capacity provided by the agreement will give the Australian government sufficient freedom to respond to changes in media technology. Specifically, it will give Australia the freedom to both retain its existing local content requirements and extend these or introduce new ones in specified circumstances to address the impact of changing technologies. Of course, the technology used in audiovisual production is changing. We are moving into the digital era. Being able to retain our rights to have defined quotas of Australian content is very important given that things are going to change very much with new technology. </para><para>It is quite clear that the Australian free trade outcome in respect of audiovisual content clearly contains greater specificity than the Singapore free trade agreement outcome. In short, the US agreement is more targeted than the broad Singapore free trade agreement reservations. It is my belief that the negotiated outcome addresses Australia's genuine concerns while meeting the US's legitimate interests in having some certainty about the future openness of the Australian market. In particular, the key reservation in annex 2 gives Australia the right to introduce new measures as well as to maintain existing measures. Those are important points for the Australian public to be aware of. This government certainly is not going to abandon Australia's voice—as it is put—in the audiovisual world. This government will preserve the Australian film industry and ensure that it is strong and vibrant in the future.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>25435</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>NATS</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As the chamber is aware, we are discussing the <inline ref="R2118">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2111">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004</inline>. This is a historic and significant free trade agreement with the United States. It is a significant time in the parliament because the free trade agreement we are discussing is probably the most significant and important agreement to Australia in trade and in economics since 1957, when another significant trade agreement was signed with Japan. The parallels between these two trade agreements are quite uncanny. First of all, both were negotiated by a National Party minister. The Minister for Trade in 1957 was Jack McEwen, who undertook an agreement with Japan.

You have to remember that in 1957 when negotiating that agreement it was soon after the war. So there was a lot of pressure on the then government over negotiating with a former enemy. Of course, those against it were from the same party that is against this agreement. That is of foremost significance.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Look at the result of that trade agreement that the then coalition parties pushed through the parliament. Look at how, during the 1960s and 1970s, that particular agreement underpinned the growth in the Australian economy and the many good and great years we have had in Australia.

That particular agreement underpinned decades of a very healthy Australian economy. The significance of it is that it was negotiated by a National Party minister back in 1957—no less than Jack McEwen—under extreme pressure, provocation and doomsaying by the same types who are trying to pull this particular agreement down. What we have before us today, speeding forward, is of exactly the same significance: this particular agreement will underpin the growth in the Australian economy for decades to come. Why have the opposition, be it that they are now going to vote for this agreement at this eleventh hour, made it so difficult for the government to put it through? It really should have been put through months ago. Why have they made it so difficult when it is so obvious that we are signing a most significant economic link with the largest economy in the world? Quite frankly, every country in our region would envy this particular agreement. If they thought we were not going to sign it, if it ever came to that, they would be the first in the rush to have such an agreement signed.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We heard during the five months of deliberation of the opposition how the fact that we are making strong economic links with the United States is going to affect our relationships within the region. What a load of rubbish that has turned out to be. As the opposition know only too well, we have a free trade agreement with Singapore and we have a free trade agreement with Thailand all but put through the parliament. We have a trade agreement being negotiated with China, no less, and now Malaysia wants to be in on the act with a free trade agreement. So it is absolute rubbish to say that this particular agreement would affect our economic, political, social or military relationships with our Asian neighbours. It is quite the contrary; it has given us the prestige to be able to negotiate.</para><para>But you cannot get it through the likes of Senator Lundy, who happens to be in the chamber, or the likes of Senator George Campbell, who happens to be leaving the chamber at the moment. Why? It is pretty basic. We never heard them criticise the Thai free trade agreement or the Singapore free trade agreement or the pending China agreement, or the Malaysians. There is one basic and simple reason why you are against this agreement, because your criticism simply does not stack up economically. There is only one basic reason. Why don't you have the courage to come out and say it? You are anti-American in every shape and form, even to the detriment of the welfare of Australia for decades to come—and that is what this free trade agreement delivers. There is no other reason, Senator Lundy: your bias is dripping off you.</para><para>This agreement particularly brings benefits to the primary industry sector. This is something we have been waiting for for years. We have been hanging around the World Trade Organisation for a long time now waiting for a breakthrough, and perhaps in the last couple of days there has been a renewed breakthrough with the World Trade Organisation, but bilateral agreements of this sort are invaluable to the primary industry sector, and no less this one. This one absolutely champions the cause of primary industry. We have the beef industry, the wool industry, the sheepmeat industry and the dairy industry all benefiting from this agreement. Of course, we wanted better for all of those industries, and quicker access.

I wish tonight to direct my remarks to only a few aspects regarding this report and the circumstances surrounding the doping allegations made. I am, of course, keen to give the Minister for Sport a full opportunity while parliament is sitting over the next two weeks to put a comprehensive account on the public record.</para><para>To begin with, I would like to say tonight that the Anderson inquiry into these allegations should not have been necessary. A full, properly constituted and independent inquiry should have been instituted immediately upon the discovery of the sharps bucket on the premises of the AIS facility at Del Monte. There should have been a comprehensive inquiry with full powers—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7G6</name.id><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator Lundy</name></talker><para>—Indeed.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—of compulsion and protection, as Senator Lundy knows—and I am delighted, Senator Lundy, that you are going to enter this debate a little later this evening because it is very important. And, of course, the inquiry should have been able to investigate the actions of all athletes allegedly involved in either improper or illegal practices. Without doubt this was the responsibility of the minister, as the AIS is a Commonwealth agency and has a heavy duty of care to all of the athletes involved. Instead, under the totally inadequate stewardship of Senator Kemp, we actually saw a parade of errors and mistakes—pseudo inquiries by coaches and human resources bureaucrats, secretive inquiries by a lawyer contracted to the Sports Commission, ASC induced delays in the tribunal processes, and attempts to cover up the whole matter at least until after the Athens Olympic Games. This issue should have been squarely faced up to back in December of last year, but we find the Australian Olympic cycling team is still in turmoil less than two weeks before the opening ceremony of the games. Senator Kemp should have insisted on full disclosure, full investigation and full accountability back when there was time to do so. There was not enough time for the full job to be done, and the responsibility for that should be laid at Senator Kemp's door.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I also want to comment on the decision made by Minister Kemp to table only part of the Anderson report. I want to be clear on this point. The portion tabled is by far the smallest selection available. Senator Kemp made a number of statements that he intended to publicly table the full report by Mr Anderson and he told the parliament that this public release would be `subject to privacy and other legal requirements'. Senator Kemp then tabled Mr Anderson's summary report last week without any of the additional 300-odd pages of appendix material, which is referred to extensively throughout the summary report. Senator Kemp has made no attempt to justify his refusal to table even one page of the appendices. He has provided no grounds for the failure to table that extensive material. He has given no idea of legal or other advice he has sought or received on the reasonableness or otherwise of tabling that material. And, importantly, the minister has made no attempt to discuss this matter with the Senate. If indeed there are legitimate privacy or other concerns with the publication of the material, then I would have expected Senator Kemp to raise those reasonable issues with the opposition and other senators with an interest in these important matters. The minister's failure to keep his undertaking to the Senate and his abject failure to consult with the Senate on his grounds for doing so will, I believe, be seen as a grave disservice to the parliament. I will be having more to say about these matters a little later in the week. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>25438</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to add my comments on the Anderson report which Minister Kemp tabled in part, and in part only, last week. The issue at hand is not that this report has finally been tabled but, rather, why it took almost seven months from the discovery of used injecting materials in the Del Monte AIS residence to order an obviously much-needed independent and comprehensive investigation into this matter, why it took three weeks from the date the report was completed for it to be finally tabled in parliament and why this report has not been tabled in full.</para></talk.start><para>On 24 June 2004 Minister Kemp appointed Robert Anderson QC to conduct an independent inquiry into serious allegations regarding the use of prohibited performance enhancing drugs by some Australian cyclists. That this investigation was finally ordered by Minister Kemp only as a result of pressure brought to bear by Labor senators, who questioned the cover-up of the Court of Arbitration for Sport findings which concluded that at least one athlete other than French had used eGH, or equine growth hormone, in this room, has already been noted in this chamber. The fact that this whole mess could, and should, have been avoided if the minister had acted decisively in the first instance and ordered a comprehensive independent investigation into this matter last year cannot, however, go without comment. An immediate investigation into this matter would have allowed adequate time to fully investigate these allegations, and would have ensured that the syringes, phials and swabs that were found were tested immediately rather than being left for so long and handled so many times that it was very difficult to gather DNA information that could have offered essential evidence at the time.</para><para>Unfortunately, due to the government's ineptitude in handling this matter, the issue has dragged on for so long that we are now only 11 days from the Olympics and we still have outstanding appeals, more than half a report missing and potentially more damning evidence to come. Even when the minister finally ordered a full investigation into this matter, he failed to give Mr Anderson the powers that it could be reasonably assumed would be required to uncover the full extent of just what was going on at the AIS Del Monte residence. Mr Anderson himself conceded he had no powers to compel anyone to answer his questions. He said:</para><quote><para>I don't have coercive powers, I can't subpoena, I don't have any authority to administer oaths.</para></quote><para>This, in combination with the fact that Mr Anderson was given little more than a week to complete his comprehensive task, clearly shows that the minister was not fully committed to catching those who were attempting to beat the system. There are already questions over the completeness of this report, given the limited time frame and powers that Mr Anderson was required to work within. To now have the minister refuse to release the appendices to this report makes the situation look even worse.</para><para>Last month Mr Mark Peters, CEO of the Australian Sports Commission, called on disgraced cyclist Mark French and his legal team to allow the release of the Anderson report, claiming that what Mr French and his team have done `is just a stunt to make sure that their publicity campaign is not derailed'. This was an outrageous statement. When Mark French agreed to release the whole 300-page report, however, the minister and the Australian Sports Commission completed such a stunning backflip they would easily have won gold in an Olympic diving competition. </para><para>Minister Kemp said it was `clearly in the public interest' that he table this report. If it is so clearly in the public interest, why has the minister prevented the full report from being tabled? I ask: are there concerns for the safety of those people who the minister said provided detailed information, including personal information, and who voluntarily cooperated with the Anderson investigation without the expectation that their statements would be made publicly available? I also ask: is there fear of retribution against those who came forward and provided information in an effort to get to the bottom of this matter? We do not know. Or, as I am left to speculate, is it the fact that these appendices may contain further information that may be condemning in nature?</para><para>I note that Dick Pound, head of the World Anti Doping Agency, condemned the politicians and sports officials who loudly profess to be against doping in sport and in favour of transparency but who go quiet when it comes to action against top local athletes who are alleged to have broken the rules. Even members of the international sports community are questioning Senator Kemp's commitment to stamping out the use of prohibited substances in sport. So, enough of hiding behind privacy laws in government guarantees. There have now been five separate investigations into this matter. At every stage we have been asked to accept the verdict placed before us, only to find each time that the truth has not been fully disclosed.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>25439</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Nick (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Bolkus)</inline>—Order!

I recommend both articles to honourable senators. The first appeared in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper on 23 June 2004 and was written by Brian Walters, a barrister who is vice-president of the organisation Free Speech Victoria. According to Mr Walters, the circumstances surrounding the appointment of Rehame to conduct this work and of this decision by the ABC board becoming publicly known through the medium of the ABC television show <inline font-style="italic">Media Watch</inline> raise fundamental questions about free speech.</para></talk.start><para>The second article was by the veteran journalist, sometime editor and current commentator Frank Devine. It appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper on 2 July 2004 and provided a wonderfully light-hearted but, in fact, deadly serious critique of the ABC and the propensity of its broadcasters to editorialise. Devine's article was headed `ABC news gives equal time to speculation and comment'. His view is that the people who actually run the ABC are:</para><quote><para>MoT (nicknamed in honour of Orwell's Ministry of Truth), the shadowy, much-feared sub-committee of the ABC Staff Association ... </para></quote><para>The committee, Mr Devine asserts as he argues the case for peer review of the ABC, is `adept with stopwatches' and `will be able to demonstrate to the millisecond how even-handed it was in distributing coverage among the parties'. Now Mr Devine is having a laugh, of course—it is always the best medicine. But it is not election campaign coverage that is of concern, certainly not in terms of stopwatch performance. Even-handedness is a quality that includes, but is not limited to, equal time. </para><para>The problem that many people have with ABC news and current affairs broadcasting is not that it is unprofessional—it is very professional indeed—or that it is too narrow. Its coverage is extensive and very, very broad. The problem is the systemic—if not systematic—presentation of information in ways that will result in subliminal skewing of opinion in listeners and viewers. As one example, take this instance—picked up by Mr Devine in his <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> article—from the ABC's seven o'clock television news on 19 and 20 June:</para><quote><para>“Russian President has revealed new intelligence claiming that Saddam Hussein's regime was planning to strike the United States ... For President George Bush the revelation may come as a relief.”</para></quote><para>Mr Devine, who kindly offers to act in a `fill-in' capacity before the peer review monitoring group is in place, makes this devastating rejoinder:</para><quote><para>Delete second sentence. Unsupported, not to say air-head, speculation.</para></quote><para>In a further instance, the ABC ran a quote from President Bush:</para><quote><para>`This is a regime that sheltered terrorist groups. This is a regime that hated America. And so we saw a threat and it was a real threat.'</para></quote><para>Then it added as its own comment:</para><motion><para>That claim is being disputed by the commission into the September 11 attacks.</para></motion><para>Mr Devine writes in response:</para><quote><para>Delete last sentence. The commission disputes nothing in this Bush statement. An ABC concoction.</para></quote><para>That is the problem. Somehow, ABC news and current affairs people just cannot help injecting unsupported—indeed, insupportable—commentary into news and analysis. It does anger people—people in Queensland and elsewhere around the country who let me know in very forthright terms just what they think about this business of skewing the news.</para><para>Nor is this disquiet confined to the ABC audience. Albeit this sprang from a different set of difficulties, it is very worrying that the Chairman of the Australian Stock Exchange, Mr Maurice Newman, felt constrained to resign from the ABC board because of the actions of the staff elected director, Ms Ramona Koval. Ms Koval's objections to the ABC appointing Rehame to monitor its political coverage found their way onto the ABC program <inline font-style="italic">Media Watch</inline>. Whatever the merits of the ABC appointing a monitor to monitor its own monitors, the issue of board confidentiality is crucial. It should not be broken because Ms Koval is concerned about what she views as continual political interference at board level. Her action validates the very point made by commentator Frank Devine to which I referred earlier: the ABC staff should not presume to run the organisation. If there are staff concerns—and there is an industrial problem in Queensland at present, of which I have been advised, relating to a low salary cap being imposed on regional journalists there—they should be dealt with, but they should be dealt with in an employer-employee environment.</para><para>But, of course, the problems at the ABC are far wider than that. I inform the Senate that I have added my voice to that of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, in complaining about the politicising of the Bali bombing and South-East Asian terrorist issues by the managing director of the ABC, Mr Russell Balding. Mr Balding has referred my complaint to the complaints review executive, as I requested, and I thank him for that. The ABC's decision to run an episode of its series <inline font-style="italic">The Third World War</inline>—a British documentary—that referred to Bali and failed to take account of evidence available to this parliament on intelligence issues was reprehensible. Mr Balding issued a statement on 2 July 2004 in which he said of these events: </para><quote><para>There is a fundamental difference between dealing appropriately with complaints and bowing to pressure.</para></quote><para>	...	...	...</para><quote><para>This is a crucial period for the ABC. In the heightened atmosphere of a looming Federal election the public can be assured that the ABC will stand firm and protect its editorial independence.</para></quote><para>There was no threat to that independence. All the foreign minister sought was to have the ABC ensure that those elements of the British documentary that had been overtaken by events here in Australia be put in context—that is, that they be illuminated by material that became available after the documentary was made. These matters are now being considered, so I will not canvass them further at this time; but they need to be resolved.</para><para>On a happier note, as honourable senators know, I am very far from being implacably opposed to absolutely everything that the ABC does or says. I am an avid watcher of, and listener to, the ABC. In particular, I am a dedicated fan of NewsRadio. As my friend and colleague the Minister for the Arts and Sport, Senator Rod Kemp, observed at the June estimates hearings, it is an excellent service. I believe in paying tribute where it is due, and it certainly is in relation to NewsRadio. The 24-hour news service has recently celebrated its 10th birthday.</para><para>In another area of the ABC's operations, the government and the ABC are working together to support the highly successful Backing Australia's Ability program. The ABC will help promote innovation in the community through the National Innovation Awareness Strategy by producing a range of exciting new projects in partnership with the government. These include <inline font-style="italic">ACE Day Jobs</inline>, a series of 36 five-minute episodes showcasing young Australians who are passionate and enthusiastic innovators and entrepreneurs. The series will be available on broadband video and via the ABC web site. Another project is Start!, a radio and online initiative supporting young people who have an idea they would like to turn into a business.</para><para>I close by saying that it was good to see the ABC recruiting from within for its new director of news and current affairs. I wish John Cameron all the best in that position. I know from people connected with the ABC with whom I have enjoyed a glass or two of wine from time to time that he is highly thought of. I wish him the very best in that position and hope that he manages to perform, certainly from the point of view of balance and bias within the ABC, better than some of his predecessors.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Taxation: Income Tax</title><page.no>25441</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>25441</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The July 2004 income tax cut seems to have made tax cuts an even bigger election issue. That is because many Australians think the system is still unfair. Many Australians accept that they are not excessively taxed overall, but all Australians want the system to be fair. Some commentators confuse unfairness with paying less tax. Millions of Australians are happy to pay their taxes for governments to provide health, education and other services. Many Australians—including Democrats like me—want more spent on services, not less. Voters tell me they want fairness restored and tax principles they can rely on—ones that reflect Australian values, realities and aspirations. </para></talk.start><para>As contestants for government, the Liberals and Labor will debate income tax policy this election. What should they be arguing about? Having had the taxation portfolio for the Democrats for eight years, my experience tells me that the majority of Australians would react well to an income tax system that retained a progressive structure with relatively few rates, was indexed to inflation, had minimal tax concessions, and advantaged lower to middle-income earners while providing a fair productivity incentive to higher income earners. There are supporters in Australia of a flat income tax—meaning just one tax rate, regardless of income—but most Australians prefer the notion that those who earn more should pay more. A progressive income tax system is therefore the first principle. Australia once had as many as 29 income tax rates. Five rates are what we have now, and they are well accepted: nought per cent, 17 per cent, 30 per cent, 42 per cent, and 47 per cent—the latter four with the flat 1.5 per cent Medicare rebate added. The second principle, therefore, is to have a top and a bottom rate with one to three rates in between.</para><para>The third principle many Australians want is to annually index income tax to inflation. Bracket creep increases taxes by stealth. Bracket creep is the impact of inflation related salary increases on the static progressive marginal tax rates. Indexation is well accepted in Australia, as with alcohol excise. Income tax indexation was tried in one form or another in the seventies and eighties. The choice is either to index all the rates annually or to index the top and bottom rates only so as to keep the relative gap between the two constant, with the in between rates adjusted as and when governments decide. That does mean that some bracket creep gains would be kept by government. Indexing is most costly when inflation is high. Depending on how you do it, indexing tax rates to end the bracket creep problem would result in a present cost to the revenue of about $1 billion per annum.</para><para>The fourth principle is a vital one. Australians are incensed by people who do not pay their fair share or by politically favoured constituencies who are given sneaky, special advantages by the tax system. Such an environment encourages a culture of tax avoidance: `If they are getting away with it, why shouldn't I?' Broadening the base and simplifying the system can help pay for more tax reform and reduce tax avoidance. Making the superannuation tax concession smaller, putting indexation back onto fuel, disallowing work related deductions, stopping companies paying less than a set minimum amount of tax, reducing the excessive FBT allowance on company cars, reducing excessive capital gains tax concessions, attacking trusts tax dodgers and means testing the private health insurance rebate are among the many ideas that could raise many billions.</para><para>The fifth principle is to advantage low- and middle-income earners. The most important distributive mechanism for improving the lot of low-income Australians is to improve their disposable income. The working class and the middle class get the rawest income tax deal. Lower income Australians struggle with a tax threshold that kicks in at a ridiculously low level of $6,000 and they struggle with the highest effective tax rates of all because, as they earn more, their welfare benefits reduce. </para><para>Australia's welfare floor is $12,500—the minimum official income required for basic subsistence. There is no justification for income taxing someone earning that amount. Economic and competitive realities almost certainly mean that there will remain substantial numbers of lower paid workers, but that does not mean low-income Australians do not deserve a fairer go. From the employer's perspective, if the disposable income of low-wage earners increases as a result of tax cuts, it could take some of the stress and tension off the low-wage industrial case that has to be mounted annually. You cannot address tax rates for low-income earners without sympathetic adjustments to welfare rates. If you wanted to get people off welfare and into work, you would target and improve the tax and welfare intersects. </para><para>In their `Info 347' June 2003 paper, ACOSS said that the average tax rate on all income for someone earning $20,000 a year is presently 12 per cent, or $2,400. So, if the tax-free threshold were raised from the present $6,000 to $20,000, that low-income wage earner would have $2,400—or $46.15 per week—more disposable income in their pocket each year. If Mum and Dad were both earning just $20,000 each, they would pay no tax and have $4,800 more to spend on the kids.</para><para>There is another strong reason to raise the tax-free threshold to $20,000. Casual and part-time workers, particularly women, need not pay income tax at all, which would be great for struggling families and mothers, among others. Sharan Burrow, the ACTU President, said on 3 August in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline>: </para><quote><para>Of the 1.6 million jobs created over the past 10 years, the bulk of them have gone to women. But 50% of those jobs are part-time or casual, which means that women are on $18,000 a year or less.</para></quote><para>A $20,000 tax-free threshold already exists for some lucky Australians. The value of the senior Australians tax offset means that qualifying single self-funded retirees and age pensioners have an effective tax-free threshold of $20,000. Why not extend the principle? Raising the tax-free threshold to $20,000 flows tax cuts right up through every income level, so all Australians would get a tax cut. It would cost a massive $19 billion a year. It would also mean about two million taxpayers would no longer be required to submit a tax return, with consequent administrative savings.</para><para>The sixth and last principle is to provide a fair productivity incentive to higher income earners. The top rate could kick in at $120,000, establishing a gap of $100,000 between those who pay no income tax and those who pay the highest tax. If tax rates were indexed, this relativity would remain constant in real terms. How to afford it? Just a few months ago the Treasurer was crying poverty. Then he found over $50 billion to splash out on an election spree. Where there is a political will, there is indeed a political way. You would have to set the principles you desire and then find the funds. Staging implementation over several years and determining priorities would help. Lower income Australians should undoubtedly come first, so the priority should be to raise the tax-free threshold. </para><para>Now for the costings: using all six principles, a rough estimate says this indicative tax scenario could cost about $52 billion over three years, less any savings that could be made elsewhere. Of course the criticism of my tax thoughts tonight will be cost, practicality and so on, but the political reality is that Australians will remain very unhappy about income tax until the bandaid is exchanged for a lasting cure. We all know that any tax policy can be structured in myriad ways. There are many other ways of addressing income tax reform than the ones I have put here. I am of the view that services expenditure takes a higher priority at present, but if Mr Howard and Mr Latham are determined on election tax cuts promises then what those should be needs debating. So next time some politician calls for real income tax cuts, the options I have outlined tonight are some you could debate with them. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Education: Universities</title><page.no>25444</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>25444</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to speak about the critical role that our universities can play as drivers of their local economies and communities and about how the Australian government is supporting this. The appropriate relationship between universities and their regional communities is not a new issue and in the past was often rather quaintly described as `town and gown'. At the most basic level, universities have a massive economic impact on the community they are located in, just by being there: by their massive size, by their number of staff, by their number of students and by what they simply buy and use in the local economy. This is particularly the case in small rural cities.</para></talk.start><para>Universities are uniquely placed to assist their communities in future economic, social and cultural development. There are few organisations today, other than a university or a higher education institution, that have the interest, independence, authority, networks, information, critical mass and longevity of existence to take on an economic development leadership role in a region free of outside organisational controls. However, to achieve maximum benefit, this needs to be a two-way process where the community actively involves itself in the planning, management and evolution of collaborative projects with the university. There is so much potential here, but the approach across Australia has been rather hit and miss and often dependent on the enthusiasm of particular individuals in a university and a community who, of course, may move on.</para><para>The potential and the need for a more systematic approach has been recognised by the Australian government in a paper entitled <inline font-style="italic">Community and campus: the benefits of regional engagement</inline>. This has been prepared under the auspices of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson. The paper goes into the benefits of engagement and contains 10 top tips for communities seeking to engage with their local university. Finally, it has a profile of a fully engaged university. In Australia no university could be described as fully engaged with its community, and the Australian experience has been patchy. However, 84 significant regional engagements by universities have been identified by Garlick and Prior in 2002. Of Australia's 39 universities, nine scored zero. The leader, the University of South Australia, developed 13 significant engagements. Coming equal second with Charles Sturt University and La Trobe University was the University of Newcastle with eight—a good result, but the potential is still enormous.</para><para>At the turn of the century, I was making many speeches in the parliament and the community on the importance of regions. I became particularly interested in the key aspect of engagement: the role of the universities as key drivers of their local regional economies and communities. I took part of my study leave in 2000 to look at the importance of universities as drivers of regional economies. In Scotland I examined the ways in which the new Scottish parliament decided to really get behind education and economic development in the highlands and islands for a population that is now down to half a million people. The initiative they took up was called the University of the Highlands and Islands Project. They combined a number of university campuses, research institutes, 17 TAFE campuses and 50 other learning centres and put them all together in a new university. Then they linked that all up with high-bandwidth technology. The ultimate aim was a better educated population and, with high bandwidth throughout the islands and highlands, the generation of economic activity and jobs, driven by a university that was engaging with its community. </para><para>The Scottish model is an example of how university-community engagement could hold the potential for transforming regions. The potential exists here in Australia, and the government and community expect that the resources directed to higher education should allow universities to meet identified needs in the community, including its economic and social wellbeing. Individual regions, through their distinctiveness, are often better placed than nation states to develop competitive advantages for their local industries. By focusing on their areas of research strength and improving their linkages with industry in their region as well as in their local communities, universities are in a unique position to transfer knowledge and skills into initiatives for economic growth, environmental improvement and community development. Many universities are already active in engaging industry in collaborative partnerships. Universities could become a mechanism for ensuring that Australian regional communities are not bypassed by the knowledge economy, by offering technology and expertise to both community members and businesses to increase competitiveness and sustainability in their region.</para><para>The best regional universities have a strong relationship with their communities in addition to such partnerships. The form of the relationship, based on the university community service obligation, can contribute significantly to the social and cultural enrichment of a community. This can be achieved in a variety of ways, such as making university facilities available to the community, becoming involved in local projects, tailoring specific courses for regional needs and providing research expertise in partnership with local farmers and businesses. Universities can become active in raising the expectations and aspirations of the community as well as upgrading regional skills. Engagement needs to become an integral part of what the regional university does, not just an adjunct to teaching and research. Teaching and research form only two parts of the traditional academic triumvirate. The third part is community engagement, which has tended to come a distant third to teaching and research in the traditional assessment of the work of academics. A culture of publish or perish continues to prevail in universities, where service to the community goes largely unrewarded in respect of career advancement for scholars and the funding of universities. It should be part of their core business and be seen as being academically relevant and recognised as an important contribution to the overall role of the university.</para><para>Last year I delivered the opening address at the National University Community Engagement conference, called Inside/Out, at the University of Queensland. The keynote address was delivered by Sir David Watson, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Brighton in the UK, who quoted from a paper issued by the Association of Commonwealth Universities in describing engagement as now being `a core value' of universities. He said:</para><quote><para>Engagement implies strenuous, thoughtful, argumentative interaction with the non-university world in at least four spheres: setting universities' aims, purposes and priorities; relating teaching and learning to the wider world; the back-and-forth dialogue between researchers and practitioners; and taking on wider responsibilities as neighbours and citizens.</para></quote><para>Engagement is a two-way process. Both parties need to agree on mutual objectives, which may include job generation, business and investment growth, and increased participation. The notion of extending and deepening university engagement with communities features prominently in the Australian government's initiatives in higher education. The government has embraced a broad framework to progress the educational, economic and social needs of regions through partnerships between the community, education institutions, business and governments at all levels. It is already the case that, as part of formal reporting through the profile process, the Australian government requires universities to advise on the extent of their community and social engagement. Under the new institution assessment framework to be introduced this year, community engagement will continue to be given weight in the reporting process. The regional loading initiatives will deliver $122.6 million over four years. To be introduced from next year, they reflect in part recognition of the particularly vital role that non-metropolitan institutions and campuses play in providing for the educational, economic and social needs of regions through partnerships between the community, educational institutions, business and governments at all levels. </para><para>The measures specifically recognise the unique contribution made by regional higher education institutions and campuses to their local communities in providing access to higher education to students from rural and regional areas. These are in recognition that universities which provide places at regional campuses face higher costs as a result of location, size and history. They also often have less potential to diversify revenue sources, and a narrower industrial base in rural areas provides fewer opportunities for commercial partnerships. Also, one of the initial priorities of the collaboration and structural reform program under the 2003 higher education legislation will be to fund projects which involve collaboration between universities and their communities, with $36 million being committed over four years. The Australian government believes that our universities need to be responsive to broader community needs and aspirations. In its higher education reforms, the Australian government has established a policy framework that allows the higher education sector to more easily respond to identified community needs. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Veterans: Health Services</title><page.no>25446</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>25446</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to speak about the health of veterans, and in particular about health effects of service where the medical science has failed to provide the necessary linkage to enable compensation claims to be accepted. In particular I want to address what I believe to be a serious failing in the system to deal properly with this problem. Within the veteran and ex-service community for more than 50 years there has been a degree of dissatisfaction with people's inability to obtain compensation and treatment for what they believe to be service related and service caused injuries and illnesses. </para></talk.start><para>Throughout Australia's military history, particularly since World War II, there have been a number of hazardous exposures for which adequate answers have never been forthcoming. I say from the outset that this is not part of some compensation syndrome. Regrettably, within our community we have a considerable number of ex-service people who were exposed to hazardous substances and who reasonably believe that their illnesses should be attributed to that exposure. Yet the medical and scientific evidence linking the exposure to the illness does not exist or, more to the point, governments have repeatedly said that it does not exist—or, if it does, the factual history and the records of that exposure are insufficient to prove the case.</para><para>In some cases the research simply has not been done. Let me cite some examples. Those who served with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force—otherwise known as BCOF—in Japan after 1946 believe that their mortality rate and illnesses are directly attributable to exposure to atomic fallout following the detonation of atomic bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Some who served in Korea believe they were exposed to a mix of hazardous chemicals. Individually and in combination, these chemicals are believed to have had serious adverse health effects. Those who participated in the British atomic tests in Australia in the 1950s also believe their exposure to fallout has affected their health. </para><para>Vietnam veterans in general, in both Australia and the United States, have long pressed for greater recognition and research into the effects of Agent Orange. Since the Vietnam War we have had the Gulf War of 1991, and deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq as well as East Timor and Bougainville. Each of these deployments has had its own unique characteristics—with different patterns of health problems and compensation issues. From the Gulf War we have had what is generically called the Gulf War syndrome, and wrapped up in that are fears about depleted uranium, smoke inhaled from oil fires and the effects of vaccination programs.</para><para>In every case, some or many of those deployed have experienced ill health on return home. However, the history has been that, with respect to compensation and treatment, linking the service with the illness has been difficult. For BCOF, for example, successive governments have accepted only limited liability for exposure to radiation. The data gathered at the time, it is said, show such a low order of exposure that a causal link cannot be accepted. The campaign by BCOF members, now all in their 70s and 80s, has been unrelenting. The further complication is that the refusal to accept exposure to radiation is also used by government to deny that BCOF was in any way a dangerous deployment. It is only in recent times that government has relented and has agreed to undertake a mortality and cancer incidence study.</para><para>It is tragic that this concession has taken over 50 years. As many veterans often say, `We'll all be dead before they concede.' Likewise, with those who served in the peacetime atomic testing program of the 1950s, governments have continually denied liability. But those affected—or those just concerned for their collective welfare—have never accepted that denial. Again, 50 years after the event, government has agreed to review the data and to conduct a mortality and cancer incidence study. And it is not unreasonable to expect that the change in the quality of scientific research in the intervening period might be sufficient to have the questions re-examined. Research conducted in the United Kingdom over recent years, for example—at the University of Dundee, in particular—once disparaged by the bureaucracy in Canberra, has now achieved a level of credibility. So there has at last been some progress.</para><para>The experience of Agent Orange remains with us also. Many Vietnam veterans earnestly believe that their health—and their children's health—has been affected by their exposure. Although some cancers and children's disabilities have been accepted, again there has been denial based on lack of research findings. In fact the research that is most relied upon, the Ranch Hand study, has now been said to have been corrupted. Without going into the detail, one can see the pattern.</para><para>The Gulf War syndrome met with denial. Yet there was no denying that veterans returning from the Gulf in 1991 were afflicted with a range of illnesses. In the United States, the reaction at the time was the same—denial. Veterans were told that there was no such thing as Gulf War syndrome, and this was supported by the Repatriation Medical Authority here in Australia. Yet people were sick, and without explanation. It was years before any action was taken. Conventional medicine refused to accept it, and the research had not been done. Research is now under way, especially in the US and the UK—who deployed the largest number of troops. </para><para>In Australia we have had a very useful Gulf War health survey, which is an excellent start. But the point is that, in this case and in every other case, the first reaction has been denial. This pattern seems to be entrenched. In every case, governments around the world have been dragged unwillingly to reopen the cases. We need to understand the feelings of veterans who remain dissatisfied with government responses to their claims. It is a sad fact that governments worldwide rely heavily on their defence personnel. They recruit them with promises of a rich and rewarding career, train them and maintain them. But when their usefulness has finished, they drop them back into society without much thought about their future.</para><para>The lucky ones will have skills of value in the marketplace. If they do not have those skills, they seem to suffer the problems of labour market failure and all the stresses associated with life after service—hence the significance of health care and, of course, compensation. Unfortunately, there are some—maybe many—who attribute their poor physical or mental health and their general lack of life fulfilment to their service life. The system seems to have trouble coping with these individuals.</para><para>I would like to mention here that in my office a large proportion of the contact made by ex-service people concerns the treatment they are currently receiving from the Military Compensation and Rehabilitation Service. In some cases, people are virtually accused of being malingerers. Whatever the truth might be in any one case, there remains a problem. It would seem to me that, here again, the problem is one of denial—either that or the bureaucracy is simply not set up to manage it properly. Fundamentally, though, I suspect the problem is one of corporate attitude. The focus of Defence, quite naturally, is the effective sharp end. The downstream problem is never acknowledged. This is collateral damage for someone else to look after and pay for. It is instructive to consider that the budget for Veterans' Affairs is currently around $10.6 billion per annum. The budget for Defence is around $16.3 billion.</para><para>The downstream costs of military service for health care and the compensation of veterans alone are very substantial—and this does not include the post-service costs of those ex-service people who are not veterans with entitlements under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. On the other hand, as representatives of taxpayers, we must be certain that compensation is paid only for real liabilities. We must be sure that those liabilities are being properly managed. Of this we can have little confidence, as Defence are on the record as saying that they cannot be accountable for the costs of what happens at the sharp end. This, of course, is nonsense.</para><para>The size of the current liability for injury compensation alone—$1.4 billion—is a symptom in itself. At Veterans' Affairs no liability has ever been calculated—except to say that, with a budget of over $1.3 billion for disability pensions this year, the cost for the future, even allowing for the passing of the World War II generation, will be enormous. The Senate would be aware that this is currently the subject of an inquiry by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee. The committee is due to report shortly. I will therefore resume on this subject when the report is tabled. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Caboolture Region: Education</title><page.no>25449</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>25449</page.no><name role="metadata">Moore, Sen Claire</name><name role="display">Senator MOORE</name><name.id>00AOQ</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Over the past few months I have been fortunate to attend a number of citizenship ceremonies in several regions in Queensland. I know many other people in this place have had that same pleasure. Tonight I want to concentrate on some of the families with whom I spoke a few weeks ago in the community of Caboolture. This is a rapidly growing area slightly north of Brisbane where I am based. It has been growing, with many families of all ages. It is growing not just because of people who have made the quite significant choice to move from other countries to take up citizenship and to live in this part of the world; it is a part of Queensland which is developing at an amazing rate. In several of the local government areas there we have some of the highest numbers of young people under the age of 16 in the country. Significantly, in the same geographic region we also have one of the highest populations of people over 65. Those people are living together in a burgeoning society.</para></talk.start><para>Some of the families with whom I spoke at the citizenship ceremony a few weeks ago talked about why they had made the choice to live in that part of the world. One of the common themes of parents was that they wished to give their kids real opportunity; they wished to have choices. They wanted their kids to have chances that they may have missed out on themselves. One of the common themes, of course, was the opportunity to have a full and effective education. They were talking about the kind of education that was available to them in the Caboolture area. There are a large number of primary schools and secondary schools there, and many kids are working together and having that chance of a full and effective education. But an ongoing theme for the parents in that area was that they wanted to see more options for post-secondary education.</para><para>There is a really good model in place in that community. I am sorry that Senator Tierney has gone, because many of his comments this evening concerned exactly the kinds of things that we were talking about at that meeting. We were talking about the value of educational facilities to the local community, and in particular the value of post-secondary schools—which can be attended not only by students following the sequence from primary to secondary and into tertiary education but by people of all ages. This gives people a choice—a chance to take on study that they can access, that they can decide and that they can then benefit from at any one time.</para><para>In the Caboolture community there is a model in place. It is a cooperative model. It is one that sees the local TAFE college, the Brisbane North Institute of TAFE, collaborate with the Queensland University of Technology—known as QUT. They have formed the Caboolture Community Campus, which, it is hoped, will live and grow in the community of Caboolture so that it can be part of that community and so that people can make the choice to be educated there.</para><para>In the Caboolture area there are great expectations and there is great hope. People have had many promises made to them. Before the last election the local federal member made a promise that a local university would be put in place in the area. The years have gone past, and whilst the model is there—whilst there is an effective TAFE college and the QUT is a sponsoring group—the university has not grown. People in the community have had their expectations raised and they have had hopes about the kinds of study that would be available there, but the actual university places—the ones that were promised in the hurly-burly of the last campaign—have not come through. </para><para>That is something we should strongly consider—when you make a promise, when you say something is going to happen, you have to look at what needs to happen to make it work. Promises of university places do not make a university. What a truly successful university needs is really effective engagement by the local community. It needs all levels of the education community to work together and to be part of the new model. It needs the full and very active cooperation of all levels of government. We know that can be difficult because people have their own agendas, their own plans and their own budgets, but sometimes things rise above those kinds of problems. Indeed, the expectations of the local community must be acknowledged, and I think there is a responsibility to fulfil those expectations. As I have said, promises do not make universities. What we have at the moment is a co-location campus which seems to be working in a really good way. There is a real hope that people who have taken the choice to go through the TAFE program will see that they have the skills, the abilities and the support required to take that next step and go on to another form of learning.</para><para>This model is working very effectively in another part of Queensland—in the Logan area, which I have been lucky enough to visit many times. I have been fortunate to be involved in the Mick Young Scholarship Trust. The Mick Young scholarships are funded in his memory by people who knew and respected Mick Young. One of the things he stood for was real opportunity for all people, regardless of their income or background. The Mick Young scholarships are formulated to give that immediate support to people so they can take that next step with their studies. At the Logan campus, which is on the other side of Brisbane, I was able to talk with a number of young people—and with people who were not in the first blush of youth—who were able to access Mick Young scholarship money and make the choice to continue their studies. These were people who had come back into the education process through a whole range of motivations: some through illness and some through having to make a career change because of an accident or lack of job opportunities in their own sphere. They were given the chance to test themselves in tertiary education, and they found they were succeeding. That gave them new hope and new chances to continue with a whole range of options that until then had not been open to them. In fact, they had not even considered them.</para><para>There is a real opportunity for that kind of process to now occur in the Caboolture area. The promises made before the last election campaign must be translated into action. There needs to be confidence at the local level that a wider range of courses can be provided in the area. That is what we need instead of people having to think at one level, to restrain their thinking and to be forced into choices that perhaps are not theirs—having to do that because they cannot get transport to other areas, because the nearest tertiary education options for nursing and other kinds of courses they may want to do are up to two hours away and because they cannot get there easily and do not feel safe doing the travel.</para><para>It is about time that, as a community in Caboolture, we put aside any short-term fixes or selfish desire for the immediate photo opportunity or the immediacy of getting our pictures in the paper for whatever reason and ensure that the issues of the people around us are considered as a primary cause. We can work to put the model in place—the kind of model Senator Tierney was talking about in other regions of the country and overseas—so that the real value of having education facilities at the local level can be experienced. We must collaborate to effectively put this in place. The Caboolture Community Campus model can move forward. There would be a wider range of courses available and more students would have the chance to see whether courses there might fit them—might aid them in their job search or in their transition from one place to another. They would be able to get the study chances that many other people get—and not just in large capital cities. We talk about hope and opportunity. I think this kind of process at the local level puts hope and opportunity into practice. We should be able to achieve much more than promises; we should make sure that the reality meets the expectation and we should ensure that those people receive the kinds of education options they deserve. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Community Services: Domestic Violence</title><page.no>25451</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>25451</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to speak tonight on the topic of violence and abuse. My Democrat colleagues and I have spoken a number of times about domestic violence, violence towards children and sexual assault of children. I have also spoken a number of times about animal cruelty. Tonight I would like to outline the links between those topics. It is an important area that we need to recognise. There is a clear and growing recognition of the links between cruelty towards animals and cruelty towards humans—who are, of course, just another form of animal, in many respects. Recently, US psychologist Professor Frank Ascione visited Australia and gave a number of lectures around the country. I would certainly recommend that anybody who is interested in the topic of violence in the home and violence in the family—particularly on the preventative side, but also in identifying and dealing with it after the fact—should examine the work of people such as Professor Ascione.</para></talk.start><para>If we are serious about trying to reduce the extent of violence in the home and violence towards children and identifying potential offenders in the early stages, we have to look at all the identifiers and all the indicators that might suggest problems are there or are developing. A clear link—and research has shown this more and more—is with cruelty towards animals. Some people may have an instinctive feeling that if people get their anger out towards an animal then perhaps they will have gotten it out of their system and they will be less likely to be violent or aggressive towards humans. The evidence does not show that; the evidence shows that there is a continuum. This is important in identifying areas where violence may be occurring, particularly domestic violence and violence towards children, and not being detected. It is perhaps more important in the area of prevention—trying to identify problem behaviour early before it develops into something far more serious. </para><para>In its extreme case the links are certainly there when you look at the evidence. The vast majority of people involved in serious violent crime—in murder and particularly serial murder; serial killers as we call them—far more than the percentage of the general community, have also been involved in repeated acts of cruelty towards animals and in many cases from a young age. Their first signs of problem behaviour involved significant torture of and cruelty towards animals. If that can be identified and recognised as a serious problem at a younger age then perhaps we can intervene earlier and prevent far more serious acts of violence down the track. It is also important in terms of identifying violence that is occurring now. </para><para>This topic is also one, I am pleased to say, that organisations that deal with animals, such as the Veterinary Association—vets being in a profession that obviously at its core deals with animals—have raised. What do vets do if they are treating an animal that they suspect or believe has been injured deliberately by an owner, by a neighbour or by someone else? At the moment there is really no clear pathway for them to follow to report their suspicions or their concerns. We have moved towards mandatory reporting of suspicions of child abuse these days from teachers and others in some of the helping professions, but it is not there from vets. There are different views about whether there should be mandatory reporting by vets. I do not want to get into that. What I would say is that we need to establish from the start a clear procedure for vets to follow. Who do they report to? At the moment it is not clear. Many of them report reporting it to the police, for example, and having nothing happen. There is, firstly, no clear pathway for veterinarians to follow and, secondly, no clear process at the other end of how to deal with these complaints and not enough recognition that they are potentially serious. </para><para>If you look at some of the research that has been done in the US and is starting to be done in Australia—and I think it is an area where we should be looking at more research—many of the women who go to domestic violence shelters who have pets or animals in the home will report that their pet had also been mistreated by the perpetrator. That in itself clearly shows that, if you have a vet that suspects the animal has been injured deliberately and there are children in the home, they also could well be at risk.</para><para>Another issue that comes into play and has also been shown to be a relevant factor is that women will stay in an abusive relationship because they have animals they do not want to leave behind. Shelters, not surprisingly, have difficulty in taking pets and animals. The women—and often the children, if it is the child's pet—do not want to leave that animal behind to face potential further cruelty. If the animal has already been abused and they are aware of that practice, they do not want to leave it behind, so they are more likely to stay in that unsafe situation. Anything that is identified as a barrier to somebody leaving an unsafe situation rather than getting to a place of safety is something that we need to identify and acknowledge. There have been attempts in various areas to provide opportunities for pets or animals to be put in kennels, catteries or other facilities like that free of charge or for a minimal fee for a temporary period for people in that situation. Again, those are the sorts of things that we need to recognise and identify in building these links that are clearly there.</para><para>Another area in this issue that I have spoken on a number of times is the need for a more consistent national approach to animal welfare in terms of both enforcement of the laws as well as commonality of laws—again, as an indication of the seriousness of theses sorts of behaviours. It is one of the reasons why I believe we need to get stronger treatment and stronger concern from the judiciary about instances of blatant and extreme animal cruelty. People in Queensland, in particular—and I think in other parts of the country also—would recall the widespread community outrage with the perverse cruelty and killing of a number of kittens by some armed forces personnel in Townsville in northern Queensland. That caused a huge outrage in the community and indeed caused at least two questions in this chamber by Senator Moore—a fellow Queensland senator—who spoke before me. When the initial sentence for those people was brought down there was widespread outrage from the community that it was insufficient. From memory I think it was then raised by the relevant minister and appealed on the grounds of the sentence being insufficient.  </para><para>It might be a bit ironic for a Democrat to be in here calling for a tougher law and order approach and tougher sentences. I am not necessarily talking about that. What I am talking about is the need to recognise that these are serious offences—not necessarily that they need to have tougher sentences, but that they need to be treated as something that is not just trivial or a few blokes that got drunk and decided to tie a cat to the back of their ute and drag it around until it got killed.</para><para>It does not follow that A automatically leads to B but it is a clear indication of a much higher risk factor of inappropriate degrees of violence in other situations. We need to, firstly, recognise that the link is clearly there in research and, secondly, put in place processes to deal with identification of animal cruelty that appears to be deliberately inflicted, whether it is early intervention with children who might need assistance, counselling or other behavioural management, the investigation of a potential risk situation in a household or something like that. The first thing is to take it seriously, which is starting to be done. The second thing is to listen to the calls of those in the professions, such as vets and those in the domestic violence and child abuse area, and put in place consistent systems across the country that will enable the tracking of this behaviour, and intervention and prevention whenever possible. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Townsville City Council</title><page.no>25453</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>25453</page.no><name role="metadata">Brandis, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator BRANDIS</name><name.id>008W7</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise this evening to return to a topic I have previously raised in this place—that is, the proper management of the Townsville City Council. I draw the Senate's attention to recent media reports in the <inline font-style="italic">Townsville Bulletin</inline> regarding the employment by the Townsville City Council, which is a council dominated by members of the Australian Labor Party, of the Labor candidate for Herbert and former Labor member for the state seat of Thuringowa, Ms Anita Phillips. It was revealed on the weekend that Ms Phillips had been on the council's payroll as a consultant researcher for the last four months, only coming off the payroll when questions were asked about the appropriateness of her employment. She was given a position at the council starting on 5 April this year, which was due to expire three months later. At the end of that three months, she was given an additional month's extension, but none of that was publicly known until last week. </para></talk.start><para>In the <inline font-style="italic">Townsville Bulletin</inline> on Saturday, 31 July, the two non-Labor Townsville councillors publicly raised questions about Ms Phillips's employment. The two non-Labor councillors sought information about the nature of Ms Phillips's employment by the council and the process by which Ms Phillips was hired. The two non-Labor councillors wanted to be sure that Ms Phillips was not on the council's payroll in a nonexistent job. The ratepayers of Townsville have been told that Ms Phillips's position was to `provide project management advice and assistance to staff'. No further information has been forthcoming. The ratepayers were not told what public benefit they would get from Ms Phillips's employment and what assistance she brought to the council that the current staff could not already provide. It is quite clear that Ms Phillips was the beneficiary of a nonexistent job, chewing up time on the council's payroll before the federal election. Let there be no mistake: Ms Phillips's employment was in a nonexistent position created entirely for her convenience and benefit.</para><para>It has been disclosed that Ms Phillips was the only person interviewed for this position. Despite the council receiving six other applications and despite at least one other applicant scoring only four points short of Ms Phillips's 41 points in the short-listing process, Ms Phillips was still the only person interviewed. Armed with this information, it would seem that the council was determined to interview only one person for the position: Ms Anita Phillips. </para><para>When these questions were raised in the Townsville media, no Labor councillor was prepared to publicly support Ms Phillips. Instead of the Labor Mayor Tony Mooney or his eight Labor councillors defending the decision to employ Ms Phillips, the council's human resources manager, Mr Alan Hollway, defended the decision to employ Ms Phillips. So who is Mr Alan Hollway? As the human resources manager at the council, Mr Hollway is responsible for the recruitment practices of the council and for ensuring proper human resources policies are implemented. You would expect Mr Hollway to ensure that a job is not created or a person is not given a job that cannot be justified.</para><para>But ratepayers of Townsville are entitled to be sceptical about Mr Hollway's ability to keep his political opinions and allegiances out of the council's recruitment processes. Astute readers of the <inline font-style="italic">Townsville Bulletin </inline>would recognise that Alan Hollway is quite clearly a very partisan council manager. We know this to be the case because of Mr Hollway's letter to the <inline font-style="italic">Townsville Bulletin </inline>editor on 5 June this year, in which he viciously attacked the current member for Herbert, Mr Lindsay, and several other senior government ministers over a number of issues. Mr Hollway is, by his own admission in the local media, clearly a strong supporter of the Labor candidate and is Labor Party partisan.</para><para>So after the proper inquiries were made the following was clear: Ms Phillips was the only person to be interviewed for the position, all other applicants did not get a look in and the person overseeing the recruitment process at council is, by his own acknowledgment in the <inline font-style="italic">Townsville Bulletin</inline>, a Labor Party partisan and an opponent of the incumbent federal member, Mr Lindsay. I remind you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that Ms Phillips is the Labor candidate for Herbert. Here we quite clearly have a case of a manager hiring and firing at the council who obviously wants to help Ms Phillips in the lead-up to the federal election.</para><para>To make matters worse, I am advised by a couple of sources within the council that Ms Phillips's employment contract was going to get an additional extension past 27 July, but that plan was knocked on the head when authorities higher up than Mr Hollway realised the inappropriateness and unjustifiable nature of the contract and when legitimate questions about her employment were raised by the two non-Labor councillors. This is nothing short of a rort. A job has been created for Ms Phillips. When it appeared that the federal election would not be as early as some in the Labor Party in Townsville thought, Ms Phillips's contract was extended to help her through to the federal election.</para><para>The ratepayers of Townsville honestly cannot be expected to believe that Ms Phillips's contract was a bona fide job when the work that she undertook cannot be identified or justified, when the contract was extended when it became apparent that there would not be an early federal election and when she was the only candidate out of six applicants to be interviewed in the recruitment process by an announced Labor Party partisan. It is quite clear that this is nothing but a job for a Labor mate. Townsville ratepayers' money should not be used to create bogus positions as consultants or researchers by the Labor Party for their mates, let alone for their parliamentary candidates. The mayor and councillors owe it to the ratepayers to ensure that their rates have not been squandered to create a job for Ms Phillips during her electioneering. Placing Ms Phillips on a contract to give project management advice to the council staff is an insult to the staff's professionalism. The ratepayers of Townsville deserve to know exactly what work Ms Phillips did for the people of Townsville while she was campaigning for federal parliament and why they should have to pick up the cost of her employment. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health and Ageing: Aged Care</title><page.no>25455</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>25455</page.no><name role="metadata">Wong, Sen Penny</name><name role="display">Senator WONG</name><name.id>00AOU</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to speak briefly on the important issue of aged care, a subject and policy area which, in recent times, has received insufficient attention from the members of this government and from the parliament. In South Australia currently, the union which covers many aged care workers, the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union, is conducting a campaign to try to raise the profile of some of the important and problematic issues in the area of aged care. The campaign is entitled Shine the Light on Aged Care and it is one which involves not only workers from the aged care sector but also residents and their families as well as members of the wider community.</para></talk.start><para>Over the weekend, workers in the aged care sector, members of the union, conducted a phone-in in which members of the public, workers in the sector, family members of residents and others could phone in and lodge their complaints or give their views about what was happening in the aged care sector. The results were quite alarming and confirmed what many of us already know: this government has presided over a deterioration in the quality of aged care services in this country. It is important to note that the complaints made in the phone-in were not only from workers in the industry but also from residents and their families. In fact, around 48 per cent of the complaints made in the phone-in were from residents and their families. A number of case studies were gathered together as a result of that phone-in.</para><para>For example, there were examples given of care staff members having halved in one facility over the last few years and extra wings being built without any increases in staff resources to attend to the extra beds with consequent decline in levels and standards of care to residents. There were complaints about the care work `production line'. Care workers were allocated insufficient time to provide care for a resident. One example given was 3½ minutes per resident to wake, shower and dress the resident for breakfast. There were cost-cutting measures reported, measures which clearly affect the quality of care. Some examples were one tablespoon of vitamised food for a resident's dinner or an apple pie cut into 47 separate serves for residents, the use of large baby wipes instead of linen for hygiene and residents only being allowed weekly showers. There were also complaints made about the eviction of residents from their facilities and their contracts being dishonoured.</para><para>These are only some of the alarming case studies which were gathered as a result of this phone-in. The story that is painted is what many of us suspect and what many people know. The sector is being starved of funds to employ well-trained workers and this has resulted in poor quality of care and a reduction in services to residents. It is a sad comment in this country that some of our lowest paid workers are those who give the care to our elderly and also those who give care to the nation's children. Why is it that aged care and child-care workers are amongst the lowest paid in the country? These are the people who do such important work. These are also people who entirely missed out on any of the income tax cuts given by this government. There are many in the sector who work long hours for low pay in extremely difficult conditions. There are many unsung heroes. </para><para>I want to talk about just one of them. Her name is Joy Wyatt and she is a worker at Semaphore Residential Care Centre. She is a kitchen hand and she is also a union delegate. She spoke to a rally, which was part of the campaign, over the weekend and gave a very moving account from the heart and also from the coalface. She made this point: </para><quote><para>When serving morning/afternoon teas I find myself struggling to balance my workload against residents' requests and needs to such a point that I feel it is not only stressful but also unacceptable.</para><para>Whenever you try to discuss these issues with management you hear the same excuse—lack of funding to increase hours. Everyone is so starved of time to do their job.</para></quote><para>As Joy says:</para><quote><para>So to improve the quality of care for our elderly people we need to keep working together.</para></quote><para>This is what Joy says and this is certainly what she and other workers in the industry have done. Not only have they conducted the phone-in, organised a rally, put posters up around the city and distributed information about aged care but they have also started a petition. There is a wonderful story about Joy, who is an avid Port Power supporter, not only taking the petition with her to the football over the weekend and getting it signed by members of the public at the game but also managing to get a whole range of signatures from Port Power officials and players as well. That is quite an achievement and I look forward to the Adelaide Crows similarly supporting this campaign on aged care.</para><para>I congratulate Joy Wyatt and her colleagues on the work that they are doing. As Joy says:</para><quote><para>If we care for aged care, it's time to treat our workers fair!</para></quote><para>Adequate staffing levels and fair wages in aged care must be part of funding arrangements for aged care if we are to achieve decent services for residents and if we are to redress the unfair low wages paid to these workers. I congratulate Joy on her work and I congratulate the union on their campaign to Shine the Light on Aged Care. I hope this will be a campaign issue in the forthcoming federal election. It should be. It is an important issue: it is an issue that goes to the heart of what we are as a community and the dignity and respect that we afford those people who are elderly and unable to care for themselves. It is an issue on which we as a nation can do far better.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 8.14

senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	The Australian Government has undertaken significant reform of the telecommunications sector since 1996, most notably the development of an open and competitive market, supported by a responsible regulatory safety net. </para><para>For those areas where the competitive environment has not adequately delivered improved infrastructure and services, the Government has been providing direct targeted funding support through grants programs, tenders and subsidies. Funding is being delivered via a number of mechanisms, including the Networking the Nation community grants program; the Social Bonus community grants programs and targeted funding initiatives; the Telecommunications Service Inquiry tenders and grants programs; and the Regional Telecommunications Inquiry initiatives.</para><para>More than $1 billion has been allocated to these and other communications initiatives aimed at improving telecommunications services in regional, rural and remote areas of Australia. </para><para>Telstra was successful in winning a number of the tenders noted above, including those for mobile phone services in towns with populations above 500 people, towns with populations below 500 people, and for selected regional highways. The resulting contracts amounted to $21.8m, $18.8m and $19.1m respectively. Telstra also won the tender to upgrade services in the most remote parts of the country (the “Extended Zones”). This contract amounted to $150m. </para><para>Data is also available on certain other mobile phone tenders that Telstra was successful in winning, including individual tenders through the Networking the Nation program and the Wireless West program. In total Telstra received subsidies under these programs of $48.6m. </para><para>However, given the structure of the funding arrangements for many of the initiatives it is not readily possible to state the total level of funding that Telstra has received. For example, under the Networking the Nation program and some of the Social Bonus initiatives, funds were allocated by the independent NTN Board to not-for-profit bodies who may have subsequently entered into a commercial partnership with Telstra (or another carrier) to complete the project. Data has not been captured on the funds that Telstra may have received from these processes.</para><para>(2)	The objective for the provision of Government funding support is to help bridge the gaps between urban and non-urban Australia in terms of the range, availability and cost of telecommunications services.</para><para>In circumstances where Telstra received Government funding as the result of, for example, competitive tender processes, fee for service or matching funding arrangements, there would have been some benefits to all shareholders in the organisation. In this regard, it is also worth noting that a number of fully privatised companies have been successful tenderers and the recipients of Government funding support for communications initiatives. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003</title><page.no>25465</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2421)</subtitle><id.no>2421</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>25465</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 28 November 2003:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	When does the Government plan to reintroduce the Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No 2) 2003 into the Senate.</para><para>(2)	Given that Ms Catherine Smith of the Attorney General's Department stated during the inquiry by the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee into the Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003, that the intention of the bill was not to disconnect individuals' phone services: will the Government consider the recommendation in the committee's minority report that the provisions of the bill that potentially enable the Government to disconnect individuals' telephone services be redrafted. </para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>25465</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Arts and Sport</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	The Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No 2) 2003 was passed by both Houses of Parliament on 1 April 2004 and came into force on 21 April 2004.</para><para>(2)	When the Government reintroduced the Bill in the Senate on 1 April 2004, the Government proposed amendments to the Bill that addressed concerns raised by the Senate Committee.

(AFP) received $6.84m over four years commencing 2002-03 under the Government's E-Security National Agenda Initiative. Within the AFP, E-Security is one small element of the broader High Tech Crime type, which incorporates crimes purely involving computer systems, such as denial of service attacks and hacking, and the use of technology to facilitate other crimes such as drug smuggling, terrorism and fraud. The funding received has been used to develop the AFP's capacity to investigate these crimes through developing specific skills, including computer forensics and electronic evidence retrieval.</para><para>(2)	With the funding provided under the initiative, the AFP has appointed a Director to oversee the operations of the AHTCC. It has also funded four investigator positions, one intelligence position, four computer forensic staff and three specialists. </para><para>	The AFP operates under a flexible team's model within a functional structure. Employees are directed to matters as they arise, in accordance with organisational priorities and operational requirements. It is therefore not useful to detail numbers of personnel dedicated to any particular crime type, as this will vary from time to time. It is not practical to compare AFP employment bands and salaries with APS levels, as AFP employment terms and conditions vary considerably to those which apply in the broader public service. </para><para>(3)	See the answer provided to (2).</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Veterans: Rent Assistance</title><page.no>25487</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2670)</subtitle><id.no>2670</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>25487</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator Mark Bishop</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 4 March 2004:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	With reference to the Government's package of additional benefits for veterans announced on 2 March 2004, why is rent assistance for war widows postponed until March 2005, as stated in the Minister's press release.</para><para>(2)	Of the 45 000 veterans said to benefit from the exemption of disability pensions from the Centrelink means test, can a breakdown be provided showing: (a) Totally and Permanently Incapacitated (TPI), (b) Intermediate Rate, and (c) other veterans.</para><para>(3)	For those ex-service people in receipt of a Disability Support Pension from Centrelink who do not have any other income, what will be the net benefit from this measure for a single person.</para><para>(4)	Of the 19 000 persons estimated to benefit from the exemption of disability pension payments from the Centrelink means test, can a breakdown be provided showing: (a) age, (b) TPI, (c) Intermediate Rate, and (d) others.</para><para>(5)	Why is the new Defence Force Income Support Allowance (DFISA) being introduced in preference to changing the Social Security Act 1991. </para><para>(6)	Did the Minister and the Department of Family and Community Services refuse to amend the Act, resulting in the adoption of the DFISA alternative.</para><para>(7)	What will be the cost of implementing the DFISA.</para><para>(8)	What arrangements have been put in place between Centrelink and the department to exchange information on the rate of DFISA to be paid, and will there be a Memorandum of Understanding between Centrelink and the department on this matter.</para><para>(9)	(a) Will calculations be based on the same payday; and (b) what delay, if any, will occur between supply of rates and actual payment.</para><para>(10)	Given that only the above general rate of the special rate is to be indexed against the Consumer Price Index/Male Total Average Weekly Earnings, why was the whole special rate exempted from the Centrelink means test.</para><para>(11)	Does the exemption of the entire special rate from the Centrelink means test effectively remove the traditional distinction between benefits paid to those with qualifying service and those without; if so, what is the justification for this change, and is this a calculated and deliberate removal of the distinction, at least in part.</para><para>(12)	What is the average fortnightly increase to be paid to TPI recipients as the result of the indexation of the above general rate.</para><para>(13)	(a) Does the Government intend to introduce legislation in relation to the measures in the 2 March 2004 announcement; if so, when; and (b) what are the likely commencement dates of payment for each benefit.</para><para>(14)	How many dependant children of TPI veterans are there.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>25488</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator Coonan</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	The commencement date of the payment of rent assistance to war widows has been brought forward to 1 January 2005. This initiative will require a major data collection to verify up to date rent details for the approximately 11,500 war widows. The complexity of reprogramming and testing the rent assistance pension rules is compounded by the competing information technology priorities of implementing other major initiatives that also will provide significant benefits to the veteran community. These include general statutory increases, the implementation of the new Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 changes and implementation of the Defence Force Income Support Allowance (DFISA) with effect from 20 September 2004. </para><para>(2)	The question is confusing the two changes to the disability pension. There is no initiative to exempt disability pensions from the social security means test, see the answer to part (4) below. The specific initiative that refers to 45,000 veterans is the proposal to index amounts of disability pension in excess of the above general rate having regard to both movements in the Consumer Price Index and Male Total Average Weekly earnings.</para><para>As at 6 March 2004, approximately 43,970 persons were in receipt of above general rate disability pensions. These include approximately 28,423 special rate recipients including blind, totally and permanently incapacitated (T&amp;PI) and totally and temporarily incapacitated (TTI) veterans; 981 intermediate rate veterans and 14,557 veterans on other levels of above general rate disability pension. Growth patterns indicate that this population will soon exceed 45,000.</para><para>(3)	The actual rates of DFISA that will be payable as at 20 September 2004 are not currently available as they will be dependent on actual movements in the Consumer Price Index and Male Total Average Weekly Earnings. However, the net indicative benefits from DFISA based on the current rate for single disability support pensioners with no other income and not renting is as follows: </para><para>. $260.40 for special rate</para><para>. $164.88 for intermediate rate</para><para>. $127.38 for extreme disablement adjustment</para><para>. $68.92 for 100 per cent general rate</para><para>. $63.08 for 95 per cent general rate</para><para>. $57.23 for 90 per cent general rate</para><para>. $51.38 for 85 per cent general rate</para><para>. $45.54 for 80 per cent general rate</para><para>. $39.69 for 75 per cent general rate</para><para>. $33.84 for 70 per cent general rate</para><para>. $28.00 for 65 per cent general rate</para><para>. $22.15 for 60 per cent general rate</para><para>. $16.31 for 55 per cent general rate</para><para>. $10.46 for 50 per cent general rate</para><para>. $4.62 for 45 per cent general rate </para><para>. $0.00 for 0 to 40 per cent general rate</para><para>Single veterans who have a level of disability at 40 per cent or less, and who have no other income, already receive their full entitlement to disability support pension. </para><para>(4)	Detailed age data is not available. Of the total population of social security payment recipients, including those who receive Age Pension, Disability Support Pension, Carer Allowance, Parenting Payment, Newstart Allowance and other payments, 950 have T&amp;PI disability pension assessed, 75 have intermediate rate disability pension assessed and 18,940 have other rates of disability pension assessed. It should be noted that the numbers include both veterans and their partners. </para><para>(5)	and (6) The DFISA is a supplement that will be available under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (VEA) along with other veterans' entitlements such as the disability pension, pharmaceutical allowance and treatment. As such, it is appropriate that it be delivered by the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) as are all veterans' payments. </para><para>(7)	It is estimated that the total cost of implementing DFISA will be $99.6 million over a five-year period. This is made up of $81.1 million of administered funds and $18.5 million dollars of departmental funds spread across the Department of Family and Community Services (FACS), Centrelink, and DVA.</para><para>(8)	As part of the implementation process, DVA and Centrelink will negotiate a Memorandum of Understanding for the exchange of DFISA rate information.'</para><para>(9)	Payments of DFISA will be made on DVA's paydays with other veterans' entitlements payments. Entitlement will commence on 20 September 2004 and payment will reflect the daily entitlement from that time.</para><para>Centrelink and DVA's paydays are not aligned. DVA pays all recipients fortnightly on a Thursday whereas Centrelink makes payments on each working day and paydays are specific to each recipient. There will be an interval between the Centrelink assessment of social security eligibility/payability, and payment of DFISA by DVA. It should be noted however that the Centrelink income support payments and DVA's disability and DFISA payments will be calculated daily, effective from 20 September 2004. </para><para>(10)	Income support payments may be made by DVA where the pensioner has qualifying service or by Centrelink where the pensioner does not have qualifying service. The Government has decided that benefit values for those without access to service pension will be placed on a common basis with those with eligibility for service pension under the VEA. This will be achieved by introducing a new payment known as the DFISA, which will supplement those income support payments which are affected by the inclusion of DVA disability pension in Centrelink assessments. It should also be noted that receipt of the DFISA will not be limited to veterans who are receiving a disability pension greater than the general rate.  </para><para>The general rate disability pension is payable to people regardless of work capacity. The above general rate disability pension is paid to those more seriously disable, including those who can only work part time or not at all. It is therefore appropriate that only the above general rate disability pension is indexed by a wage index.</para><para>(11)	Disability pension, including the special rate, has not been exempted under social security law. Distinctions between veterans with qualifying service (QS) and those without QS continue and, in particular, eligibility for service pension (which includes an earlier pension age for veterans), eligibility for the issue of a Gold Card at age 70 and specific service pension Gold Card treatment provisions for eligible veterans and the exclusion of disability pension from the service pension income test remain. </para><para>(12)	There is only one amount that is the rate for T&amp;PI pensioners, hence there is no `average' increase. The special rate (including T&amp;PI) will be increased from $762.60 to $778.20 per fortnight with respect to the first indexation date on 20 March 2004.  This is an increase of $15.60 per fortnight on the September 2003 rate and $7.20 per fortnight higher than the special rate indexed by the Consumer Price Index alone. </para><para>(13)	(a) and (b) Yes. The Veterans' Entitlements (Clarke Review) Bill 2004 received Royal Assent on 30 June 2004. Several of the Government's initiatives required amendment to the VEA. These are:</para><para>i. increase in funeral benefit which will apply in respect of those who died on or after 1 July 2004;</para><para>ii. extend operational service to minesweeping and bomb/mine clearance service after World War II that meets the qualifying service requirements which will commence with effect 1 April 2004. </para><para>iii. extend an ex-gratia payment of $25,000 to all surviving prisoners of war held captive during the Korean War, or their widows or widowers, who were alive on 1 July 2003;</para><para>iv. introduce the DFISA, to be paid by my department to eligible veterans receiving income support from Centrelink, which will commence on 20 September 2004; </para><para>v. with the payment of rent assistance an increase in income support payments for eligible war widows/widowers will commence in January 2005; and</para><para>vi. index the component above the general rate for special rate, intermediate rate and extreme disablement adjustment disability pensions having regard to movements in the Consumer Price Index and Male Total Average Weekly Earnings, which will commence after amending legislation is passed with effect from 20 March 2004. </para><para>(14)	An exact number of dependant children of veterans who receive a special (T&amp;PI) rate of disability pension is not known. T&amp;PI veterans are not obliged to inform my department of this information and therefore any information recorded is not reliable. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Federal Police: Law Enforcement Powers</title><page.no>25490</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2754)</subtitle><id.no>2754</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>25490</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator Ludwig</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Justice and Customs, upon notice, on 26 March 2004:</para></talk.start><quote><para>What powers do Australian Federal Police have to enforce Commonwealth law within: (a) the 3 nautical miles of ocean immediately adjacent to Australian coastline; (b) Australia's territorial sea; (c) the `contiguous zone' of Australia's exclusive economic zone; and (d) Australia's exclusive economic zone. </para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>25491</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Ellison</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Many offences have extraterritorial application but the Australian Federal Police capacity to exercise powers to enforce those laws beyond the Australian coastline is dependent on the nature of the alleged activity, where that activity occurred and the jurisdictional reach of the particular legislation. </para><para>The Commonwealth Government participates in a national scheme which extends Australia's criminal laws offshore. The Government's legislative contribution to that scheme is the Crimes at Sea Act (Cth) 2000. The coastal States and the Northern Territory have complementary legislation.

Rather the scheme provides, in general terms, that State and Territory laws operate of their own force up to 12 nautical miles from shore. Thereafter, State and Territory laws are then applied as Commonwealth law from 12 to 200 nautical miles or to the continental shelf limit (whichever is further).

question:</para></talk.start><para>(1) and (2) Two environmental surveys were specifically commissioned for the Sunrise Gas Project which examined the proposed platform location, two alternative pipeline routes and three shallower banks to the south of the platform location. These surveys were conducted by Bowman Bishaw Gorham (BBG) in June 2000 and April/May 2001. </para><para>These studies were undertaken in the context of the findings of previous work in the broader region conducted by BBG and the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) at the Big Bank Shoals, the Bayu-Undan field and Sahul Shelf which found similar continental shelf assemblages to those described at Sunrise. </para><para>(3)	(a)	The environmental surveys by BBG form part of the baseline information for monitoring the environmental impact of the Sunrise Gas Project. In addition the proponent will undertake a supplementary marine survey prior to any construction activity. The survey will cover the project footprint area and a number of nearby shoals.</para><para>(b)	This baseline information will form the basis of ongoing environmental monitoring for any impacts resulting from the Sunrise Gas Project during the life of the project and for a period following decommissioning. Monitoring will be undertaken by appropriately qualified environmental scientists employed or contracted by the proponent. The environmental health and safety performance of the Sunrise Gas Project will be managed and subject to audit by the Northern Territory Department of Industry and Resource Development as the designated authority under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967.</para><para>(4)	While individuals of nine migratory species (three whale and six turtle species) listed under the EPBC Act may occur on occasion in the Sunrise Gas Project area none of these species utilise the area as an important breeding or feeding habitat, nor is the proposed site of the project on any recognised important migration route for these species. The potential impact of the Sunrise development on these species was therefore predicted to be negligible and on site studies were not deemed to be necessary.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Fisheries: High Seas Fishing Permits</title><page.no>25520</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2865)</subtitle><id.no>2865</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>25520</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator Greig</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation, upon notice, on 28 April 2004:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Which companies have licenses that allow them to bottom trawl on the high seas.</para><para>(2)	(a) Which vessels are authorised to bottom trawl on the high seas under these licenses; (b) where are these vessels operating; (c) which species are they targeting; (d) how much did they catch in 2001-02 and 2002-03; and (e) what is the duration of the licences.</para><para>(3)	Which companies have licenses that allow them to bottom trawl on sea mounts on the high seas.</para><para>(4)	(a) Which vessels are authorised to bottom trawl on sea mounts on the high seas under these licenses; (b) where are these vessels operating; (c) which species are they targeting; (d) how much did they catch in 2001-02 and 2002-03; and (e) what is the duration of the licences.</para><para>(5)	Which companies have licenses that allow them to bottom trawl on sea mounts in Australian waters.</para><para>(6)	(a) Which vessels are authorised to bottom trawl on sea mounts in Australian waters under these licenses; (b) where are these vessels operating; (c) which species are they targeting; (d) how much did they catch in 2001-02 and 2002-03; and (e) what is the duration of the licences.</para><para>(7)	What exploratory licences have been issued to bottom trawl on sea mounts on the high seas and in Australian waters.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>25520</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows: </para></talk.start><para>(1)	Information on ownership of high seas fishing permits is not currently publicly available from the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA), reflecting commercial confidentiality and privacy concerns. However with the recent passage of legislation amending the Fisheries Management Act 1991 and the Fisheries Administration Act 1991, two registers covering High Seas Fishing and General Permits are to be created. The High Seas Register will include such information as name and address of the owner(s) of the boat and the nature of the fishing permit.

These fisheries are the South East Trawl, Great Australian Bight, Western Deep Water Trawl, East Coast Deep Water Trawl, South Tasman Rise and Coral Sea Fishery. Of these fisheries, public registers currently exist for the SET and GAB and lists of the permit holders entitled to fish in these fisheries together with the names of nominated vessels are at Attachments B and C. </para><para>(6)	(a)	Refer to the answer to Question 5.

Law firms tendering for Departmental work cannot generally refuse to disclose the names of their clients on the grounds of legal professional privilege when responding to questions from the Department regarding possible conflicts of interest. However, during tendering processes law firms may make a business decision not to provide the names of clients, which could lead to the Department not considering them suitable to undertake the work. </para><para>(2)	No data is collected centrally on the incidence of legal professional privilege relating to any aspect of legal firms using legal professional privilege in response to inquiries of progress under the consultancy or review, since the issue does not generally arise. As progress reporting generally occurs during the full life cycle of consultancies and reviews, such data would be difficult and time consuming to compile.</para><para>(3)	The claiming of legal professional privilege does not usually arise in relation to questions of conflict of interest (see the response to question 1 above).</para><para>(4)	The claiming of legal professional privilege does not usually arise in relation to questions of conflict of interest (see the response to question 1 above).</para><para>(5)	(a)	The claiming of legal professional privilege does not usually arise in relation to questions of conflict of interest (see the response to question 1 above).</para><para>	(b)	No. The claiming of legal professional privilege does not usually arise in relation to questions of conflict of interest (see the response to question 1 above).  </para><para>(6)	It is possible that a misunderstanding has resulted from the reference to legal professional privilege in answers to previous Questions on Notice concerning Phillips Fox and the copyright Digital Agenda review, in particular, the answer to Question on Notice 2203 and the management plan that formed Attachment A to the answer to Question on Notice 2753. To the extent that there is any misunderstanding this answer seeks to clarify the matter. </para><para>As stated in the answer to Question on Notice 2203, in its tender Phillips Fox disclosed the names of clients that Phillips Fox acted for that Phillips Fox assessed as having an interest in the proper and efficient operation of Australia's copyright system and, possibly, an interest in making submissions to the review. The names of these clients were supplied to the Attorney-General's Department in confidence for the purpose of assessing the conflict of interest requirement of the tender process. Although Attachment A to the answer to Question on Notice 2753 included the annotation [List of relevant Phillips Fox Clients - subject to Legal Professional Privilege] this should more correctly have stated that the list of client names was confidential information. The management plan formed part of the Phillips Fox tender which was confidential information under the Agreement between the Commonwealth and Phillips Fox. </para><para>Legal professional privilege was also referred to in the answer to Question on Notice 2203 concerning which Government departments and agencies had engaged Phillips Fox to perform legal work for them. In its tender Phillips Fox advised the Attorney-General's Department that the firm acted for `a number of Commonwealth and State departments and other public sector agencies'. The fact that no more specific details were supplied by Phillips Fox about these clients related more to the fact that the work being done for those clients was not such that would give rise to any particular conflict of interest in relation to the work being tendered for and, therefore, it was not necessary to provide more specific information. </para><para>(a) No. No such provisions were included as it was not identified by either party as an issue requiring inclusion. The contract included provisions dealing with conflict of interest requirements and confidentiality. </para><para>(b) No. Phillips Fox were not contracted as the Department's legal advisers. Phillips Fox were contracted to conduct research and analysis of the digital agenda reforms from legal, economic and technical points of view. The successful tenderer happened to be a law firm but was not required to be so. The relationship between the Department and Phillips Fox was governed by the consultancy Agreement. </para><para>(c) No. </para><para>(7)	As stated in the answer to Question on Notice 2753, conflict of interest was a mandatory criterion for tenders in respect of the copyright Digital Agenda review. The claiming of legal professional privilege does not usually arise in relation to questions of conflict of interest (see the response to question 1 above). </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Telstra</title><page.no>25529</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2886)</subtitle><id.no>2886</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>25529</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 6 May 2004:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Is it correct that a promise was given in writing from the office of the then Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Alston, that all claims from the group `Casualties of Telstra' would be settled before the end of 1999.</para><para>(2)	Are there any claims still outstanding that date back to 1999 or earlier. </para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>25530</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Arts and Sport</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question: </para></talk.start><para>(1)	A search has been conducted of records held by the Office of the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts and the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts for such a document.

For example, the opposition of the teacher unions to basic skills testing is well known. </para><para>(3)	While the Australian Government has a strong interest in the reporting of student achievement against common national standards, the State and Territory government and non-government education authorities determine the curricula undertaken in schools.</para><para>In the syllabus and curriculum documents currently used in the States and Territories, there is a clear recognition that children need to recall or mentally determine basic multiplication and division facts. By the end of Year 4, it is generally assumed by these documents that all children will be able to recall multiplication facts up to 10 X 10 and to work out division facts from known multiplication facts.</para><para>Educators agree that children are disadvantaged from a speed point of view if they don't have number facts at their fingertips.

These tests address the full range of the curriculum and the full range of students' ability. This ensures that teachers teach to the full curriculum, encouraging excellence while at the same time ensuring that all children have essential literacy and numeracy skills. The national comparable benchmark data is extracted from these State tests.</para><para>The national benchmark standards, as agreed by all Ministers, represent the minimum acceptable standard of literacy and numeracy that a student must have at a particular year level for the student to continue to make progress at school. As such, the benchmarks do not seek to describe the full curriculum or the full range of student achievement. The benchmarks have a strong equity component, with an expectation that all students should attain at least the level of skill they need to access further schooling. </para><para>Six studies were undertaken by the Australian Council for Educational Research from 1997 to 1999, to compare Australia's draft literacy and numeracy benchmarks with standards overseas. These studies were commissioned to inform the development of the final benchmarks and for use in reviewing the benchmarks at a later date. Student performance on items from the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) was also considered </para><para>Comparisons drawn between the Australian benchmarks and standards from other countries need to be treated carefully.</para><para>Overall, the studies found that the Australian benchmarks are set at a lower level than standards in other countries, because Australian benchmarks are minimum acceptable standards. Unlike the Australian benchmarks, most countries do not explicitly state that all students are expected to achieve a minimum standard in terms of actual performance, but instead set more aspirational standards.</para><para>The Australian benchmarks cover a smaller range of skills, because they are designed to include only essential elements needed by students to make progress at school (and elements agreed by all States/Territories).

Dr Polya's figures for 2002-2004 are only forward estimates suggested by the UN Populations Division. Furthermore, The same UN data predicts that child and infant mortality will in fact fall dramatically during and following the years of the coalition presence and the removal of Saddam. </para><para>(2)	The Government has not been directly involved in establishing mortality rates but has provided financial support to expert UN agencies such as UNICEF and the World Health Organisation (WHO) that have undertaken studies to determine mortality rates and causes. </para><para>(3)	UNICEF reports suggest that the basic causes of high infant/under-five child mortality rates are wide-ranging. They include: civil strife, sanctions, three major conflicts, inadequate resource distribution, poor institutional capacity and inadequate human resources. These problems can be directly attributed to the Ba'athist regime, eg. Saddam Hussein's regime allocated only $US16 million to health care in 2002, 60 times less than that of the 2004 Iraqi national budget of $US950 million allocated to the Ministry of Health.  </para><para>UNICEF reports that the immediate causes of infant/under-five mortality are disease and malnutrition.

has not ratified the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and has stated that it will not become a party to the Treaty. However, the US maintains a moratorium on nuclear testing and, at the Non-Proliferation Preparatory Committee meeting in April 2004, has reaffirmed that it is not planning to resume nuclear testing.</para><para>(3)	Australia maintains its commitment to nuclear disarmament based on balanced and progressive steps towards the elimination of nuclear weapons. The US has stated that research into bunker-busting and low-yield nuclear weapons is entirely conceptual and that it is looking at whether there are alternative ways of meeting current and emerging threats to US security. The US has stated, repeatedly, that it is not developing new nuclear weapons.
