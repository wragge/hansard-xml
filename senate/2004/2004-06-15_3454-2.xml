In the lead-up to this budget hopes were very high that this government would provide broad based relief for Australian families burdened by the highest-taxing government in history with record debt—relief to compensate households for the effect of bracket creep. But the hopes of these families that they would finally get serious tax reform have been dashed. Instead this budget has created a class of forgotten people.</para></talk.start><para>Before I go to the detail of how this budget has failed on the tax reform front, I remind the Senate of the Treasurer's track record. He is hardly the friend of the taxpayer. In eight years Mr Costello's record on tax relief is providing a tax cut to compensate for the GST and, after that, we had the smallest tax cut in our history. Remember last year that insulting sandwich and milkshake tax cut? So what now? For 80 per cent of taxpayers, that is four out of five Australians, this budget gives nothing—not a cent of tax relief. But so great is the cynicism that the electorate holds towards this Treasurer that they are not surprised. They are used to getting stung by the highest-taxing Treasurer in Australia's history.</para><para>Despite the tax cuts in this bill, total tax revenue will hit a record high next year of $217 billion. That is up 90 per cent since 1996. By next year, total personal income tax will be up 80 per cent since the government came to office. That is right, 80 per cent. Australian taxpayers are now paying an aver-age of $9,000 more in Commonwealth taxes than in 1996. and this will grow to $12,000 over the forward estimates. Australians have got used to carrying the weight of Mr Costello's ever increasing tax burden.</para><para>Let us look a bit closer at what this bill does—and fails to do. For taxpayers earning less than $52,000 a year there is no tax relief. In the seat of Brisbane 78,500 people do not get a tax cut. That is 83 per cent of the taxpayers in the seat of Brisbane. In the seat of Cunningham 74,800 do not get tax relief. That is 86 per cent of electors in Cunningham who do not get a tax cut. In the seat of McMillan 70,900 do not get a tax cut. That is 93 per cent of taxpayers in McMillan get nothing in tax cuts in this budget. According to NATSEM, three out of five families and singles will miss out on the tax cuts and the family assistance benefits. A majority of families get nothing at all from the budget in any form. The tax cuts in the budget fail to even give back bracket creep in any year over the forward estimates.</para><para>There are seven new taxes or increases in existing taxes in this budget. This brings the total to 151 since this government came to office. That is right: 151 new or increased taxes since this government came to office in 1996. At least one out of three families eligible for family tax benefit may never see the second family tax payment of $600. The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Treasurer have both now admitted it will be clawed back to pay debts. Here was a budget which outlined a record $52 billion spending spree but failed to offer any restoration of basic services and hardly anyone got any tax cuts.</para><para>There was no plan in the budget to save Medicare, make education more affordable or address the long-term savings and investment needs of this nation. The Treasurer calculated—or rather miscalculated—that Labor would not pass these tax cuts. He thought that Labor would oppose the tax changes in this bill for higher income earners. He focused on the $52 billion he was going to splurge on his government's desperate attempt to cling to power. But he did not realise that Australians would focus on the other 52—those earning under $52,000 who do not get a single cent from tax cuts in this bill. Mr Costello's tax gamble has not paid off, and the losers are the four out of five Australian taxpayers who have been left behind. </para><para>While Mr Costello miscalculated his tax package, Australian families have been forced to calculate how much tougher life has become. Household debt is at a record high and, on average, our families owe more than they earn. The household debt to income ratio is now at 147 per cent. Credit card debt has become the main currency for too many families. Mortgage repayments are chewing more of the family budget than ever before. The costs of going to see a doctor and of giving our kids a higher education are skyrocketing. To add insult to injury, the government's own family payments system is creating a debt trap for too many of our families. Families under record financial stress need relief. Labor have consistently argued that we can provide this relief by (1) restoring vital services like bulk-billing, creating 20,000 new places in our TAFEs and 20,000 places in our universities while reversing the 25 per cent Howard-Costello fee hike and (2) providing broader and fairer tax relief. You can fund better services without raising overall tax levels if you make the tough decisions to redirect current expenditure.</para><para>Contrary to the naivety of some reports, all Labor's spending is fully costed and fully funded. It is not additional spending. It is redirected spending and it is paid for through savings—savings from cutting the waste and mismanagement that are fast becoming the hallmarks of this government. Only this fiscal rigour gives you the ability to sustain better services for families and lower charges for people. Under Labor's fiscal rules we are funding our proposed spending on services in a way that will drive down expenditure to GDP and maintain surpluses. This is a reformist approach to our public finances and one that will ultimately benefit all Australians.</para><para>In contrast, Mr Costello has given up on reform. The real tragedy of this budget is that the Treasurer has missed a golden opportunity to drive significant reform to the current tax system. He has missed a chance to try to reduce the disincentives created by the interaction of the tax and social security systems. None of the fundamental problems with the system—the need for relief for ordinary workers under record financial stress, the crippling disincentives to work and the family debt trap—have been addressed in this budget. We are still left with many families facing serious disincentives to work. They keep working harder, but they keep being held back by crippling effective marginal tax rates. This will ultimately lead to lower productivity, lower growth and lower living standards. That is a price that we should not have to ask our children to pay.</para><para>Fundamental reform of the family payments system is needed to avoid the massive debt trap that it creates. But the government just sits on its hands. At the last election, the Prime Minister said he would fix the debt trap once and for all. He offered a one-off $1,000 bribe to pay off the debts in order to buy his way through the election. Here we are, three years later, on the eve of another election and Mr Howard covers up his broken promise to fix the system with another bribe—another patch-up. This is not genuine reform.</para><para>Labor will offer an alternative. We will provide broader and fairer tax relief. We will make the tax system work for Australians, not against them. The details of Labor's tax plan will be released at a time of our choosing, but we will give people plenty of time to compare our package with that offered by the government. With record tax collections, a peaking of participation in the labour force and 13 years of economic growth, this was the opportunity for reform, and Australians expected it. Instead of serious tax reform we got a seriously large election bribe. Instead of support for Australian families we got a tax cut which ignored four out of five Australian taxpayers. This is not a plan for a better Australia; it is just a plan for an election. However, Australians can see through it. They will reject this budget due to the inherent unfairness of this taxation bill and the contempt with which this Treasurer treats struggling ordinary people, who are again required to prop up the misguided policies of this highest-taxing government in Australia's history. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>23478</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R2045">Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2004</inline>. In November 2003 I wrote an opinion piece for a newspaper and I am going to repeat some of the things I said there. Last November I said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Big tax cuts are now inevitable.</para><para>Labor has ensured it by endlessly rabbiting on about the Coalition being the highest-taxing Australian government ever. (True but irrelevant, since Australia is among the lowest-taxing nations in the OECD.)</para><para>Labor's line is dangerous. It encourages a resistance to raising additional revenue to invest in education, health and the environment.</para><para>The Liberals have guaranteed tax cuts by constantly saying surpluses must be paid back.</para><para>So the question is: When?</para><para>My bet is in the May budget. One reason is that such an election sweetener is irresistible for the government. Two, the Coalition would want to spend any surplus money in advance, leaving Labor with nothing to promise. Three, pay packets would only benefit from tax cuts legislation in the second half of next year, when an election is most likely. Four, tax cuts will be seen as some relief against expected higher interest rates.</para><para>The government have trapped Mark Latham into virtually guaranteeing Labor support for raising the present top tax rate of 48.5 per cent from $62,500 to a much higher threshold.</para><para>ACOSS say anyone earning $100,000 has an average tax rate of 34 per cent on all income. Is that really that high? </para><para>The well-off have already had their tax cuts. The Coalition's 30 per cent rebate on private health insurance, costing the taxpayer nearly $3 billion a year, favours higher income earners. Capital gains tax was halved just a few years ago, with Labor support, despite the Democrats' opposition and despite the fact that it clearly mainly benefited those wealthy Australians with investment and share portfolios.</para><para>Democrats like me can cry all they like that Commonwealth revenue and expenditure are still insufficient to meet the pressing and legitimate expectations and needs of Australians for health, education and the environment, amongst other things. (Health will remain an issue, even if Medicare Plus passes the Senate.)</para><para>We say we do not so much need increased taxes as increased revenue. We attack some tax expenditures and tax wastage as the means of assisting the growth in revenue to meet expenditure needs.</para><para>But tax cuts it will be. The two majors will have the numbers.</para><para>So, if tax cuts seem inevitable, what is the right way to go? What could or should be the government priorities and how much money would they have to spend?</para></quote><para>That is what I wrote in November 2003. This bill introduces the tax cuts that I forecast and that were announced by the Treasurer on budget night. And, like most Australians, I was astonished on budget night when I heard that tax cuts costing $14.7 billion over four years would be given only to those earning over $52,000 a year. This seemed crazy brave for a government facing an election year and a government which had enough money to contemplate an infinite number of tax cut possibilities. For 2004-05, higher income earners will get a $21 a week tax cut; for 2005-06, it will be $42 a week or $2,184 per annum.  </para><para>While tax relief for earners below, say, $100,000, particularly at middle-income levels, is argued by many to be justified, in our view the first call should have been to give relief to low and lower middle-income earners. Only 24 per cent, or 2.25 million taxpayers, will benefit from this tax cut. The government have justified the legislation on the basis that it ensures that 80 per cent of taxpayers will have a maximum nominal tax rate of 30 per cent or less. This has long been a policy objective of theirs. </para><para>Judging by the media and by calls to our offices, it does seem that these tax cuts have not generated anger of real note. In that sense, the government has taken a risk that it seems to have calculated well. But it appears that Australians do not really resent tax cuts to those earning above $52,000. What those earning below $52,000 do resent is the fact that they did not get tax cuts too, especially single parents without children, who are left out of the budget pork. The Democrat amendments that I will move later will provide a tax cut to the deserving seven million taxpayers who will be getting nothing from the government's exclusive tax cut for higher income earners. We are not saying that those earning $60,000 or $70,000 a year are rich; they are not. We get plenty of correspondence from families on this income level explaining the cost of raising children. They often feel like they are struggling, particularly in some of the big cities like Sydney. I can understand their perspective and we are not saying that they should pay more tax—they do deserve a bit of a tax cut, too, which our proposal would deliver—but this group must remember that they are, from an income perspective, in the top 20 per cent of earning Australians and they should remember that the average full-time wage earner is still earning below the $52,000 a year that this tax cut uses as a benchmark. They should remember that there are around seven million Australians earning less than $20,000 who do not get a tax cut. </para><para>Tax cuts only for higher income earners are considered offensive by many Australians. The highest effective tax rates continue to be paid by low-income Australian families, who should be helped to stop them falling into poverty traps. If you wanted to get people off welfare and into work, you would target the tax and welfare intersects. The working class and the middle class get the rawest income tax deal. Low and lower income Australians struggle with the tax threshold that kicks in at a ridiculously low level of $6,000 and they struggle with the highest effective tax rates of all because, as they earn more, welfare benefits are reduced. </para><para>The most important distributive mechanism for improving the lot of low-income Australians is to improve their disposable income. From the employer's perspective, if the disposable income of low-wage earners increases as a result of tax cuts, it could take some of the stress and tension off the low wage industrial case that has to be mounted through the Australian Industrial Relations Commission every year. The Democrats believe that all Australians should get a tax cut, but it must be a fair and equal tax cut. That is the purpose of our amendment. Unfortun-ately, the government only want to help the higher income earners in this budget, and that is their priority. </para><para>I note that shortly after the Australian government budget, the New Zealand government announced their proposals. Like Australia, families were winners in that budget, but there were no tax cuts in New Zealand. Instead, the New Zealand government included an interesting $60 a week payment for in-work, low-income families. Their aim is to increase the incentives of people to move from welfare to work. The very senior and longstanding reporter—and very serious reporter, I might say—Tim Colebatch, in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of 1 June 2004, said:  </para><quote><para>This is the first stage of welfare reforms that the NZ Government intends to culminate by tackling the hardest issue of welfare reform: merging the welfare system into a single welfare benefit with add-ons to meet particular needs, as recommended in Australia in 2000 by the sadly neglected McClure report on welfare reform.</para></quote><para>He went on:</para><quote><para>Welfare payments with high clawbacks are poverty traps. Any reformers worth the name, in government or opposition, should make it a top priority to cut those claws, so that for people on welfare, work will pay.</para></quote><para>It is a shame that the Australian government did not believe that this was a priority worthy of tackling in this budget, particularly since it welcomed the McClure report, which had this kind of strategy in mind.</para><para>Turning to other parties' approaches to the tax cuts and tax cuts generally, the approach of the Australian Greens is to deny everyone a tax cut. The Greens' policy is not to give tax relief to low-income earners. Last year, in fact, they voted against the low-income earners' tax cuts. The Greens do share the Democrats' concern that the government is not spending enough on health and education, but their simple rhetoric has ignored the reality that a fair tax cut not only would help low-income earners but is necessary for low-income earners. It also ignores the fact that there were cash surpluses of $7.5 billion last year and there will still be, despite the massive handout to buy votes from families this month, $4.6 billion this year.</para><para>Despite the fact that we have seen cash surpluses of $12 billion in the last two years alone, Australians believe services continue to deteriorate. They feel that this government is never going to fund health and education sufficiently and that their surpluses are going to be put in the bank and used to pay off debt—despite the fact that Australia's debt level is exceptionally low by historical standards and amazingly low compared to any international standards. Providing a fair tax cut to those most in need would not hurt our fiscal policy or the massive budget surplus.</para><para>Prior to the budget, the Democrats announced that, if there were to be tax cuts, we would prefer to see an increase in the tax-free threshold from $6,000 to $10,000, thus providing an equal tax cut to all taxpayers. Obviously this would benefit lower income earners proportionately more. As I have said, this bill will provide a tax cut only to those earning over $52,000 a year at a cost of around $15 billion over four years, giving a $42 a week or $2,184 per annum tax cut in 2005-06. Only 24 per cent, or 2.25 million, of Australian taxpayers will benefit, and there is nothing for the other seven-odd million. What the Democrats seek to do, with an amendment which hopefully we will circulate soon, would cost roughly the same as the government's proposal. Our proposal would increase the bottom tax threshold from $6,000 to $7,500 in 2004-05 and to $9,000 in 2005-06. This would give all of the over nine million Australian taxpayers around $5 a week in tax cuts in 2004-5, which is $260 per annum, and $10 a week the following year, which would be $520 per annum—in both cases, $260 more in year one and $520 more in year two than the lower income earners are going to get at present.</para><para>If the tax cut proposal was designed to wedge Labor in preparation for an election, it has worked. Mr Latham has been constantly talking about broader and fairer tax cuts, but he is yet to reveal an alternative proposal. I note that, once again, that was not on the table today. This is his chance, we think, to show what Labor does stand for. We urge the Labor Party to commit to broader income tax cuts for all Australians, with an emphasis on lower- and middle-income Australians, and, in this instance, to support the Democrats' fair and equal tax cuts proposals. Labor senators, who have been so critical of the government's tax policy—so opposed to the wonderful initiative of the GST and the new tax system, so opposed to earning revenue, so critical of how little is spent on health and education—still will not commit to an alternative tax cut view. We think they should not just let these tax cuts sail through the Senate. We think Labor should be putting an alternative through, in the sense of either supporting our proposals or putting up its own proposals. We can amend these bills and we should. </para><para>If Labor in the Senate does support Mr Costello's idea of a fair tax cut, it will be another step towards the `soft target' strategy which we think has failed Labor previously. I will speak further to my amendments in the committee stage, but I want to move on to asking Treasury and the government, whichever it will be next time round, to start thinking with some imagination. In the second reading speech on this bill is this statement:</para><quote><para>The prospect of moving to a higher tax bracket can act as a disincentive for increased work force participation. At present the 42 per cent marginal tax rate cuts in at incomes that are a multiple of around 1.1 male average earnings, and the 47 per cent marginal tax rate cuts in at around 1.3 male average earnings. </para></quote><para>I think that that observation from the Treasurer is an accurate one. I think what the Treasurer is saying is that the way in which inflation and tax policy have allowed the bands to concentrate and converge and allowed people who are relatively low earners to pay the highest tax rate is a legitimate complaint. I do not think that the way this has been addressed either last year or this year by the government or the way I have heard Labor discussing this matter addresses the fundamental problem: we need a quantum shift in permanently adjusting tax rates so that people can be certain and secure in their perception of their fairness, equity and longevity.</para><para>There is only one way to do that, and that is with wholesale reform. I am not suggesting that what I am about to say is the answer but I want to speculate and see what it would look like. Let us say, for instance, that the tax system was accepted as needing to be progressive and that the same number of income tax rates was retained—there are five at present. One of the reforms that Labor introduced in its time in government was, of course, to reduce the huge number of bands—I forget the number, but I suspect it was several dozen—down to five. Let us say we accept that principle. Then let us say we accept the Democrats' view that in good tax policy, in order to ensure that lower income people will be free from tax, we should look at a tax-free threshold of $20,000. Let us assume an upper income tax threshold of $120,000—that would leave $100,000 between those two, with three tax brackets within that. And let us assume that the top tax rate is at or near what it is at present. It might rise a little to be 50 per cent at the top rate, but that is not a big deal. The way to ensure that that gets locked in, of course, is to index the lowest and the highest tax rates so that every year they move up to adjust for inflation. Then periodically governments can address the intervening tax and welfare intersects as they see fit over time. But at least the constancy and relativity would be maintained by indexing the top and bottom thresholds.  </para><para>I have had a look at what the costings would be—of course, I do not have access to the giant machines and all the modelling that the government has access to, so I know the Senate will recognise that what I am about to say is an estimate based on rough scheduling. But, if you were to introduce such a system—based on three tax rates of perhaps 25 per cent, 30 per cent and 40-odd per cent—you would get a tax cost of around $52 billion over three years. That is the sort of figure you would face if you were really to attempt to permanently reform our tax system—on the basis that you introduce permanent rates and indexing, and a progressive system to ensure that the relativities are maintained. When I quoted the Treasurer earlier, what he was indicating was that the relativities have slipped and that Australians feel aggrieved that they are no longer being taxed fairly. In the next government somebody has to grasp this nettle, even while recognising the very great cost that is entailed in addressing it properly.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>23482</page.no><name role="metadata">Webber, Sen Ruth</name><name role="display">Senator WEBBER</name><name.id>00AOT</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R2045">Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2004.</inline> There can be no doubt that the hardworking Australians who earn more than $52,000 per annum are entitled to a tax cut. But the heart of this matter is whether Australians who earn less than $52,000 are also entitled to tax relief. This government, in one of the most cynical exercises in Australian history, has engaged in the most blatant vote-buying round of tax cuts ever seen—targeted at the few and not at the many. There can be no doubt that these tax cuts are not worth a cent to most Australians. Indeed, according to official statistics, there are no tax cuts for four out of every five taxpayers. By any objective measure, having 80 per cent of people miss out on these tax cuts fails this Prime Minister's 1996 promise to govern for all of us. Instead, he governs for some at the expense of all of us.</para></talk.start><para>Take one very simple exercise as a case in point. As former Prime Minister Paul Keating once said, you should always back self-interest because at least you know it is trying. I, like all senators and members, employ staff. I chose to have a flat structure, with all my staff employed as electorate officers grade B. The injustice of these tax cuts can have no clearer example. Personally, as with all other senators and members, I will get a tax cut. There will be tax relief for parliamentarians because we earn over the magic $52,000 per year. But there will not be one cent of tax relief for any of the people who work with me in my office. This, of course, illustrates the failure of these tax cuts. I work with these people day after day, and the government is telling me that I can have a tax cut but that no-one else in my office can.</para><para>Now the basic defence that the government offers as to why it has failed to deliver tax cuts to 80 per cent of Australians is that these people will be looked after through the family tax payments. That premise only holds up if those people are eligible for family tax payments in the first place. If you are a family where both you and your partner work yet do not earn more than $52,000 per year then, even with dependent children, you get nothing from this government. If you are a self-funded retiree, you miss out. If you have not had children, you miss out. If you are single, you miss out.</para><para>Some commentators have referred to the 80 per cent of Australians who will not get a tax cut as the `forgotten people'. I grant it is a strong term but I contend that in this case it is not an appropriate one. The Howard government can hardly claim that they have forgotten these people. A more correct term would be the `ignored people'. There can be no doubt that that 80 per cent have been deliberately ignored by this government. How do you forget 80 per cent of Australians? The government made a conscious decision to not provide tax relief to these people. They simply weighed up the odds and decided that giving tax relief only to those Australians earning more than the magic $52,000 a year would boost their re-election prospects. Let there be no doubt that they chose to give to the few at the expense of the many. </para><para>Indeed, we do not have to look beyond the figures from the last census, of 2001. The ABS data shows that in most electorates more than 80 per cent of people will receive not a cent in tax relief. Let us look at the figures for the electorates in my home state of Western Australia. In the electorate of O'Connor, one of the safest Liberal seats in Western Australia, 93 per cent will not qualify for a tax cut. Perhaps this is yet another example of the inability of the member for O'Connor to represent the interests of his constituents. After all, he will get a tax cut. There will be tax relief for him and for only a paltry seven per cent of those in his electorate. What about the other safe Liberal seats in Western Australia? In Tangney only 14 per cent of people will get a tax cut. In Forrest only nine per cent will get any relief. In Kalgoorlie a massive 20 per cent will get tax relief. In Moore 13 per cent will get tax relief, and in Pearce nine per cent will. In Curtin 21 per cent of people will receive the tax cut. These figures demonstrate that the overwhelming number of Australians, even in the government's own electorates, are going to miss out. In one of the most marginal seats in the country, the seat of Canning, the Prime Minister and his Treasurer have failed to help even 20 per cent. In Canning 90 per cent will miss out.</para><para>The ALP seats in Western Australia do not even reach the lofty heights of the figures for the electorates of Curtin and Kalgoorlie. In fact, the highest percentage of Western Australians in Labor seats receiving a tax cut is only just reaching double figures. In Fremantle, it is 11 per cent; in Perth, 11 per cent; in Swan, 10 per cent; in Stirling, 10 per cent; in Cowan, nine per cent; and in both Brand and Hasluck, eight per cent. That is not good enough by any measure. The government cannot claim that those people who will miss out will be accommodated under the family tax payments system. For those with no dependent kids, there will be no family tax assistance. For those with dependent kids over 18, there will be no family tax assistance. The government pretend that the tax cuts are not the whole picture, and in that they are right. The whole picture has to include all those people the government chose to ignore. The full picture includes all Australians, and the fact is that across the country 80 per cent of them do not get any relief from this government.</para><para>The ABS census statistics show that those electorates that do best out of this government are all safe Liberal seats in—surprise, surprise!—Sydney and Melbourne. In North Sydney, 35 per cent will get a tax cut; in Wentworth, 30 per cent—and I bet they will be glad to have their new member, whomever that will be—in Bradfield, 29 per cent; in Higgins, 26 per cent; in Kooyong, 24 per cent; in Mitchell, 24 per cent; in Goldstein, 22 per cent; in Berowra, 22 per cent; and so it goes on. I find it interesting that in the Prime Minister's own electorate 81 per cent will not get a tax cut but in the electorate he now chooses to live in—that is, North Sydney—only 65 per cent will miss out. Talk about ignoring the people that put you there. Now comfortably living in the electorate of North Sydney, he looks after his new neighbours but ignores his constituents. That is not really fair. He ignores 81 per cent of the people he is meant to represent.</para><para>These tax cuts were designed to deliver a fourth term to the Howard government. They are a failure by any measure of justice or equity. They are designed to buy votes—pure and simple. The tax relief in this budget is not designed to put fairness or equity back into the taxation system. As Senator Conroy said, it is not even designed to restore bracket creep. It does not address the needs of single Australians, couples with no children or self-funded retirees. It is a tax cut for a few of us, given in the hope that all of us will be subjected to another three years of Howard government policy drift. That is what these tax cuts are designed for. They are designed so that there will be two more years of neglect and clawback followed by a spending binge in yet another election year. The Australian people are now aware of the cruel frauds that have been perpetuated on them over the last eight years. What they wanted was a government for all of them, and that is what the Prime Minister championed. What they now have is a government for a few of them, for less than 20 per cent of them. They have a government that has not forgotten about them but has deliberately chosen to ignore them. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>23484</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Arts and Sport</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R2045">Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2004</inline> gives effect to the reductions in personal income tax announced in the 2004-05 budget and is part of a package to help 99.8 per cent of Australian families with children. The measures contained in this bill will cut personal income tax by some $14.7 billion over four years. The tax reductions will be delivered by increasing the income thresholds for the top two tax brackets. These changes are targeted to ensure that the tax system continues to support rewards from working. The prospect of moving to a higher tax bracket can be a disincentive to increased work force participation. Australians earning the equivalent of full-time adult average earnings will cross the 42 per cent threshold in 2004-05 unless the threshold has increased significantly, as proposed in this bill.</para></talk.start><para>These targeted changes to the personal income tax schedule will ensure that the majority of Australian taxpayers—over 80 per cent, across the forward estimate years, including those on average earnings—will remain in or below the 30 per cent tax bracket. These changes will also make the Australian tax system more internationally competitive. Many highly skilled Australians, including our young people, are internationally mobile and can choose to work anywhere in the world. It is important that the tax system does not discourage talented people from living and working in Australia. Lifting the top tax threshold will ensure that Australia strengthens its international position as a low taxing nation. The significant increase in the top tax threshold will improve Australia's ability to compete as a preferred place to live and work.</para><para>The tax cuts in this bill build on the income tax cuts the government delivered through its A New Tax System and in the 2003-04 budget. The combined effect of these three stages of tax reform is to deliver significant tax cuts to all Australians. There will be a 23 per cent reduction in tax for taxpayers earning around $20,000 a year compared to the amount of tax people on this income would have paid prior to A New Tax System. This is a very substantial tax cut—of course, those who remember the debate on A New Tax System recall how the Labor Party fought these tax cuts tooth and nail. There will be a 21 per cent reduction in tax for taxpayers earning $50,000 a year, which is around average earnings; and an 18 per cent reduction in tax for taxpayers earning around $90,000, after the tax cuts in this bill are implemented.</para><para>It is important to keep in mind that people who do not pay tax cannot benefit from tax cuts. On current estimates there are about 6.8 million people aged 16 and over who do not pay any tax. A single adult does not pay tax until their taxable income reaches $7,383. This effective threshold will be higher if they receive an allowance or a pension. About 6.8 million people in Australia over the age of 16 do not pay tax. The personal tax cuts in this bill continue the government's commitment to ongoing structural tax reforms. They increase the rewards for those who wish to work overtime, seek promotion or acquire skills. They strengthen the international competitiveness of the tax system.  </para><para>This is an important bill that gives effect to budget measures. It again demonstrates that this is the government that cuts taxes for the Australian public. This government can achieve this result because of its very sound management of the Australian economy, which has made the Australian economy one of the great growth economies in the world.

This proposal of ours is designed to raise the tax-free threshold in two tranches in the first income year from $6,000 to $7,500 and in the second year to $9,000. It is a policy of ours that we have been promoting for several years. We do think that this would enable everyone—all nine million Australian taxpayers—to get a tax cut instead of just the top 20 per cent, and of course it will proportionately have a much greater effect for low-income earners, which is where we think the priority for tax cuts needs to commence. As I made very clear in my speech on the second reading, we do not consider higher income Australians earning above $52,000 and below $100,000 to be rich. That would be an unreasonable attitude. This proposal simply reflects our perspective that we should start by producing greater tax equity and improving the disposable income possibilities for lower income people, and we think the tax-free threshold is the simplest and easiest way to commence that process.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>23485</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I indicate on behalf of the Labor Party, as I indicated in my speech on the second reading, that we will be supporting the government's tax cuts and that we will be bringing forward our own package.

This would obviously affect the capacity of the government to fund essential community services. However, the government has given tax cuts to those who earn less than $52,000 as part of the new tax system. </para></talk.start><para>I want to make it perfectly clear and put it on the record that taxpayers and seniors at all income levels have benefited from a continuing program of tax reform. The personal tax cuts that were announced in the 2004-05 budget are the third stage in ongoing structural reform of the personal income tax system. I think Senator Kemp did mention that the combined effect of these three stages of tax reform has been to deliver significant tax cuts to all Australian taxpayers. Taxpayers earning $20,000 are paying around 23 per cent less in tax than prior to the new tax system; those on $50,000, around average weekly earnings, are paying around 21 per cent less tax than prior to the new tax system; and by 1 July 2005 taxpayers earning $90,000 will be paying 18 per cent less than prior to the new tax system. Most importantly, raising the top thresholds will ensure that those on average weekly earnings stay in the 30 per cent tax bracket, which I am sure is an objective that this chamber would support. More than 80 per cent of taxpayers will remain in the 30 per cent tax bracket or a lower tax bracket even after ongoing growth in wages over the next four years.</para><para>I remind the chamber that it is important to bear in mind that people who do not pay tax simply cannot benefit from the tax cuts. As Senator Kemp indicated a little earlier, the estimate is that there are around 6.8 million people aged 16 and over who do not pay tax and who could not possibly benefit from tax measures of the kind proposed. Maybe some would, but certainly if you do not pay tax it would be very difficult to imagine how you could. A single adult does not pay tax until their taxable income reaches $7,383, and this effective threshold would be higher if they receive an allowance or a pension. Of course pensions are now indexed so they are just not tied to the CPI. The majority of single adults and couples without children who do not gain from the 2004 budget package are not taxpayers. Obviously in another bill we will be debating the advantages of the superannuation co-contribution for low- to middle-income earners. </para><para>Families with children are receiving significant increases in family assistance under the changes announced in the budget through increases in the family tax benefit for lower and middle income families as well of course as a reduction in the taper rate at which family tax benefit is withdrawn. The estimate I have is that 99.8 per cent of families with dependent children under the age of 16 benefit from the 2004 budget package, as indeed they should—this government makes no apologies for putting families front and centre in the way in which it has.</para><para>As the Democrats would know, the government provides substantial tax relief for senior Australians through the senior Australian's tax offset, or SATO as it is colloquially called, at a cost of around $1.6 billion each year. Eligible single senior Australians can now earn up to $20,500 without paying any income tax or Medicare levy. While the offset phases out at a rate of 12.5c for each dollar of income over this amount, singles can earn up to $38,340 and still benefit from the offset. Couples can earn up to $33,612 without paying tax, depending on how much income each member of the couple earns, and still receive some offset at combined incomes of up to $59,244. As a result of these benefits many senior Australians need not even lodge a tax return.  </para><para>Many senior Australians of course have shares, and anyone with shares might also benefit from the redesigned company tax arrangements where excess imputation credits are refundable. In the past imputation credits could only be used to offset a tax liability, which meant that obviously there were times when those credits were wasted. The government has also legislated the indexation of the aged pension, as I mentioned a moment ago, by the higher wages growth, male total average weekly earnings, or CPI—whichever is the highest. This indexation has led to significant real increases in pensions for aged pensioners, veterans and disability pensioners. Part rate pensioners continue to keep significantly more pension for every dollar of private income they receive above the income test-free areas as a result of the reduction in the pension withdrawal rate from 50 per cent to 40 per cent.</para><para>Having considered Senator Murray's proposals—and I do give very careful consideration to Senator Murray's suggestions because he does have a very deep interest in the tax system and from time to time does make suggestions that warrant consideration—at this stage and as part of the government's response to the budget, we will not be supporting them. They are not really something that is able to be contemplated in the context of a very large budget in which some tax cuts have been delivered for higher income earners simply as a matter of fairness and equity because they missed out when others got substantial tax cuts. But, as I have endeavoured to point out comprehensively, this government really has provided benefits across the whole income spectrum within the confines of a restructure of the tax system that has really seen nobody miss out, certainly not those earning less than $52,000. So it is for those reasons and for the fact that we have given further assistance to families through the family tax benefit, which is how we see it as being most efficacious for those families, particularly for ones that do not put in tax returns, the government will not be supporting these proposals.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>23487</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Thank you, Minister, for your very full response to our proposal.

This bill rolls out the latest of this government's attacks on progressive taxation in this country. Last year we had the $4 a week hamburger and milkshake tax cuts, which cost us $2.4 billion last year and will cost us $10 billion over the next four years. That is the direct financial cost. The bill also cost us the opportunity to abolish higher education fees for university students and the opportunity to return to free tertiary education. It cost us the opportunity to invest in public housing, the opportunity to support the rebuilding of bulk-billing in this country and the opportunity to invest in a range of other vital public investments. The latest budget tax cut, through this piece of legislation, will cost us $1.9 billion this year and $14.7 billion over the next four years. That is $14.7 billion that the public have consistently told the government and the parliament they want to see invested in vital public services in this country.</para></talk.start><para>The government is keen to talk about giving back to taxpayers but does not say what the costs of these election handouts will be in the further neglect of our public services. This bill not only robs us of the opportunity this year to make more sustainable and responsible use of taxation revenue by investing in public works and public services but also it robs us of the opportunity to do it in the future. It does this because it has the effect of flattening the personal income tax scale, allowing those on higher incomes to pay less tax. This change in the income tax scales will, as the government knows, be electorally difficult for any opposition to change if they were to win government. This does not mean that they should not do it, and in fact the Greens believe they should do it. But it is likely in an electoral climate that this change may be with us for many years, with the result that future governments will have less revenue to cater to society's collective needs while the richest individuals will have more money to cater to their personal wants.</para><para>I simply do not understand anyone thinking that this system could possibly be fair. The Greens cannot understand why such a system could be described by the government as being fair: it gives more money to the wealthy and it is not fair to the collective benefit of the rest of the country. The Greens reject this approach. We will oppose this piece of legislation, as we opposed the tax cuts in the last budget. We are ardent supporters of a progressive taxation system. We see it as a tool to deliver economic and social justice through the redistribution of personal wealth into public wealth. We believe in investing in public services rather than investing in tax cuts.</para><para>The bill does the opposite. Over the next four years this bill will deliver more than $14 million into the pockets of some of the wealthiest people in our society. It comes at a time when our public school teachers are taking industrial action in response to the continuing relative erosion of their salaries, which has seen them fall by one-third since 1972, relative to average weekly earnings. We are seeing house prices skyrocketing and private rents following, while the Commonwealth is stepping back from its role in providing public housing through the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. Bulk-billing rates are at their lowest level ever, yet the government is choosing not to invest this surplus taxpayers' money into our public health system.</para><para>Our natural environment and our infrastructure are in dire need of protection and expansion, not the green-tinged announcements such as those being made by the Prime Minister in the Great Hall at the moment, which in fact give more money to companies like Rio Tinto for their geosequestration and other research in the fossil fuel areas. The announcement today about the environment and announcements in recent weeks about the infrastructure in Australia have been woefully inadequate. This inadequacy is a result of both a terminal lack of vision by this government and a lack of real understanding about the central importance of the environment to the future of all of us. This inadequacy also shows an unwillingness by the government to invest public money in our public future—that is, in our public hospitals, our public schools and our future environment through our natural heritage. </para><para>The Greens have announced and supported a green bonds initiative that would see the government issuing bonds to raise $35 billion over the next 10 years. This is quite a conservative amount of money to invest in public and environmental infrastructure, but it is needed if we are to have any significant impact on the environmental fortunes of this country as we go through the 21st century. A raft of community figures are also calling for investment in environmentally sustainable infrastructure. I attended the Press Club address by the ACTU secretary, Greg Combet, who called for increased public debt in order to invest in our public infrastructure. I note the remarks of the Chief Executive of the Australian Industry Group, Heather Ridout, who said:</para><quote><para>... we have a deficit fetish in Australia which is really disguising under-investment in a lot of our major infrastructure assets and it's really encouraging government, not sufficiently, to invest in long-term assets for the country.</para></quote><para>But the government is not listening, despite what the Prime Minister may say. Of course, the urgent investment needs do not end with the environment. The Greens have spoken many times in this chamber about the importance of investing in public health and public education. We have identified the need for in the order of $4 billion in additional annual investment in Medicare, which could be funded by abolishing the private health insurance rebate—taxpayers' money that provides insurance, not health services. We have also identified the need for $7 billion in public education spending across the lifelong spectrum of education, from preschool through to university and TAFE tertiary education.</para><para>My office has been inundated, as I hope many senators' offices have been, with information on the resource needs of our public schools. I take this opportunity to seek leave to table a raft of representations from public school teachers, which have been circulated to all parties, identifying the resources needed for their public schools. They were faxed to senators' offices, but I am happy to provide the government with a copy now.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator Eggleston</name></talker><para>—There was a request from the Greens to table documents, but the Greens are advised that the government have not yet read the documents and cannot agree to the tabling until those documents have been read by the whips.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AOR</name.id><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name></talker><para>—They have been provided to the minister on duty.

They include things such as toilet blocks and new readers books in schools. They call for investment in public resources rather than in the tax cuts proposed in this legislation. When our schools are going without these things, it is not the time to pay bonuses to the already well-off, but that is not the way the Treasurer sees it. The Treasurer would have us believe that this piece of legislation is simply about returning money that has already been taken away as a result of the government's favourite bugbear—bracket creep. We have heard numerous members of the government claim that the top tax rates are far lower in the income scale than they used to be and that a move to reduce this burden on high-income earners is long overdue. This is deliberately misleading rubbish. </para><para>Professor John Quiggin, from the Australian National University, has been at pains to point out this deception. In the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> just a few weeks ago, he described this claim as `one of the sillier claims in the debate over tax policy'. This is because the range of the tax scale was more progressive back in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. In that period, those paying the top rate of tax paid up to 67c in the dollar; those now paying the top rate pay 48c in the dollar and earn about the same amount relative to those who paid 48c in the dollar during earlier decades. So the idea that there has been some terribly unjust shift in taxation rates for those earning 1.3 times the average weekly earnings is simply and plainly wrong.</para><para>The reason the government wants to bring in this tax cut is not that injustices have been done unto higher income earners. It is much more to do with how those higher income earners, or those aspiring to become high-income earners, will vote in the coming election. If the government were responsible in amending the tax laws it would look at the $8.2 billion in loopholes that the Australian Council of Social Services has identified, such as diverting income to a private company or lower tax rates payable, equalling $1.3 billion; executive perks such as salary sacrificing for a company car, coming up to $1 billion; income splitting to reduce tax payable, coming up to $800 million; family trusts in the order of $400 million and salary sacrificing superannuation in the order of $2.5 billion. These are the kinds of measures that the average Josephine wants to hear about, because this is what progressive taxation is supposed to be—tax according to one's ability to pay rather than tax according to one's ability to evade.</para><para>On the other end of the scale, low-income earners need to be relieved of the massive impact of high marginal tax rates when they move from welfare to work. The GST is an example of the regressive taxation brought in by this government that has hurt low-income earners the most. The Greens support the rolling back of this GST. Ordinary Australians are being rorted and services are being run down. Their incomes have declined in comparison to those at the top of the ladder. As long as they do not live in marginal seats—and most of them do not—this government looks set to continue ignoring them. The Greens say no to this insulting, cynical logic of election handouts and the haemorrhaging of our desperately needed public funds into the pockets of the wealthy. The Greens will oppose this legislation. During the second reading debate I sought to move a second reading amendment, which I will read out for the Senate:</para><quote><para>... condemning the government for attacking the progressive nature of personal income tax system, reaffirming the importance of personal income tax system as a means of both redistributing wealth and providing for adequate public services and supporting alternative measures that would redirect the revenue forgone through this measure and other regressive budget measures into public health, public education, housing and environmental protection.</para></quote><para>The Australian Greens will support the amendments proposed by Senator Murray as an improvement on the current piece of legislation, which we will oppose. I seek leave to table the statements from public school teachers on the resources they would like to see public money spent on in their schools. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>23491</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have only just had a quick look at the documents. Whilst the government would normally be disposed to allow any document to be tabled that is remotely relevant to a bill, flicking through this it appears to be multiple copies of a petition that relates to some requests for further facilities in the public-private education debate. Even if money were not available pursuant to these tax cuts, it is not customary to hypothecate on any amount saved on one bill for some other purpose. For those reasons, leave is not granted.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>23491</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am surprised by this move by the minister. My understanding is that, where people have written petitions that are not in a format that can be tabled as a petition in parliament, it is customary to seek leave—as I have done many times in similar instances—to table those documents or those letters from individuals about their areas of concern. The legislation we are debating right now is about government priorities on how budget money is to be spent. Last year I moved an amendment on behalf of the Australian Greens to say that this money should be spent on public education. That is the same discussion that I have just had in putting forward the Greens contribution to this debate. It fits perfectly with the contributions that we have had from public school teachers and parents around the country who want to ensure that their voices can be heard in this debate. They are saying, `Rather than having the money put into tax cuts, we would like to see it put into our public schools.' </para></talk.start><para>I have sought leave many times in the parliament to table contributions when they have not been in petition form. All the other parties have granted leave for these documents to be tabled. They were provided to the government so that they could peruse them before my asking leave for them to be tabled in the parliament. I ask the minister to reconsider her decision to ensure that the concerns of these teachers about how public money should be spent in the context of the budget outlined in the bill we are debating today are tabled. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Kirk, Linda  (The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN)</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Kirk)</inline>—Senator Nettle, leave is not granted.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>23491</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I urge Senator Coonan to reconsider this matter.

I know that Senator Payne is proud to be a member of a government that not only has a fine record of environmental activism but also has an environmental vision for the future. Building on initiatives like the Natural Heritage Trust, the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality, the representative areas program for the Great Barrier Reef, the marine protected areas in Australia's vast territorial oceans, meeting its Kyoto targets, the Living Murray initiative, the national water initiative and the Greenhouse Challenge—just to name a few—today's energy statement demonstrates irrefutably that this government is the greenest government in the history of the Federation.</para></talk.start><para>Those who are serious about these issues should study the coalition's environmental agenda and our record and compare them with the promises, perceptions and stunts of other political parties. The Prime Minister's energy statement, delivered just an hour ago, provides real leadership and vision. It highlighted the establishment of a $500 million fund to bring at least $1 billion of extra new investment in low-emission technologies. It also highlighted $134 million to support commercialisation of renewable technologies and $75 million for solar cities trials to demonstrate a visionary energy scenario where solar energy efficiency and market reforms combine to provide a sustainable future. Also, the statement highlighted the requirement that Australia's largest energy users undertake regular energy efficiency assessments. </para><para>The ability to spend money on the environmental enhancements that have been mentioned today follows on from the Howard government's historically good management of the Australian economy. You cannot invest in our natural heritage and in leading edge emissions technology to help the environment if you have the sort of banana republic style economy left to us by the last Labor government. The Howard government is looking to the future and acting to lower the costs of meeting future greenhouse constraints. This will position Australia well to contribute to global emissions reductions whilst maintaining our nation's prosperity.</para><para>By contrast, Labor's proposals seem to stop at parachuting in—in a less than democratic way, I might add—some wealthy, non-voting rock star or resorting to stunts about Tasmanian forests, and a proposal for the Murray-Darling system that is less than what the Commonwealth and the state Labor governments have already agreed upon. Labor's determination to sign the flawed Kyoto protocol will bring not one improvement in the world's climate change problem but it will cost thousands of jobs in regional Australia. It will cost economic growth and it will cost export income. Labor's mandatory renewable energy target of five per cent would cost Australia something like $11 billion. If you look at the proposal of that other stunt party, the Greens, of 10 per cent, you would see that would cost Australia something like $23 billion annually. It cannot be done.

The Australian Crime Commission comprises two-thirds its own staff and one-third secondees. I have been asked questions about the activities of the two particular officers that I have mentioned. In regard to that question, I have said that there has been an independent investigation carried out, the results of which are reportedly due soon to the Commonwealth Ombudsman, within the fortnight. I look forward to the receipt of that report. What has been investigated are the activities of these two particular officers and the circumstances surrounding their alleged corrupt activities. </para></talk.start><para>Of my own confidence in the Australian Crime Commission I can say this: no evidence has been produced to the government which would indicate systemic corruption in the Australian Crime Commission. The <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners</inline> program last night centred around the activities of two particular officers. I have yet to receive from anyone evidence which would indicate systemic corruption. But I have said that the Commonwealth government regards these allegations concerning these two particular officers very seriously, and that is why we are paying such close attention to the investigation of these officers. In relation to the Australia Crime Commission itself, there is no police force in Australia which has the level of scrutiny that that body has. For instance, we have an intergovernmental committee of police ministers from across the country. They will be meeting at the end of this month. We have, as well as that, a board made up of police commissioners from around Australia: the head of Customs, the head of ASIO, the head of ASIC—the corporate regulator—and the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department of the Commonwealth government. We also have a parliamentary joint committee on which members opposite preside over or participate in. In addition, we have the Commonwealth Ombudsman, who has oversight of the activities of the Australian Crime Commission.</para><para>The secondees have another layer of scrutiny—that is, their own disciplinary provisions in their home police force. The two particular police officers are subject to investigation. The disciplinary bodies in the states of Victoria and New South Wales are involved as well in the investigation into the officers' activities. I was not pre-empting the outcome of this independent investigation. What I was indicating was that there has been no evidence which would reveal systemic corruption in the Australian Crime Commission. To compare the Australian Crime Commission with the situation in Victoria is simply drawing a very long bow and, in fact, it is incorrect. The <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners </inline>program last night stated that there were over 100 allegations of corruption in relation to the Victoria Police.</para><para>Last night in the same program, two state police detectives who were seconded to the Australian Crime Commission were mentioned. It was stated in the same program that over 20-odd years there had been very few allegations of corruption concerning the Australian Crime Commission's predecessor, the NCA. In putting the Australian Crime Commission in place, we put in enhanced provisions in relation to accountability, professional standards, vetting and the turnover of staff so that we would not have entrenched practices growing up in that body. Forty-five per cent of its staff are new staff. This is a new body and one which is making a great contribution to law enforcement of this country. Having said that, we remain concerned about the allegations in relation to the two particular police officers, and we look forward to the early receipt of that independent investigation report, which I have mentioned. </para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>23496</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

I know that he knows, like all of us on this side know, that one of the best ways we can help Australian families and their children into the future is to have a strong economy. Last week Minister Andrews announced that Australia's unemployment rate was 5.5 per cent—the lowest level in almost 23 years. The unemployment rate is below six per cent, interest rates are below six per cent and inflation is below three per cent. Economic management is not a fluke and it is no accident. It requires a steady hand on the tiller—a steady hand on the budget. In net terms, we reduced the debt of $96 billion that Labor left us by almost $70 billion, saving us almost $6 billion in interest. We can assist families because we have made those savings. We are not paying interest on debt, racking up debt that we cannot afford or racking up debt for the next generation.</para></talk.start><para>The recent federal budget is designed to keep our economy strong. It is about securing our future. It is about supporting the backbone of Australian society—Australian families. It is about giving families choice and about giving them opportunities. The new More Help for Families measure will provide an additional $19.2 billion for families over five years. It is the largest package of assistance ever put in place by an Australian government. Around two million families with 3.5 million children will benefit from the changes to the family tax benefits system.</para><para>This week we continue to deliver to families. The one-off payment will see over the next two weeks about two million eligible families receiving a $600 payment for each dependent child. About two million families will start receiving an average payment of $1,200 in their bank accounts from this week. An eligible family with four children will receive $2,400. The bonus is tax free, and it is not taken into account in assessing pensions or benefits as income. It is expected that the majority of payments will have been made by 22 June and a smaller number by the end of June. Strong economic growth and good economic management by the Howard government have allowed us to deliver the extra financial support that families deserve. </para><para>Senator Fifield asked me about alternative policies. I really do not know that I can answer that question, Senator Fifield, because you get mixed messages. Mr Latham, on the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline> when he was asked to make a commitment that families would not be worse off under Labor, twice failed to give Australian families that commitment. Mr McMullan, the spokesperson for finance, when he was asked about the $600 supplement and the increase in the base rate of the family tax benefits, said that he could not guarantee that past 2005. So there is no policy. What Labor have been saying is, `After the budget, we'll tell you about the family policy.' It is nearly a month since the budget and we still have not got a family tax policy from the Labor Party—no policy, no sign of policy, no commitment to families that they will not be worse off and no guarantee that the $600 supplement will be continued past next financial year. There are no policies. Labor are a policy-free zone. They have had a chance. The budget has been there.

It is a statement that indicates, not surprisingly, that the government is determined to maintain economic growth in this country and to take advantage of the comparative benefits that we have in our natural resource sector but nevertheless to exploit those in an energy efficient way. The government has in place existing programs and existing incentives for renewable energy that encourage that, but also it believes that there is the potential for new technologies to greatly assist in the overall task of a more energy efficient economy and that there is a strong case in favour of investing public money, together with private sector money, in the development of these new technologies.</para></talk.start><para>Therefore, the Prime Minister indicated that included in the range of new initiatives is the fact that the government would be driving investment of at least $1.5 billion to demonstrate breakthrough technologies with significant long-term greenhouse gas reduction potential through the establishment of a $500 million fund to leverage private sector investment of at least $1 billion in the demonstration of low-emission technologies. What the Prime Minister is saying is, yes, there are renewable technologies available, they are being taken up in Australia and we do have a program that encourages and supports the taking up of those technologies. It would have been possible as one alternative to extend that program but there are alternative ways to go forward.

In some ways the government is covering the field. It is doing so, as I said, because it wishes to achieve a more sustainable economy. That is in Australia's national interest. It is in not only its short-term interest but also the interests of future generations.

We understand that the states and territories want to do the same, and we have all learned that through the COAG trials, so that Indigenous people will have less difficulty in dealing with a wide range of bureaucracies and so that we do not make it as difficult, as all of us have done for so long, for Indigenous people in rural and remote regions to get the proper assistance they need.</para><para>I understand that there are different views in relation to the abolition of ATSIC, although I notice that Mr Latham has said that he thought it should go and that he had lost confidence in it.

The point I was making was a very clear one: the Australian Crime Commission has put in place enhanced measures in relation to vetting people who want to be seconded to the ACC or who want to work for the ACC. We have adopted a rotational basis—that is, to shorten the periods of time that people would work with the ACC and to keep that rotation going. I think I touched on that in the answer I gave to Senator Ludwig. The reason behind that is obvious: it is to avoid entrenched bad practices gaining a foothold in an organisation such as the ACC. There is vetting that goes into the financial affairs of the applicant concerned and other assessments. We have also looked at professional standards, which the Commonwealth Ombudsman has looked at, and an independent committee has been set up in that regard. </para></talk.start><para>The ACC has put in place measures which have been an improvement on the NCA.

In those three years, more than 2.9 million incorrect payments have been made to families—that is, 56 per cent of all payments totalling $2.5 billion have been wrong, and 1.6 million families have been overpaid an average of $900 each year. That means that the government has recovered a total of $1.5 billion from families through the stripping of their tax returns, the issuing of debt notices and garnisheeing of future payments. The one thing the government system seemingly cannot do is to pay families their correct entitlement when they need it each fortnight—I stress: when they need it each fortnight. Even the government's research tells it that families do not want to deal with annual assessments of their circumstances—they want financial support when they need it and in accordance with their circumstances. This is the component that the government cannot grapple with.</para><para>In the recent federal budget the government tried to paper over the problem by providing this $600 payment, but I hope Australian families will recall that the $1,000 payment that the government gave before the last election lasted for only one year. This time families will receive $600 before this election and a promised $600 after it to flow through the system—the government claims—as an additional family benefits payment. But, when we look at the detail, we discover that that additional $600 will not be indexed in future in the same way that family payments were in the past. Senator Patterson today promised that this $600 would maintain its real value. The trick, though, is in what she means by the `real value'. It is clear from her answers today that she continues to fudge on that issue. I suspect it is because she got dudded in cabinet. She knows that family payments have been indexed by a wage related measure for many years. She knows that the trick—perhaps it was Treasury, it seems that FaCS was not aware of this trick when we questioned them in estimates—of making this $600 a cushion on wage related indexation is the fraud that the Howard government is now running. If indexation had occurred in the way the old formula applied, and you compare it to how indexation will work with this new figure, this additional $600 will disappear in five years. That is the fraud that the government is now peddling. The government has refused to come back to the Senate Community Affairs References Committee with the detail following the estimates process last week. Senator Patterson indicated that, if necessary, the government would legislate to maintain the real value of this additional $600, but what the government still has not dealt with is that the change to the indexation formula changes the value of family payments across the board, not just this $600. This $600 will be a cushion on future increases and there will not be the benefit in the system that this government claims.</para><para>If Senator Patterson had said today quite frankly and quite clearly that the indexation of the family benefit would continue on the same basis that it had in the past then she would have avoided this fraud. She did not do that today and that is why she must have been dudded in cabinet. CPI is what the minister refers to, yet anybody who has been around the indexation of family support and pensions knows that, if you want to maintain the real value of pensions and assistance, you link it to a wage related measure. We know this problem, for instance, in relation to the child-care benefit. We know that the affordability of the child-care benefit has been in decline because it is indexed solely to the CPI. There is a long history of indexation across pensions and benefits and this government— <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>23509</page.no><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name><name.id>TH4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Isn't it interesting that Senator Collins can come in here, day after day, whingeing, whining and carrying on as she does about this issue, yet at no stage has she released a policy.

We have asked the minister to provide the detail as to how she can be so confident that the value of the $600 payment in family tax benefit A will not be eroded because of changes to the indexation formula. The minister stood up in question time today and said: `You don't need to worry about that. It won't happen.' We have asked the department and we have asked the minister for the detail to be provided. We were assured at estimates that it would be provided. We are still waiting for the answer. The minister's response today was, `The department's too busy trying to get this money out into people's letterboxes during the next few weeks.' The minister says they are too busy to provide us with the detail of this pre-election bribe. The fact of the matter is the detail should be available. It should have been available as part of the development of this policy announcement in the budget.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The reason we do not have an answer, I suspect, is that the minister and the department have been caught out. During the estimates process this issue was brought to light during the questioning of the departmental officials, and the minister did not really understand. And she still does not understand. The fact of the matter is that any value arising out of this initial one-off payment will be eroded over the course of the next five years because of the changes to the indexation arrangements that would have otherwise applied to family tax benefits. </para><para>Senator Collins, in her excellent speech on this issue, pointed out that this government has presided over a system which is giving with one hand and taking back with the other. The only response you get from members of the government, such as Senator Knowles, is to attack the messenger. But Australian families know that even when they advise Centrelink of changes to their income circumstances, even when they comply with the requirements that are laid down, they often find they still end up with a debt. It is no fault of theirs; it is the fault of this system. We have a situation now where 1.6 million Australian families have an average debt to Centrelink of $900 per year. Okay, this government has tried to fix the problem for the short term by paying a one-off $600 payment, but what those families have to understand is there is a sting in the tail—that this government gives with one hand and takes away with another. And that is the cruellest trick you can play on the Australian people. <inline font-style="italic">(</inline><inline font-style="italic">Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>23511</page.no><name role="metadata">Humphries, Sen Gary</name><name role="display">Senator HUMPHRIES</name><name.id>KO6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As I listened across the chamber to Senator Collins and Senator Forshaw, a phrase that was made famous by the late President Reagan sprang to mind, a phrase he made popular during the 1980 presidential debate. He famously said, `There you go again.' There indeed goes this opposition once again desperately trying to strip some gloss off what has been extremely good news for Australian families in the last few months in the form of additional payments to them under family tax benefits. There have been significant improvements to their financial positions, there have been significant increases in their security and there has been a significant increase in their capacity to meet the cost of living. With the increase in the amount of money available to Australian families, these families are significantly more reassured by the action they have seen from this government than by the rhetoric they hear from the opposition.</para></talk.start><para>The fact is that, however you look at the situation, Australian families today are in toto better off under the present regime and the present arrangements for family tax payments and family support than they ever were under Labor—and not by small degrees but by a country mile. There is more money available to Australian families for income support—$19.2 billion for the next five years—announced under the More Help for Families package, there is wider eligibility and there are larger payments. More Australian families positively benefit from these arrangements. I ask those opposite: do they really think Australian families are focusing on the questions they are raising—these relatively marginal questions, with respect, about overpayments—or do they think Australian families are focusing on the big picture of how payments have improved and how their position has improved under the coalition government? If you think they are focused on the former, you are kidding yourselves.</para><para>We keep coming back to this question of overpayments. Labor says there are overpayments to Australian families that have to be repaid to the government and it shows the government is mean and niggardly and that it wants to get this money back. Let me remind people that top-up payments to Australian families who missed out were not available under the Labor Party government. If you underestimated your income under a Labor administration, then too bad, stiff cheese, you lost out. Today people in that position can receive a top-up benefit, but the corollary of that, the other side of that coin, is that overpayments need to be addressed, and that is what this government does with its policy.</para><para>I ask members opposite: what is the practical alternative to recovering overpayments made to anybody who is a beneficiary of the Australian government or any government, for that matter? What is the alternative to recovering those overpayments if they are made? I do not know. We have not heard what Labor's alternative is. We do not know what Labor are going to do—if they ever miraculously squeak into office somehow—to address this issue. Are they going to forgive those sorts of debts? Are they going to say, `No, it's all right'? Or are they going to do what they have done in the past and say that there are no top-up payments for Australian families and that if you underestimate your income, too bad, you do not get a top-up. The other side of that coin is that you can keep an overpayment. Is that what you are going to do? Let us know. Let us find out. </para><para>I know that a previous Labor minister once tried to implement a policy of no collection. I recall that many years ago, when he was responsible for the ACT, Tom Uren made the statement in public that he thought it was unfair that ACT public housing tenants should have to pay outstanding back rent. What happened? There was an explosion in unpaid rent to the ACT Housing Trust—so much so that the succeeding minister had to reverse the policy and set about recovering millions of dollars in unpaid rent to the Australian government as administrator of the ACT Housing Trust. So Labor's policies do not actually bear any scrutiny. We do not even know what Labor's policies are in detail. No-one is fooled by this exercise. We know that you do not have an alternative. You are trying to take the gloss off what has been a very good policy that has provided great benefits to the Australian community and Australian families. You are failing miserably in that exercise and you are coming back to this issue by trying to find some currency and some mileage in it. Frankly, I do not think that anyone sees that you are succeeding in that exercise.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>23512</page.no><name role="metadata">Moore, Sen Claire</name><name role="display">Senator MOORE</name><name.id>00AOQ</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise also to take note of answers given by Senator Patterson today. Here we go again. We have been talking about the system for a number of years now—in fact, since it was first introduced. The system that was introduced to pay family tax under this government is basically flawed. It is not gloss. In fact, the only gloss in this system is the one-off payment which has been introduced—and that is gloss. For all the families in Australia who will be receiving the one-off payment over the next two weeks, that will be gloss. However, what is below the gloss is significant. Debt is not a marginal issue.</para></talk.start><para>We have a statement by the Minister for Family and Community Services that `an amazing amount of money' will be given to Australian families over the next couple of months. One component of that amazing amount of money that will be spent on this issue is a significant advertising campaign. We do not know all the details of the campaign. We have asked about it, but we are still waiting to see what the details will be. But, interestingly enough, one of the reasons for the advertising campaign which we discussed at Senate estimates was precisely the fact that Australian families are confused by the system of family payments. It is not an easy system to understand. One of the reasons that the government must spend about $20 million—an amazing amount of money on advertising for this component alone—is that people do not understand the system. We have heard before in this place and also in Senate estimates about a general acceptance that the system is complex and that some people get caught out by it—not a small marginal number. I take issue with the fact that debt can be considered to be small and marginal when people are traumatised by receiving information from the government that they owe money. </para><para>In this place we have discussed what we consider to be the inbuilt flaw in the system, which indicates that people are in a situation of having to make a choice. They have to guesstimate their forward income, and on the basis of that guesstimate their payments are made. We know that the vast majority of people in the country who take up this payment prefer to have it paid on a fortnightly basis. There is no question about that. Senator Patterson has agreed with that. People see the value of getting that regular income. However, the real kick to this process is that, if you have not calculated your income correctly at the beginning of the financial year or at times throughout the financial year, you will have a significant debt at the end of the time. There is no question about this. We have heard from previous ministers that a debt is a debt is a debt. We say that the system must be enhanced to ensure that people are not caught out by this debt.</para><para>Amidst the amazing amount of money to be spent on the advertising campaign around the glossy one-off payments that are to be brought in by the end of this financial year and the glossy growth of the payment over the next couple of financial years, there must be some awareness in the community that you need to consider that a debt may be accruing. We asked quite directly whether the advertising would promote some clear understanding of how debts are accrued. We also asked quite a specific question as to whether this year alone there will be a clear understanding that tax refunds will not be stripped to repay the debt that people may have accrued. You would all understand that in the past this has been a significant issue that we have raised. People have come to our offices and complained that they have received notices from the Taxation Office at the end of the financial year saying that, because they have a family payment debt, their refund caused by other purposes will be stripped and they will not have access to that money. We are trying to understand whether this year—quite significantly a year where we could be deep in an election campaign—the advertising campaign will say that this year alone you will not be stripped.</para><para>The minister consistently says that people on this side of the chamber do not understand. We do understand, Minister. We are asking specific questions. We want to get the system to work. But it is not just us who have to understand but the community, the people who are receiving these payments and the people who will be benefited by the gloss but will also be damaged by any debt that they accrue. This is the real issue. This is not some kind of stunt or a whinge or a whine. These are direct questions to the government. Have you seen how the debt will be worked out? How will families be told about it? Will they be helped through this process so that they will not be further traumatised by a payment that is their right? <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: Contraception</title><page.no>23513</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>23513</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads (Senator Ian Campbell) to a question without notice asked by Senator Allison today relating to the availability of an emergency contraceptive drug.</para></motion><para>The question went to what is a matter of very significant public health importance, and something that is of particular importance to the health of many women in Australia—that is, the announced desire of the Minister for Health and Ageing to reverse the decision that was made some months back to allow what is commonly known as the `morning after pill' to be made available through pharmacies. Probably what is most noteworthy is that the minister chose not to answer the question at all and made no comment whatsoever on what is a very controversial and quite widely publicised announcement by the health minister. I think it is extraordinary that Minister Campbell suggested that he had no information on the matter, no comment on the matter and no view on the matter, and simply referred it to the health minister. That is unsatisfactory and I suggest it is very unlikely that there was no information and no awareness on the part of the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing in this chamber about that particular matter. It is a matter of great significance. </para><para>If you examine Minister Abbott's explanation as to why he wants to reverse this decision and restrict the availability of the morning after pill and the other announcements that he has made, which he has been forced to back down on—according to reports—by his own party room, to attempt to contravene the privacy of young people who seek information and help from a doctor, there is clearly an agenda here on the part of the health minister—an ideological agenda, a narrow agenda driven by a narrow idea of morality that is very concerning. </para><para>I noted with great interest the comment made by at least one Liberal Party member in the weekend papers suggesting that this agenda from the health minister was directly linked to the agreement that the health minister made with some Independent crossbench senators on his Medicare safety net legislation. That is an extremely worrying suggestion. I am sure many people had that suspicion, but the fact that the statement was made by a Liberal Party member gives much greater weight to that suspicion. It is a classic example of why the Senate needs to act responsibly, openly and transparently about important policy matters. </para><para>It is no secret that the Democrats negotiated extensively with the government about their proposed Medicare safety net. We negotiated and achieved significant gains on the government's Medicare proposals—extra incentives for bulk-billing, extra assistance for allied health—without compromising the fundamental and integral component of Medicare, which is its universality. Those sets of negotiations in the areas which had been agreed to by the health minister were undercut by Independent crossbench senators here. You had to wonder at the time why they would undercut something and agree to something that actually achieved less assistance for allied health and that unnecessarily destroyed the universality of Medicare by creating a two-tiered safety net, the flaws of which were outlined quite clearly in a Senate committee report which one of those Independent senators had signed off on.</para><para>So you do have to ask the question: what else was there in that agreement at least for one, if not more, of those senators that made them feel it was a better result for them than what otherwise would have been achieved? Why did they allow the fundamental principle of universality to be dramatically compromised to achieve something that was less than the government was already going to agree to? You then have to ask the question: were there other side deals? Were there other issues that were not announced at the time that were part of that agreement? This is not the first time that this minister has subsequently raised issues that are clearly very narrow, morality driven—I use that term in a very narrow sense—and ideologically driven. It is a conservative morality agenda that has been put forward. Statements were made not long after that that threats to family planning funding had been drawn attention to in the past. </para><para>This is a very serious matter and the Democrats are pleased that the minister has failed in his agenda to attack the privacy rights of young people seeking to go to the doctor who are still very concerned that the government will seek to find a way to restrict the rights of women to access a full range of contraceptive assistance and simple assistance on a basic health matter, such as the morning after pill. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question agreed to. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><petition.group><petition.groupinfo><title>PETITIONS</title><page.no>23515</page.no></petition.groupinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1</name.id><name role="metadata">The Clerk</name><name role="display">The Clerk</name></talker><para>—Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows:</para></talk.start></interjection><petition><petitioninfo><title>Trade: Live Animal Exports</title><page.no>23515</page.no><no.signed>355</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>DT6</name.id></name.ids><names><name>Senator Bartlett</name></names></petitioninfo><quote><para>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: </para><para>The Petition of the undersigned notes the inadequate numbers of livestock available for Australian slaughter, food consumption and hides; the increase in Australian abattoir closures; the growing negative economic, employment and social impacts on rural Australia; and the unnecessary suffering endured by Australian livestock because of this nation's pursuit of trade and financial benefits at any cost.

response'.</para><para>Following the release of the government's discussion paper on the deadlocks mechanism in October last year, I announced the formation of a distinguished Consultative Group, chaired by the Hon Neil Brown QC, a former minister in the Fraser government, and also including the Hon Professor Michael Lavarch, a former Attorney-General in the Keating government, and Professor Jack Richardson, a former Commonwealth Ombudsman. </para><para>The Consultative Group conducted a national public consultation process, focused on the two proposals canvassed in the discussion paper:</para></quote><para>-	the first of which would allow the Governor-General to convene a joint sitting of both houses when a bill has been twice rejected by the Senate;</para><para>-	the second of which would allow a joint sitting after an ordinary general election, to consider a bill rejected twice before the election and then once again after the election.</para><quote><para>These proposals did not represent an attack on the Senate.</para><para>They were not an attempt to extend the power of the Executive.</para><para>Not an attack on minor parties.</para><para>Since federation the way to resolve deadlocks has been through existing section 57:</para></quote><para>-	only six double dissolutions have occurred since then; </para><para>-	of these, on only one occasion, in 1974, was a joint sitting called to consider deadlocked legislation.</para><quote><para>It is my view that the requirements of section 57 impede good government today. </para><para>The Senate plays a very important role as a house of review, however, the government is formed in the House of Representatives. </para><para>An elected government, regardless of its political persuasion, should be able to implement the policies on which it was elected in the interests of all Australians.</para><para>The introduction of proportional representation in the Senate, combined with the move in 1983 to 6 senators being elected from each state at a half-Senate election, rather than 5 senators, has made it almost impossible for any government to obtain a majority in the Senate. </para><para>A party now needs 57.16 per cent of the vote in a state at a half Senate election to win a majority of seats in that state.</para><para>This means that opposition and minor parties have the power to persistently veto important government policies. </para><para>One example of this obstruction is on the government's proposals to change the unfair dismissal laws.</para><para>This is important government legislation which has been opposed by the Labor Party 40 times, despite being a key element of government policy, endorsed by the electorate at the last two federal elections. </para><para>The government does not consider it is in the national interest that the Senate should be capable of persistent obstruction of such important measures. </para><para>In recent experience, it can be difficult to engage public interest in matters of constitutional reform, but the Consultative Group heard from people at public meetings in every capital city, and looked at the 293 submissions received by my department from interested members of the public late last year. </para><para>I understand that the discussion at the public meetings, attended by around 240 people in total, was robust, and the issues covered wide ranging. </para><para>While the views expressed at the meetings were not necessarily reflective of the views of the broader electorate, the process was still worthwhile.</para><para>I am disappointed that, while the then Leader of the Opposition welcomed the release of a discussion paper, and said that Labor welcomed constitutional reform, there was no submission in response to the discussion paper from the Labor Party.</para><para>Nevertheless, some state and territory governments did lodge formal submissions, in which they supported constitutional reform of various types.</para><para>I also welcome public comments, in particular from Premiers Carr and Beattie, who have supported the right of the lower house to prevail over an upper house. </para><para>The Consultative Group also had the benefit of reviewing submissions from the Democrats, the Greens, One Nation and Senator Brian Harradine. </para><para>Each of these submissions provided valuable insight to the Consultative Group and the government.</para><para>In its report, the Consultative Group has made a number of observations about public attitudes in relation to legislative deadlocks. </para><para>I have previously stated that the government would consider holding a referendum in conjunction with the next federal election, if the period of public consultation revealed a reasonable prospect of community support for a change. </para><para>History shows that constitutional change is difficult in Australia, with only eight out of 44 referenda being passed since federation, so I have always emphasised the importance of bipartisan support.</para><para>The Consultative Group concluded that there is not `any substantial measure of support for either of the two options presented in the discussion paper'.</para><para>Consequently, the government is not proposing a referendum on this issue at the next election. </para><para>However, the Consultative Group also concluded that “the discussion paper and the consultation processes have provided a starting point for engaging the wider community on constitutional questions”, and recommended “a wider programme of consultation with the community, and more attention given to educating the public about the Australian Constitution and how it operates in practice”.</para><para>So that is what I propose.</para><para>In the past the government has supported programmes of education on constitutional issues.</para><para>In the lead up to the centenary of federation in 2001, the Constitutional Centenary Foundation was funded to encourage and promote public discussion, understanding and review of the Australian constitutional system. </para><para>Further, through the Discovering Democracy programme the government has made a significant investment in resources for schools to teach children about the constitution and our system of government. </para><para>This public consultation process on section 57 has itself made an important contribution to public debate regarding constitutional issues.</para><para>In light of the Consultative Group's comments about a continuing programme of education and consultation, I have had an initial discussion with the Leader of the Opposition about how this matter might be moved forward.</para><para>He indicated that the Opposition would not favour constitutional reform in this area unless the Senate's power to block supply was reduced or substantially circumscribed. This is not the government's position.</para><para>The government will approach future discussion on this issue from the starting point of a disposition to support option two—which would allow a joint sitting after an ordinary general election, to consider a bill rejected twice before the election and then once again after the election. This is a sensible response to the problems addressed by the Consultative Group.</para><para>In closing, I wish to thank the members of the Consultative Group for their work on this critical issue of constitutional reform. </para><para>Each of them brought to the role a great deal of experience in constitutional law and knowledge of the workings of government. </para><para>They have each contributed a great deal of time, energy and commitment to the task of consulting with the public on these issues. </para><para>I am personally grateful for the work they have done and for the advice they have provided to me and the government on these important matters.</para><para>Mr Speaker, I commend the Consultative Group's report to the House and to all Australians. </para></quote></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>23524</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the statement.</para></motion><para>It is well known that those attempting constitutional reform in this country have a poor success rate, and Mr Howard is no exception. Since the last successful referendum in 1977, seven issues, including that of the republic, have all been bowled over. All have been defeated. While Mr Howard facilitated the republic referendum in 1999, he also ensured its failure. The whole republican referendum exercise cost more than $20 million, not including the constitutional convention. From the outset, it was a complete waste of money in the absence of a Prime Minister's enthusiastic imprimatur. </para><para>One could read Mr Howard's venture last year into constitutional change for Senate deadlocks and double dissolutions as a chance to cement his place in history as a constitutional reformer. But he must have known—anyone would have known—that Australians are extremely wary of anything that might weaken the Senate and are deeply suspicious of and resistant to any proposal that does not have bipartisan support—bipartisan at a minimum; it probably needs more. I think it needs support also from the minor parties in our political process. </para><para>Some might argue it was worth spending almost $200,000 on this flawed exercise to test the waters. I do not agree. Just look at the results. We found out through the Senate estimates process that a total of only 240 people turned up to discuss the white paper, across eight capital cities at a cost of around $850 per person. The report says:</para><quote><para>Attendance at the public meetings was minimal and the lack of any positive community response suggests that there is at least widespread public indifference to the government's proposals.</para></quote><para>When it came to Mr Howard's own option—a joint sitting to vote for legislation that the Senate has negatived just three months beforehand—the report is blunt. It says:</para><quote><para>Option One received a rough passage in most of the Group's consultations. The clear prevailing body of opinion was that the option would increase executive governmental power at the expense of the Senate and render the Senate far less effective in performing its function of review. The Group concludes that the option would have virtually no chance of community acceptance either now or in the foreseeable future.</para></quote><para>The option proposed by former Labor Attorney-General Michael Lavarch to hold a joint sitting after an ordinary general election received a lukewarm rather than an icy reception. The report says:</para><quote><para>Many persons in the consultation process did not differentiate between Options One and Two in terms of their general mistrust of the political process or their concern about implications for the current system of government. However, other persons saw Option Two as at least preferable to Option One and were open to discussing its merits, particularly when combined with other constitutional reforms such as fixed parliamentary terms. For these reasons, the Group considers that Option Two would have greater potential for success in the longer term, particularly if the government were willing to consider some modification of the option.</para></quote><para>Mr Howard need only have chatted to just a few voters anywhere in Australia to have seen that his plans were futile. On the other hand, I suspect that Mr Howard in fact saw the whole thing as futile all along. After all, many less controversial proposals than this have been put before the electorate in the past only to go down in a screaming heap. </para><para>What I suspect Mr Howard was up to, in his usual devious and divisive way, was wasting a great deal of taxpayers' money and people's time to persuade the electorate that he was a victim of Senate obstructionism and that the Senate was responsible for his lack of a third-term agenda. As usual, the Prime Minister put politics before good government. There was no consultation with the opposition or with the minor parties. He did not lift the phone and ring the then opposition leader Mr Crean or, after Mr Crean, Mr Latham to try to engage in a process that may well have led to some bipartisan, broad support in the parliament.</para><para>Labor is not opposed to Senate reform. In fact, we have made it clear that we would be prepared to consult on and consider the Prime Minister's second model. We recognise that either model would mean a weakening of Senate powers but we say a weakening of Senate powers is of itself not necessarily a bad thing. Mr Howard will need to deal with the possibility that these mechanisms could be abused and could potentially destroy the Senate as a genuine house of review.  </para><para>For example, could we guarantee a conservative government would not reintroduce malapportionment to our electoral system? Could we guarantee a government would not destroy the powers of the Auditor-General, as former Premier Jeffrey Kennett tried to do in Victoria? Could we guarantee a joint sitting would not diminish the scrutiny powers of the Senate? Could we be assured that the appallingly badly drafted and draconian original ASIO bill 2002 would not have passed in its original, wholly unacceptable form after a short delay? </para><para>In addition to these issues, there are others that need to be addressed as part of any attempt to reform the deadlock provisions of the Constitution. The first of those, of course, is removing the power of the Senate to block supply. After the events of 1975, Labor believe that the power to block supply should be removed. We do not believe that the Senate should have the power to bring down a democratically elected government. We remain resolutely committed to constitutional reform to prevent the Senate from rejecting, deferring or blocking appropriation bills.</para><para>The second issue is the important one of the introduction of fixed four-year terms. Fixed parliamentary terms would be a genuine reform and would address some of the uncertainties and limitations of our current political system. They would be good for our democracy and they would improve the quality of our government.</para><para>The third issue is maximum four-year terms for the Senate. I think we have got to the point where we know that the Australian people will not accept and agree to eight-year terms for the Senate. It is simply too long for accountability and mandates to have any meaning. With such a constitutional change, every election in effect would become a double dissolution election, giving ultimate say over blocked legislation to the people. This is the most democratic way of deciding what happens when the two houses are deadlocked. </para><para>Labor's approach to constitutional reform is different from this failed attempt by Mr Howard. We say constitutional change can be achieved only with real involvement of the people and with bipartisan agreement. That is something that is clearly way beyond the capacity of this Prime Minister, Mr Howard. I believe it can only be achieved with the sort of sensible approach that I have outlined under a future Labor government.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>23526</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise on behalf of the Australian Democrats to speak to the report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Resolving deadlocks: the public response</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline>and the Prime Minister's statement. The report went to the public response to the Prime Minister's proposals that were released last year for public consultation. I draw attention to the Democrats' submission to the consultative program. That outlines in a fair degree of detail, for anyone who wants to see it, our full response to this important issue. It is still available through the Democrats web site. I attended one of the public forums, which—and I am sure by total coincidence—was also the most strongly attended public forum. It was the one in Melbourne.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>—That would have been a coincidence, yes! </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name></talker><para>—I am not sure news of my attendance got out in advance, but perhaps it did. That might explain the huge throng of 40 or 50 people that were there. The first person got up and asked the panel to concede that the entire Constitution was a fraud and that everything that had happened since 1901 was illegal. They said that if we just acknowledged that and unravelled everything we could start to have a serious debate. That was perhaps a bit of an indication of where the night was going. Following on from that, there were some very useful contributions from a number of members of the public, from people who were concerned and who had obviously given thought to how to make our political system work better.</para></talk.start></continue><para>One point made at that forum, which I think was a very good one, was that even the term `deadlock' is not the most accurate term. It implies that there is some sort of stand-off when the fact is that, if the Senate rejects a piece of legislation, there is no stand-off. There is a resolution: the legislation has been rejected by the parliament. It is quite a clear-cut situation. The impression that the government likes to keep giving, that there is some unresolved situation just because it has not managed to succeed in getting what it wants, is completely false. The Senate's role under the Constitution—and this has always been recognised as its key role—is to examine legislative proposals put forward by the government of the day. It is clearly seen by the public as the specific role of the Senate, especially in the modern era, to examine the legislation the government has put forward. It puts forward proposed laws. They do not become laws unless the parliament, and particularly the Senate, agrees to them. If the Senate does not agree then they do not become law. The situation is resolved. It might not be resolved to the government's satisfaction, but that is life. There are plenty of things that get through the Senate that the Democrats do not support. They are not resolved to our satisfaction but they are resolved by being passed, even if in a form that we do not like.</para><para>There needs to be that simple recognition by people who engage in this debate that legislation being knocked back is not a bad thing in itself. You can have individual opinions about whether or not legislation is good or bad, as people obviously do, but the fact of it not passing is not some constitutional crisis or flaw in our system. It is actually a sign of the system working. It is worth repeating at every opportunity that the amount of legislation that is defeated by this parliament through the Senate is less than three per cent. Over 400 pieces of legislation have been put forward by this government since we came back to parliament after the last election, in about February 2002, and less than three per cent of those hundreds of bills have been rejected. Many of them have been amended and improved significantly. To suggest that there is some impediment to the reasonable operation of government is simply a falsehood. Because the Prime Minister starts this debate from that false premise, everything that flows from it is naturally flawed.</para><para>It was very clear from the limited public response at the public forums and in the submissions that there is very strong public support for the role the Senate plays. That is reflected in the fact that the public vote differently in the Senate from how they do in the House of Representatives. The Democrats more than any other party have had consistently over more than 20 years a higher percentage of the vote in the Senate compared to the House of Representatives. I think that is a reflection of the specific and very specialised role the Democrats have developed in the Senate. The support of the public for the Senate is fairly clear-cut. That is shown not just in the response that was there but even in the lack of response. There was no groundswell of public concern about the Senate getting in the way of this or any other government. The public saw the falsehood of the Prime Minister's premise for what it was and quite clearly said: `This is not serious. We're not even going to bother to engage.' </para><para>It is worth noting one conclusion of the report, that quite clearly there is no way that any proposal along the lines put forward would succeed; it would fail and fail dismally. The public has not been convinced of the need for any change. The report did say—and I hope there will be follow-up on this—that there should be a comprehensive program of consultation and education if change to section 57 of the Constitution is to be achieved. Section 57 deals with disagreements between the two houses.</para><para>The Democrats put forward an alternative proposal that we believe would work well and that would enhance the value and the power of our democracy for the Australian public. It was simply that, if a piece of legislation had been the subject of disagreement between the two houses a number of times, that question would be put directly to the public via a referendum at the following election. This proposal was seriously put forward and given significant support in the constitutional conventions back in the late 19th century. I am not sure whether it would have been suitable for that time but I am certain it is suitable now, with a much more educated electorate and much stronger communications technology. It would not be that difficult. In fact, it would be simple for questions like that to be put at a referendum at each election. I think that would give people a greater sense of meaning, belonging and power to their involvement in our democracy and would reduce some of the cynicism and powerlessness that people currently feel. It is a significant and valuable proposal that I believe should be considered and given more promotion.</para><para>The bottom line is that any attempt to simply look for a way for a government to bypass or get its legislation through the Senate is doomed to fail because the Senate was put here quite clearly from the very start, constitutionally and deliberately, to provide a check on the executive. There is no doubt that the executive of the government of the day, the cabinet, has become far more powerful in recent decades than it was at the start of our federation. There has been a clear and concerted attempt to diminish the power of the parliament, the Senate and the courts and they need to be defended against that. Clearly, the separation of powers and the fundamental underpinnings of our parliamentary democracy are in danger of getting out of whack if we give any more power to the government of the day. If anything, we need to be strengthening the power of the Senate and the parliament to counter some of the extreme advances in executive power and the misuse of power in recent times.</para><para>The one exception to that, which the Democrats do believe we should eliminate, is the power of the Senate to block supply, supply being the ordinary annual services of government. That does not mean budget measures; it means appropriations to allow government departments to continue ticking over. That is not a policy issue. It is the last area that should be held up and the Democrats strongly believe, as Labor has indicated, that it should be removed. It is a source of disappointment to us that the Liberal Party, and indeed the Greens, do not acknowledge that and want to maintain that inappropriate weapon. You can certainly hold a government to ransom in any area you like; you do not need to hold up supply and the operation of the ordinary services of government that serve the public while you are doing it. It is a weapon that should be removed. It is the only area that allows a distraction from the important debate about maximising the powers of the Senate to keep a proper check on whoever is the government of the day. It is a reminder that, come election time, the vote that people have for the Senate is just as important as the vote they have for who they elect to be Prime Minister. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>23529</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I join in making comments on the report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Resolving deadlocks: the public response</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline>and the Prime Minister's statement. We are a consultative government. If there is something that has been acknowledged about the Howard government over the past eight years it is that we do consult with the people. We want to ensure that anything we put forward does have the support of the Australian people, especially in the important area of constitutional change. Honourable senators will recall that there was a discussion some time ago about the mechanism for dealing with deadlocks between the Senate and the House of Representatives. As a result, in October last year the Prime Minister announced the formation of a distinguished consultative group, chaired by the Hon. Neil Brown, QC. That group also included the Hon. Professor Michael Lavarch and Professor Jack Richardson.</para></talk.start><para>The consultative group conducted a national public consultation process, focusing on two proposals that were canvassed in that paper. The first proposal would have allowed the Governor-General to convene a joint sitting of both houses when a bill has been twice rejected by the Senate. The second proposal would have allowed a joint sitting after an ordinary general election, to consider a bill rejected twice before the election and then once again after the election. We know in this place that there is legislation on which a government can get elected—and, indeed, re-elected—yet have trouble getting it through the chamber. The example par excellence is the unfair dismissal laws that Labor has now voted against 40 times. As a government we have been elected and re-elected on that policy, which would create overnight another 50,000 jobs. We have just seen the unemployment rate go down from 5.6 per cent down to 5.5 per cent, and we would see an even further reduction. But, for whatever reason, the Australian Labor Party and the minor parties have opposed that.</para><para>The question does arise, in the context of Australian democracy, of how to resolve such deadlocks. I think it was a worthwhile discussion to have, to see what views the Australian community might put forward to assist in the resolution of those sorts of disputes. That is why I fully agree with Senator Bartlett, who I think was nearly making a bit of an election pitch there for the Democrats, saying that it is just as important in voting for the Prime Minister as it is when voting for the Senate. I simply remind the Australian people that, if you do want a Howard government, you ought to be voting for the Liberal Party or the coalition Senate ticket in your particular state because, if you want the government's agenda to get through—such as getting the burden of the unfair dismissal laws off the back of small business—you need to deliver the numbers to the government of the day.</para><para>Senator Bartlett was quite correct in his assessment of why the Senate was set up in the first place—as a bit of a check on the executive. I think it was more as a states house, but I will not get into that debate. Suffice it to say that the voting system for the Senate has changed, as has the number of senators elected from each state. As I understand it at least, there was a time in Australian history when the winner took all in Senate elections and there was not proportional representation. We now have proportional representation with six senators elected at every half Senate election, as a result of which it is virtually impossible for a government to be given a majority in the Senate. In the past majorities in the Senate were achievable. I understand that the Fraser government for a while had a majority in the Senate.  </para><para>Now, with the numbers having been changed on top of the proportional representation system, it does make it very difficult for the government to get its legislative program through, even when it has put a policy position very strongly and clearly to the electorate not only at one election but at two elections. So the proposition was considered: what is the way to overcome these deadlocks? Two proposals were put forward and they were then canvassed around the country to ascertain what support there might be for those two proposals. </para><para>We as a government support the Senate and we support its role. It is, therefore, disappointing in a way to hear that the Australian Labor Party and the Democrats do support the abolition of the Senate's right to block supply. We as a government will not go that far. We do not accept that at all. If you genuinely want to block executive power, I would have thought one way to do that would be to block supply, but it appears that the block on executive power that allegedly the left wing parties in this chamber champion does not extend to a blocking of supply—of course, that is just in case those opposite ever get into power. They would not want to face that situation, because blocking supply means that there is such a deadlock that the ball has to be bounced again by the umpire—namely, the Australian people—to make a choice as to who should be the government of the day. I am not sure that that of itself is a strong argument.</para><para>The problem is that the Labor Party said that they did not really want to consider Senate reform without the blocking of supply being taken out of the equation. That was only by public comment because it was regrettable indeed that the Australian Labor Party, whilst welcoming the consultative process and the release of the original discussion paper, made no submission in response. You would have thought if the Labor Party were genuine about constitutional reform they would have had the resources to do so. Indeed, Senator Brian Harradine, an Independent senator from my home state of Tasmania, put in his own submission to this consultative group. It was a well thought out submission. I am not sure that I necessarily agree with it, but at least he put some work and effort into it and tried to work through the process effectively, whereas the Labor Party, as we have now come to expect, are opposing this for opposition's sake. They see a discussion paper and they feel they have to publicly welcome it, but then they have no positive policy input. The Labor Party have been lacking in a whole range of areas in the national debate in this country. They just cannot come up with a firm and fixed policy position which might be able to be advanced, other than that they want to remove the Senate's power to block supply. As I said, Senator Harradine, an Independent senator, was able to find the time and the commitment to make a submission. I think it reflects very adversely on the Australian Labor Party, the so-called alternate government, that they were not able to find the time to do so.</para><para>There have been some conspiracy theories put around that this was all about trying to diminish the power of the Senate. We as a government sought to see whether there was a process available whereby deadlocks between the two houses could be resolved. The consultative process was a good one. Those involved ought to be congratulated, but it is clear that the consultative process did not provide a clear approach that would be adopted by the Australian people. As a result, the government's decision is not to pursue it at this stage but to support in very strong terms a campaign of educating people about the importance of our constitutional arrangements in this country. Once that is understood, at the next election people will be voting for the Howard government not only in the House of Representatives but also in the Senate. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>23531</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>23531</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Appropriations and Staffing Committee</title><page.no>23531</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>23531</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Chapman, Grant (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Chapman)</inline>—Pursuant to standing order 166, I present the 40th report of the Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing entitled <inline font-style="italic">Senate Department Budget 2004-05</inline>.

The need for the work arose from the reform of Defence's logistics and supply functions, which resulted in the closure of the former Navy Stores complex at Randwick Barracks. Defence decided to prepare the surplus portion of the Randwick Barracks site for sale and eventual residential redevelopment. </para><para>The total estimated cost of the proposed redevelopment was $85.4 million. It was anticipated that the works would commence in June 2003 and would be completed in 2006.</para><para>In November 2002 Defence requested Committee approval for the remediation of Stage 1A of the disposal area to proceed prior to consideration of the remainder of the project. Early approval of this project element was sought so that Defence might meet its 2002-2003 revenue targets. The Committee examined the particulars of the Stage 1A works, estimated to cost $4.6 million, and granted approval on the understanding that the remainder of the project would be subject to a full inquiry in 2003.</para><para>A public hearing into the remainder of the works was scheduled for April 2003, but was cancelled at Defence's request. The Committee later learned that the cancellation occurred because Defence wished to refine the scope of the project and to re-examine financing and project delivery arrangements.</para><para>In order to receive planning approval from the Randwick City Council Defence undertook to meet certain timing and project specifications with respect to the site, including:</para></quote><para>	construction of a new community facility and hand-over, free-of-charge, to Council by November 2003;</para><para>	a Plan of Management and Bushland Regeneration Plan for the Randwick Environmental Park;</para><para>	embellishment of the Randwick Environmental Park to a cost of $1 million by November 2003;</para><para>	construction of an army oval prior to the development of any land relying upon the oval's storm-water retention function; as well as</para><para>	remediation of the property to a level suitable for future residential use. </para><quote><para>In October 2003, the Committee was concerned to learn that Defence had commenced three `interim works' projects at Randwick Barracks in order to satisfy commitments made to Council.</para><para>According to Defence, these `interim works' comprised:</para></quote><para>	the Community Facility and Randwick Environmental Park, estimated to cost $4.75 million;</para><para>	the temporary relocation of 9th Support Battalion and associated rationalisation of the retained portion of Randwick Barracks at a cost of $0.5 million; and</para><para>	preparation for sale of Stage 1B and parts of stages 5 and 6, costed at $3.5 million. </para><quote><para>The Committee noted that these works had been included in the referral made in December 2002 and, under the provisions of the <inline font-style="italic">Public Works Committee Act 1969</inline>, should not have been commenced prior to completion of the Committee's inquiry into the proposal. The Committee therefore requested that Defence cease works at the site and ordered that a public hearing be conducted at the earliest opportunity.</para><para>The public hearing held at Randwick on 12 March 2004 generated considerable local interest. In addition to the procedural issues addressed by the Committee, members of the public raised concerns relating to:</para></quote><para>	the level and extent of contamination at the site and</para><para>	the execution, monitoring and certification of remediation works.</para><quote><para>At the hearing, the Committee was assured that the level of contamination at the site was relatively low. In response to public concerns, however, the Committee recommended that a map showing the level and extent of contamination throughout the site be made readily available on the project web page.</para><para>A great deal of the written and verbal evidence presented to the inquiry dealt with the remediation of the site, particularly in relation to the removal of asbestos from soil. </para><para>The Committee comprehensively questioned Defence and the State-government accredited site auditor on:</para></quote><para>	the level to which the site will be remediated;</para><para>	the development of the remediation methodology;</para><para>	the deployment of leading edge remediation techniques;</para><para>	the advantage or otherwise of staged versus whole-of-site remediation;</para><para>	the relative merits of on-site and off-site remediation; and </para><para>	the actual execution of the remediation works.</para><quote><para>Having reviewed the evidence presented, the Committee was satisfied that the site could be remediated to a level fit for residential purposes using the proposed methodology. However, members were concerned to learn of the existence of a `regulatory gap' between the role of the site auditor, who signs off on the completed works, and the role of the local Council and state Environment Protection Authority, who control what works will be undertaken at the site.</para><para>In order to ensure appropriate monitoring of remediation works as they proceed, the Committee recommended that an appropriate regulatory body be given responsibility for monitoring the execution of contamination remediation works to ensure that proper health, safety and environmental controls are exercised.</para><para>The Committee will seek to ensure that this recommendation be placed on the agenda for the next meeting of State and Federal environment ministers.</para><para>It is usual for reports of the Public Works Committee to conclude with a recommendation that the works under investigation proceed at the estimated cost. On this occasion, the Committee takes the view that such a recommendation would be redundant as the `interim' works described by Defence have already commenced. The Committee does, however, recommend that the remaining portion of the Randwick Barracks Site Remediation and Infrastructure works be subject to a thorough investigation by the Committee at the earliest opportunity and prior to the commencement of any further work elements. </para><para>Mr President, I wish to thank the many people that assisted the Committee during the course of its inspection and public hearing at Randwick, my fellow Committee members and the secretariat staff.</para><para>I commend the Report to the Senate.</para></quote><para>—————</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">PROPOSED FIT-OUT OF NEW LEASED PREMISES FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND AGEING AT SCARBOROUGH HOUSE, WODEN TOWN CENTRE, ACT</inline></para><para>Mr President, on behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works I present the Committee's second report of 2004 titled: <inline font-style="italic">Proposed Fit-out of New Leased Premises for the Department of Health and Ageing at Scarborough House, Woden Town Centre, ACT.</inline></para><para>The report examines the proposed fit-out of Health's new leased premises currently under construction at Atlantic Street, Woden Town Centre. The estimated cost of the proposed fit-out works is $18.5 million.</para><para>The Department of Health and Ageing has been situated in the Woden Town Centre area since the development of the town concept in the early planning of Canberra. </para><para>Over time, the Department has expanded to occupy some 46, 000 square metres of leasehold accommodation in Canberra, with 12 of its 15 leased premises being located in Woden. </para><para>The need for the proposed work is driven by Health's objective of consolidating its Canberra activities into two buildings in Woden, one of which will be Scarborough House. </para><para>Health anticipates that the rationalisation of its accommodation at Scarborough House will result in a number of organisational benefits including, cost and operational efficiencies derived from the collocation of fragmented leases and the provision of a modern working environment for employees.</para><para>Work elements for the Scarborough House proposal comprise:</para><para>	integration of electrical, mechanical, security, communications, fire and hydraulic services into base-building works; and</para><para>	general office fit-out to meet Health's requirements, including security and reception facilities, office areas, meeting rooms, utilities, stores, tearooms, first-aid room, and conference and training facilities.</para><para>At the public hearing, the Committee questioned Health on issues related to project costs, building amenities and consultation.</para><para>When asked to expand on the cost efficiencies to be realised from collocation, Health stated that savings would be generated in a number of areas including security arrangements, energy, repair and maintenance costs, venue hire, and courier and freight charges.</para><para>The Committee expressed concern at what appeared to be unusually high relocation costs. The Department explained that the relocation costs provided for a number of moves, which were required to create greater cohesion through the realignment of business entities.</para><para>The Committee noted Health's tight project timeline and queried the potential for cost escalation and the provision of appropriate contingency arrangements. Health replied that while it was confident deadlines would be met, the building owners would be responsible for any costs incurred in the event of a delay.</para><para>With respect to all cost matters, the Committee requested that Health supply it with a cost savings analysis, a detailed breakdown of relocation costs and a project timeline. The Department subsequently provided that information.</para><para>The Committee asked why Health had decided against the provision of child-care facilities on-site. Health explained that employees were not moving outside the Woden area, where adequate facilities already exist. Furthermore, the building has insufficient external space to provide a suitable play area.</para><para>Noting the open-plan layout of the office accommodation, the Committee raised concerns about employees' personal workspace environment. Health assured the Committee that individual workspace allocations would be within acceptable departmental ranges and that the issue of sound intrusion had been addressed. </para><para>The Committee was also interested to learn more about Health's staff consultation process. Health described its Communication Strategy which included staff information sessions and a consultative forum comprised of employees from each work area, and union and occupational health and safety representatives. Health developed a process to encourage staff feedback and suggestions from staff, and intended to incorporate these into the architect's brief.</para><para>Although Health's written evidence described a range of proposed energy conservation measures, it did not indicate that Health had consulted with the Australian Greenhouse Office to ensure compliance with the Commonwealth Energy Policy. </para><para>When questioned by the Committee, Health confirmed that it had liaised with the Greenhouse Office on achieving energy savings targets.</para><para>Having considered the evidence for the work, the Committee recommends that the proposed fit-out for the Department of Health and Ageing at Scarborough House, Woden Town Centre, ACT proceed at the estimated cost of $18.5 million.</para><para>Mr President, I wish to thank those who assisted with the inspection and public hearing, my Committee colleagues, and secretariat staff.</para><para>I commend the Report to the Senate.</para><para>Question agreed to. </para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade    Committee: Joint</title><page.no>23536</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>23536</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>23536</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator FERGUSON</name><name.id>EP5</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I present the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade entitled <inline font-style="italic">Near Neighbours</inline><inline font-style="italic">—</inline><inline font-style="italic">Good Neighbours: An inquiry into Australia's relationship with Indonesia, </inline>together with the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of proceedings and submissions received by the committee.

Although there have been periods of strain, it has been for the most part a positive relationship of considerable value to both countries and with the potential to be significantly more so. It is in the interests of both nations for the relationship to be strong in all its dimensions—strategic, political, economic and cultural.</para><para>Within weeks of the commencement of this inquiry, the Bali bombings would bring home to us all how closely the interests of both countries lie.</para><para>A number of submissions describe the high degree of cooperation that took place immediately after the bombings in dealing with the disaster, and the ongoing cooperation since. The Bali bombings have had an impact on many aspects of our engagement. They have also affected the relationship at it deepest level. Of the 202 lives lost, 89 were Australians and 38 were Indonesian.1 This shared loss has brought together our two histories in a powerful way and no account of measures taken by either government can adequately portray the nature of this impact.</para><para>While the Bali bombings have formed a backdrop to much of this inquiry, we have kept a broad focus that appropriately reflects our wide ranging engagement. </para><para>The breadth of this engagement was made very clear in the number of submissions from government departments and agencies. These submissions described in detail a wide range of activities in an extraordinarily diverse range of areas. Our recommendations in this area build on the excellent work that is already being done.</para><para>Mr President, the Committee was extremely impressed by Australia's relationship with Indonesia at the bureaucratic level. We consider, however, that the relationship needs considerable strengthening at both the political and at the people-to-people levels. At both levels there is a pressing need for much better communication and much deeper understanding. </para><para>The Committee considers that parliamentarians have a role to play in strengthening the relationship at the political level.</para><para>Towards the end of this inquiry, members of the Committee spent some days in Jakarta meeting with political leaders, senior officials and a wide range of other government and non-government organisations. The discussions were substantial, informative and robust. There were many highlights in the visit including, of course, a meeting with HE President Megawati Soekarnoputri. </para><para>The Committee also valued the opportunity to establish a connection with our counterpart committee, Commission 1. We consider that regular meetings would provide the opportunity to develop this relationship and achieve over time, communication that is characterised by open dialogue and mutual respect.</para><para>The Committee has recommended that the Minister for Foreign Affairs establish a program of exchange visits between the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committees of the Australian Parliament and the equivalent committees of the Indonesian Parliament. Incorporated in the program should be a formal, structured one day conference with agenda items prepared by both sides covering all aspects of the relationship that may be of concern.</para><para>Mr President, at the heart of Australia's relationship with Indonesia is the relationship between the people of Indonesia and the people of Australia. </para><para>Australia and Indonesia have vastly different backgrounds and cultures. Such differences promise potential for rich exchanges. They can also lead to poor communication, misunderstanding and mistrust. Better mutual understanding is in the interest of both countries.</para><para>One of the principal means of enhancing understanding is through education. We consider that maintaining Australia's expertise on Indonesia and expanding the level of understanding about Indonesia through research and education is crucial if we are to continue building this relationship over the long term. Australia's commitment to this should be demonstrated by:</para></quote><para>	continuing support for Indonesian studies in universities and expanding research opportunities;</para><para>	restoring NALSAS or establishing a program with similar aims, and</para><para>	increasing opportunities for Australian students to study in Indonesia. </para><quote><para>Education is not only a key strategy for building understanding—it is also a key element of Australia's development cooperation program. Improving education in Indonesia is a means of pursuing regional prosperity and stability and it is in Australia's national interest to ensure that education retains its central role in our development assistance work.</para><para>Education is also significant in terms of trade. Approximately 18,000 Indonesian students come to Australia each year. There is potential for further growth in this area and it is important that Australia's high standards in education are maintained and that links with students after their return to Indonesia are nurtured.</para><para>Australia and Indonesia have a strong interest in a healthy trade and investment relationship. Indonesia is already an important trading partner and has the potential to be significantly more so. We have recommended that a scoping study be undertaken on the implications of a free trade agreement on both economies.</para><para>Mr President, Australia and Indonesia are near neighbours. Being good neighbours is an art requiring a delicate balancing of distance and closeness, a distance that is respectful of difference and sovereignty—a closeness that guarantees a helping hand in times of need. In conducting this inquiry and writing this report, the Committee has endeavoured to contribute to the building of a positive, healthy and productive relationship between good neighbours.</para></quote><para>1	<inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline>, 22/2/03, p 4 `Revised Bali death toll counts 89 Australian victims'</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>23538</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the motion to take note of the report. In its report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Near Neighbours—Good Neighbours: An inquiry into Australia's relationship with Indonesia</inline> the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade noted its concerns over the level of misunderstanding and `even mistrust that is present in the bilateral relationship'. The committee agreed that the bilateral relationship needs `considerable strengthening at both the political and the people-to-people levels and that at both levels there is a pressing need for much better communications and much deeper understanding'. The 1993 report into the bilateral relationship concluded much the same. It also proposed that further encouragement should be given to Australians and Indonesians from all walks of life to improve their understanding of each other's aspirations. Little, it seems, has changed. </para></talk.start><para>Recent history attests to government to government problems of communications and the lack of `a much deeper understanding'. I was fortunate to be a member of the committee's delegation that visited Indonesia in February 2004. Delegation members were warmly received, and the openness of our discussions and the insights given assisted the committee's deliberations. The one issue that constantly emerged during the visit was reaction to Senator Hill's announcement in December 2003 that the Howard government will participate in the United States missile defence program and that Australian warships could carry missiles with the capacity to intercept attack missiles in outer space as part of this program. This issue and the delegation's response are referred to on pages 13 and 14 of the report.</para><para>Clearly, the government's handling of this matter was very poor. Communications and follow-up clarifications added to the confusion not just for Australians but also very much for Indonesia and Indonesians. Confusion reigned unnecessarily on several accounts. Press reports indicated that the Australian foreign minister had been pressed for a response in December 2003. Throughout January 2004, media coverage detailed official Indonesian concerns from the Indonesian Parliamentary Commission for Security, Defence and Foreign Affairs and directly from the Indonesian government via spokespersons from the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Security Minister Bambang Yudhoyono eventually requested a written clarification of the proposal. Why wasn't action taken to allay suspicions much earlier?</para><para>It is not customary for Indonesian officials to use the public arena to register alarm or concern. That the media was used indicates the failure of Australian diplomacy. Obviously private discussions, if they were held, were unhelpful. The Indonesians that the delegation met—very senior parliamentarians and leaders in Indonesian communities—saw our participation in the missile shield system as an aggressive and hostile measure. They did not see it at all as an Australian defensive response to the threat of ballistic missiles; they saw it as a measure aimed at Indonesia, designed to increase our capabilities and increase the military threat. That was their perspective on our decision to participate in the missile defence system.</para><para>Whatever their perceptions, it is clear that diplomacy did not work in allaying Indonesian concerns. Ambiguity reigned majestically through contradictory statements. The Australian contribution remained undefined. The Treasurer eventually ruled out spending on the ballistic missile system. The much heralded memorandum of understanding with the United States still has not seen the light of day. During the visit I took every opportunity to explain in detail Labor's position on missile defence. I confirmed that Labor opposed the Howard government's decision to commit to Australian participation in the program, because Labor saw neither threat nor priority for Australia to develop a national missile shield defence system. However, Labor does support the development of a capability for in-theatre missile defence of ADF personnel and key strategic interests. A Labor government would be strongly committed to ensure that all efforts are made to protect ADF personnel deployed in operations. </para><para>Labor also strongly supports a continued intelligence relationship with the United States through the joint facilities at Pine Gap, which presently provide missile launch information. As a unilateral response, the problem of ballistic missile proliferation and national missile defence is disproportionate to the present threat. It is technically questionable and costly and is likely to be counterproductive, particularly for the security environment of the Asia-Pacific region. This view is clearly shared by our neighbours. Indonesia in particular is very wary of the Australia government's decision to participate in the US missile defence program and sees it as a military capability aimed at Indonesia. The key point is that differences of opinion will emerge between Australia and Indonesia, but the relationship should be sufficiently robust to withstand difference. That can be accomplished through sound diplomacy and communication in our bilateral relations. Clearly that has not occurred with respect to the missile defence shield proposition. The Howard government has not done what it should have done to ensure that Indonesian concerns were being addressed.</para><para>In today's short tabling remarks I would like to highlight a presentation that was made to the committee at the ministry of foreign affairs. In an official meeting with the delegation, the Indonesians discussed what they saw as the emerging anti-Australian sentiment among young Indonesians. Members of the delegation were quite shocked by the presentation, which told a story of young people applying for entrance to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Indonesia—they sit an entrance exam to join the foreign affairs civil service. They reported that, in that examination, the views expressed by candidates were overwhelmingly anti-Australian. The candidates saw Australia as increasingly linked to US foreign policy and as having the same foreign policy as that of the US government. They saw our participation in Iraq, the pretension of being the deputy sheriff of the region and our involvement in the missile defence program as indicative of an Australian foreign policy that they found threatening, anti-Muslim and anti-Indonesian. Like me, the delegation was shocked that, effectively, the Indonesian foreign affairs department was sending us a message about the emergence of a strong anti-Australian sentiment among its educated young people. I am sure they provided that briefing to the committee purposely, and they detailed the predominant views of those young students. That is a reflection of some of the difficulties in the relationship, the emerging view in Indonesia of Australian foreign policy and some of the challenges we face in overcoming those perceptions. Some of those views, in particular those on the missile defence program, are not soundly based on facts; nevertheless they are emerging as serious issues for the relationship between Indonesians and Australians.</para><para>The committee's report acknowledges the importance of better communications and deeper understanding of each other's politics, customs, history and culture. Australia and Indonesia are neighbours in one of the world's most dynamic regions. Our relationship is vital to Australia's engagement with and credibility in the Asia-Pacific region. A lot has happened between our two nations, and this important report details the challenges that both nations face in maintaining a sound and constructive relationship into the future. </para><para>In closing, I pay tribute to the chairman, Mr Jull, the deputy chairman, Mr Price, the other colleagues who went to Indonesia with me—Kim Beazley and Senator Natasha Stott Despoja—and the committee secretary, Janet Holmes. They were all very good company in what was a very hectic schedule. I think the committee worked well on that visit and we all learnt a great deal. I would also like to pay tribute to the embassy staff and others who assisted us, particularly the defence attache, Brigadier Ken Brownrigg, who was very helpful to those of us with a particular interest in defence matters. I certainly think that Kim Beazley's explanation to the TNI generals of Australia's view on Timor was the highlight of the trip and a highlight for all those who were there. I do not think the TNI generals had ever had such a frank explanation of the Australian view of our involvement in East Timor and I am sure it did them the world of good. This is an important report. I thank the committee secretariat and the other members for their work on it. Hopefully, it will help build a better relationship with our Indonesian neighbours.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>23540</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I too wish to add to the comments that have been made regarding the inquiry and the delegation of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. It was an incredibly significant inquiry. This inquiry has covered nearly every aspect of Australia's relationship with Indonesia. There is no doubt that our country's relationship with Indonesia is one of our most important. Not only is Indonesia one of our nearest neighbours; it is the world's fourth most populous nation and, of course, the largest Muslim nation. It is a country which is still working on developing the level of democracy which we already enjoy in Australia, and there are a number of examples of instability within its borders which could potentially have security implications for Australia.</para></talk.start><para>The evidence presented to this inquiry was comprehensive, in-depth and fascinating. As chapter 1 of the report states, Australia's relationship with Indonesia is a `rich and complex tapestry' and a `multifaceted, multilevel bilateral relationship'. The committee heard evidence about the activities of a whole range of agencies, organisations and corporations—from the Australian National Maritime Museum to the Australian Sports Commission; from the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance to the Australia-Indonesia Young Leaders' Dialogue; and from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the Australia West Papua Association. It is therefore not surprising that the committee has come up with a comprehensive report. I also take this opportunity to commend the secretariat for their outstanding hard work and professionalism during the conduct of this inquiry and the preparation of the report.</para><para>I would like to comment on a number of aspects of this report in the time available. The first is in relation to Australia's aid to Indonesia. The report includes reference to the four key priorities which have been adopted to provide a focus for Australia's aid program to Indonesia. It notes that AusAID endeavours to maintain flexibility in the aid program and that that has enabled it to respond to issues such as anti-money-laundering and antiterrorism legislation. On behalf of the Democrats, though, I would like to make clear our opposition to the use of the aid budget to finance such initiatives. While antiterrorism initiatives are incredibly important, the Democrats believe that such initiatives should be funded out of other areas of the budget rather than out of the already stretched aid budget. The aid budget must be used for poverty reduction initiatives as well as for democracy and governance strengthening programs. In relation to debt relief, the committee noted that at the end of 2003 Indonesia's public debt was around 66.9 per cent of its GDP and that its debt to Australia stood at $1,347.7 million. As AusAID's evidence to the inquiry demonstrates clearly, these massive debts are taking their toll on basic services and development within Indonesia. The Democrats share the view expressed by a number of organisations that Australia should negotiate a debt for poverty reduction swap with Indonesia, and we are pleased that the committee has indicated an interest in this idea. </para><para>On the issue of re-establishing links between the Australian Defence Force and Kopassus, I would like to record very strong opposition on behalf of the Democrats. In our view, there should be absolutely no resumption of ties with Kopassus until there is objective evidence that Kopassus is committed to protecting human rights and has brought all perpetrators of human rights violations to justice. We note that the United States has indicated that it will not resume any ties with Kopassus until it has determined whether or not Kopassus was responsible for the murder of three schoolteachers, two of whom were US citizens, near the Freeport mine in August 2002. In addition to allegations of human rights abuses against Kopassus, the Democrats note evidence provided by the International Crisis Group which suggested that terrorist organisation Laskar Jihad is operating in Indonesia as a result of tolerance on the part of senior military officers. The Australian government has proffered the view that a key aim of the defence relationship with Indonesia is to encourage `a stable long-term future for Indonesia'. However, the Democrats believe that any resumption of cooperation with a military unit renowned for its disregard of human rights and with possible ties to terrorism will be detrimental to the long-term stability of Indonesia and is therefore inconsistent with a key aim of our defence relationship.</para><para>In arguing for limited cooperation with Kopassus, the Australian government has expressed the view that Kopassus is the most capable counterterrorist force in Indonesia. The Democrats see two primary flaws in this argument. Firstly, any so-called counterterrorist capability is undermined by evidence of possible links between Kopassus and terrorist organisations. It does not matter how capable Kopassus is if it is allowing terrorist organisations to continue to operate. Secondly, the government gives examples of circumstances in which it would work with Kopassus, namely hijack and hostage situations. In the context of such high-pressure emergencies, it would be impossible for the government to adhere to its policy of not working with Kopassus officers who have been involved in human rights violations. It simply would not have the time to make the assessments. For these reasons the Democrats are of the view that the resumption of ties between the Australian Defence Force and Kopassus is fraught with danger and is contrary to the interests of both our country and, indeed, Indonesia.</para><para>The committee heard a great deal of evidence regarding the ongoing tensions within the regions of West Papua and Aceh. I do not propose to enter into a debate regarding independence, partly because I think there are more pressing issues to be addressed—such as the ongoing human rights violations—but also because the Democrats do not necessarily advocate independence as the ultimate solution to ongoing tensions within each of those regions.</para><para>However, we do believe there are a number of unresolved issues from the past which need to be revisited if there is to be any hope of long-term peace and security within these provinces. For example, the Democrats have long expressed concerns in relation to the so-called Act of Free Choice held in West Papua in 1969. The West Papuan people have consistently challenged the legitimacy of that process over the past 25 years. In fact, it is often referred to as the `Act of No Choice'. Some of the individuals involved in that Act of Free Choice have since revealed that they were subjected to threats—for example, that their tongues would be cut out if they voted for independence. </para><para>I have put many of these issues on record before, so I will not reiterate them now. But, given some of the circumstances surrounding the Act of Free Choice, it cannot be said that the West Papuan people have ever been given a genuine opportunity to determine their own future. As such, they have been prevented from exercising their basic democratic rights under international law. This must be acknowledged by our country and by Indonesia and there must be a genuine attempt, insofar as it is possible, to redress the wrongs of the past.</para><para>The other issue to which I want to refer is the exclusion of media and non-government organisations from conflict areas. There is widespread evidence that the Indonesian government has prevented humanitarian, human rights and other non-government organisations—as well as the independent media—from accessing conflict areas such as Aceh. As the recent expulsion of the two International Crisis Group researchers Sidney Jones and Francesca Lawe-Davies from Indonesia demonstrates, this level of censorship is not necessarily restricted to areas of conflict.</para><para>The ICG is an immensely well-respected organisation, headed up by our former foreign affairs minister Gareth Evans. Prior to flying out of Indonesia on 6 June, Ms Jones had been living there on and off for around 30 years. She is an internationally renowned expert on terrorism, and is considered one of the foremost experts in the world on Jemaah Islamiah. I have met with Ms Jones. I think she is remarkably impressive and extremely knowledgeable. This action on the part of the Indonesian government provided to all of us a stark reminder of how far some countries—and, in particular, Indonesia at this moment—have to go on the path towards a robust democracy. Freedom of speech, freedom of movement and freedom of the media are all vital in ensuring the accountability of governments. The exclusion of some groups from certain parts of Indonesia unfortunately gives rise to the perception that the Indonesian government may have something to hide, whether or not that is actually the case.</para><para>We know the Indonesian media have a vital role to play. We met with wonderful representatives of that media on our delegation. This was the focus of a report prepared by Mr Adam Rollason, a parliamentary intern who worked with me in my office last year. His report, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Backing democracy: an analysis of the rights and the role of the media in Indonesia</inline>, provides a comprehensive consideration of the role that the Indonesian media play in promoting democracy. I seek leave to table that report. I have received permission to do so from the whips of the parties on the condition that I make it explicit that the report in no way reflects the views of the Australian government. I think all of us who have had the opportunity to have interns work with us recognise their role.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Senator Stott Despoja, your time is about to expire.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name></talker><para>—In conclusion, I commend not only the members of the delegation but also the secretariat, once again. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>23543</page.no><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator EGGLESTON</name><name.id>4L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Indonesia and Australia are two countries which are entwined together geographically but vastly different in terms of their culture and history. Indonesia is an archipelago of some 17,000 islands and has a population of 200-odd million people, most of whom are Muslim. Australia is an outpost of European civilisation with a relatively recent history of just over 200 years. Although Australia supported the independence of Indonesia from the Dutch in their war of independence in the 1940s, there is still a great gulf between our two countries—and it is a gulf which needs to bridged because, as I said at the beginning, we are geographically close to each other and it is very important that we understand each other.</para></talk.start><para>I lived for some 22 years in Port Hedland, on the north-west coast of Western Australia. Port Hedland is closer to the Indonesian archipelago than it is to Perth. There was quite a lot of interaction between the north-west of Western Australia and Indonesia because there were direct flights to Denpasar and some 10 per cent of the population of Port Hedland were Malay Indonesian people who moved backwards and forwards between the two countries. There is probably a much better understanding of the closeness of Indonesia in the north-west of Australia than there is throughout the rest of Australia. In fact off the north-west coast there are only about 80 kilometres between the Indonesian islands and Ashmore Reef—that is where Indonesian territory is closest to Australian territory—so Indonesia is very close indeed. Yet, as I said, even though our countries are close, there is less understanding than there ought to be.</para><para>I think this report is very important because it makes a number of recommendations to bring people together, and I think that by bringing people together bridges of understanding are built. I would like to refer fairly briefly to some of the recommendations in this report which I think are in that spirit of bringing people together and so will facilitate the improvement of understanding between our two countries.</para><para>Recommendation 1 has a proposal for an increased number of parliamentary exchange visits between Australia and Indonesia. I think that is very important. When I was last in the Indonesian national assembly, about 18 months ago, I was struck by the fact that many of the Indonesian politicians admitted frankly that they were deeply suspicious of Australia in relation to Indonesia's territorial integrity. As Senator Evans has said, they also harbour doubts about our intent in terms of our defence relationship with the United States. I think it would be helpful if we had more visits by parliamentarians between the two countries, particularly by Indonesians coming to Australia. Then they would understand that in this country we really do have a free press and we do have non-government organisations who are able to express their views without reference to the government.</para><para>I think it would help them to understand that the comments made about Indonesia and events in Indonesia by our media and by non-government organisations do not necessarily in any way represent the views of the Australian government. In particular NGOs, in the cases of Aceh and West Papua, have perhaps led local people to believe that there would be support for movements of independence from Indonesia, but that is not the position of the Australian government. The Australian government does respect the territorial integrity of Indonesia. I think parliamentary exchange visits both by Australians to Indonesia and, in particular, by Indonesians to Australia would do a lot to help each understand the real politics of the other's country and bring about a much better comprehension of the positions we come from. </para><para>Recommendations 3, 4 and 5 in the report support the strengthening of the relationship between Australian states and local governments and Indonesia. As the report notes, both Western Australia and the Northern Territory do have fairly close relationships with Indonesia and they have a good understanding of Indonesia. Western Australia had a sister state relationship with the province of East Java which was particularly useful. I think those sorts of relationships between states and cities are very important and build bridges of understanding. But most importantly I would like to refer the Senate to recommendations 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15, which support increased Australian education services being provided to Indonesia and an increased number of scholarships being offered to Indonesians to study in Australia.</para><para>Education has been a very important focus of Australia's relationship with Indonesia for many years, in fact since the 1950s and the Colombo Plan, when a great number of people from South-East Asia and from Indonesia came to Australia and obtained degrees here. In fact, there are literally thousands of graduates in Indonesia holding quite senior positions in industry and government who hold Australian degrees. At one stage there were reputed to be four members of the Indonesian cabinet who held Australian degrees and, of course, the fact that they have studied in Australia and understand Australia and Australian culture must mean that there is a better comprehension of the positions of the Australian government on various issues. As Senator Stott Despoja has mentioned, many Indonesians are very poor and it is impossible for many of these people to even consider coming to Australia to study at universities. So offering more scholarships to Indonesians to come to Australia is an important matter which the Australian government could give consideration to—increasing the number of scholarships we offer to young Indonesians to come and study in our universities.</para><para>Recommendations 18, 19 and 20 support the teaching of Indonesian studies and languages in Australian schools, and recommendation 17 supports increased funding for the Australia-Indonesia Institute. In the Northern Territory, all schoolchildren learn bahasa Indonesia from a very early age—or they did in the past, or at least it was an option that was available. It was certainly an option in Western Australia and it still is at secondary school level, along with other Asian languages. The programs to teach Indonesian languages in Australian schools are very important because there is a huge difference between people who go to another country and cannot converse with the local people and people who are capable of conversing with the local people in the understanding they gain of the other society and of the culture of that society. So I very strongly support these recommendations which seek increased funding for programs of Indonesian studies, culture and languages in our schools. I think it is very important in itself and I think that is a very important and worthwhile recommendation, as is the recommendation for increased funding of the Australia-Indonesia Institute. I think we do need to devote more attention to research into the differences between our societies and cultures, our points of contact and the dissemination of information about each other's countries in the other country. I think that is very important in terms of fostering better relations between Australia and Indonesia.</para><para>Indonesia has now adopted a democratic process for the election of its national assembly. Those elections were held earlier this year and the president will be elected for the first time by direct popular vote later this year. It is an important stage in the political evolution of Indonesia, as we see the progressive development of a civil society and the relaxation of restrictions on the press. As I said, the destinies of Australia and Indonesia are intertwined by our geography, and it is very important that we develop a better understanding of each other. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PETITIONS</title><type>Petitions</type><page.no>23545</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Education: Funding</title><page.no>23545</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>23545</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I seek leave to table nearly 150 statements from public school teachers about how they could spend the amount of money that is being given to equivalent private schools.</para></talk.start><para>Petition received.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title><type>Ministerial Statements</type><page.no>23545</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>United Nations: Human Rights           Committee</title><page.no>23545</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>23545</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek leave to incorporate a statement on behalf of the Attorney-General in relation to an order of the Senate made on 1 April 2004 regarding a government response to the United Nations Human Rights Committee views in Young vs Australia.

It deals with a proposed whistleblower protection scheme, executive remuneration, infringement notices, continuous disclosure provisions, conflicts of interest, shareholder participation and related matters. These aspects of the bill place a heavy reliance on disclosure and on the active involvement of shareholders—and, in the case of the whistleblowing scheme, on persons working in or for companies—to promote good corporate governance. The committee believes that these measures are a vital step towards enhancing trust and confidence in Australian corporations. Clearly, while participants in the inquiry offered general and wide support for CLERP 9, many held reservations about particular features of the proposed legislation. The committee has made recommendations to address some of these concerns but, as with the majority of witnesses, welcomes the reforms.</para><para>Today I have tabled part 2 of the committee's report on this legislation. Except for submissions and additional information received after 4 June 2004, which are tabled with part 2 today, submissions, additional information and the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> transcripts of the committee's hearings were tabled with part 1. As I will be speaking to both parts 1 and 2 of the committee's report in more detail on Thursday, my comments today will be brief.</para><para>Part 2 of this report deals with the financial reporting and audit reform proposals in the bill. I am pleased to say that, in common with many submissions to the committee's inquiry, the committee believes that there is much to commend in this bill. The chief executive officer and chief financial officer sign-off and operating and financial review will make financial reports more reliable and serviceable for users. The bill's measures to strengthen auditor independence will restore public confidence in the assurance role played by auditors in relation to financial reports. The introduction of the financial reporting panel will provide for the more speedy resolution of disputes between the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and companies about their financial statements. This will ensure more timely dissemination of information to the market and to the correction of misinformation. </para><para>Although the positives are many, the committee has made 34 recommendations altogether. Some of them merely clarify provisions in the bill or cater for practical contingencies. The remaining recommendations are more substantive in nature and add new provisions to the bill or amend existing ones. These include the introduction of a requirement for alternative accounting positions to be discussed in financial reports; the introduction of additional `true and fair view' requirements; limitation of the auditor rotation requirements to the top 300 listed entities by market capitalisation; deletion of the prohibition against former auditors taking up a management position with a client if a former auditor from the same firm already occupies such a position; clarification of the role of the Financial Reporting Council; postponement of the conversion of auditing standards into disallowable instruments until the implications are thoroughly reviewed and any problems resolved; and, finally, introduction of a range of requirements to restore confidence in the Financial Reporting Council and strengthen the standard-setting arrangements in part 12 of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act. The committee urges the government to adopt these recommendations.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>23547</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I draw the attention of those interested in part 2 of this report on the CLERP 9 legislation to my supplementary remarks. Those remarks go to the heart of a problem—that is, that in my opinion neither CLERP 9 nor the report deals with the issue of ensuring full independence for external auditors. I know that the secretariat, the chair and the deputy chair have worked exceptionally hard to produce these reports, and I think that they have done an exceptional job. Nevertheless, they have had to deal with the matter pretty well on its face and not address the philosophy, which I think needs to be re-evaluated by the government and all parties, as to how corporate governance, matters of independence, matters concerning directors and boards and other essential governance issues should be viewed.

I do not think anyone in this place or indeed in all the Australian parliamentary system could begin to imagine the scale of an Indonesian election. The parliamentary elections that we were fortunate enough to observe had four parts to them. There were four ballots taking place on the one day. There were some 147 million voters eligible to vote on that one day spread over some 6,000 islands. There were over 585,000 polling places. That meant that, because there were four elections, over 660 million ballot papers had to be prepared, produced and distributed for that one day of democracy, with over 15,000 candidates facing election on a single day. Indeed, I do not think it would be taking it too far to say that it was probably the largest single democratic event in the world. </para><para>Our delegation comprised four parliamentarians, 16 Australian officials and, of course, a delegation secretary. The fact that there were four parliamentarians as part of our delegation was seen as a strength in that the Australian parliament and the Australian political system was as committed as the Indonesian political system to ensuring a smooth democratic process. In addition to the Australian observation team, there were strong teams from the US, Japan and the EU. Indeed the EU delegation was the only other one led by a member of parliament—a member of the European parliament. I think it would be fair to say that none of us could recall observing any significant violations of electoral laws by any of the political parties concerned throughout the delegation's time in Indonesia. From memory, there were some 24 political parties. From my own personal observations, during the period of the campaign that I was there for, it was peaceful and relatively subdued, albeit a lot more colourful and with a lot more vitality than your standard Australian election.</para><para>Apart from making some central observations in Jakarta, I was deployed with two other Australian officials to the area of West Timor. My overwhelming observation in observing quite a number of polling places in West Timor was the incredible pride with which the local population took part in the election. I could only wish that Australians were as determined and eager to vote and as proud of being allowed to vote in our elections as the Indonesian population in West Timor was. Again, it was a very peaceful and relatively subdued day. Some would find that surprising given that there are still some camps with some displaced people from East Timor within the area we were in in West Timor.</para><para>To allow for some of the incredible logistical challenges that electoral commissions face when organising such a large election, a couple of days before the scheduled election day the government had passed some emergency laws to allow for the delay in the conduct of the election in some places throughout the archipelago. Election day, as I was saying, was peaceful. It was calm, friendly and incredibly festive. It was a community based event. Local communities were responsible for establishing polling places, which were largely outdoors. The entirety of those small communities took a great deal of pride in the presentation of their polling places. You could almost sense some form of competition between the neighbouring polling places. My overwhelming observation would be that there was a great deal of strength in local community commitment to the democratic process. As I say, it was one that they were fiercely proud of and determined to take part in no matter what level or lack of education or disability some of the older citizens encountered.</para><para>With regard to the organisation of the election, apart from some of the last-minute logistical problems in some more remote parts of the archipelago there was only one thing that the electoral commission underestimated—that is, the actual amount of time it would take to calculate the results of the election. We were promised at the time that because the electoral commission had entered the modern age and had computers just like everybody else we would all know the result very quickly. Indeed, it all came down to the man sitting in front of the screen, we were told, to determine the result. As with all things to do with the technological age, the Indonesian electoral commission underestimated the challenges that technology can pose and the challenges that the man sitting in front of the screen can be confronted with, so it did take quite some time for the population to be made aware of the result. </para><para>In concluding, I would like to pass on some congratulations. I would like to congratulate all of the independent monitors who were there, who went a long way to ensuring that it was a peaceful, open and democratic process. I would like to congratulate the staff of the Australian Electoral Commission who had been placed in Indonesia for some time, who played a valuable role in training electoral staff in preparation for the day and who were out in the field monitoring on the day to ensure that their training was being adhered to. I would also like to congratulate all the Australian officials who took part in the observations and the delegation and pay tribute to their professionalism, competence, talent and commitment. In fact, it is a testament to them as official representatives of Australia both from departments based here in Canberra and from the embassy that, despite the challenges mentioned earlier today, we still have a fairly strong and open relationship with Indonesia.</para><para>As I say, Indonesia has a thriving democracy. It is a relatively young democracy but, as Senator Stott Despoja was saying earlier, part of the challenge of maintaining that thriving and relatively young democracy is ensuring the freedom of the press and ensuring that we maintain outside observation from important observers like Sidney Jones. In finishing, I would like to place on record my thanks to the Australian embassy staff who assisted in a very competent and professional way with our visit; to the officers from the Australian Federal Police, who were also incredibly tolerant of people like me and competent in the way they discharged their duties; to the delegation secretary, Bev Forbes, who was an incredibly calm, confident and professional delegation secretary; and to my parliamentary colleagues.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>23549</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will speak briefly to the motion moved by Senator Webber on the parliamentary delegation to Indonesia. I think that she has provided an excellent summation of the observer mission and, indeed, I commend to the chamber the report that has been prepared on behalf of the chair of the delegation, Ms Margaret May. I would also like to put on record my thanks and congratulations to the members of the teams—to the Australian electoral and embassy officials. I would like to compliment our chair, the team leader, and to acknowledge that, for some period of the delegation, Senator Webber was the acting chair and I would like to thank her. I would also like to thank Minister Downer for the opportunity for parliamentarians to be a part of an observer mission. As Senator Webber stated in her remarks, it was a distinctive feature of the Australian observer team and I think it is an important one.</para></talk.start><para>The contribution by the Australian government of up to $15 million to the Indonesian elections is an important part not of relationship building but of relationship strengthening between Australia and Indonesia. While this is my second opportunity today to record my ongoing fascination with and interest in the country of Indonesia, I will constrain my remarks. I would like to emphasise, as has Senator Webber and indeed the report, what an extraordinary logistical exercise this was. Senator Webber was right in describing it as the single largest election on any day in the history of the world as we know it. Some people may say, `Aha, but what about India?' In actual fact, the distinction was not only the number of voters but also the number of elections taking place on that day. There were 24 political parties, 2,057 separate elections, 585,219 voting stations to be correctly equipped for a maximum of 300 voters at each station, 660 million ballot papers to print and distribute, 581,000 KPU members and staff to train, 3.9 million polling station staff to train, 1.1 million polling station security staff to train, 15,276 representatives to be elected and some 448,705 candidates. I love the idea of 24 political parties. It sends a message to some people who dare to complain about the number of minor parties in Australian politics. </para><para>It was an honour to be part of the delegation. It was an extraordinarily exciting opportunity and, as the report quite accurately reflects, the elections were relatively fair, free and peaceful. We were really excited to be a part of elections that perhaps had had a greater build-up than their outcome. The expectations of violence and other activities were greater than what actually happened on the day. I would like to pay special tribute to the team members with whom I worked: Nic Notarpietro from AusAID, Dr Bradley Armstrong from the Australian Embassy in Jakarta and, of course, the AFP—Sean, thank you very much for your assistance.</para><para>I would like to pay tribute to every member of the delegation. It was really exciting to be part of such an accomplished, diverse and professional team—AusAID, DFAT, Defence, ONA, AFP and, of course, the embassy. In Australia, we are incredibly well served by these people and I know earlier Senator Eggleston in his remarks on the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade report, <inline font-style="italic">Near neighbours—good neighbours: an inquiry into Australia's relationship with Indonesia</inline>, referred to the importance of language. I might add for the record that I think it was only the members of parliament who were perhaps somewhat deficient in our knowledge of Bahasa—or, in my case in Bandung, my lack of Sundanese training—whereas our officials and bureaucrats were expertly trained and got us through all manner of situations and circumstances.

We have consistently demonstrated our determination to achieve that end. In 2004-2005, we will allocate a record $2.9 billion—39% more in real terms than in the last year of the Keating Government. The bulk of this funding goes to the practical areas of health, housing, education and employment.</para><para>While there have been real improvements as a result of this effort we believe that the rate of progress is not good enough. I am sure that most indigenous Australians would say that they are not getting value for money. The Productivity Commission report `Overcoming Indigenous Disadvantage' reinforces the need for fundamental change. No one can say that the current approach is working. </para><para>Going beyond the abolition of the ATSIC Board, replacement of Regional Councils and consequential amendments in this bill, the Government will be introducing radical and necessary changes to the way in which services are delivered to indigenous Australians. </para><para>The changes will build on what we have learnt from the whole of government approach adopted in the COAG indigenous trials currently operating in each State and Territory.</para><para>Over the last 30 years governments of both political persuasions have sought to implement measures to address the long-standing disadvantages experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. These measures have included a range of programmes, legislation and representative structures. </para><para>Soon after the then Government established the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) in 1990, it became evident that no single body could seek both to represent indigenous people and to make independent decisions about the allocation of funds. The Commission found it difficult to effectively advocate on behalf of indigenous people and to provide impartial advice to government.</para><para>The ATSIC experiment failed on a number of fronts. Its focus was almost exclusively on Australian Government programmes and services. The fundamentally important role of State and Territory governments was neglected. All too often the specialist indigenous agency, ATSIC, provided an excuse for mainstream departments to avoid their responsibilities to indigenous Australians. Moreover, only a very small proportion of eligible indigenous Australians bothered to vote in ATSIC elections.</para><para>The Government took a major step to address problems in ATSIC last year with the establishment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Services (ATSIS). This separated the representative functions from decision making on funding. However, this was a transitional arrangement which did not represent a long-term solution to the issues facing ATSIC.</para><para>A review of ATSIC delivered to the Government in November 2003 acknowledged a number of significant problems. These included a lack of leadership at the national level of ATSIC, insufficient connection between the national, regional and local levels of the organisation, and a lack of engagement between ATSIC and its constituents at the local level.  </para><para>It is against this background that the Government has taken the decision to abolish ATSIC and overhaul the way in which services for indigenous Australians are delivered. </para><para>While the Labor Party says that it wants to abolish ATSIC its real goal seems to be to establish another elected national indigenous body. Government imposed bodies such as that which Labor is contemplating have failed in the past and no doubt will continue to fail in the future. Other countries with indigenous populations such as the USA and Canada do not have such government established bodies. It would be far more consistent with indigenous self-management for indigenous people to develop and establish their own representative bodies without government interference.</para><para>The aim of the new arrangements is to produce better outcomes for indigenous people. The programmes which ATSIC and ATSIS were responsible for will be allocated to mainstream government agencies. One of the advantages of mainstreaming will be to focus the specialist service delivery expertise of mainstream agencies on specific aspects of indigenous disadvantage.</para><para>It is important to point out that ATSIC was never responsible for all Australian Government indigenous specific programmes. Indeed, in 1995 the previous Government transferred responsibility for indigenous health from ATSIC to the Department of Health and Ageing because of concerns about the performance of ATSIC.</para><para>It is also important to stress that no programmes will cease as a result of the changes we are making and existing levels of funding will continue. </para><para>We acknowledge the need for better coordination and for strengthening accountability. Accordingly we will be implementing a series of new measures to enhance coordination and accountability.</para><para>A Ministerial Task Force chaired by the Minister responsible for indigenous affairs will be established to provide whole of government leadership on indigenous issues. It will coordinate the Government's indigenous policies and report to Cabinet on directions and priorities in indigenous policy. The Ministerial Task Force will report annually to the Expenditure Review Committee of Cabinet on the performance of indigenous specific programmes and the allocation of resources across agencies.</para><para>A Secretaries Group will support the Ministerial Task Force. It will report annually on the outcomes of indigenous specific services. Secretaries will be directly accountable for successes and/or failures of specific programmes and services. Performance in indigenous programmes and services will be included in their performance agreements.</para><para>We are establishing a National Indigenous Council to provide policy advice to the Government at the national level. In particular, it will directly advise the Ministerial Task force on a range of indigenous issues. The National Indigenous Council will be a non-statutory body comprised of indigenous people with expertise and experience in key policy areas.</para><para>The new arrangements will be under-pinned by regional agreements as well as shared responsibility agreements at the local level. While some Regional Councils work well, arrangements for engaging with indigenous Australians at the regional and local level need to be improved. </para><para>We will be discussing the best way forward with the States and Territories, at the next meeting of the Council of Australian Governments. ATSIC's Regional Councils will have the opportunity for input and we recognise that different models are likely to emerge in different regions and jurisdictions.</para><para>A new Office of Indigenous Policy Coordination in the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs will provide policy advice to the Minister, coordinate policy development and service delivery across government and oversee relations with State and Territory governments. It will also monitor the performance of government programmes and services including arrangements for independent scrutiny.</para><para>We will strengthen service delivery in the regions where a network of indigenous coordination centres in rural and remote areas will replace ATSIC/ATSIS offices. These centres will operate as a multi-disciplinary team offering a whole of government service to local communities.</para><para>The Government will expand the role of the Office of Evaluation and Audit, (OEA) currently located in ATSIC. This will be in addition to the role of the Australian National Audit Office and will provide a particular focus on the performance of those programmes. OEA will also continue to investigate the performance of bodies that obtain funding from indigenous specific programmes. </para><para>The legislation provides for the transfer of the Regional Land Fund to the Indigenous Land Corporation (ILC) and ATSIC's Housing Fund and Business Development Programme to Indigenous Business Australia (IBA). The bill also makes provision for the ILC to give funds to IBA to allow it to promote economic development on the land the ILC acquires for indigenous people.</para><para>The Torres Strait Regional Authority (TSRA) which provides a range of indigenous specific services to Torres Strait Islanders living in the Torres Strait will continue to perform its current role. The TSRA had some time ago separated its representative and funding functions and is working effectively in meeting the needs of Torres Strait Islanders in the Torres Strait.</para><para>The Torres Strait Islander Advisory Board which provided advice to ATSIC about issues affecting Torres Strait Islanders on the mainland will cease to exist as a result of the abolition of ATSIC. Torres Strait Islanders living on the mainland will be represented on the National Indigenous Council.</para><para>Labor has expressed concern about some of the consequential changes to other Acts contained in the bill. These concerns are based on a misunderstanding of what the bill does. Labor has said, for example, that the bill proposes that the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department will be responsible for determining funding for Native Title Representative Bodies. This part of the Native Title Act (Part 11) has never been the responsibility of the Attorney-General. It has always been administered by the Minister responsible for indigenous affairs. This will continue to be the case, and with the abolition of ATSIC the decisions on funding will be made by the Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs.</para><para>Labor also says that the bill removes the requirement for indigenous representation on the National Health and Medical Research Council. This is simply not correct. The Council will continue to include a person with a knowledge of the health needs of indigenous people, who is most likely to be an indigenous person. All the bill does is to remove the requirement that the person be nominated by ATSIC.</para><para>The bulk of reforms that we propose do not require legislation and will be introduced administratively on 1 July 2004 regardless of Labor's delaying tactics. However, there is a cost to the taxpayer of retaining the ATSIC Board while Labor goes through another needless round of consultations. The salary package for the Board alone is a significant $52,000 per week.</para><para>Labor seems unconcerned about public money being used to keep the discredited shell of ATSIC in existence for no purpose. The Government had considered that there was bi-partisan support to abolish ATSIC swiftly and decisively. Clearly we were mistaken as was the Australian public.</para><para>Labor cannot have it both ways—if it is interested in true reform and making a difference the old model cannot be kept afloat for a further period while Labor finds a way to rebadge it. That is neither courageous nor constructive.</para><para>We have heard Labor criticise the Government for not consulting enough with the very people this bill will affect. Nothing could be further from the truth. A thorough and extensive consultation process was undertaken involving two major rounds of public consultation. 8,000 copies of the ATSIC Review's Public Discussion Paper were mailed out and a specific website was established.</para><para>Furthermore, the Review panel met with a wide range of stakeholders across the nation, including each of the 35 ATSIC Regional Councils and received 156 written submissions. A number of Regional Councils chose to invite community members to participate.</para><para>In summary, the public consultations revealed widespread disillusionment and dissatisfaction on the part of indigenous Australians with ATSIC.</para><para>Indeed, it will surprise no-one if referring this bill to a Committee results in the same conclusions being reached. Replacing ATSIC with another body or several mini ATSICs as Labor seems to want will not ensure that imposed structures are removed so that indigenous people can speak for themselves. </para><para>Referring this bill to a Committee is a terrible waste of resources—the indigenous communities have spoken, and loudly. For those who wish to listen, that is.</para></quote><para>—————</para><para><inline ref="R2032">ANTI-TERRORISM BILL 2004</inline></para><quote><para>This is a Bill to strengthen Australia's counter-terrorism laws in a number of respects—a task made more urgent following the recent tragic terrorist bombings in Spain which resulted in the loss of 190 innocent lives.</para><para>The safety and security of its population and national interests is the most important responsibility of any government.</para><para>It is a responsibility this government takes very seriously.</para><para>Our response to the threat of terrorism has been comprehensive and wide ranging.</para><para>Since the devastating September 11 attacks in New York and Washington, the Government has overhauled Australia's legislative framework in relation to terrorism, to complement existing laws that already targeted terrorism.</para><para>But it is a task that is ongoing.</para><para>In the current environment, complacency is not an option.</para><para>Our counter-terrorism laws require review and, where necessary, updating if we are to have a legal framework capable of safeguarding all Australians from the scourge of terrorism.</para><para>This government has worked hard to ensure that the reach of Australia's criminal justice system extends to cover terrorists by eliminating loopholes and gaps. </para><para>We have updated the federal Criminal Code to ensure that our offence regime comprehensively responds to terrorism.</para><para>The Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2002 introduced a suite of offences into the Criminal Code targeting persons involved in terrorist acts or terrorist organisations. </para><para>It is now appropriate to improve the capability of Australia's law enforcement agencies to properly investigate these new terrorism offences.</para><para>Since 11 September 2001, the AFP have, sadly, had experience in investigating acts and allegations of international terrorism.</para><para>They cooperated closely with Indonesian authorities investigating the Bali bombings. </para><para>That experience has revealed that issues such as differences in international time zones may substantially reduce the time available during the investigation period to actually question a suspect.</para><para>The Bill responds to these issues in two concrete ways.</para><para>First, it extends the fixed investigation period under Part 1C of the Crimes Act for investigations into suspected terrorism offences.</para><para>At present, an initial period of 4 hours is available for any investigation, including investigations into terrorism offences, with a further 8 hours available for serious crimes if authorised by a magistrate or other judicial officer.</para><para>While this limit has worked well in relation to conventional offences and a time limit is necessary to maintain confidence in the reliability of evidence, it is an inadequate length of time in which to question suspects in the context of complex terrorism investigations that may have international aspects.</para><para>The Bill would maintain the initial investigation period of 4 hours, however it would provide for this period to be extended for up to a further 20 hours. </para><para>This would give a maximum investigation period of 24 hours.</para><para>As with any extension of the fixed investigation period, each extension would have to be authorised by a magistrate or other judicial officer.</para><para>The magisterial supervision and other safeguards, such as `dead time' to allow a person arrested to rest and recuperate before and during questioning, should ensure that the reliability of evidence is not compromised.</para><para>Secondly, the Bill permits law enforcement agencies to reasonably suspend or delay questioning a person suspected of committing a terrorism offence to make overseas inquiries to obtain information relevant to that terrorism investigation.</para><para>At present, the Part 1C questioning regime does not permit investigators to make overseas inquiries without running down the investigation `time clock' or, worse still, releasing the suspect.  </para><para>Given that terrorism investigations will often have an international dimension it is vital that authorities be able to make overseas inquiries without compromising their obligation to question a suspect fully.</para><para>And with international time zones a likely cause of delay in responding to requests for information and assistance from Australian authorities, the Bill prescribes this time as `dead time' so that it does not exhaust the finite investigation period. </para><para>In adjusting Australia's investigatory procedures to meet the new terrorist environment, the government recognises the need to ensure that appropriate safeguards are put in place to maintain the balance between security and individual rights and freedom.</para><para>That is why this extension would only apply to investigations of relevant terrorist offences under the Criminal Code.</para><para>And any decision to suspend or delay questioning to make overseas inquiries must be reasonable in the circumstances and must only last for a reasonable period that does not exceed the amount of the time zone difference.</para><para>And that is why all the existing safeguards in Part 1C of the Crimes Act will continue to apply to terrorist suspects being investigated in accordance with the Crimes Act regime. </para><para>These safeguards include:</para></quote><para>	a suspect's right to communicate with a legal practitioner, friend or relative, an interpreter and a consular office</para><para>	a suspect's right to remain silent</para><para>	requiring the tape recording of any admissions or confessions made by a suspect as a pre-condition for admissible evidence, and</para><para>	a suspect's right to a copy of recorded interviews.</para><quote><para>These amendments will greatly improve the ability of Australia's law enforcement authorities to effectively enforce our terrorism laws.</para><para>The bill also amends the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act.</para><para>The recent armed conflict in Afghanistan demonstrates that in today's security environment terrorist organisations may be acting in collaboration with the armed forces of a foreign state.</para><para>In future conflicts there is a real possibility that the terrorist organisations will continue to operate with the armed forces of sympathetic foreign states. </para><para>The Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act was designed to prohibit Australian citizens and those ordinarily resident in Australia from engaging in hostile activities in a foreign state. </para><para>Currently, a person does not commit an offence under the Foreign Incursions Act if the person commits hostile activities while serving in any capacity in or with the armed forces of a foreign state. </para><para>As a result, where a terrorist organisation is part of the armed forces of a government, a person involved in that terrorist organisation will not be liable for an offence under the Foreign Incursions Act. </para><para>The Bill gives the Government the power to prescribe organisations for the purposes of the Act. </para><para>Engaging in hostile activities while in or with a prescribed organisation will not be excused on the basis that the organisation was part of the armed forces of a foreign state. </para><para>In recognition of the serious nature of the hostile activities prohibited by the Foreign Incursions Act, the Bill will increase the maximum penalty for committing a hostile activity to twenty years imprisonment.</para><para>Currently, the Foreign Incursions Act is only applicable to a non-Australian citizen or resident if the person was in Australia at any time during the year preceding the doing of an act which is an offence against the Act. </para><para>This means that a person who is not a citizen or resident escapes the reach of the Foreign Incursions Act on day three hundred and sixty six. </para><para>The Bill will amend the Foreign Incursions Act to make it clear that a person, whether or not an Australian citizen or resident, who was in Australia at any time for a purpose connected with a hostile activity will be liable for prosecution under the Act. </para><para>The Foreign Incursions Act provides for three types of ministerial certificates, two serving as prima facie evidence of the facts recognised in the certificates and one serving as conclusive evidence of recognised facts. </para><para>The three types of certificates relate to facts that are difficult to prove or that may have implications for Australia's international relations because of the political nature of the facts (for example, whether a place or an area is or is in an independent sovereign state, whether a person was acting in the course of his duty to the Commonwealth and whether an authority was in effective governmental control of a state or part of a state). </para><para>Proving whether a group or organisation is part of the armed forces of a state is similarly difficult to prove and may also have implications for Australia's international relations. </para><para>Recognising this fact, the Bill contains an amendment enabling a Minister to issue a certificate attesting to the fact that a group was not part of the armed forces of a state at any one time. </para><para>Such a certificate would be prima facie evidence of the fact stated therein. </para><para>These amendments to the Foreign Incursions Act modernise the Act and ensure that it remains a valuable legislative tool in protecting Australia's national security and holding persons accountable for their acts committed both within Australia and overseas.</para><para>The Bill also amends the Criminal Code to make it an offence for a person to be a member of an organisation found by a court to be a terrorist organisation on the basis of facts presented in the course of a trial, where that organisation is not listed in regulations as a terrorist organisation.</para><para>This amendment will bring the membership offence provisions in line with the other terrorist organisation offence provisions, which apply both in relation to terrorist organisations listed in regulations and organisations found to be terrorist organisations by a court.</para><para>The effect of the proposed amendment would be to return the membership offence in Division 102 of the Criminal Code to its original form as set out in the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill when it was introduced in 2002.</para><para>The inconsistency between the membership offence and other terrorist offences was the result of pressure exerted by the Senate during the passage of the Bill.</para><para>It does not make sense to have a membership offence which will not apply in circumstances where a court finds that an organisation is a terrorist organisation, and where all other terrorist organisation offences do apply.</para><para>A further amendment to section 102.5 of the Criminal Code will introduce modified offences of providing training to or receiving training from a terrorist organisation.</para><para>The first offence will apply where a person is reckless as to whether an organisation is a terrorist organisation.</para><para>The second offence, which introduces a strict liability component, will apply only in the case where a terrorist organisation has been specified by regulations under Division 102 of the Criminal Code.</para><para>The effect of the proposed strict liability provision is that the prosecution still has to prove that the person intentionally provided training to or intentionally received training from an organisation, and that the organisation is a terrorist organisation specified by regulations.</para><para>However, the prosecution would not have to prove that the person was aware that it was a specified terrorist organisation.</para><para>A person will have available a defence of mistake of fact.</para><para>In addition, the offence will not apply if the person is not reckless as to the organisation being a specified terrorist organisation. </para><para>The effect of this amendment is to place an onus on persons to ensure that they are not involved in training activities with a terrorist organisation.</para><para>This amendment will send a clear message to those who would engage in the training activities of terrorist organisations, which could result in an attack of the kind seen in New York or in Bali, that they can expect to be dealt with harshly.</para><para>The last set of amendments concern the Proceeds of Crime Act. </para><para>The need for strong and effective laws for the confiscation of proceeds of crime is self-evident and has been considered and supported by this Chamber in the past. </para><para>The purpose of such laws is to discourage and deter crime by diminishing the capacity of offenders to finance future criminal activities and to remedy the unjust enrichment of criminals who profit at society's expense.</para><para>Literary proceeds are one aspect of the Proceeds of Crime Act. </para><para>The literary proceeds regime prevents criminals exploiting their notoriety for commercial purposes. </para><para>Orders can be made, for example,

and</para><para>	to provide a simpler and more consistent process for setting aside and terminating Part X arrangements. </para><quote><para>A key finding of the review was that Part X arrangements continue to have an important place in Australia's personal insolvency system as a formal alternative to bankruptcy allowing debtors to come to binding arrangements with creditors for payment or settlement of outstanding debts. </para><para>However, there were a number of areas identified in which improvements could be made to increase confidence in these arrangements.</para><para>A critical feature of Part X arrangements is that the debtor's proposal must be accepted by creditors. </para><para>The creditors are asked to make a decision based on information provided to them and following an opportunity to question the debtor at a creditors' meeting. </para><para>It is vital that creditors have available to them all information which is relevant to the debtor's proposal and affairs. </para><para>This must include information about relationships between the debtor and controlling trustee and between the debtor and other creditors. </para><para>As a result, the Bill proposes amendments to ensure that creditors have early access to the debtor's statement of affairs and that the debtor and controlling trustee are required to make written declarations of any relationships of which creditors should be aware prior to making a decision whether or not to accept the debtor's proposal.</para><para>The Bill also proposes amendments which will reduce the complexity of Part X and improve its transparency. </para><para>Even the description “Part X arrangements” has been inadequate to describe, for the benefit of debtors and creditors alike, what these arrangements are intended to achieve. </para><para>Therefore, the Bill proposes to replace the three existing types of arrangements under Part X with a single type of arrangement to be called a personal insolvency agreement. </para><para>A personal insolvency agreement, as described in the Bill, will provide greater choice and flexibility to debtors and creditors. </para><para>The debtor's proposal must contain provisions which will give creditors a clearer picture of what they are being asked to accept. </para><para>For example, the proposal must detail the property and income to be covered by the agreement and state: </para></quote><para>	how that property or income is to be dealt with </para><para>	whether the normal rules for distribution of dividends apply or whether property is to be distributed in another way</para><para>	whether the antecedent transactions provisions of the Act apply, and </para><para>	whether and to what extent the agreement will operate to release the debtor from his or her provable debts.</para><quote><para>The Bill also proposes amendments to streamline the process for setting aside and terminating personal insolvency agreements. </para><para>Currently, there are numerous provisions dealing with when a Part X arrangement is void and for termination of an arrangement. </para><para>The amendments will consolidate these provisions so it is clear that there is a single process and set of grounds on which a personal insolvency agreement can be set aside and a single process and set of grounds for terminating a personal insolvency agreement.</para><para>Many of the issues which may undermine the integrity of Part X arrangements can also arise in relation to post-bankruptcy schemes of arrangement and compositions under Division 6 of Part IV of the Act. </para><para>Therefore, this Bill also includes amendments to those provisions particularly in relation to the disclosure obligations of debtors, creditors and trustees. </para><para>These amendments will mirror those being made to Part X.</para><para>Finally, the Bill will make some minor and technical amendments to improve the operation of the Bankruptcy Act and correct a drafting error in the transitional provisions contained in the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Act 2002.</para></quote><para>—————</para><para><inline ref="R2034">EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS AMENDMENT BILL 2004</inline></para><quote><para>The Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2004 provides that grants are not payable where the applicant or the applicant's associates are deemed by Austrade, according to Ministerial guidelines, to be `not fit and proper' persons to receive a grant.</para><para>The Australian Government strongly supports the EMDG scheme.

The Act establishes a system of notification and assessment of industrial chemicals to protect health, safety and the environment and to provide for registration of certain persons proposing to introduce industrial chemicals. The Department of Health and Ageing portfolio, through the National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme (NICNAS), administers the Act. </para><para>The proposed changes give effect to the Government's response to the recommendations of the Chemicals and Plastics Action Agenda in December 2002. This response indicated the Government's agreement to examine options for flexibility in the assessment processes for industrial chemicals.</para><para>The industry has taken the Chemicals and Plastics Action Agenda very seriously and is monitoring government and industry progress in implementing the recommendations through the Chemicals and Plastics Leadership Group. Regulation reform was considered a high priority for the chemicals and plastics industry and the proposed changes will address long-standing industry concerns about the need for more efficient approval processes for industrial chemicals. </para><para>The chemicals industry is one of the largest sectors in the world. In Australia in 2000-01 the chemicals and plastics industry contributed $6.9 billion in industry value added with an annual turnover of approximately $24.6 billion (ABS Publication Catalogue 8221.0). Exports in 2000-01 were valued at $3.3 billion and imports at $12.4 billion (ABS Data provided to the Department of Industry Tourism and Resources). Chemicals are integral components of most manufactured and processed primary products. The proposed amendments are aimed at enhancing Australian industry capacity and addressing issues raised by industry in the Chemicals and Plastic Action Agenda, including concerns that the current:</para></quote><para>	notification and assessment requirements under the Act can result in delays to the introduction into Australia of new chemicals with low hazard and/or low risk; </para><para>	NICNAS arrangements do not provide enough incentive to industry to encourage the introduction of safer, more environmentally friendly industrial chemicals to the Australian marketplace; and </para><para>	criteria for the notification and assessment of new chemicals are restrictive and may delay for several months the commercial introduction of an otherwise low risk chemical.</para><quote><para>Concerns have also been raised by industry that the Government is not acting quickly enough to introduce the proposed amendments.</para><para>The proposed changes to the Act are the result of seven months of collaborative effort on the part of the government, industry and the community. This led to the publication of the Final Report and Recommendations for NICNAS Low Regulatory Concern Chemicals (LRCC) Reform Initiative and the Implementation Strategy for NICNAS Low Regulatory Concern Chemicals (LRCC) Reform Initiative in August 2003. The proposed changes to the Act are based on the recommendations that were agreed during the reform consultation process and recorded in these publications.</para><para>The Bill encompasses a package of amendments that must be considered in the context of the entire package. This package delivers reform for industry while protecting existing levels of worker safety, public health and environmental standards. </para><para>One of the specific changes proposed in the Bill is the introduction of a new process of audited self-assessment for low regulatory concern chemicals. </para><para>The OECD New Chemicals Task Force and the EU have praised the audited self-assessment process as a highly innovative approach and are looking at how it might be adopted within their jurisdictions. Adopting this process within Australia requires amending the Act to allow manufacturers and importers, who are known as introducers under the Act, to self-assess a chemical against criteria and guidelines issued by NICNAS. This will introduce flexibility into the current assessment process for industrial chemicals to enable the fast tracking of low regulatory concern chemicals while maintaining existing levels of worker safety, public health and environmental standards.</para><para>The new process for audited self-assessment will include an audited self-assessment certificate for polymers of low concern; non-hazardous chemicals; and other chemicals, or classes of chemicals that are prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of the self-assessment system. </para><para>The new self-assessment provisions will be counter-balanced with corresponding penalty provisions under the Act. All holders of self-assessment certificates will be required to keep self-assessment data records for five years; to submit an annual report to NICNAS; and to comply with any notices from NICNAS requiring information relating to self-assessment data. Penalties will be imposed on introducers for breaching any of these requirements.</para><para>The changes to the Act also introduce new permit categories for low regulatory concern chemicals and adopt administrative processes for some permit renewals. This includes: </para></quote><para>	a low hazard permit for chemicals of low volume; and</para><para>	a permit category for controlled use chemicals.</para><quote><para>Changes to the permit system also include expanding the early introduction permit system to cover low hazard and low risk chemicals. </para><para>Again, these new provisions will be counter-balanced with corresponding penalty provisions for breaches of permit conditions under the Act.</para><para>A range of new exemptions is also proposed for low regulatory concern chemicals. The new exemption categories include:</para></quote><para>	a Transhipment Exemption for chemicals off-loaded at an Australian port or airport for less than 30 days and kept under the control of Customs before reshipment out of Australia; </para><para>	an exemption for non hazardous and low hazardous non-cosmetic chemicals of specified volumes;</para><para>	an exemption for low concentration non-hazardous cosmetic chemicals imported in specified mixtures; </para><para>	an increase to the current exemption for research, development and analysis and the general exemption for low volume chemicals.</para><quote><para>These exemption categories will also be subject to reporting requirements and audits by NICNAS inspectors. It will be an offence to breach any of the exemption requirements and penalties will be incurred as a result. </para><para>It is also proposed that the current company registration scheme be extended to cover the broader industrial chemicals industry. Presently, the company registration scheme only covers those who import and/or manufacture industrial chemicals over a certain annual threshold amount, which is currently $500,000 per year. Introducers over this threshold are currently required to register with and pay a company registration charge to NICNAS.</para><para>Under the changes, this scheme will be extended to cover all importers and manufacturers of industrial chemicals, regardless of the amount imported and/or manufactured each year. Essentially, this means that all importers and manufacturers of industrial chemicals will be required to register with NICNAS. Introducers below the threshold will continue to be exempt from paying company registration charge and only an annual administration fee ($336) will apply to these introducers. This will only be a minor impost on industry and is necessary because NICNAS is a fully cost recovered scheme.</para><para>This proposal for mandatory registration is not controversial and in fact was suggested by industry during the reform consultation period as a way of increasing industry knowledge of NICNAS and compliance with the Act and thereby enhancing community confidence in the chemical industry.</para><para>The amendments to the Act also incorporate changes in relation to the Australian Inventory of Chemical Substances (known as the AICS). The AICS is the legal device that distinguishes new industrial chemicals from existing industrial chemicals in Australia. All chemicals on the AICS are defined as existing chemicals, while industrial chemicals not included in the AICS are defined as new industrial chemicals and must be assessed by NICNAS before they can be introduced, unless exempt under the Act. </para><para>Currently, new industrial chemicals are listed on the AICS five years after a certificate is issued by NICNAS. Under the proposed changes, however, the Act would be amended to give certificate holders the option to request that an assessed chemical be included on the AICS immediately, and to allow for the chemical to be listed on the AICS following this request.  </para><para>Further, the proposed changes give the Director of NICNAS the discretion to put additional details on the AICS. These include details of the assessment of the industrial chemical, details of use, if applicable, and any other conditions.</para><para>These amendments will mean that introducers will no longer have to try to envisage what uses their chemicals might be put to in the future because the chemicals will only be able to be introduced for the specific uses where this is applicable. This will prevent chemicals that have been assessed for a particular use, for instance, from being imported or manufactured for a different, un-assessed use, and which could be more harmful to health, safety and the environment. </para><para>To ensure compliance with these new provisions, it will be an offence to breach a condition of the AICS and the penalty for this offence will be 120 penalty units. </para><para>Finally, it is also proposed that the definition of “cosmetics” under the Act be amended to harmonise it with that used under the Trade Practices legislation. This will improve consistency in the Government's regulatory approach to cosmetics and will align the Australian definition with the European definition of cosmetics.</para><para>In summary, there is strong support for all of the proposed amendments. These amendments have been developed in response to industry concerns and in consultation with industry, government and the community. The reforms for fast tracking of assessment processes are counter balanced with enhanced public access to information, increased record keeping requirements and enhanced compliance activity. </para><para>The proposed amendments do not change the objects of the Act, but introduce flexibility into the current assessment process for industrial chemicals to enable the fast tracking of low regulatory concern chemicals while maintaining existing levels of worker safety, public health and environmental standards.

We believe that all Australians should have the opportunity to obtain a better standard of living in retirement than what the superannuation guarantee and the age pension can achieve alone. </para><para>It was this Government that introduced the co-contribution scheme on a $1 for $1 basis for eligible low income earners who make voluntary superannuation contributions. </para><para>But we now propose to take it further. </para><para>This bill will provide a $2.7 billion boost to superannuation incentives over three years. This builds on the Government's retirement income policy achievements to provide incentives, flexibility and security in retirement. </para><para>From 1 July this bill will increase the matching rate to $1.50 per $1 of employee contributions up to a maximum Co-contribution of $1,500. If an eligible person pays $1,000 into superannuation, the Government will match it with up to $1,500. </para><para>This bill also increases the lower income threshold, up to which the maximum co-contribution applies, to $28,000. Furthermore, for the first time employees with incomes between $40,000 and $58,000 will become eligible for the co-contribution. Currently the co-contribution phases out completely at $40,000.</para><para>These changes will improve retirement savings for over one million Australians who already receive the Co-contribution, even if they do not change their saving behaviour. More importantly, it facilitates a significant improvement in retirement incomes for those willing to save a bit more. </para><para>As an example, where a member with a current income for co-contribution purposes of $25,000 makes the minimum level of contributions required to receive the maximum government co-contribution over a 30 year working life, then the member's real accumulation balance is projected to increase by $106,000. This represents an improvement of 86% compared to the balance from Superannuation Guarantee contributions alone.</para><para>For someone earning $36,000 (approximately median earnings) and who makes the minimum level of member contributions required to receive the maximum government co-contribution over a 30 year working life, then the member's real accumulation balance is projected to increase by $51,000. This represents an improvement of 28% compared to the balance from Superannuation Guarantee contributions alone </para><para>This bill does more than provide a more generous co-contribution scheme. Over the next three years, it will accelerate and further reduce the maximum superannuation contributions surcharge rate to 7.5 per cent for higher income individuals, relative to current scheduled reduction from 15 per cent to 12.5 per cent. More than half a million Australians will receive a boost to their retirement savings as a result of this initiative.</para><para>In total these measures are estimated to cost the Government $2.7 billion over the forward estimate years. More than three quarters of the benefits provided by these measures or $2.1 billion are targeted to low and middle income workers. </para><para>The measures presented in this bill provide a significant opportunity for employees to improve their standards of living in retirement.

Duties on aviation fuels provide a substantial proportion of funding for CASA, which is estimated to receive 11 per cent less than the forecasted revenue due to reduced world-wide demand for air travel, cessation of Ansett operations and the introduction of larger and more fuel-efficient aircraft.

The Committee's Report arose out of a request from myself in May 2003. The Government response to the Committee's report was tabled on 16 October 2003.</para><para>Further electoral reform measures are contained in the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2004 which I am also introducing today. The amendments contained in this Bill will improve the operation of the electoral system.</para><para>The amendments cover a number of broad areas including enrolment issues, access to the electoral roll and its use; the lead-up to election day including preparations undertaken by the Australian Electoral Commission (the AEC), political parties, candidates and others; the processes for voting; and the operation of polling booths on election day. The major amendments include:</para></quote><para>	improving public access to the electoral roll;</para><para>	restructuring the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 relating to entitlement to information contained in the roll to make them more easily understandable;</para><para>	extending end-use restrictions on roll information and related penalties to all forms of the roll;</para><para>	removing the roll from sale in any format;</para><para>	requiring the AEC to publish a statement of reasons for decisions not to register proposed party names;</para><para>	allowing scrutineers to be present at pre-poll voting centres;</para><para>	prohibiting broadcasting of political material that is audible within close proximity of polling places;</para><para>	allowing for the temporary suspension or adjournment of polling for physical and safety reasons; and</para><para>	clarifying procedures for the nomination of candidates for election to both Houses of Parliament.</para><quote><para>Over time, access to the roll has been expanded to include State and Territory electoral authorities, Australian Government agencies, health screening programmes and medical researchers. The forms in which the roll is provided have also evolved to keep pace with technological change. Finally, measures regulating the uses to which roll information can be put have been steadily increased over time. All of these changes have created roll access provisions that are complex, out of date and, in some cases, contradictory. </para><para>This Bill will amend the roll access provisions to improve clarity, remove contradiction and improve privacy protections. Access to roll information will be set out in tabular form. The tables will include all information that is currently provided for in the Electoral Act. They list who is entitled to roll information, what information they are entitled to and how often they will receive it. Apart from the printed version of the roll, the amendments will remove all references to the form of the roll from the Electoral Act. This means that the Australian Electoral Commission will be able to keep pace with changes in technology and provide access to roll information in new and more accessible forms such as on the internet. Improved access to the roll will enable people to check their enrolment details. </para><para>The amendments will extend the end-use restrictions to all roll information, regardless of form. This measure will close a loophole that has allowed roll information to be used for commercial and other unintended uses, such as direct marketing and debt collection. Finally, the roll will be removed from sale, closing off the means by which people obtain roll information for commercial and other unintended uses. Copies of the roll will be available for inspection at all AEC offices.</para><para>The Bill introduces a new accountability mechanism for decisions about party names. </para><para>The AEC will be required to provide a written notice of reasons for its decision not to register a party name to the parties to an application for, or objection to, the registration of a party name. The reasons will be provided to all parties of an application for, or objection to, the registration of a party name.</para><para>There are a number of improvements to polling administration also in the Bill. The first of these relates to scrutineers. Scrutineers are an essential part of the polling process, a defence against fraud and a guarantee of accountability. However, under the existing provisions of the Electoral Act scrutineers are not permitted to attend pre-poll voting centres. The implications of this are significant in light of the fact that, according to the JSCEM, nearly 600,000 pre-poll votes were cast at the 2001 federal election.</para><para>The Bill will amend the Electoral Act and the Referendum Act to allow scrutineers to attend pre-poll voting offices to scrutineer pre-poll voting, improving accountability for all these pre-poll votes. </para><para>One of the characteristics of recent elections in Australia is the increasing sophistication candidates bring to canvassing outside polling booths. For example, one innovation examined by the Committee is the use of broadcasting equipment to canvass for votes. While innovative, this form of canvassing may result in the political message being heard in the polling booth, which is against the spirit of the Electoral Act. The Bill amends the Electoral Act and the Referendum Act to prevent the use of broadcasting equipment for canvassing that can be heard within six metres of the entrance to the polling booth, at the entrance to the polling booth, and inside the polling booth.</para><para>A further amendment to the Electoral Act and Referendum Act will allow a temporary suspension of polling where there is a threat to the safety of electors or a difficulty in the physical conduct of polling. Currently, polling can be adjourned to another day at a polling place if polling is interrupted by circumstances including violence, storm or flood. However, there is no mechanism for temporarily suspending polling on polling day for these sorts of reasons.</para><para>The Bill will allow for such a temporary suspension. The Bill also expands the reasons for which polling can be suspended to include fire and health hazards.</para><para>Finally there are a number of minor technical amendments to the Electoral Act and Referendum Act, including:</para></quote><para>	extending the time an elector living overseas can apply for enrolment from two to three years;</para><para>	allowing sitting independents to renominate using a single nominee;</para><para>	streamlining the process of withdrawal of a candidate from a bulk nomination;</para><para>	removing the requirement for postal votes to be received by the AEC before the close of polls in certain circumstances;</para><para>	allowing the election results to be attached to the writ, rather than written on the back of it; and</para><para>	the removal of appeal to the High Court by way of right for injunctions. </para><para>I commend the Bill to the Senate.</para><para>—————</para><para><inline ref="R2030">ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT (ENROLMENT INTEGRITY AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2004</inline></para><quote><para>This Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2004 contains amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (the Electoral Act) and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984, the majority of which arise from the Government-supported electoral reform recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters' report titled The 2001 federal election.

As a measure to prevent any potential disenfranchisement of voters, where the presiding officer continues to have doubts about the elector's identity following the answers to the questions, the elector will be able to cast a provisional vote.</para><para>As a further measure to preserve the integrity of the electoral roll, amendments to allow for the close of rolls for new electors to be 6.00 pm on the day on which the writ is issued, and for the close of rolls for those amending their enrolment to be 8.00 pm three working days after the issue of the writ will ensure that the Australian Electoral Commission has sufficient time to verify details provided by applicants for enrolment.

The role of the Panel, which included senior members of the medical profession, was to recommend ways for ensuring an affordable medical indemnity insurance system that would allow doctors to continue to practise with certainty.</para><para>Doctors made it clear to the Panel that one of their main concerns about medical indemnity insurance was the need to maintain insurance cover for the possibility of any claims made against them after they retire or leave the medical workforce.

Some groups said that the high cost of retirement cover meant that they felt pressured to continue to work past the point at which it was safe for them to do so.</para><para>The need to purchase insurance in retirement is an outcome of claims-made insurance, under which claims will only be covered if the doctor had current insurance both when the incident giving rise to the claim occurred and when the claim is notified. Under claims-incurred cover, which will meet a claim if the doctor is covered at the time of the incident, the need for retirement cover does not arise. </para><para>While the medical indemnity sector had been moving away from claims-incurred cover for some time, the introduction of APRA supervision of the sector in mid 2003 and the lack of claims incurred reinsurance in the market led to all medical indemnity cover from that point on being offered on a claims-made basis.</para><para>During consultations with the medical profession it became evident that older doctors who were used to claims-incurred insurance had not made financial provision to maintain claims made cover once they retired. Even for younger doctors, the need to save throughout their working lives to pay for insurance through their retirement—without any certainty about the level of premiums in retirement—was a very significant concern. </para><para>The Government had always intended to resolve the retirement cover issues as part of its broader medical indemnity package. Initially, the Government made sure through regulations under the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Act 2003 that doctors would have access to run-off cover for six years after they retired or left the private medical workforce. This was an interim measure while the Government, the profession and the insurers worked together on a long term solution. </para><para>This process fed into the deliberations of the Medical Indemnity Policy Review Panel and led to its proposal for a Run-off Cover Scheme to provide the long term solution that doctors need. </para><para>The Scheme will be established by making amendments to:</para></quote><para>	the Medical Indemnity Act 2002 to set out the eligibility criteria for Run-off Cover Scheme and the payment arrangements for associated claims; and</para><para>	the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Act 2003 to require all medical indemnity insurers to grant indemnity to doctors who are eligible for the Run-off Cover Scheme at no cost to the doctors.</para><quote><para>The basic design of the Scheme is that insurers will grant eligible doctors an indemnity, which will be deemed to be a contract of insurance for most purposes.</para><para>As claims against those doctors emerge they will be managed and met by the insurers. </para><para>The Government will then reimburse the insurers for the costs of the claims. </para><para>The Government has also agreed to pick up through the Scheme the incurred but not reported claims against eligible doctors arising from their period of claims-incurred cover with a medical defence organisation. </para><para>Under the eligibility criteria for the scheme some doctors will be covered permanently and others will leave when their circumstances change. The following practitioners will be covered by the Scheme:</para></quote><para>	retirees over the age of 65 or more who have declared that they have retired permanently from the private workforce; or</para><para>	doctors who are permanently disabled; or</para><para>	those who are under 65 years of age and have not engaged in private medical practice for 3 years (this group can include those who have retired before the age of 65, and those no longer practising medicine, or are working solely in the public sector ); or</para><para>	those who are on maternity leave; or</para><para>	those who have died (provided that a claim can still be made against the doctor's estate).</para><quote><para>There will also be a capacity for new groups of doctors to be included in the Scheme by way of regulations including temporary resident doctors who have left Australia permanently to become eligible for the Run-off Cover Scheme immediately on leaving Australia. </para><para>Doctors who already meet the qualifying criteria will be eligible for cover from the Run-off Cover Scheme for claims notified on or after 1 July 2004. Other doctors will become eligible over time.</para><para>Doctors won't have to apply for cover under the Scheme. Insurers will be obliged to issue a contract when they are aware that the doctor is eligible. </para><para>Under the Scheme the scope of doctors' cover will be determined by the last cover they purchased during their working lives to cover incidents which occurred while they were practising. This arrangement should provide doctors with a seamless transition into the Scheme once they are no longer practising.</para><para>However, if a doctor returns to the private medical workforce then he or she is no longer eligible for the Scheme in respect of new claims notified after his or her return to private medical work. </para><para>As not all doctors who cease private practice will immediately meet the eligibility criteria for Run-off Cover Scheme, the Government will also amend the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Act 2003 and its associated regulations so that insurers will provide run-off cover to doctors not eligible for the Scheme who require run-off cover for at least three years `at cost'.</para><para>The Government will also contract with insurers to provide run-off cover at nominal cost to doctors who have been members or policy holders for ten years or more and who are not eligible for the Run-off Cover Scheme.</para><para>Medical indemnity insurers will contribute to the cost of the Scheme by an annual charge on their individual gross insurance premium incomes. This charge will be set as a tax in the Medical Indemnity (Run-off Cover Support Payment) Bill 2004, which forms part of the package of bills presented here today.</para><para>The upper limit of the rate of tax is set in the bill before you. This is simply a default rate, to allow some scope to respond to changing circumstances over time. I propose to put forward regulations to the Executive Council which would set a lower rate of 8.5% from 1 July 2004. This lower rate reflects the estimated total cost of the cohort of doctors entering the scheme each year as they retire. </para><para>Most medical indemnity insurers will be able to provision for their payment to this Scheme from 1 July 2004 as their premium cycles run on a financial year basis. Their run-off cover support payment will be due at the end of each financial year. </para><para>To take account of one insurer collecting premiums on a calendar year basis, I propose to put forward regulations which will provide for it to be taxed at the end of a calendar year. As the first year for which the insurer will be taxed will be 2005, I also propose that it be taxed at a rate 1.0625% higher than other insurers for the first four years of the scheme. This will ensure that the insurer makes an equivalent contribution to other insurers to the cost of the scheme, even though it will not be taxed for the first six months of the 2004-05 financial year. Its members will already be eligible for the Run-off Cover Scheme from 1 July 2004.</para><para>Representatives of the medical profession have told the Government how important the Run-off Cover Scheme is and also appreciates that this tax will be applied proportionately and transparently to premiums paid by practising doctors. I acknowledge the support and assistance of the medical profession as the Government has developed this aspect of its medical indemnity package.</para><para>The Government is also very aware of doctors' needs for both transparency in financial transactions and security of insurance cover in their retirement. The Government has responded to these concerns in two significant ways in its design of the run-off cover scheme.</para><para>First, medical indemnity insurers will have to include information on doctors' premium invoices which shows the gross premium payable by the doctor and that proportion and amount of the premium which the insurer will pass on to the Government under the Run-off Cover Support Payment Scheme. </para><para>Secondly, the Government will provide a money-back guarantee to working doctors, if the Run-off Cover Scheme were ever terminated in the future before they became eligible for the scheme without an equivalent Government scheme being provided. The Government will refund these doctors their implicit contribution to the Run-off Cover Support Payment made by insurers, plus interest. The refund will be paid at the direction of individual doctors for the purpose of purchasing alternative medical indemnity insurance.  </para><para>These arrangements show the Government's clear commitment to transparent, secure arrangements for medical indemnity insurance.</para><para>To make sure that there is a seamless transition between the Run-off Cover Scheme the Government will also refine aspects of its existing Exceptional Claims Scheme. Under the proposed changes the Exceptional Claims Scheme will be able to pay claims against doctors for claims arising from treatment of public patients in public hospitals where the doctors were covered by a medical indemnity provider at the time of the incident giving rise to the claim. Such claims are presently excluded from the Exceptional Claims Scheme. </para><para>As a result of the amendments proposed in the bill a retired doctor who was once covered for such claims under “claims made” discretionary cover with a medical defence organisation would not be personally liable for amounts in excess of the limit of their Run-off Cover Scheme contract. </para><para>The Government is also aware that doctors continue to be concerned about their personal exposure to exceptional claims in relation to services they provide when accompanying sporting teams or cultural groups. The Government has responded to these concerns by introducing regulation-making provisions in this bill to widen the scope of the Exceptional Claims Scheme. I propose to put forward regulations extending the scope of the Exceptional Claims scheme to overseas treatment by doctors in these circumstances.</para><para>The Run-off Cover Scheme is good news for doctors. Together with the Exceptional Claims Scheme, and the Government's continued work with the States and Territories on the implementation of tort law reform, this Scheme will allow doctors to continue to practise with security into the future, and security when they retire. This is essential for the maintenance of health services and the protection of patients.</para><para>The Scheme demonstrates the Government's commitment to doctors to support them in the vitally important services they provide to the Australian community. </para></quote><para>—————</para><para><inline ref="R2049">SUPERANNUATION LAWS AMENDMENT (2004 MEASURES No. 1) BILL 2004</inline></para><quote><para>The Superannuation Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 1) Bill 2004 will amend the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Act 2003.</para><para>The Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Act 2003 provides a matching Government co-contribution of up to $1,000 for personal superannuation contributions made by qualifying individuals.

The development of a tourism strategy is an important 2001 election commitment of the Coalition. </para><para>Over the last decade, tourism has become a major global industry. In response, nations are recognising the potential economic contribution tourism offers, and are becoming increasingly competitive. Governments are restructuring their tourism agencies to maximise their investment in tourism. As international competition intensifies, it is important that Australia maintains and cements its competitive market position.</para><para>The benefits of tourism go beyond the generation of sustainable economic activity. International travel builds tolerance and understanding of different cultures, and is a significant contributor to peaceful international relations.</para><para>Travel by Australians within Australia strengthens our understanding of our history, our Indigenous heritage, our unique and diverse culture, and our outstanding natural environment. Travel binds us together as a nation. While these benefits are harder to measure than economic output, the Australian Government believes that they are, at least, equally important reasons for government support of the tourism industry. </para><para>The Tourism White Paper is the result of an unprecedented partnership between Government and the tourism industry. It provides a comprehensive framework to grow tourism in a sustainable manner. With an extra $235 million behind the White Paper, the Australian Government's total tourism spend over the next four years will exceed $600 million.</para><para>The White Paper has two strategic elements. Firstly, we want to encourage more international visitors and Australians to go beyond the metropolitan areas and discover regional and rural Australia. Secondly, we want them to have the best experiences through the best products. The aim is to develop Australia as a `Platinum Plus' destination, one that is a market leader in quality and value. This is a key factor in maintaining and increasing our world share of tourism exports. </para><para>The Tourism White Paper provides the basis for structural reform of key tourism agencies. It will also provide a platform to maximise the Australian Government's investment in tourism.</para><para>The purpose of this Bill is the establishment of a new tourism body, Tourism Australia. This is a key plank of the Government's reform agenda for tourism. Tourism Australia will encompass the functions of the Australian Tourist Commission, See Australia, the Tourism Forecasting Council and the Bureau of Tourism Research, plus a new unit, Tourism Events Australia. </para><para>Since its creation by the Coalition Government in 1967, the Australian Tourist Commission has been responsible for promoting Australia overseas. Through an effective partnership model with industry, it has been instrumental in doubling Australia's international visitors since the early 1990s. The successful elements of the Australian Tourist Commission Act 1987 have been incorporated into the Tourism Australia legislation.</para><para>See Australia is a private company which receives significant funding from the Australian Government. Its main role is to encourage Australians to travel in Australia through generic tourism promotion, such as the `Go on. Get out there' campaign.</para><para>The Bureau of Tourism Research is the main source of tourism related statistical and research information in Australia. Its key publications are the International and National Visitor Surveys, which provide information about the characteristics and travel behaviour of international visitors and Australian residents. The Tourism Forecasting Council was established by the Australian Government to provide consensus forecasts of Australian tourism activity.</para><para>This Bill will bring together these vital mechanisms for delivery of the Government's support for tourism into a coherent body which will give strong leadership for the growth and development of the tourism industry. Tourism Australia will have a broad range of responsibilities including support for international and domestic marketing and market development, events and business tourism, and the provision of key tourism research, statistics and analysis. </para><para>A key aspect of Tourism Australia's international and promotional activity will be the new branding of Australia. This is a unique opportunity to bring together all aspects of Australian life, from the arts and sport right through to agriculture and business exports. With this new branding we can promote Australia in a holistic sense.</para><para>A great example of this is the Australian wine industry. Australia sells more than 1000 bottles of wine every minute outside of our country. Significant benefits for regional Australia will flow if we can turn each bottle of wine into a liquid postcard of Australia. In marketing terms, this presents an excellent leveraging opportunity. </para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Background</inline></para><quote><para>Tourism makes a substantial contribution to the Australian economy. In 2001-02, tourism was directly responsible for 4.5 per cent of Australia's GDP, 549,000 jobs or 5.9 per cent of all employed, and $17.1 billion in export earnings or 11.2 per cent of total exports.</para><para>Tourism contributes to the preservation of the environment and heritage by placing an economic value on them, and to significant job creation, especially in rural and remote communities. It is an excellent vehicle for advancing the Government's economic, social and environmental objectives, particularly in regional Australia. </para><para>Over the past few years, the Australian tourism industry has endured the adverse impacts of a series of international events. These events challenged the capacity of the industry to maintain sustained tourism growth and respond quickly and effectively to major incidents. The Tourism White Paper contains a number of initiatives directed towards enhancing the tourism industry's capacity to be more flexible in responding to future shocks. The establishment of Tourism Australia is a key element in achieving this objective.</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Major Features</inline></para><quote><para>Tourism Australia will be established as a statutory body subject to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 (CAC Act). This recognises the commercial focus of the new body and the need for it to operate flexibly in a commercial environment.  </para><para>An important consideration in establishing Tourism Australia as an independent body is to allow it to engage more actively on a commercial basis with industry. This includes actively seeking industry's contribution to marketing and promotional campaigns. In carrying out its functions, Tourism Australia will also work closely with State and Territory tourism agencies, regional tourism organisations and other key stakeholders. Tourism Australia will have additional resources to better forecast emerging trends in the global tourism market and therefore to maximise returns on government investment and Australia's growth potential.</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">The Functions of Tourism Australia</inline></para><quote><para>The new organisation will help to foster a prosperous and sustainable tourism industry in Australia.

This includes both international and domestic visitors. Tourism Australia will also help to foster a sustainable tourism industry in Australia, and will help to increase the economic benefits to Australia from tourism.</para><para>It is vital that Australia is highly competitive in tourism marketing and promotion to ensure potential tourists, both domestic and international, increasingly consider and choose Australia as their next holiday destination, or business or event location. </para><para>Tourism Australia will develop strategies to promote growth in the number of international and domestic visitors, and maximise yield from those visitors. Tourism Australia will seek to achieve this through developing marketing and promotional strategies that position Australia as a market leader in quality and value, raising awareness of Australia's unique attributes, and strategically marketing Australia to key markets. </para><para>It is recognised that many regional areas of Australia have a growing reliance on tourism for generating business activity and jobs, especially in the small to medium sized business sector. Tourism Australia will encourage international and domestic visitors to travel throughout Australia, to ensure that tourism contributes strongly to the economic wellbeing of regional Australia. </para><para>Tourism Australia will help guide the development of tourism product in regional areas, helping to ensure that products and services correspond with visitor demand, and develop strategies to encourage the dispersal of international visitors throughout Australia. Tourism Australia will also promote the benefits of holidays to Australians, and of exploring their own country.</para><para>Significant economic benefits can be gained from the staging of events, not only for the tourism industry, but also for the businesses which indirectly benefit from tourism, and the broader community. Tourism Australia will establish a special events unit called Tourism Events Australia. This unit will work with State and Territory governments to maximise the return on investment associated with attracting and staging international events in Australia. </para><para>Timely and accurate data and research is vital to the Australian tourism industry and government. It provides a foundation for informed decision making and underpins strategic business planning, including new product development, and also helps in public policy planning.

The legislation itself is in fact welcomed by the opposition. However, I think it is, in truth, an indictment of this government that it us unable to deal with this legislation in a more pragmatic way. The Senate committee report proposed significant recommendations that could have been taken up by the government, but it failed to take them up. Labor's amendments, in fact, would have strengthened this bill significantly and given older people and younger people in our community much greater protection in the workplace and generally, particularly in the area of age based harassment by stamping out a loophole that still allows age based discrimination in some circumstances. With the amendments that Labor were proposing, we believe the operation of the Commonwealth age discrimination legislation would have gone from being perhaps the weakest in the land to being on a par with the best.</para></talk.start><para>As amended by those proposals, we considered that the legislation before us would have been better able to fulfil its mission, one which the government and the opposition agreed to—that is, to protect Australians from negative age discrimination and a culture of utilising our nation's best talent base irrespective of a person's age. There is, I think, strong consensus in the community that if the government is serious about retaining older people in the work force it needs to act to change its current attitudes towards older workers. There is also strong consensus that we need to be giving our young people greater comfort than what this bill presently provides. It demonstrates that the Howard government is happy to talk about removing discrimination but that in reality it is happy to retain and entrench discrimination when it suits.</para><para>Labor in this instance will not refuse to pass this legislation because of the benefits that it will bring. But we express, as I have been doing, our serious concern that the government is not prepared to support a stronger Age Discrimination Bill, one that would have been a piece of legislation that this government could have been proud of. Instead, it is prepared in this instance to settle for second best. While the opposition will not oppose the passage of this bill, that does not signify that we acquiesce to this second-best piece of legislation. What it does mean is that we still agree to the benefits that this legislation will bring by ensuring that age based discrimination is eliminated as far as this bill can do so, and we ask the government to consider during the next period the amendments that were not agreed to in the House this time. Labor will continue to seek a change for the betterment of Australians, especially in the area of age discrimination.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>23586</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We Democrats are very disappointed that the government has decided not to agree to the amendments that were made by the Senate to the <inline ref="R1764">Age Discrimination Bill 2003</inline>. Age discrimination legislation is long overdue. The Democrats welcomed the introduction of the bill; however, we were disappointed with the approach taken at the time by the government. As we looked more closely at the detail and examined the speeches of government members it became quite clear to us that the bill was little more than an attempt to facilitate the government's policy of keeping older Australians in the workplace, and for longer. Many of the arguments made in favour of this legislation were associated with the economic benefits it was argued would flow from older Australians remaining in the work force longer. </para></talk.start><para>The Democrats share the view that older Australians should be able to remain active within the work force without fear of discrimination. However, we believe that freedom from discrimination on the basis of age is a fundamental human right which deserves protection in itself. It is a right which applies equally to younger Australians and to older Australians. We Democrats believe it should have been protected years ago, not just now that the government has discovered the apparent economic benefits. Of course, the government's motivation for introducing age discrimination legislation is really quite irrelevant if in the end what we achieve is comprehensive protection against discrimination on the basis of age. However, in this case the government's attitude was actually reflected in the provisions of the bill, which did have a number of weaknesses. The Democrats and the opposition sought to address a number of those weaknesses by way of amendment in the Senate.</para><para>The Democrats thought that the most obvious weakness in the bill was the absence of an office of the age discrimination commissioner, and we introduced amendments to bring about such a commissioner. Unfortunately, those amendments were not supported by the opposition and therefore failed. However, there were a number of other amendments which were passed by the Senate. In particular, the prohibition against age discrimination was extended to include discrimination on the basis of a person's relative or associate. The prohibition was also extended to apply to unpaid work as well as to paid employment. The Senate removed the provision in the bill which would prevent a person who has been discriminated against on the basis of their age and disability from seeking redress under both age discrimination and disability discrimination legislation. The Senate introduced a prohibition against harassing a person because of that person's age. It also removed the dominant reason test from the prohibition against discrimination so that a person could seek redress if they had suffered discrimination and at least one of the reasons for that discrimination was their age. The final amendments made by the Senate were aimed at ensuring that the exemption for positive discrimination was based on an objective rather than a subjective test. They introduced a requirement of reasonableness.</para><para>The government, through the House of Representatives, has rejected each and every one of the amendments made by the Senate. The reasons for opposing the amendments are brief and unconvincing. We Democrats believe that the Senate's amendments significantly improved what was otherwise a very weak bill. The government's rejection of these amendments simply confirms that its motivation in introducing this legislation had little to do with a genuine commitment to protecting the rights of Australians. This is clearly reflected in the reasons provided by the House of Representatives for rejecting the amendments. For example, in rejecting the amendment which would have removed the dominant purpose test from the bill, the House states:</para><quote><para>In the area of age discrimination, action should be unlawful only where age is the dominant consideration. It is critical that the legislation not restrict employment opportunities for older Australians by imposing unnecessary costs and inflexibility on employers acting in good faith. The dominant reason test will be most appropriate to promote the attitudinal change it seeks to achieve.</para></quote><para>In other words, the government's intention is not to provide any real avenues of redress for those who have suffered age discrimination but merely to promote an attitudinal change. So this legislation will operate more like a vision statement than a regulatory regime. We Democrats are deeply disappointed that the Senate's amendments have been rejected; however, we will not be insisting upon them. As I said at the start of my remarks, and in my speech in the second reading debate on this bill, age discrimination legislation is long overdue in Australia. We have taken the view that it is better to have a weak prohibition against age discrimination than to have none at all. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>23588</page.no><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name><name.id>GX5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank honourable senators for their comments. The <inline ref="R1764">Age Discrimination Bill 2003</inline> delivers on a key government commitment and a key government policy initiative and it is integral to the government's strategy for addressing the ageing of Australia's population. Our aim in prohibiting age discrimination is to promote a change in people's attitudes about younger and older people. As Senator Greig has correctly pointed out, the government's objective is to encourage and foster attitudinal change without imposing unnecessary and unrealistic restraints on decision making in business and other sectors of public life. The amendments moved originally in the Senate by the opposition and the Democrats were not necessary and they were rightly rejected by the House of Representatives. In our view they would only have compromised the effectiveness of the bill. For example, the amendment purporting to extend the bill to unpaid work would undesirably fetter the voluntary sector.</para></talk.start><para>The Attorney-General tabled a statement of the government's reasons for rejecting the amendments in the House of Representatives and I need not repeat the reasons the government will not accept the amendments.

The key amendment to which the House of Representatives has disagreed—I am assuming there was only one but perhaps there were other amendments—came from we Democrats, who were looking for opportunities to militate against what we saw as the inappropriateness of the Federal Police Commissioner being chastised for speaking out publicly on an issue which caused the government some embarrassment as it appeared to suggest policy differences. It was our view that those senior public servants, and the commissioner in particular, ought not be placed in the difficult and possibly invidious position of not being able to speak out on what they believe to be matters of public importance, at the risk of their own employment.  </para></talk.start><para>The amendment we therefore moved, and won support for from the opposition, was to ensure that such speaking out by the commissioner would not place her or his employment in jeopardy. The amendment therefore was self-explanatory and it was our hope that it would be adopted with a view to ensuring that there was greater transparency and accountability in terms of the processes for senior public servants, an example of which we saw in the recent scenario involving Commissioner Keelty. It remains our view that that amendment ought to have been supported and should have become a part of the legislation. However, although the House of Representatives has not seen fit to embrace it, we will not stand in the way of the passage of the legislation as a whole given that the broader provisions of the legislation certainly have merit.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>23589</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There was, as I understand it, only one surviving amendment after the day of the long debate that we had in relation to the <inline ref="S406">Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline>, where the Democrats won the Labor Party's support for more transparency in relation to the appointments, ensuring that the government will not be able to deal with people as they will. As the member for Barton made clear in the House of Representatives, the opposition has supported this legislation to complete the integration of the AFP and the APS and we will not be opposing the passage of this bill.</para></talk.start><para>We are—as I think the Democrats are—disappointed that the government has not accepted an amendment proposed by the Democrats to reaffirm the right of the AFP Commissioner to express an honestly held view. This right, of course, faces no greater threat than the Howard government. Indeed, last fortnight in the Senate estimates we heard further evidence of how Commissioner Keelty was harangued by the Prime Minister's office and department after he made comments about Iraq that the government did not like.</para><para>As the member for Barton noted in the other place, the basis of the government's opposition to this amendment is entirely disingenuous. The minister says that it would prevent a commissioner from being dismissed for making racially discriminatory comments and my recollection was that that was the argument that Senator Ellison also relied upon. I must say I did have to consider that for a while but, having considered it, I think it was appropriate to come back and say that, in the first place, it would be easy for the government to clarify that the legislation does not go so far as to make unlawful those acceptable comments that are otherwise lawful.</para><para>In the second place, the minister now concedes that racially discriminatory comments justify dismissal. Why doesn't he then use his influence to ensure that the Western Australian branch of the Liberal Party does something about previous matters that have arisen? I will not go to the particular case; I am sure Western Australian senators, and perhaps other senators here, know what I am talking about: actions which are taken in cases such as those which offend the Racial Discrimination Act. I particularly refer to a judgment by Judge Carr—and I will not go to the title but it was not that long ago, in 2002—which was not appealed. In my view, it is another case of the Liberal Party having double standards. It was a sure sign that the government was desperate in its search for an excuse not to support this amendment. When you reflect upon that case—the case in Western Australia under the Racial Discrimination Act, by a Liberal Party senator—you may think that it is strange that Senator Ellison would also raise that as an argument as to why he could not include it in this bill. I also put the argument, earlier, that you could amend the provision to ensure that unlawful comments would not be made lawful as a consequence.  </para><para>I think it really underlines the Western Australian position and the government's position that they really cannot see their way clear to have a bill which ensures that Commissioner Keelty, in this instance, can act with complete honesty in a range of public matters. Nevertheless, we should not be sidetracked. I could certainly go on a little about that, but it is a debate that has been had. The real debate is the integration and I think the government has got that right. We have supported that, and we think that it will provide a new regime for both the AFP and the APS to ensure that they get on with crime fighting. We do not resile from our belief that the government was wrong to negate this amendment but, as we have indicated in the other place, in view of the importance of completing the APS-AFP integration and giving the AFP appropriate powers of cross-jurisdictional investigation, we will not be opposing the passage of this bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>23590</page.no><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name><name.id>GX5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I again thank honourable senators for their comments.

I spoke just briefly before question time on the third reading, but I was sat down just before I was about to finish. As I do not now have to finish within 10 seconds, I will elaborate more fully. The enormous tax cuts coming out of the federal budget are a simple matter but do need to go on the record as an issue of public significance and public debate. The tax cuts are aimed specifically and exclusively at the highest income earners. The top 20 per cent to 25 per cent of income earners are the only people that will benefit from these income tax cuts. The Australian Democrats have said all along—indeed, even before the budget—that if there are going to be income tax cuts they should be shared fairly amongst the entire community. There is no doubt that lower income earners can and would benefit from income tax relief. </para></talk.start><para>The Democrats attempted to address that by moving amendments in the committee stage of this legislation to make these tax cuts fairer. Providing $10 a week extra for low-income earners might not sound like much and might not make much difference when you are on $100,000 a year, but when you are only on $30,000 a year that extra 10 bucks does make a difference, and that would have been one way of clearly making these tax cuts fairer. That measure was not supported by either Labor or the coalition, and that is a disappointment to us.</para><para>Leading up to the budget the Democrats also outlined a range of areas where we could be saving extra money, increasing our revenue or reducing lost revenue by closing tax loopholes in areas such as the incentive that gives people a tax break for company cars. That measure, closing a tax loophole, incidentally, but appropriately on a day like today with the Prime Minister's announcement, would be good for the environment. That area currently encourages more car use, with the taxpayer paying for it. Modifying negative gearing could save an enormous amount of money and reduce the upward pressure on the price of housing. The massive capital gains tax discount that was supported by the ALP a few years ago was another area where a massive tax gain for higher income earners was provided, leading to the upward pressure on the price of housing. The long-abandoned promise by the coalition to tax trusts as companies would not just create a fairer tax system but also raise significant amounts of money. And there are many other smaller measures as well. So there is a range of measures that would make our tax system fairer and more equitable and would raise extra revenue that could pay for these tax cuts or that could go into extra services that the Democrats also believe are necessary.</para><para>It is important to acknowledge and note for the record what is happening here. I mentioned the capital gains tax cuts that were made by this government with the support of the ALP. Huge gains were described at the time as overwhelmingly benefiting the wealthy as well as giving retrospective tax cuts to those already holding assets. At the time of the business tax changes Margo Kingston wrote that the Democrats had been fighting hard to stop the potential for massive rorting by the rich and fighting for the promised tax avoidance measures to be legislated to ensure that those tax avoidance measures that were supposed to be addressed were legislated for and in place before the other parts, the lower company tax rates and the capital gains tax rates, kicked in. She said that Labor `shook hands with its traditional enemy rather than join the Democrats to improve the package for its own constituency'. It is doing it again and it is doing it for the same electoral reasons: it wants it off the agenda. It says it is coming down with its `fairer and broader' tax proposals for the election. If Labor's proposals are good, then we will support them in the Senate if it gets into government. But what if it does not? We are then stuck with incredibly unfair, badly targeted, regressive income tax changes. In effect, Labor is helping the government get through parts of the changes that it wanted with its package attached to the GST. Labor made great play about the GST at the time and criticised it mercilessly, but now it is actually helping the government deliver some of the most regressive components of that—the income tax cuts for higher income earners—and it has to be highlighted that that is what is happening here. </para><para>I have no doubt that Labor are genuine in saying they will put forward a tax package that is going to be broader and fairer—and we will be the first to say so if that is what happens—but the fact is that that is not what is before the parliament. We cannot put that in place. At the moment there has been no attempt by the opposition to make this existing legislation fairer or broader. So we have something that is unfair and narrow that is going to become law. That is l-a-w law and it is not going to be undone. The trouble with passing a bad law and saying `We'll fix it up later; just trust us' is that sometimes you do not get the chance. That is an unfortunate reality that many people have had to live with as a consequence of this sort of approach. We are elected to the Senate to consider legislation on its merits, not only on its merits when it suits us electorally or in terms of the electoral timetable. This legislation, on its merits, deserves to fail. It is clearly regressive and unfair. Because it is a matter of such significance and public debate, I felt it necessary to put clearly the Democrats' position on the record for the final vote on this legislation. It will obviously pass into law, because the numbers are there, but it is badly targeted. It is clearly not fair and, it should be mentioned also, is being rushed through in very quick time.</para><para>These are measures that were announced only a month ago. Coupled with the additional family tax payments that were rushed through in the last sitting week, we will have a massive injection of funds into the economy. Many economic commentators are saying that this is likely to lead to upward pressure on interest rates and is a very dubious economic responsibility. This government like to pride themselves on being economically responsible, but the fact is that a large proportion of the credit for the good economic statistics that the government continue to point to must go to the Senate, because it is the Senate that passes these measures. It is the Senate that passes the vast bulk of legislation, the vast bulk of budget measures. The government cannot have it both ways. They cannot say that the Senate is holding up their program and then, when it does not and they get good figures as a consequence, say that it is all their own work. So the Senate is able to be economically responsible, and the Democrats put a lot of importance on being economically responsible. This massive injection of funds—there are huge amounts, billions and billions, in a very short space of time—is not economically responsible. It is not equitable in any definition of the word. In our view, there has not been proper scrutiny of how that amount of public money could best be used. That is another example of poor legislation being rushed through unnecessarily quickly because it suits the political timetable of other parties. </para><para>In the last sitting week we saw Labor allow through extraordinarily quickly massive amounts of money to be spent on extra payments for family tax benefit. Within two days of it being announced in the budget, it was introduced as legislation through the House of Representatives and the Senate. As I pointed out at the time on behalf of the Democrats, that is irresponsible. But the shadow minister, Mr Swan, had the gall to go on radio and television to complain about the hidden clawback that was in that legislation that the government had so-called `snuck through'. The only reason it got through without being exposed was that it was rushed through without being looked at properly. The information that Mr Swan used to point to this so-called clawback came from Senate estimates. As I said at the time—and, indeed, attempted to do at the time—if we had simply postponed that bill until after the Senate estimates process, which is there to look at the budget, we would have found this so-called clawback and we could have fixed it up. That opportunity has been lost, and we will be lucky if it is ever fixed up. That is why we should not rush through legislation without looking at it properly. That is why we should not pass laws that we know are not as good as they could be or, in this case, are clearly not good at all. That is why the Democrats oppose it. We are disappointed that such a massively unfair tax cut is going to be put through with very little examination of its consequences and of what much better opportunities—much more effective value-for-money expenditure of this enormous amount of money—could have been put forward instead.</para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>18:01:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.</para></division.header><para>(The President—Senator the Hon.

They impose both customs and excise duties of 1c per litre for high-sulfur diesel on top of the normal rate retrospectively from 1 July 2003 and 2c a litre from 1 January 2004. The bills increase the rate of both customs and excise duties on aviation fuels by 0.306c per litre, impose both customs and excise duties on biodiesel at the normal rate of 38.143c per litre on ultralow-sulfur diesel and amend the excise tariff to enable previously paid duties to be deducted in the formula for calculating excise duty payable on ethanol-petrol blends.</para></talk.start><para>The duty rate differentials for high- as opposed to low-sulfur diesel were first announced by the Prime Minister all the way back in May 1999—last century—in what was then described as the Measures for a Better Environment package. The new duty rates will finally give effect to the government's decision to encourage the early introduction of ultralow-sulfur diesel, which will be mandated by 1 January 2006 under the Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000. Labor supports the initiatives to encourage cleaner fuels and has previously indicated its support for the changes, particularly those which encourage the early introduction of ultralow-sulfur diesel, known as ULSD. Yet again it has taken the government too long to implement them.</para><para>The government first announced these measures on 31 May 1999 and it has taken five years to get this far. Meanwhile, refiners have been living with great uncertainty—uncertainty which has largely stifled the large investment decisions needed to produce cleaner petrol and diesel. It is not only the fuel producers who have suffered as a result of the government's tardiness on these bills; consumers should have been encouraged to use low-sulfur diesel long before now. Cleaner diesel is better for the environment and better for public health, but Australia will struggle to meet its deadline for new clean fuel standards in 2006 because of the delay in the introduction of these bills into the parliament. This is just one example of the Howard government's disregard for the consumers in the fuel sector.</para><para>High petrol prices are putting financial pressure on Australian families. Most parts of this country are experiencing prices of at least $1 a litre. Of course in many regional areas, such as in my home state of Tasmania, prices are much higher. As the Treasurer has said, a big part of the problem is the war in Iraq and the instability in the Middle East—something for which this government must surely take some responsibility. High oil prices demonstrate the need for increased competition in the Australian petroleum industry to provide relief for consumers and their families. That is why Labor in government will implement a six-point plan to put downward pressure on petrol prices. </para><para>Labor will ensure that consumers continue to have access to a competitive retail petroleum market. Our six-point plan will strengthen the Trade Practices Act and give the ACCC more teeth to take action against major oil corporations and their alliance partners misusing their market power to the detriment of the market and, consequently, the detriment of the consumer. A number of reports have recommended reforms to the Trades Practices Act, but the Howard government has refused to legislate them. Only Labor is committed to stimulating competition and, in this case, delivering lower petrol prices to consumers. Further, despite government scaremongering, Labor has no intention of moving against the shopper docket scheme.</para><para>Today the Prime Minister released his long-awaited energy white paper. This white paper fails to deliver a policy which guarantees reliable, affordable and environmentally sustainable supplies of energy to all Australians. Instead, after 8½ years of drift and inaction, all the Prime Minister has produced is another short-term election fix—funding announcements on the eve of an election, most of which will not be available for two years. The Prime Minister still has his head in the sand on climate change and, unlike Labor, has no plan to address Australia's growing dependence on imported oil or the looming crisis in energy infrastructure investment. Australian households and industry face a supply and price crisis if regulatory impediments to investment are not adequately addressed and energy market planning issues are not dealt with. The Prime Minister's failure to match Labor's commitment to ratify the Kyoto protocol and to   increase the mandatory renewable energy target puts Australia on the path of an environmental crisis and perpetuates investment uncertainty for industry.</para><para>Labor supports technologies designed to allow us to burn our coal more cleanly and efficiently but it believes an equal effort needs to be made in increasing the role of renewable energy in Australia. The Prime Minister's white paper fails to deliver the correct balance. In transport fuels, Labor has supported recent initiatives to tax fuels on an energy content basis and to encourage a greater uptake of alternative fuels. Today a desperate Prime Minister turned the clock back, consigning policy to the waste bin in deference to a quick political fix. This is at a time when we are consuming oil three times faster than we are finding it, leaving us increasingly exposed to externally induced fuel price hikes.</para><para>Labor places high importance on energy efficiency and will be looking at the detail of the government's plan to ensure that it is well targeted, effective and efficient. There is a large amount of business to be undertaken in this place, and I believe we are sitting late tonight to attend to that. I will end my comments by saying that Labor supports these bills. I understand that there is to be some amendment pursued by the Democrats. Labor will be looking at that in the context of the debate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>23596</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R2019">Customs Tariff Amendment (Fuels) Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2022">Excise Tariff Amendment (Fuels) Bill 2004 </inline>will amend the Excise Act to increase the customs and excise duty rate on aviation fuel by 0.306c in order to fund the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, to introduce a differential excise and customs duty on ultralow-sulfur diesel to encourage the quicker take-up of the cleaner fuel and to impose an excise on biodiesel for the first time.</para></talk.start><para>The Democrats successfully negotiated the differential excise on ultralow-sulfur diesel with the government in 1998. We did that to encourage the take-up of ultralow-sulfur diesel. The Democrats will be supporting this initiative. Prior to our raising this issue with the government, there was no national fuel standard for diesel fuel in Australia—with the sulfur levels in diesel many times higher than those allowable in Europe and other parts of the world. In addition to introducing a fuel standard, there were a number of other measures which encouraged the use of alternative fuels such as biodiesel. There are great benefits in moving to low-sulfur diesel. Of course all diesel now is low sulfur, but there is an opportunity through this differential to encourage petroleum companies to move to ultralow-sulfur diesel, which has been called for by the truck and auto manufacturing sector for some time. </para><para>The legislation also deals with the introduction of customs duty and excise on biodiesel. Biodiesel is a renewable fuel which can be produced from vegetable oil or other organic matter. It can be blended with petrodiesel or used on its own to power diesel engines. Biodiesel burns more cleanly than petrodiesel, producing less harmful particulate emissions than low-sulfur diesel and, because it is renewable, it does not contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Prior to the 2001 election, the government set a production target for biofuels of 350 megalitres by 2010 and agreed not to impose excise on biofuels. The Democrats, along with the industry, were very disappointed when, in the 2003 budget, it was announced that there would be an excise imposed on this clean and renewable fuel. The government has been collecting excise on biodiesel since September last year, and the passage of these bills will provide legislative backing for that collection of revenue.</para><para>We believe that biofuels, together with other alternative fuels such as natural gas and LPG, should be excise free. We believe that this would provide a competitive advantage to alternative fuels and encourage the take-up of those fuels in the marketplace. This has been demonstrated by the successful uptake of LPG as a transport fuel, particularly by the taxi sector of the transport market, in many parts of the country. This was a debate that we had with the government last year. However, the government has indicated that it will not back down from its decision to impose a new tax on clean fuels, and the ALP has indicated its willingness to support the government's stand. Recognising that the new tax would be introduced with the support of both major parties, we did manage to negotiate an extension of three years to the time frame for the payment of cleaner fuel grants on alternative fuels so that now they will be in place until 2011 and they will be phased out over a five-year period until 2016, which is effectively an excise break for the alternative fuels industry. We would like to have seen a much longer time frame for the grant, but this was all the government was prepared to give. That was very disappointing in the light of the government's previous commitment to not tax alternative fuels.</para><para>As some senators in this place may be aware, biodiesel is relatively easy to produce. It can be produced by people in their own backyards using raw ingredients. Many Australians, both in the cities and in regional areas, do so. There are a great many people who enthusiastically produce the fuel to power their own vehicles—diesel powered four-wheel drives or farm machinery. Under the proposed legislation, these hobby producers or small-scale backyard producers who produce biodiesel for their own use will also be subject to the excise, and that involves imposing a very costly and onerous testing regime and licensing requirement on those people. That is unrealistic for people who are producing fuels for their own use. In order to obtain a licence, producers have to have the fuels tested, and testing a single batch of biodiesel can cost many hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars—and often backyard biodiesel production is around the 50-litre mark. </para><para>Requiring hobby producers to meet these requirements will force them to either stop making this renewable fuel and driving their cars on what is an environmentally sound fuel that is often made from recycled oil, sometimes fish and chip oil, and instead use fossil fuel petrodiesel or—as some will no doubt choose to do—continue with their hobby, break the law and produce biodiesel regardless. The Democrats will be moving amendments to the Excise Tariff Amendment (Fuels) Bill which will seek to exempt the non-commercial production of biodiesel for personal use from that excise. Those amendments will be modelled on provisions in the Excise Tariff Act which exempt home-brew beer from this excise.</para><para>As Senator O'Brien has said, the Prime Minister's statement today on energy was a disappointment. The Prime Minister talks about energy security, but his idea of energy security is how well our infrastructure is secured against terrorism. I think he misses the point here because energy security is about security of supply, not about the security of something we have already got. As we all know, it is the case that fuel supply will peak in the next few years, and peaking means that you cannot keep increasing consumption, which is what we are currently doing worldwide.</para><para>The Democrats would argue that you also cannot sit back and rely on exploration which might find petroleum very much deeper than most of the reserves we currently tap into, which makes it difficult and expensive to extract. And you cannot rely on sources such as shale. The shale oil mine in Central Queensland has struggled to produce oil from shale. The problem is that it is very expensive to, firstly, dig out of the ground and, secondly, crush, heat and extract the oil from. So we cannot possibly look at a sustainable greenhouse future that depends on such very greenhouse intensive and costly sources of energy.</para><para>It is important that we promote fuels like biodiesel and it is a great shame that the government proposes to impose an excise on biodiesel in this bill. We accept that agreement has been struck with the opposition and that we have lost the debate to not have excise imposed on biodiesel. To some extent we are going to have to live with that, but small-scale biodiesel producers will be the losers out of this. In fact, those who write to me have told me already that they will not continue to produce biodiesel. Not only will this be a problem for emissions and the use of cleaner fuels but it will mean that a waste product which is currently going to landfill—or whatever other destiny is currently available to fish and chip oil—will not be recycled and used effectively as a transport fuel.</para><para>We will be moving to exempt small-scale producers from this measure. As I have indicated, it can be very costly to do the testing. That is one of the main reasons for wanting this exemption, but obviously the government is not going to gain very much from collecting an excise from people who produce 50 litres of biodiesel on an irregular—or even on a regular—basis. It seems to me that, as long as they are not selling this on and they are not a commercial producer, they should not be caught up in the excise regime and that there is also a good argument for them not having to test their product. The Democrats will be supporting these bills, but I do hope to persuade honourable senators to support my amendment, which has been circulated. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>23599</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The amendments contained in this bill have been previously tabled as the excise tariff proposals. The proposals now require incorporation in the Excise Tariff Act. This bill contains three government initiatives: the introduction of excise differentials between diesel with high sulfur content and ultralow-sulfur diesel, an increase in excise duty rates for aviation fuels and the imposition of an excise duty on biodiesel.</para></talk.start><para>The excise differential for high-sulfur and ultralow-sulfur diesel is part of the government's Measures for a Better Environment package to encourage the production and use of cleaner fuels. The production cost for ultralow-sulfur diesel is higher than for high-sulfur diesel. Without the differential, ultralow-sulfur diesel would be uncompetitive in the marketplace, as users generally regard high- and ultralow-sulfur diesel as interchangeable and would not be prepared to incur the additional cost of ultralow-sulfur diesel. The imposition of an excise differential is intended to even up the price between high-sulfur diesel and ultralow-sulfur diesel and reduce the price disincentive for the production of ultralow-sulfur diesel. The bill amends the Excise Tariff Act to incorporate the excise differentials for high-sulfur diesel and similar products with high-sulfur content that may be used as diesel substitutes.</para><para>An increase in duty on aviation fuels is required to provide supplementary funding for the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, CASA. The duty on aviation fuels provide a substantial proportion of funding for CASA, which is estimated to receive 11 per cent less than the forecast revenue due to reduced worldwide demand for air travel, cessation of Ansett operations and the introduction of larger and more fuel-efficient aircraft. The increase in duty will ensure that CASA is adequately resourced to continue its safety regulatory responsibilities and maintain Australia's enviable aviation safety record.</para><para>The imposition of excise duty on biodiesel was announced by the government in the 2003-04 federal budget as part of the government's broader fuel tax reform arrangements that bring all currently untaxed fuels into the excise and customs duty systems. The reform establishes a broad, sustainable taxation framework, providing increased certainty for investors as well as establishing a fairer and more transparent fuel excise system with improved competitive neutrality between fuels. On 16 December 2003 the Prime Minister announced the final excise duty rates for fuels. Biodiesel will receive a discount of 50 per cent on the usual excise rate. The discount was set having regard to a range of industry, regional and other factors. Grants are provided under the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme for the production of biodiesel fuels and biodiesel fuel blends. These grants will offset the excise duty, effectively providing an excise-free rate for biodiesel until 1 July 2011. After 1 July 2011 the grants will be reduced by five even annual instalments until the final excise duty rate for biodiesel—19.1c per litre, half the rate applying to conventional fuels—is reached on 1 July 2015. Grants are similarly provided for imported biodiesel to offset customs duty. Complementary changes to customs legislation are being addressed through the Customs Tariff Amendment (Fuels) Bill 2004.</para><para>Having regard to the time of the evening, I will not at this stage respond to Senator Allison other than to indicate that the government is not disposed to support her foreshadowed amendment. I will elaborate on the reasons at a later time in the evening.

It would allow those non-commercial producers of biodiesel to make biodiesel without the need to pay the excise, which is a lesser problem to those producers, I might say, than the problem of testing the fuels they make in order to ensure that they comply with the fuel standards.</para><para>I want to read some of the correspondence from the many people who have written and asked for us to act on this. We have heard that many have already stopped production. This is a great pity for them personally because it means they are no longer likely to drive their vehicles using this cleaner fuel, but it also takes away an opportunity for recycling oil to produce biodiesel. It is simply financially unviable to produce biodiesel for your own use under the proposed system.</para><para>Another argument that is often put is that the revenue that will be collected will be minuscule. It is estimated that 2,000 to 3,000 people currently produce diesel at home or in some other location for their own personal use. Many of them have already dropped out of that production. I visited a commercial organisation in Melbourne last year and talked with them about what would be needed for them to have their biodiesel tested. They use it on the trucks they run. They are not interested in making biodiesel commercially. They were doing the right thing insofar as improving fuel emissions and benefiting the environment but they were seriously questioning whether it was useful for them to do so.</para><para>Many said that we should be encouraging the most economical and renewable fuel, and that includes biofuels. Typically some asked that we not provide any unnecessary barriers to the successful culture. Another said that from an ethical, environmental, economical, technical and social perspective they could not find any good arguments for placing an excise on a small group of home producers who intend to use the product for themselves and not for sale. Many more indicated that biofuel producers will simply stop doing what they are doing. </para><para>I know it is likely that a couple of arguments will be put as to why this should not proceed. One of them is safety—that is, if these producers were not caught up in the federal system, the Commonwealth would be concerned about occupational health and safety issues. But it is my understanding that the state governments are responsible for compliance with occupational health and safety and that both the occupational health and safety laws and the dangerous goods laws would ensure that producers would not be in a position where what they were doing was dangerous or would somehow disadvantage them.</para><para>Newcastle, as always, is leading the pack, as it were, on environment initiatives, and the Newcastle City Council web site talks about that. The council has just been awarded $100,000 from the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority which will fund Australia's first alternative fuels project using biodiesel. This biodiesel will come from restaurants in the Newcastle area and will then be used by the Newcastle City Council vehicles. That initiative will reduce the council's greenhouse gas emissions and its reliance on fossil fuels as well as produce a financial saving of approximately $30,000 each year through reduced maintenance costs. They point out that international experience suggests that biodiesel has been proven to produce lower emissions of particles than diesel. That project is to be tested under Australian conditions by the RTA, the Roads and Traffic Authority.</para><para>The point I wish to make is that there is no good reason for discouraging the production of biodiesel. There is no reason in terms of occupational health and safety or dangerous goods; there is also no good argument from an economic point of view. Two or three thousand producers of perhaps 50 litres each over a short period of time would not appear to me to be a major problem in terms of loss of revenue from this source. In fact, today we saw the most massive handout of tax revenue from the energy industry given back to truck drivers and to the petroleum industry. This would pale into total insignificance by comparison with that $1.2 billion, which is being handed back by way of excise reductions for petrofuels and fuels which are fossil fuels.</para><para>I would strongly urge the minister to consider this question. It is hard to see that there would be any reason, other than occupational health and safety and dangerous goods, which might reasonably be put up as a barrier. Certainly, it is not an economic consideration, because these producers are going to go out of business anyway; they are not going to bother producing biodiesel if this exemption is not agreed to. As I said, it is hard to imagine that there would be any reason for not supporting it.</para><para>On the point of whether or not this is dangerous, as I understand it, the Army is currently interested in using biodiesel. The reason for doing so is that it has a higher flashpoint, which means that it is much safer for use in Army exercises than ordinary diesel. There are many applications which could be adopted. There are a very broad range of environmental benefits including cleaning up used oil, whether it is fish and chip oil or some other kind of oil, in the production. As I have said, there seems to me to be no real reason for putting any sort of barrier in the place of home production, such as the need to comply with the standards or to pay the excise.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>23601</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to make a brief response to Senator Allison. I appreciate Senator Allison's rationale and careful explanation of the basis on which she has made the request that is currently being considered. I want to very briefly put on the record the government's position. The government's announcement of the application of excise duty on biodiesel as part of broader fuel tax reform in the 2003-04 federal budget did not include an excise exemption for the production of biodiesel for personal use. The excise status for small-scale biodiesel production in the government's view cannot be compared with the excise treatment of, for example, home brewed beer. A more valid comparison is to other fuels that compete with biodiesel, such as conventional diesel, and it should be noted that there is no exemption for non-commercial, small-scale production of conventional fuels. But, in any event, even within the production of excisable alcohol the exemption is for home brewed beer only, whereas unlicensed distillation of spirits is, of course, illegal. </para></talk.start><para>The lack of an exemption in the case of biodiesel accords with the general principle that excisable fuel production is subject to the provisions of the excise-licensing regime, in which the criteria to be satisfied are normally directed to commercial-scale production. Moreover, it is consistent with the government's active implementation of fuel standards for conventional fuels that are directed towards minimising emissions. Fuel standards are in place for diesel, petrol and LPG as well as biodiesel. It is not certain—indeed, it is unlikely—that small-scale biodiesel production by non-commercial parties would consistently produce fuel that satisfies the required fuel standards. Additionally, small-scale, non-commercial manufacture of biodiesel is, in the government's view, not desirable because of the hazardous nature of the chemicals involved in biodiesel production, by which I mean, methanol, potassium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide—that is, caustic soda. Briefly, those are the reasons why the government is not agreeable to the request, although I acknowledge Senator Allison's longstanding interest in this and I have listened carefully to the basis on which she has put forward her request.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>23602</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The opposition, I am advised, was not given much notice about this proposed amendment and has had a limited amount of time in which consider it. I note that the amendment talks of biodiesel which has been produced for non-commercial purposes using non-commercial facilities. I am advised that there is no definition in the legislation as to what the term `non-commercial' means. That being the case, it would seem that non-commercial might be taken to mean `not produced for sale'. It might mean `not produced for use in a business' and non-commercial facilities might or might not mean `facilities run by a business where the diesel is produced only for the use of that business'. So there would be some uncertainty in the provision as it is proposed in that sense.</para></talk.start><para>The other issue that arises, in terms of the intent of the legislation to exempt this fuel from the testing regime, is that it provides an escape from what I understood to be a fairly generally accepted policy—that cleaner fuels relied upon appropriate standards being adopted across the spectrum for fuels used in our environment. One can make assumptions about where biodiesel might be used, but those would only be assumptions. The fact of the matter is that the fuel used in vehicles may be a matter for the owner of the vehicle for the time they own the vehicle, but if that has an impact on the life cycle of the vehicle, even after it has passed from that owner to another owner, then there are consumer and consumer protection issues relating to that vehicle which ought to be understood in the context of this legislation with regard to, obviously, the on sale of it. </para><para>The question of dealing with hazardous materials and general safety matters was touched upon by Senator Allison in her contribution but also by the minister in relation to the significantly dangerous substances used in the manufacture. Given the time in which we have been required to consider this amendment, we are not satisfied that the passage of this amendment will not lead to a development of manufacturing facilities using these dangerous substances in circumstances that might be injurious to the environment or certainly to those who might come into contact with or live nearby production facilities. Given that they are not commercial, does that imply that this would be a facility which might or might not be near residences?</para><para>These questions may be able to be answered. Indeed, there may be an answer to the question of how much revenue would be forgone in this measure, but I have not heard the answer to that yet. In the circumstances, Labor would prefer to give fuller, more detailed consideration to the proposition which is being advanced. Rather than deal with it in the context of this debate on short notice and without a detailed examination, Labor propose not to support the amendment. We will be giving consideration to all of those ramifications in our policy considerations, if indeed we have time to do so.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>23603</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I ask the minister whether it is her expectation that small-scale producers will cease to produce biodiesel with the passage of this legislation.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>23603</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Clearly, if they are going to proceed it will be illegal.

Senator O'Brien, I do not want to get into an argument about timing, but it is my understanding that we let your office know some time ago that this was the intent and the direction in which we were moving. There may be a problem with definitions. I am not sure if that is the case. We took the best advice that was available to us at the time. I do not think we should be concerned about what happens to those people who live next door to people who are producing biodiesel. People are out there producing biodiesel, and presumably they need to have some planning permission from either their local government or their state government in order to do that. In any case, this legislation is not about planning. Paying excise does not give you a guaranteed capacity to make biodiesel wherever you are or wherever you want to. So that is really not an issue that needs to concern us, I would argue.</para></talk.start><para>The idea of not supporting this for consumer protection reasons is an interesting one, because I do not think there is any real evidence—not that I have seen, anyway—that biodiesel use in vehicles somehow weakens them or damages them in a way that an ongoing new owner might be unsuspecting of so that they suddenly find they have got a lemon on their hands. Again, state laws have roadworthy tests and the like that would identify that. So it is disappointing. I think this is the end for a number of quite enthusiastic producers of biodiesel. They see that they are doing the right thing by the environment in recycling oil.</para><para>It is also surprising that we would think that the product that they produce is likely to be somehow inferior. In fact, they would have every reason to make sure that the standard was such that it suited their vehicle and that it was the best that it possibly could be. I have no guarantee of that, but it seems to me that we are throwing the baby out with the bathwater, because to encourage this enthusiastic group to keep doing what they are doing seems to me to be very sensible and to not have too many downsides. It is disappointing that the government do not care whether or not they are out there doing this and that it will proceed with this legislation to bring them into the fuel standards, which guarantees that they cannot keep doing what they have been doing, because the costs of testing are so very high that it could never make it viable unless they were doing it for a very altruistic reason and were prepared to hand over huge amounts of money to a testing agency and the tax office. So it is disappointing. I am sorry that both the government and the opposition have come to that conclusion. </para><para>Question negatived.</para><para>Bills agreed to.</para><para>Bills reported; report adopted.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>23604</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Senator COONAN (New South Wales—Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (7.53 p.m.)—I move:</para><motion><para>That these bills be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bills read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>POSTAL SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>23604</page.no><id.no>R1802</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title><page.no>23604</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Consideration resumed.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Watson, John (The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN)</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Watson)</inline>—The committee is considering message No. 598 of the House of Representatives relating to the <inline ref="R1802">Postal Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline>.

I preface my remarks by restating that Labor remain opposed to the bill. This is because the provisions deregulating certain aspects of Australia Post's reserved service remain in the bill. Labor previously sought to remove these provisions in the Senate but was defeated by the coalition and the Democrats. With regard to the House's message, the government has rejected Labor's amendments (6) to (8). Labor moved Senate amendments (6), (7) and (8) to strengthen the Auditor-General's postal monitoring role. We wanted a stronger consumer focus in that role.</para></talk.start><para>It is a pity that the House has not agreed to these amendments. The government is saying the ACA must have this role, but the ACA as we know it will not exist in a few years. The government should have agreed to these amendments to improve consumer outcomes in postal services, but this government is really only interested in deregulating Australia Post's reserved service. It is rejecting these amendments that would have improved the monitoring of Australia Post by the Auditor-General. We will insist on the amendments, despite the government's attempts to defeat them. The government has, however, agreed to an amended version of the Democrats' amendment imposing a strict penalty regime on persons infringing Australia Post's reserved service. We supported this amendment, but we note that the Democrats only moved this because, by and large, they felt guilty about voting with the government to partially deregulate Australia Post's existing level of reserved service. As was stated in the previous debate on this bill, deregulating aspects of Australia Post's reserved service is just not on for Labor. Labor remain committed to Australia Post remaining in full public ownership with its current level of reserved service intact. </para><para>The Democrats have tried to argue in the debate on this bill that the deregulatory measures in the bill simply formalise existing arrangements made by Labor. This is not true. This bill extends the exceptions to Australia Post's reserved service beyond what was originally legislated by Labor. The bill allows aggregators to pick up mail from their customers legally for the first time. It also allows document exchange centres to pick up and receive mail from their customers legally for the first time. This allows Australia Post's competitors to get closer to an end-to-end service that excludes Australia Post. Just because Australia Post and the government were not enforcing the existing reserved service does not make that legal. The Democrats have been sucked in by the government's claim that this section was legitimising existing practices. Again, this is a false claim. The government is making legal practices which are, in fact, currently illegal.</para><para>The Democrats are set today to again vote with the government to pass this bill which partially deregulates Australia Post's existing level of reserved service. We will remind them of this, of course, up until the next election; so, I suspect, will the Greens. Australia Post's reserved service enables Australia Post to provide all Australians with a decent standard letter service at a uniform price. Labor support this policy absolutely. We do not support the gradual deregulation of Australia Post's reserved service by stealth. And we do not support the government's attempts to deregulate and ultimately privatise Australia Post. Labor still oppose this bill regardless of the fact that some otherwise worthwhile amendments are contained in it. Labor will never support the deregulation or the ultimate privatisation of Australia Post.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>23605</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Australian Democrats will be supporting the motion moved by the government. We will not be insisting on the amendments which were moved on the last occasion the bill was before the Senate and we will be supporting the substitute amendment which has been proposed by the government in place of the amendment we originally moved. I wish to state quite clearly exactly what the final package that has been agreed to as a result of these amendments is. There are a number of clarifications of the boundaries of the exemptions to the reserved business provisions which were already in the act and which were put into the act by the previous, Labor, government more than 10 years ago. The clarifications relate primarily to the issue of picking up and delivering mail through aggregated services and document exchanges. The fundamental issue, of whether there should be aggregated services or document exchanges in the first place, was a matter decided by the previous, Labor, government.</para></talk.start><para>The issue of pick up and delivery is a very small adjunct; it simply clarifies the boundaries of that service. From all the best evidence we have received, we believe it is not a threat to Australia Post's business and Australia Post believes it will not significantly impact on its services in the future. Indeed, all the evidence suggests that Australia Post has been quite forceful in defending its reserve business powers, and I am very pleased that the government has agreed to an amendment to ensure that where there are breaches of the reserve powers of Australia Post there is a pecuniary penalty in addition to the civil penalties provided by the act. This brings the postal services legislation in line with the telecommunications services legislation, which already has a provision allowing for pecuniary penalties in the case of breaches of marketing arrangements. </para><para>I note that this legislation includes the provisions already agreed to by the Senate which give the ACCC a monitoring role for the first time in respect of the pricing of Australia Post. I am pleased the government has dropped its insistence that there be an additional monitoring role for the Australian Communications Authority. It was our firm view that the monitoring role proposed for the Australian Communications Authority was a waste of money. It would have cost an estimated $3 million, which was an impost by a regulator which, in our view, has not sufficiently been regulating telecommunications services and was not going to value add significantly in the area of postal services.</para><para>I am disappointed tonight that the government did not accept the amendments which were proposed by the opposition on the last occasion which were at least to expand the monitoring role of the Auditor-General. However, as a result of this legislation we will maintain the status quo, which is that the Auditor-General will continue the role of monitoring the performance of Australia Post. I reject the assertion by the government, in its message from the House, which says that the Auditor-General only audits—an argument which was made by the minister on a previous occasion. The Auditor-General has a much broader role than auditing and in the modern world performance auditing is a role which takes in a whole range of performance functions way beyond the issue of financial auditing. From that point of view, the status quo of the role of the Auditor-General is, in my view, a much preferable position to the position of providing a whole new cumbersome bureaucracy through the ACA. From that point of view, the Democrats will be supporting the government's proposals on this occasion by not insisting on the amendments with respect to enhancing the role of the Auditor-General. We believe the Auditor-General has been doing a very good job to date. If the government does not want the role enhanced, then frankly it is not up to the Senate to insist on that role being enhanced.</para><para>For the record, I should declare a small interest in that I have worked as a mail sorter on many summer holidays. My father was a country postmaster for over 28 years. As a result, I have a lot of emotional attachment to Australia Post. I am confident that this bill we are passing tonight will not result in a watering down of Australia Post services, but the Democrats will certainly be monitoring it. We opposed the deregulation bill when it was first proposed for Australia Post in 2000. We do not support the deregulation of Australia Post beyond this clarification of the existing reserve business powers and we certainly put the government on notice that we will be monitoring very carefully how this bill operates in practice to ensure that this is not used as any sort of vehicle for further deregulation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>23606</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Monitoring does not stop the process from happening and once the legislation goes through this process of attrition of the protection of Australia Post will continue.

I want to make a few brief comments in the chamber's consideration of amendments made by the House of Representatives to the <inline ref="R1802">Postal Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline>. As earlier speakers have noted, the House of Representatives has rejected Senate amendments Nos 6, 7 and 8 which proposed enhancements to the role of the Auditor-General. The government was keen to improve the level of monitoring of the quality of service of Australia Post and, as a result, to increase consumer confidence in the operations of Australia Post. The opposition and the Democrats—perhaps it is due to my lack of familiarity with this bill—do not appear to have persuasively articulated in a way which can be readily followed why they have decided not to support the proposed consumer focused role for the Australian Communications Authority, the ACA. It is thought by the government that Senate amendments Nos 6, 7 and 8 are a poor attempt by Labor to try and make up for the fact that they do not support the government's proposals to give an enhanced quality of service monitoring role to the ACA, and those amendments were appropriately rejected by the House. I want to make a couple of comments clear. The government believes that there is an important consumer focused monitoring role that the ACA could have performed. However, the government will not let politics continue to get in the way of this bill and is certainly not prepared to let the opposition hold up the otherwise important reforms in the bill that the Senate has decided to support.</para></talk.start><para>The House has also rejected Senate amendment (9), which provided an additional mechanism in the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989—the APC Act—to regulate breaches of Australia Post's reserved services and has replaced it with a similar amendment in which a minor legal drafting issue was addressed. The House's amendment does not change the government's objectives or intentions or the operation of the bill. It clarifies legal uncertainty arising from the drafting of the Senate amendment and provides consistency of drafting and interpretation of the reserved service infringement provisions in the APC Act. The amendment is not expected, therefore, to have any significant impact on either Commonwealth expenditure or revenue. While the government is disappointed that the opposition has obstructed the passage of many of the important consumer protection reforms in this bill, we are determined to get on with the business of reform in this area and look forward to the Senate passing the bill now in its amended form.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Resolution reported; report adopted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2004 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>23607</page.no><id.no>R1988</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>23607</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 8 March, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ellison</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>23607</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1988">Tax Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 1) Bill 2004</inline> introduces a range of new measures. Labor supported the bill in the other place but referred schedules 7, 10 and 11 to the Senate Economics Committee for further consideration. These schedules deal with charities and Labor wanted to further investigate their effect on the charitable sector and the integrity of the tax system. While Labor continues to have some reservations about these schedules in the bill, on balance it will support the bill in its entirety. </para></talk.start><para>Schedule 1 of the bill extends eligibility for the medical expenses tax offset to include the cost of maintaining properly trained dogs for guiding or assisting people with a disability. The medical expenses offset provides a tax offset of 20 per cent of eligible medical expenses over a $1,500 threshold. While the cost of maintaining guide dogs for the blind is already eligible to be a tax offset, this amendment will extend eligibility to hearing and other disability guide dogs. This is an equitable extension to eligibility for the offset and will provide much needed support for people with disabilities in the community.</para><para>Schedule 2 of the bill will provide an income tax deduction for certain expenses incurred in travel between workplaces. Prior to a decision of the High Court in 2001, Commissioner of Taxation v. Payne [2001] HCA, it was understood by the ATO and taxpayers that such a deduction was allowable. However, the High Court held that the cost of travel between two separate workplaces was not tax deductible. The amendments will ensure that where an employee is travelling directly between two workplaces the cost of that travel is deductible, for example, the cost of travel between a full-time job during the day to a part-time job in the evening.</para><para>Schedule 3 of the bill will ensure that small business do not become ineligible for the small business capital gains tax concessions because deductible gift recipients are beneficiaries of a discretionary trust controlled by that small business. Under the new capital gains tax rules, small businesses must have assets of less than $5 million to be eligible for concessional treatment, including the 50 per cent active asset reduction, the 15-year asset exemption and the retirement exemption and rollover relief. This asset test includes the assets of trusts which are deemed to be controlled by small business. If a discretionary trust lists a charity or a deductible gift recipient as a beneficiary, they are viewed as controlling that charity and assets of the charity are included in the assets of the small business, possibly denying the business access to the capital gains tax concessions. The proposed amendments will ensure that the assets of the charity or deductible gift recipient which is a beneficiary of a discretionary trust are not included in the asset test to determine eligibility for a small business CGT concession. In addition, the amendments will ensure that the determination of whether a trust is controlled by a small business is based on actual distributions, not on simply being a beneficiary.</para><para>Schedule 4 of the bill makes changes to the transitional arrangements in place for the move from the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme and the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme to the new Energy Grants (Credit) Scheme. On 1 July 2003 the Energy Grants (Credit) Scheme will replace the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme and the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme. To facilitate the transition to the EGCS a credit could be claimed for fuel purchased in the three years before its introduction under the EGCS rather than under the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme and Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme. As a consequence, individuals can make claims under the transitional EGCS that did not exist under previous schemes. For example, the use of diesel to generate electricity in a retail or hospitality business without access to grid power became eligible under the DFRS on 1 July 2002. Under the transitional EGCS such activity would be eligible from 1 July 2000. The proposed amendment will ensure that fuel purchases are only eligible under the transitional EGCS arrangements where they were also eligible under either the DFRS or the DAFGS. The amendment will act retrospectively to include the recovery of claims lodged before the amendment is passed. </para><para>Schedule 5 of this bill deals with the cost base of assets for capital gains tax purposes and the impact of the GST. Capital gains and losses are calculated with reference to the cost of the asset when it is acquired—the cost base. The cost base also takes into account any subsequent expenditure or alterations to the asset which have the net effect of increasing or decreasing the value of the asset: for example, renovating a rental property.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator Murray</name></talker><para>—Don't let us keep you up, Nick.

I think that my voice might survive it. Due to oversights in amendments to the capital gains tax provisions at the time the new tax system was introduced the value of net input tax credits are included in the cost base of assets in certain circumstances: for example, to renovations post-September 1999. This inflates the cost base of assets, minimising capital gains and maximising capital losses. The proposed amendment would ensure that net input tax credits are never included in the cost base of an asset, which will make sure taxpayers do not receive a windfall gain from this oversight.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Schedule 6 will ensure that Australian business numbers can be disclosed to the heads of Commonwealth agencies and state and territory departments in respect of all agency and department functions. Regulations already allow for this, but it is uncertain whether these regulations are watertight and would hold up to a challenge in the courts. The amendments will simplify compliance for business as they will not have to provide their ABN to every government department they have dealings with.</para><para>Schedule 7 provides a new income tax deduction for contributions related to fundraising events where the donor receives a benefit. Under the current law and consistent with general tax principles, no deduction is allowed where the individual receives any personal benefit. This amendment will allow donors a tax deduction for contributions to charities where they receive a benefit in return. For example, individuals could claim a deduction for the cost of entry to a charity dinner. As political parties are not deductible gift recipients, it will not apply to these functions. While these amendments are contrary to basic tax principles, Labor considers that the limits placed on eligible contributions provide significant safeguards to ensure that the integrity of the tax system is not jeopardised.</para><para>Schedule 8 of the bill deals with distributions to certain entities. When the Board of Taxation conveniently recommended that the government not proceed with its promise to tax trusts like companies, it also recommended amendments to section 109UB of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. These amendments aim to ensure that a trustee cannot shelter income in a discretionary trust at the company tax rate through creating a present entitlement to a private company without paying that entitlement and then distributing the underlying cash to a beneficiary, usually through a loan payment or forgiven debt. This practice means that the income is only ever taxed at the company tax rate and not the beneficiary's marginal tax rate, creating an obvious tax advantage. The current law deems that loans in these circumstances are treated as dividends and therefore taxed at the beneficiary's marginal tax rate. The amendments in this bill would include a payment from the trust or forgiven debt in the same way as loans are currently treated.</para><para>The Senate should note that this amendment is necessary only because of the complete lack of backbone of the Howard-Costello government in relation to tackling tax abuse issues. After accepting the Ralph review's recommendations to tax trusts like companies, the Howard-Costello government performed a 2001 election backflip. This was after the Treasurer had given a signed undertaking to the shadow Treasurer to implement measures contained in the review of business taxation which would have ensured that the government's business tax reforms were revenue neutral. </para><para>Section 46FA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 provides certain resident companies a deduction for nonpayment of certain unfranked or partly franked non-portfolio dividends to their wholly owned foreign parents. Schedule 9 reinstates this deduction because it was inadvertently made inoperative when the intercorporate dividend rebate was repealed as part of the consolidation reforms.</para><para>Schedule 10 requires public benevolent institutions and health promotion charities to be endorsed by the Commissioner of Taxation to access relevant tax concessions. The amendments are in response to recommendations of the report of the inquiry into the definition of charities and related organisations. Following concerns raised by Labor about the loss of PBI status by a number of organisations, the government has provided transitional relief in the budget. Labor welcomes this. It is another government backflip and it will ensure that workers in crucial sectors do not face substantial drops in income. The amendments will require public benevolent institutions and health promotion charities to be endorsed by the commissioner in order to access all relevant taxation concessions such as income tax, GST and FBT relief. The organisations will be required to display their charitable status on the Australian Business Register.</para><para>Finally, schedule 11 of the bill seeks to specifically list three organisations in the tax law as deductible gift recipients. Donations and contributions for deductible gift recipients over $2 provide the donor with an income tax deduction. Organisations that do not meet the general requirements in the tax law can be specifically listed as deductible gift recipients. Schedule 11 of the bill seeks to specifically list in legislation the Dunn and Lewis Youth Development Foundation Ltd from 10 November 2003 to 9 November 2005, Crime Stoppers South Australia Inc. from 19 September 2003 and the Country Education Foundation of Australia Ltd from 20 August 2003. In addition, the specific listing of the Bowral Vietnam Memorial Walk Trust will be extended until 16 August 2005. With those comments I indicate that the Labor Party will be supporting the bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>23610</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak to the <inline ref="R1988">Tax Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 1) Bill 2004</inline>. This is another 64 pages of taxation legislation. It is an omnibus bill covering a range of largely non-controversial areas. The 11 schedules to this bill are as follows. Schedule 1 will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to broaden the list of eligible medical expenses under the medical expenses tax offset to include payments made in maintaining properly trained dogs for guiding or assisting people with a disability. Schedule 2 will amend the income tax law to provide an income tax deduction for certain expenses incurred in travel between workplaces following a recent tax case which has challenged the long accepted deductibility of such travel. Schedule 3 will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to improve the operation of the test that is used to determine when an entity controls a discretionary trust for the purpose of applying the small business capital gains tax concessions.  </para></talk.start><para>Schedule 4 will amend the transitional arrangements of the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme which deal with the treatment of claims for fuel purchased in the three years preceding the introduction of the scheme. The changes will rectify an anomaly that may result in an unintended entitlement to concessional treatment in certain circumstances under the energy grants scheme that did not previously exist in the schemes that it replaces. Schedule 5 will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act to ensure that GST net input tax credits are excluded from the reduced cost base and other relevant amounts used for the purposes of working out the amount of a capital gain or capital loss. </para><para>Schedule 6 will amend the A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999 to put beyond doubt the scope of the purposes for which protected Australian business number information is able to be disclosed to Commonwealth agency heads and states and territories' department heads. Schedule 7 will amend the income tax law to provide an income tax deduction for contributions of cash or property to deductible gift recipients where a minor benefit is received in return. Schedule 8 will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to ensure that a trustee cannot shelter trust income at the prevailing company tax rate by creating a present entitlement to a private company without paying it and then distributing the underlying cash to a shareholder of the company. The rules replace the former section 109UB of the Income Tax Assessment Act that had a similar but more limited application. </para><para>Schedule 9 will amend part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to ensure a deduction available to certain resident companies for on-payments for certain unfranked or partly franked non-portfolio dividends of their wholly owned foreign parents continues to be available to taxpayers. This deduction was inadvertently made inoperative with the removal of the intercorporate dividend rebate within wholly owned companies in connection with the introduction of the consolidated regime applying generally after 30 June 2003. Schedule 10 will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to require charities, including public benevolent institutions and health promotion charities, to be endorsed by the commissioner in order to access all relevant taxation concessions. The amendments in schedule 10 will also require any charities so endorsed to display their charitable status on the Australian Business Register. Schedule 11 will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to update the specifically listed deductible gift recipients.</para><para>This bill was examined by the Senate Economics Committee, on which I sit, and the contentious schedules examined were 7, 10 and 11. Schedule 7 allows a tax deduction for the net amount of a tax deduction above $250, where the value of any minor benefit received is no more than the lesser of 10 per cent of the donation or $100. For example, if the Cancer Council has a fundraising dinner for which it charges $500 and the actual cost of the dinner is $50, a tax deduction will be available for the remaining $450. Evidence provided was that this concession was too limited to be of any real benefit to most charities. As noted in our minority report to the Senate committee, the Democrats believe that that $250 represents too high a threshold for ordinary Australians to contribute to charities even if they are getting a tax deduction.</para><para>Schedule 10 expands the requirements for charities to be endorsed by the Taxation Office. Currently, to obtain an income tax exemption or deductible gift recipient status, the charity must obtain endorsement by the ATO. This bill will extend the endorsement to claims of GST concessions and, more importantly, the fringe benefits tax concessions available to PBIs. Due to the fact that a vast range of charities have been self-assessing as PBIs for a long time, the endorsement requirement may cause considerable angst for the sector. The Treasurer announced in a budget release that, despite conducting a Board of Taxation inquiry, the government had decided to walk away from codifying the charities definition inquiry recommendations. The government has amended the bill so that it applies from 1 July 2005, not the original 1 July 2004, but we see this as simply deferring the inevitable confusion within the sector. In the Senate Economics Committee, ACOSS stated that it was opposed to schedule 10 on the basis that it would deepen the concern and confusion surrounding the definitions of `charitable' and `public benevolent' status. My colleague Senator Cherry has been working extensively on this issue for several years, and he and I have tried hard in this area of charities. </para><para>The issue of schedule 11 involved the potential for tax abuse via donations to the Country Education Foundation. Evidence given before the committee was that this would not be possible. The Democrats support the bill, but I have recorded our reservations with reference to schedules 7 and 10.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>23612</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank Senator Sherry and Senator Murray for their contribution and for their indication of support. The <inline ref="R1988">Tax Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 1) Bill 2004</inline> provides a tax deduction for contributions of cash or property to deductible gift recipients where an associated minor benefit is received. I intend to highlight some of the main features of the omnibus bill. Currently, a personal tax deduction under the income tax law is only allowed for gifts to deductible gift recipients—that is, where the donor does not derive any material advantage or benefit in return for the gift. The amendment provides that, if a minor benefit is received by a person in return for making a contribution of cash or property, a tax deduction will be available based on the value of the contribution less the value of the minor benefit. The measure will not apply to fundraising events held by political parties, as earlier speakers have noted, which are not deductible gift recipients. This is yet another example, I would submit, of the government leading the way in making it easier for individuals to give to their communities. The new arrangements can but enhance the ability of deductible gift recipients in Australia to use special events, such as dinners, to fundraise.</para></talk.start><para>Schedule 10, which I want to mention, will require charities, public benevolent institutions and health promotion charities to be endorsed by the Commissioner of Taxation in order to access relevant tax concessions. In addition, endorsed charities will now have their charitable status displayed on the Australian Business Register. These changes are part of the government's response to the report of the inquiry into the definition of charities and related organisations. The changes will allow greater scrutiny of the use of tax concessions by charities, improve public confidence in the provision of taxation support to the charitable sector and provide charities with certainty of their entitlements. I would like to foreshadow that I will be moving amendments to postpone the endorsement measure until 1 July 2005 in order to ensure that charities have sufficient lead time to comply with the new arrangements.</para><para>The third charities related measure will improve the operation of the test that is used to determine when an entity controls a discretionary trust for the purpose of applying the small business CGT concessions. These concessions are available only to those businesses that control assets of less than $5 million. Currently, in working out the assets controlled by a small business trust, the assets of any potential beneficiaries are included. This means that, where a small business trust has a charity as a potential beneficiary, the test inappropriately includes the assets of that charity in determining access to the CGT concessions. The changes will ensure that those businesses are not prevented from accessing the capital gains tax concessions simply because of the assets held by a charitable beneficiary. In doing so, small businesses will be encouraged to include charities as beneficiaries of these trusts. The bill also updates the specifically listed deductible gift recipients in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. It adds to these lists new recipients announced since 10 December 2002. Deductible gift recipient status will assist these organisations to attract public support for their activities. </para><para>The bill broadens the list of eligible medical expenses under the medical expenses tax offset to include payments made in maintaining a dog that is properly trained for guiding or assisting a person with a disability. This will offer taxpayers with hearing dogs and assistance or service dogs the same treatment under the medical expenses tax offset as is currently available to taxpayers who maintain a dog that is trained to guide or assist the blind. The bill provides an income tax deduction for transport expenses incurred in travel between workplaces. For example, the expenses of travelling directly from one job to a second job will be deductible. Expenses incurred in travelling between two places of unrelated income-earning activity were previously allowed as deductions under a longstanding interpretation expressed in published tax rulings and in <inline font-style="italic">TaxPack</inline>. However, the High Court decision in the Payne case overturned the former interpretation and held that expenses incurred in travelling between two places of unrelated income-earning activity were not deductible under the general deduction provisions; hence the amendment inserts a specific provision into the income tax law to ensure that the deductibility of such expenses is reinstated.</para><para>On trusts and improving the operation of integrity rules, the bill inserts certain rules dealing with payments, loans and forgiven debts made by a trustee to a private company shareholder or a shareholder's associate. These amendments address issues concerning the effectiveness and fairness of certain antiavoidance provisions contained in the current law. Broadly speaking, the amendments will more effectively ensure that a trustee cannot shelter trust income at the prevailing company tax rate and then distribute the underlying cash to a beneficiary. In addition, the amendments have been designed with targeted safeguards to ensure that ordinary commercial transactions are not inadvertently caught by the rules.</para><para>I should mention, in relation to comments that were made concerning the government's response to the Board of Taxation report on the taxation of discretionary trusts, that in fact the board did and does support the government's decision not to tax discretionary trusts as it does companies. In fact, the government has introduced a number of trust integrity measures over recent years to address loopholes. Consistent with the board's findings, the government has now introduced rules that replace section 109UB, as earlier speakers have noted, and extend the scope of the former provision by catching a broader range of transactions but at the same time providing some flexibility by preventing legitimate commercial transactions from being penalised. In addition, I should say in the government's defence that other loopholes and areas addressed include the use of non-resident trusts to transfer funds offshore, the inappropriate utilisation of losses, tracing distributions through to the ultimate beneficiaries, personal services income rules and, of course, revised social security means test treatment of private trusts and private companies. So I do not think that it can be said that the government has simply put trusts on the backburner when quite clearly the government has moved to address the issues identified in the Board of Taxation report and indeed beyond it. </para><para>The bill also clarifies the transitional arrangements governing the replacement of the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme and the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme with the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme. Technical amendments are also being made to ensure that the GST which may later be recovered does not count as part of the cost of an asset when calculating capital gains tax. The changes to the Australian business number rules will also ensure that the law operates as intended to prevent situations that require businesses to provide duplicate information to government. Further technical amendments will remove an unintended disincentive for foreign companies to invest in Australia through holding companies. Although there are indeed, as Senator Murray has said, a large number of pages in this omnibus bill they address—as he has also said—largely uncontroversial measures that most definitely needed attention. I commend this bill to the Senate as meeting the policy objectives for the reasons that I have outlined.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>23614</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill—by leave—taken as a whole.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>23614</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move government amendments (1) to (5) on sheet QV269:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Clause 2, page 2 (table item 8), omit the table item, substitute:

I think there is some force in what Senator Murray says, but in the government's view the restrictions on the proposal strike the correct balance between the need to ensure that any associated benefits are both nominally and relatively minor compared to the value of the contribution, allowing DGRs to make better use of special events to fundraise. The $250 minimum requirement for cash contributions will focus the proposal on specific fundraising events rather than ongoing fundraising events and, when coupled with the cap on the benefits, will in the government's view ensure that only minor associated benefits can be received by the contributor.</para></talk.start><para>The high minimum contribution is designed to limit the possible effect of gifts being replaced by contributions and of DGRs being encouraged to provide benefits. If the minimum contribution were reduced to $100—and this has been considered as part of my consideration of this measure—it would put pressure on charities that do not necessarily include benefits as part of their fundraising activities to compete with those that do. Obviously the government did not want to put charities in the position of running some kind of competition.</para><para>I stress that the measure does not, in any way, restrict the application of current tax concessions available for fundraising. I think it does provide greater flexibility and choice in the arrangements available for fund-raising. For example, under current arrangements DGRs can still charge for the face value of the benefit provided in a fundraising event while using the event to seek donations. The donations raised in those circumstances would be deductible as gifts rather than as contributions under this measure.

We are concerned that taking this route is going to create unnecessary angst within the charitable sector without being compensated for by policy integrity.</para><para>The way in which charities are managed and operate under the law, whilst well known and well understood, in many respects lacks the philosophical reform and integrity which was intended when the original charities definition inquiry was put together. What schedule 10 does is expand the requirements for charities that would enable them to be endorsed by the Taxation Office because the endorsement will now extend to claims for GST, FBT and so on that are applicable to PBIs. Due to the fact that a vast range of charities have been self-assessing as PBIs for a long time, charities are very concerned that they will now have a set of rulings which are contrary to the way in which they have operated and the way in which they have understood they can operate. </para><para>In the Senate Economics Committee inquiry ACOSS, which is a very representative and well-respected body—I say that advisedly; it is well-respected by the government, Labor and ourselves—stated that it was opposed to schedule 10 on the basis that it would deepen the concern and confusion surrounding the definitions of `charitable' and `public benevolent' status. To an extent, the government have recognised that. They have given what is effectively a year's transitional arrangement with the government amendments which were agreed to by the Senate a short while ago. In that recognition lie the seeds of real concern on our part that this whole area needs to be reconsidered and addressed on its own, holistically and in a manner that is thorough and that satisfies all the various areas of policy and charitable promotion which the Senate, the government and the community want to see pursued.</para><para>We are moving to excise schedule 10 to try to maintain the status quo and to give the government, the Treasury and the opposition time to reassess this area and come up with a better and less worrying set of changes than those we and the charitable bodies fear are before us.

We recognise that things are far from perfect. We believe a great deal of change is necessary but we do not think this particular schedule advances the cause.

I have spoken in this place on a number of occasions on the need for a review of charities law and for an updating of the law, and I was very pleased that the government, some four years ago now, agreed to a review of what a charity is. The recommendations on what a charity is were delivered in a report by the committee on the definition of charities some three years ago. That definition was put into a draft bill that the Board of Taxation looked at over the course of the last year and made recommendations on to the government, which I understand the government rejected in its budget statement. It is very hard to give much support to the government's approach to the law of charities, given that the government approach seems to be somewhat uncharitable. It appears to consist of making life harder and harder for charities in terms of endorsement processes and the tightening of administration whilst, at the same time, whenever proposals are brought forward to modernise the law on what a charity is they are strangled somewhere in the deep recesses of Treasury.</para></talk.start><para>The concern the Democrats have is that we need to update our understanding of what a charity is if we are going to have any sort of endorsement process or determination of what charitable or non-charitable activity is. The way to do that was outlined in some detail in the recommendations of the committee on the definition of charities which was headed by Justice Sheppard. The report of that committee was very sensible in recommending some broader definitions of what a charity should be and what charitable activities should be, and also the updating of the old arcane definition of `public benevolent institution' to one of `benevolent charity'. I raise these issues now because we cannot really support a process of endorsement of charities against a definition of charities that is 400 years old. If we were talking about an up-to-date definition, if we were talking about a new process and if we were talking about checking organisations against some reasonable benchmark by some reasonable process and against some reasonable new concessions it might make sense. But the government has chosen to freeze the definition of charity where it has been over the last 100 years and, as a result, I cannot really see any point in putting the charities we have got through the enormously cumbersome process which is outlined in this schedule to seek endorsement of what they already are. </para><para>In closing, I will ask the minister a question. It is one I have asked her in question time on a number of occasions. There were two sets of recommendations on the definition of `charity'. One was the definition which was put into a draft charities bill which, as I said, died on budget night this year. The other was a series of recommendations to overhaul the definition of `public benevolent institution'. When is the government going to respond to those recommendations? Is it going to respond to those recommendations or are we going to stick with the current 80-year-old definition of `public benevolent institution' which was put in place by the Bruce-Page government in the 1920s?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>23617</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I had to consult my advisers on the public benevolent institution issue. I am going to take the opportunity to respond a little more specifically to Senator Cherry, who introduces into this debate, I detect, a sense of frustration. What the government has in fact done here is respond to an additional source of advice—namely, the Board of Taxation, which had a look at the draft legislation, conducted an inquiry on the workability of the legislation and the definition, and consulted with the charitable sector. This is not a case of the government going off on some frolic of its own, as Senator Cherry, I am sure, would appreciate. It is appropriate for the government to seek advice on these matters. The advice was that the draft legislation did not achieve the level of clarity and certainty that was intended to be brought to the charitable sector. Rather than introduce a legislative definition of a charity that could have had unintended consequences, we have retained the common law meaning, as it is well known to those who have to apply it.

It is a time-honoured meaning. The government, however, is introducing a statutory extension to include some sectors where there could be some doubt—those being, as those in the chamber well know, non-profit child care available to the public; self-help groups with open and non-discriminatory membership, particularly organisations like Alcoholics Anonymous; and closed or contemplative religious orders who pray for us—and in this day and age that is certainly something that is worthy of being regarded as a charitable activity.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Murray's express concern in moving the amendment is that the bill does not confer the necessary certainty to the charitable sector. But the effect of the amendment moved by the Democrats certainly would be to oppose a measure that would provide that certainty. Currently, of course, charities self-assess their status according to common law concepts. As Senator Murray has noted, the government has decided against codifying this common law definition because the Board of Taxation, as I indicated, found that the draft bill did not provide that certainty. I would have thought that, rather than have a whole lot of unintended consequences, those in the Senate would embrace this response, after consultation and due consideration, to maintain the common law definition with the extensions I have mentioned. By requiring charities to be endorsed, as we are dealing with in this amendment, these organisations will certainly get the certainty that they have sought from the commissioner. My advice in relation to the PBIs is that, because the charities issue is specifically run out of the Treasurer's office, the government response has been fully enunciated in the Treasurer's press release entitled `Final response to the charities definition inquiry', which is dated 11 May 2004. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>23618</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the minister for her answer.

The government has not said anything in response to the definition of a benevolent charity. Am I correct to read into that that the government is rejecting the recommendation to modify the definition of a PBI?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>23618</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The bill in response to the charities definition is before the House.

There has been significant controversy around that. However, we do not see in the provisions of this bill cause for the fears and concerns expressed by the Democrats. Therefore, we will be supporting the bill as it stands and not supporting the Democrat amendment. We have looked in some detail at the bill and the issues relating to charities and we are confident that the quite legitimate concerns the Democrats have are not warranted in relation to this bill.

I would be fascinated to know from the minister why the date 2004 appears twice in the bill title but only once in other bill titles. I am a bit intrigued as to why there is a difference. This bill we are dealing with is another omnibus tax bill introducing a range of largely technical amendments to the tax law. While Labor supports all the measures in the bill it welcomes in particular the Howard-Costello government's backflip on providing public ambulance services with the same fringe benefits tax treatment as public hospitals. Labor understands that there are some concerns that this will result in a reduction in the level of fringe benefits tax concession provided to public ambulance officers from $30,000 per employee to $17,000. However, given the compensation in the budget for this decrease, Labor will support the changes.</para></talk.start><para>On 2 December last year the government voted against a Labor amendment to the <inline ref="R1780">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 2003</inline> which would have provided this relief. In doing so, the government created anxiety and uncertainty amongst ambulance officers around the country. Many ambulance officers faced a drop in income of up to $200 per week and yet the government did nothing. It was not until the issue was highlighted on Neil Mitchell's radio program on 3AW in Melbourne that the government responded. Within 24 hours the Treasurer, Mr Costello, had overruled the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Coonan, and announced an FBT exemption would be granted to public ambulance services. There is a growing list of issues where the Howard-Costello government has been forced to follow Labor's agenda. I want to pay in particular a special tribute to Labor's Assistant Treasurer, the member for Kingston, Mr Cox, in the other place, who conducted a one-person campaign in respect of this issue. He has argued hard, long and strongly in respect of the ambulance officer issue.</para><para>We welcome the government's decision unveiled in the budget to implement another Labor policy—that is, we recognise the need for transitional relief for organisations that have recently lost their public benevolent institution status and therefore their fringe benefits tax exemption. Having acknowledged the backflip by the government with regard to ambulance officers I want to draw one issue to the attention of the Senate that I think is unresolved—that is, the position of the St John Ambulance service in Western Australia and the Northern Territory. I want to thank my colleague Senator Crossin from the Northern Territory for drawing this issue to our attention. We think there are still some unresolved issues in respect of the St John Ambulance service. We do not believe they are reflected in the bill. We will support the bill as far as it goes. However, we think there are some issues relating to the St John Ambulance service that do need resolving. Workers in these organisations, particularly in the disability area, are notoriously underpaid and have relied on their salary-sacrificing arrangements just to get by.</para><para>Moving to the detail of this bill, schedule 1 amends the taxation of life insurance companies. Before 1 July 2001, life insurance companies were exempt from tax or taxed concessionally on certain income. As part of the government's business tax reforms, life insurance companies are now taxed as companies. These were major reforms and the amendments in this bill seek to respond to industry and ATO concerns about the operation of the new tax regime. The amendments deal with three main types of income generated by life insurance companies. These are: the ordinary class of taxable income that is taxed at the company tax rate, and income derived in relation to risk business and ordinary investment business is included in this class; the complying superannuation class of taxable income that is taxed at the rate of 15 per cent; and non-assessable, non-exempt income derived in relation to immediate annuity business.</para><para>The bill clarifies that tax losses in each class of income can only be used against taxable income in each class of income—that is, if a tax loss occurred in the superannuation business, it could not be used against taxable income in the ordinary side of the business. The amendments also modify the taxation treatment of each type of business. In relation to risk business, the amendments ensure that provisions in the ITAA 1936 relating to reinsurance with nonresidents only apply to accident and disability risk covered by the relevant reinsurance contracts. Certain reinsurance commissions are included in assessable income and the basis for determining the amount of the decrease in the value of policy liabilities that is included in assessable income is the same as the basis for determining the amount of the increase in the value of policy liabilities that is deductible.</para><para>In relation to ordinary investment business, the amendments clarify that the deduction for the capital component of ordinary investment policies does not apply to other types of policies, ensure that funeral policies issued by friendly societies are taxed as ordinary investment policies, ensure that the amount of the reduction in exit fees over the term of a life insurance policy is deductible and ensure that the risk rider premiums are included in assessable income.</para><para>In relation to complying superannuation business, the amendments clarify the scope of the deduction for the capital component of premiums received in respect of virtual pooled superannuation trust policies; clarify the scope of the liabilities that can be supported by virtual pooled superannuation trust assets; allow up to 30 days after the time that the transfer value of the virtual pooled superannuation trust assets is determined or the time that the value of the virtual pooled superannuation trust liabilities is determined, whichever is later, to transfer excess assets out of the virtual pool of superannuation trust; and impose administrative penalties for the failure to undertake the required valuations of assets and liabilities or to transfer excess assets out of the virtual pooled superannuation trust within the specified time periods.</para><para>In relation to immediate annuity business, the amendments modify the types of policies that are exempt life insurance policies; clarify the scope of the liabilities that can be supported by segregated exempt assets; allow up to 30 days after the time that the transfer value of the segregated exempt assets is determined or the time that the value of the exempt life insurance policy liabilities is determined, whichever is later, to transfer excess assets out of the segregated exempt assets; and impose administrative penalties for the failure to undertake the required valuations of assets and liabilities or to transfer excess assets out of the segregated exempt assets within the specified time periods. I hope all the senators in the chamber have been following this in great detail. The bill also includes a number of technical amendments to the operation of a life insurance regime. </para><para>Schedule 2 of the bill deals with the consolidation regime. The consolidation regime was introduced on 1 July 2002 and allows groups of companies to be treated as a single entity for taxation purposes. The amendments in this bill will provide greater flexibility to consolidated groups and clarify the operation of the consolidation regime. There is a range of amendments to the consolidation regime included in the bill, including: allowing corporate unit trusts and public trading trusts to head up a consolidated group, which is appropriate as these types of trusts are taxed like companies; aligning the period in which a choice is made to continue as a consolidated group when shares are exchanged in one company for shares in another company, with a notification period for events affecting consolidated groups; implementing special rules for determining the income tax consequences that arise where a partner or a partnership leaves a consolidated group; modifications to the clear exit pool and the pay-as-you-go, PAYG, instalment liability rules; and clarifying that a group liability can be subject to only one tax-sharing agreement.</para><para>Schedule 3 of the bill deals with the venture capital regime which established three kinds of limited partnerships as a mechanism for accessing tax concessions. These amendments ensure that limited partnerships that are separate legal entities are eligible to access the venture capital concessions. Schedule 4 of the bill will allow for continuity of FBT treatment for non-remote housing benefits where administration and payment of FBT is devolved by state or territory governments to a departmental level. Schedule 5 of the bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to ensure that a capital gains tax, CGT, event is not inadvertently created by the disposal of new interests in demerged entities.</para><para>Schedule 6 provides an explicit income tax deduction for individuals that must make United Medical Protection Ltd support payments. Without these amendments, only a practising doctor could claim a deduction for UMP support payments. Retiring or non-practising doctors that are required to make support payments would not be eligible for a deduction because these payments do not relate to their taxable incomes. These amendments ensure that all individuals that make UMP support payments can deduct these payments from their taxable income, which is done on fairness grounds, as retired or non-practising doctors are effectively incurring expenses related to past income. Schedule 7 of the bill will ensure that the goods and services tax, GST, insurance provisions apply as intended to transactions undertaken by operators for compulsory third party, CTP, schemes.</para><para>Schedule 8 of the bill provides a limited response to recommendations made by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, from their inquiry into taxation and transfers from overseas superannuation funds. Australian residents can transfer superannuation funds from overseas accounts into Australian superannuation accounts. If such a transfer occurs within six months of the individual becoming an Australian resident, the funds are not taxed. But if the transfer occurs after six months, any investment earnings from when that individual became an Australian resident are taxable. Currently that tax must be paid by the individual at their marginal tax rate, not the concessional 15 per cent superannuation tax. This can create a significant financial difficulty for individuals because they cannot access the superannuation funds, to actually pay the tax, until retirement. To avoid the situation of individuals not being able to meet their tax liability or being deterred from bringing overseas superannuation to Australia, the amendments in this bill make the superannuation fund liable for the tax. The investment earnings on the overseas superannuation will be taxed at the normal concessional 15 per cent superannuation rate rather than the individual's marginal tax rate. The bill also amends the foreign investment funds rule to ensure that transfers of overseas superannuation into complying Australian super funds are not taxed twice. </para><para>Schedule 10 includes some minor amendments to the simplified imputation system. The bill contains a minor amendment that ensures the provisions for the carrying forward of excess foreign tax credits operate properly following changes to the tax credit provisions that were made as a result of the Timor Sea Treaty. Finally, schedule 12 of the bill amends the alienation of the personal services income provisions to clarify when the Commissioner of Taxation can make a personal services business determination which is consistent with the policy intent. The effect of the commissioner granting a PSB determination is that the PSI provisions do not apply to the taxpayer. With those comments, the Labor Party will be supporting this bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>23622</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak to the <inline ref="R2013">Tax Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 2) Bill 2004</inline>. Senator Sherry, in opening your remarks you asked the minister why bills are now titled like this. I suspect you will have to ask Senator Crossin and the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, on which I sit, because we criticised the way in which tax bills were being titled, particularly when they were going from one year to another, and they have come up with this solution—which, from your remarks, you do not think is much of a solution. I must admit that, despite having the tax portfolio, I remain as confused as ever about these titles. Still, I am not confused about what is in this bill. This is another 166 pages of tax law, on top of the 64 pages in the bill that we have just dealt with. I am of the view that the next government should introduce an efficiency dividend idea: that no tax law can be introduced into the Senate chamber unless the equivalent number of pages are knocked out of the tax act so that we get a tax page neutral measure. The number of pages is just climbing and climbing—and we have still got to get to the new international tax bill, which will add some more pages.</para></talk.start><para>The Senate must obviously place a degree of reliance on the work of the Treasury officials responsible for the tax laws. A lot of this bill we are now debating is technical amendments that have no revenue impact but simply correct earlier errors. I do not condemn either the ATO, who had these legislative design responsibilities earlier, or the Treasury, who have them now, one bit for making errors in tax law. It is very difficult to get all the cross-referencing accurate, which I think is another sign that we really do need to make one more effort to simplify the system.</para><para>The 12 schedules to this bill are generally noncontroversial. Eight of them have a nil or negligible impact on taxation revenue; the others range from a revenue gain of $1 million to a revenue cost of $5 million. Schedule 1 to this bill modifies the operation of the income tax law affecting life insurance companies. In particular, the amendments affect: the basis of working out the ordinary class and complying superannuation class of taxable income or tax losses, the taxation treatment of risk business, the taxation treatment of ordinary investment business, the operation of the virtual pooled superannuation trust and the operation of the segregated exempt assets. There are also a range of technical amendments. Schedule 2 to the bill provides greater flexibility to and clarifies certain aspects of the consolidation regime—much beloved by me and other policy wonks—and ensures that the regime interacts appropriately with other aspects of the income tax law. Democrats have long been supportive of the intent of the consolidation regime. </para><para>Schedule 3 to this bill amends the ITAA 1997 and the ITAA 1936 to ensure that a limited partnership, formed with a legal personality separate from its partners and taxed as an ordinary partnership under the venture capital regime, is a `partnership' for income tax purposes. Schedule 4 to this bill amends the FBTAA 1986 to allow for continuity of FBT treatment for non-remote housing benefits where administration and payment of FBT is devolved by state or territory governments to a departmental level. Schedule 5 to this bill amends the ITAA 1997 to ensure that capital gains tax event K6 is not inadvertently triggered by the disposal of new interests in demerged entities.</para><para>Schedule 6 to this bill amends the ITAA 1997 to ensure that all individuals who make UMP support payments will be entitled to an income tax deduction for the amount of their contributions in that income year. This is part of the package aimed at resolving the medical indemnity crisis that my colleague Senator Ridgeway has been heavily involved with. The Democrats support the deductibility of the medical support insurance payments. Schedule 7 to this bill amends the GST act to ensure that the goods and services insurance provisions apply as intended to transactions undertaken by operators of compulsory third party schemes.</para><para>Schedule 8 to this bill amends the FBTAA 1986 to provide public ambulance services with the same FBT treatment as is provided to public hospitals. It has the largest revenue impact, being $5 million a year, but—to use that extremely hackneyed phrase—does put everybody on the same level playing field. Public ambulance services will be able to access an FBT exemption of up to $17,000 of grossed up taxable value per employee and will also be able to access the remote area housing FBT exemption under the same criteria as apply to public hospitals. Senator Sherry tends to be a great player for his team and does not mention other teams that much, so he failed to give us credit for being the joint proposers of this measure in December last year. It was rejected by the government at the time and has now been accepted. We raised it with the government and with the opposition and we are glad that the government has seen fit to come to the party. As a result of a recent court case, technically most public ambulance services have lost their public benevolent institution or PBI status. This means that they cannot provide employees with up to $30,000 in tax-free fringe benefits. The schedule will give all public ambulance authorities a $17,000 FBT exemption, in line with the treatment of public hospitals. That treatment has been in place for some time now—four years, I think.</para><para>St John Ambulance in both Western Australia and the Northern Territory will—as has been mentioned earlier—remain a public benevolent institution and would like us to amend the bill so that they continue to obtain the $30,000 FBT exemption. The difficulty that emerged for ambulance services was that in most states and territories they were considered to be government instrumentalities for tax purposes and therefore were not entitled to the FBT allowance of $30,000—in fact, they were not entitled to any FBT allowance. Now they have been given the $17,000 allowance, which is in line with the treatment of public hospitals. But, of course, we would then have the situation where St John Ambulance in Western Australia and the Northern Territory, which are not government instrumentalities, would be operating on a more beneficial basis than were the rest. St John Ambulance in Western Australia came to see me about this matter and I was sympathetic to their plight. But I had forgotten that the government in its budget had in fact given a three-year funding top-up, if you like, to compensate them for the change and to allow them time to adjust their employer relationships and to put new employees coming into the system on the new arrangement. I understand St John Ambulance in both Western Australia and Northern Territory being concerned that there is going to be a shift in the arrangements, but I can see no way around the good principle that the government is putting forward, that everybody should be on the same basis when they are delivering the same service. So it is an awkward one.  </para><para>There will be administrative uncertainty as a result of this change if staff work in dual roles—for example, if they work partly for the public ambulance service and partly in other PBI activities, such as the provision of first aid training. I note that the Treasurer announced on budget night the matter I mentioned earlier: the provision of financial grants to compensate ambulance authorities for the next three years. Minister, I now ask you, on the record, to cover the situation for Western Australia and the Northern Territory and indicate the way in which government will assist in overcoming any transitional difficulties.</para><para>On 3 December 2003, in rejecting the Democrat and Labor amendments, Parliamentary Secretary Ross Cameron said:</para><quote><para>The other concern with the amendment is that the bill may actually have a deleterious effect on the availability of tax concessions to ambulance services. For example, ambulance services that are at present public benevolent institutions are entitled not to $17,000 but to $30,000 gross taxable value per employee. If we look at an organisation like the St John's Ambulance Association—which, for example, is providing ambulance services under contract to the Western Australian and Northern Territory governments—as a public benevolent institution but not as a public hospital we see that St John's is currently entitled to the higher value of $30,000 per employee. It seems to me on first reading of the opposition's amendment—</para></quote><para>it was a Democrat-Labor amendment—</para><motion><para>that there is a real possibility that, if St John's were to be treated in the same way as a public hospital, they would lose that higher entitlement. I am sure that is not the intention of the opposition but that appears to me to be a likely consequence of the amendment. So for those reasons the government will be opposing the amendment.</para></motion><para>Clearly, the government decided, in the interests of integrity and consistency, to take away the higher entitlement of the St John Ambulance in Western Australia and the Northern Territory and bring up, from no entitlement to a $17,000 entitlement, the rest of the states and territories.</para><para>The last thing I want to mention before going off this schedule is that Senator Stott Despoja has raised the matter of the Julia Farr Centre in Adelaide, which provides services for those with an intellectual disability. That was affected because the state government had the power to appoint some board members and that was sufficient to have it regarded as a government institution for the purposes of tax office rulings. I think there is an issue when you have government participation or partnership in PBIs putting at risk their status. I think there needs to be some kind of panel or appeal body, which is simple and easy for people to access, to ensure that a `technical infringement', if you like, does not result in the loss of a meaningful benefit to great inconvenience to the PBI concerned. </para><para>Schedule 9 to this bill amends the ITAA 1936 to alter the taxation treatment that applies when payments are made from overseas superannuation funds. The amendments give effect to the government's response to the report by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation on taxation of transfers from overseas superannuation funds. The key change will enable a taxpayer who is having their overseas superannuation paid directly to an Australian complying superannuation fund to elect to have part of the payment treated as a taxable contribution in the Australian fund. By the taxpayer doing so, the fund, rather than the individual, will pay relevant tax arising on the payment and tax will be paid at the concessional superannuation fund rate rather than at the individual's marginal rate.</para><para>Schedule 10 to this bill amends, as part of the implementation of the SIS, division 207 of the ITAA 1997, the tax effect of receiving a franked distribution. The amendments will include adjustment rules to provide the calculation to adjust an entity's assessable income where a franked distribution flows indirectly to the entity through a trust or partnership and the entity has no entitlement to a tax offset. This bill will also amend the rules in the trans-Tasman imputation measures that adjust the assessable income of an Australian shareholder in receipt of a supplementary dividend paid by a New Zealand company.</para><para>Schedule 11 to this bill changes the provisions dealing with the carry-forward of excess foreign tax credits to ensure those provisions refer to the correct paragraphs in the general foreign tax credit provisions. Schedule 12 to this bill amends the alienation of the PSI provisions contained in part 2-42 of the ITAA 1997 to clarify when the commissioner can make a personal service business determination, as is consistent with the policy intent. </para><para>That is our review of the bill. The Democrats will be supporting all the schedules of the bill without amendment but we seek clarification from the minister with respect to the two issues I have raised. The first is the treatment of Western Australia and Northern Territory St John Ambulance organisations, with a continuing regard to assisting them in this transitional period. The second issue is the situation raised by Senator Stott Despoja where appointments from a government to a PBI's management board, or other bodies, disturb its tax status because it could be conceived as being a government instrumentality.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>23625</page.no><name role="metadata">Webber, Sen Ruth</name><name role="display">Senator WEBBER</name><name.id>00AOT</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R2013">Tax Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 2) Bill 2004</inline>—don't bills have complicated names these days?—contains a number of measures announced in this year's budget.

Because I am from Western Australia I want to concentrate my remarks on only one.</para></talk.start><para>While the ALP will support the measures in the bill, there is still some concern in my home state of Western Australia regarding the provisions of schedule 8—public ambulance services. The problem is that all this government seems to have is a one size fits all solution: it is clearly evident in this schedule. Ambulance services in Western Australia are not provided by the government. The St John Ambulance service in Western Australia is directly affected by the provisions of this legislation—or so I am told. </para><para>In December last year the government voted against the ALP's amendment—and, as Senator Murray has reminded us, it was cosponsored by the Democrats—to the <inline ref="R1780">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 2003</inline>, which would have provided relief to public ambulance services. Essentially, the government has now returned with schedule 8 and ensured that public ambulance services are treated in the same manner as public hospitals—which is a good thing. However, the shortfall occurs in the case of the St John Ambulance service in Western Australia.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7Y6</name.id><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator Crossin</name></talker><para>—And in the Northern Territory.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AOT</name.id><name role="metadata">Webber, Sen Ruth</name><name role="display">Senator WEBBER</name></talker><para>—Yes, I am parochial, Senator Crossin, so I talk about Western Australia, but indeed it is true also in the Northern Territory. The St John Ambulance service in Western Australia is not a public ambulance service. By definition, the St John Ambulance service in Western Australia does not fall into the category of a public ambulance service. The reality is that the St John Ambulance service is a public ambulance service in all but name. However, in terms of the law, the St John Ambulance service is operated by a non-profit organisation that, although supported by the government, is not defined as a public ambulance service. Western Australia is disadvantaged—as indeed is the Northern Territory—because our ambulance service is different from those in other states. Therefore, the St John Ambulance service will not fall under schedule 8 guidelines and ambulance officers in Western Australia will be subject to a potential loss of income.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The facts are that the St John Ambulance service in Western Australia covers the largest area covered by any ambulance service in the world—some 2½ million square kilometres. It is often staffed by volunteers and private staff. On any given day it receives over 300 calls for assistance. There are over 280 ambulance paramedics located in some 29 locations. Over 2,500 volunteer ambulance officers provide services across Western Australia. There are nearly 400 ambulance vehicles and 10 patient transport vehicles. It may come as a surprise to people in the rest of Australia that ambulance services would be provided by something that is not public. By any commonsense approach this is a public ambulance service provided by a non-profit organisation for all the people of Western Australia. It is a service that is jointly funded by government and the public and yet does not fall under schedule 8 of these taxation amendments. There is clearly a need to address the inequality in treatment between ambulance services in other states and those in Western Australia and, as Senator Crossin reminds me, those in the Northern Territory.</para><para>The St John Ambulance service in Western Australia deserves equal treatment under the law as applies to ambulance services in other states. Indeed, as Senator Murray has said, the arrangement in this legislation is an awkward one. We can argue about whether the definition of a public ambulance service is correct but on the ground the employees of the organisation providing public ambulance services in Western Australia deserve equal treatment. One wonders why the government, when it was making the decision to make these changes contained within schedule 8 that ensure public ambulance services are treated the same as public hospitals, did not consider the situations in Western Australia and the Northern Territory.</para><para>Let us be clear about this. Labor first raised concerns about this issue in December last year when we attempted to amend the <inline ref="R1780">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 2003</inline>. In fact, the government was caught on the hop at that time. It shows how much it knows about the operation of ambulance services Australia-wide. The Treasurer announced after the issue was made public on Melbourne radio that the government was going to make the same FBT exemption as would apply to public hospitals. The government has had over six months to make sure it gets the schedule right, yet somehow it has managed to overlook the situation in Western Australia and the Northern Territory. The fact remains that the government came up with a fix last December, worked on it until the budget this year, drafted the legislation and still managed to overlook the operations of the St John Ambulance in Western Australia—yet another example of the people that this government tends to forget. It made sure it got the issue off Melbourne radio within 24 hours last December, but it ignored the unique situation in my home state of Western Australia. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>23627</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In summing up on the <inline ref="R2013">Tax Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 2) Bill 2004</inline>, I will address the schedules from the government's perspective. In response to Senator Sherry, the renaming of the omnibus tax bills follows, as I understand it, suggestions of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel responding to concerns—Senator Murray is quite right—of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. Senator Crossin would no doubt be able to confirm this. The committee had noted the confusion caused when omnibus tax bills, formerly called TLABs, were introduced in one year and passed in another and so changed their name—that is, the number would change along the way. By placing the number of the bill and the year in which it was introduced in parenthesis, this element of the name of the bill will remain unchanged whatever the bill's fate. I hope that clarifies it for Senator Sherry.</para></talk.start><para>Tax reform that makes businesses more competitive represents an investment by this government in securing a successful economy, and it is in this setting that jobs, investment and trade opportunities are created, all of which are fundamental to our continuing economic prosperity. This bill, although once again Senator Murray chides us for its length, does deliver on the government's commitment to creating an environment in which businesses can have certainty and can prosper, and of course that benefits all Australians.</para><para>We have been responsive to industry calls to remove impediments to business investment and restructuring that occur in some parts of this bill. In particular, the engagement and consultation we have had with business and industry in the design and implementation of tax reform has been a hallmark of the approach. This bill does demonstrate our commitment to consultation and to a preparedness to both listen and act.</para><para>Amendments are being made to improve the practical operation of the income tax law affecting life insurance companies and to ensure those provisions interact appropriately with other provisions in the income tax law. The government is implementing further measures to give taxpayers greater flexibility and certainty as they move into the new consolidation regime, which has been of course a mighty task. As the new consolidation regime has changed the tax landscape for many corporate groups, we have continued to consult actively with business on the implementation and to make changes where absolutely necessary, and the bill reflects the results of that ongoing consultation.</para><para>Amendments are also being made to ensure that limited partnerships with a legal personality separate from their partners are able to access venture capital tax concessions, which of course has been sought by industry. The concessions encourage non-resident investment in the Australian VC industry by providing incentives for increased investments in start-ups and expanding businesses that would otherwise have some difficulty in attracting investment. The law is also amended to ensure that the pre capital gains tax status of membership interests is fully preserved following a demerger. This would ensure that capital gains tax is not inadvertently triggered by the disposal of new interest in demerged entities, creating a taxing point. Therefore, the measure will remove an obstacle to an entity choosing to restructure by demerging.  </para><para>Several technical amendments are also being made to the GST law to ensure that the insurance provisions apply to intended transactions undertaken by operators of compulsory third party schemes. Once again these amendments address the needs of the industry for clarification of some specific issues brought to the government's attention. As part of the further implementation of the simplified imputation system, the amendments will complete the rules that deal with the receipt of a franked distribution indirectly through a partnership or trust. </para><para>In addition to this range of business tax measures, the bill also implements a number of other tax measures. It has introduced a scheme to address the unfunded incurred but not reported liabilities of MDOs and introduces a contribution scheme which imposes a liability on doctors to fund the scheme. The bill ensures that individuals who make United Medical Protection Ltd support payments will be entitled to an income tax deduction for the amount of their contributions in that income year.</para><para>A recent court decision, as we all know from questions in this place and other explorations, found that some public ambulance services were ineligible for the fringe benefit tax exemption of up to $30,000 per employee available to public benevolent institutions. The government subsequently announced that it would make an FBT exemption of up to $17,000 per employee available to public ambulance services consistent with that available for public hospitals. So it was intended to be a level playing field. In addition, as announced in the budget, Commonwealth grants will be made to support organisations in the transition to this lower FBT concession. During the debate I was asked how the grants would be calculated for public benevolent institutions. I can advise Senator Murray in particular that the ATO is working with those organisations to correctly calculate the extent to which they are entitled to the compensatory grant. The ATO will be contacting all affected organisations to ensure that the grants compensate for the change in public benevolent institution status and the effects of this on their fringe benefit tax liability.</para><para>I was also asked specifically about Senator Stott Despoja's identified circumstance—I think it was the junior fire service in South Australia—and obviously it is important as Senator Murray has identified that some technical infringement is not seen to be prohibitive to the accessing of benefits to which they would otherwise be entitled. It obviously depends very much on the particular circumstances and I would certainly consider that this would come within the category of ATO consultations that I have just identified. </para><para>Debate interrupted. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>23628</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Alan (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Ferguson)</inline>—Order!

Death is the inevitable finality of life, the last of the fundamental rites of passage in the human existence, but it is never something we want to face for ourselves, for our loved ones or, indeed, for our friends. President George W. Bush said it best, I believe, in America during the week-long process of saying goodbye to the former President. He said that President Reagan belonged to God now but we liked it better when he belonged to us.</para></talk.start><para>In fact, a lot has been said about Ronald Reagan since his death and even more written. In a way, that is strange, because President Reagan was really a man of few words. His was a measured pace. The message that he delivered was clear. It was concise. It was simple. In an age of the unelected smart alec, it is the in thing for the chattering classes to denigrate those who express views that fail to accord with the perceived wisdom of the moment. That is a blot on the landscape of Western democracy. We must never forget that democracy thrives best on courtesy in an environment where Voltaire's famous rule is unchallenged and where, as in the past, it is possible to argue without stooping to baseness. President Reagan was a courteous man. He was also a surprising man.</para><para>Someone, and I think it was Colin Powell, the American Secretary of State, once President Reagan's national security adviser—but it does not really matter who it was—said after his death that he was a B-grade actor and an A-grade President. That is not a bad one-liner. President Reagan might in fact have got a laugh out of it himself. If he had said it himself—and that is by no means an inconceivable notion—he would certainly have done so with panache and with that hint of a wicked, slightly self-deprecating little smile that was one of his trademarks. Who could forget his `Honey, I forgot to duck' line to his wife Nancy after the 1981 assassination attempt? But to say that he was a B-grade actor and just leave it at that is also to denigrate him, for B-grade movies—like the flip sides of records, another entertainment genre that has ridden off into the sunset—were the staple of the film industry, the entertainment of millions of people around the world. We remember President Reagan's courage not only in office but when afterwards he was afflicted by Alzheimer's disease and announced that fact publicly and said that he was going away into a long sunset. Would that we could all find that much courage in such circumstances.</para><para>The words of two of his greatest international collaborators in ending the Cold War, expressed last week during the ceremonial farewells, bear repeating here tonight. Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said:</para><quote><para>He will be missed not only by those who knew him and not only by the nation that he served so proudly and loved so deeply but also by millions of men and women who live in freedom today because of the policies he pursued.</para></quote><para>She further said:</para><quote><para>Ronald Reagan had a higher claim than any other leader to have won the Cold War for liberty, and he did it without a shot being fired.</para><para>To have achieved so much against so many odds and with such humour and humanity made Ronald Reagan a truly great American hero.</para></quote><para>Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev said:</para><quote><para>I feel great regret.

It is from the former Speaker of the Lithuanian parliament, Vytautas Landsbergis. He said:</para><quote><para>A man died who believed in freedom and changed the world. This is President Ronald Reagan, to whom Lithuania is grateful and will remain grateful for his firm resistance to the Evil Empire, giving us an opportunity for us to regain our freedom and return to democracy.</para></quote><para>Honourable senators will know that, as much as I am an Australian patriot, I am also an unabashed supporter of the American nation and the American people. I am an unabashed supporter because the values that are America's heritage are good values—and because they are Australian values too. </para><para>I believe that America's democracy and the American people's commitment to freedom for their country and for others is the most powerful weapon for good. These are commitments that Australians freely share and seek to foster in a violent world. It is customary in some circles to decry the alliance we have with the Americans. Some people promote a view that Australia's distinct national objectives can be achieved without that alliance or, if not without it, while we are chorusing catcalls from the sidelines. Some of them even write songs about this great self-delusion. They set them to catchy tunes and make a lucrative career out of performing them and displaying their ignorance of history. I do not know of one American, or of one American administration, that has or has had imperial designs on us or indeed anyone. The United States was founded on liberty. Its revolutionaries fought for their freedom and that of their fellow colonists and founded a magnificent and enduring nation. It is true that, in the nearly 2½ centuries since then, international affairs and global politics have drawn America into conflicts and compromises. It is true that, in those intervening years, the face of America has changed. The same is true of every nation, and our own is no exception. But the genius of America has been to harness popular will to great projects, to hold fast to the democratic ideal and to take those benefits to the four corners of the world. The genius of American leaders has been to focus on the dream, to look for the shining city on the distant hill and to take their countrymen towards it. Those dreams, those precepts, that unshakeable faith, are also Australian traits. We too in this country are builders—in our own way, to our own design and according to our own national imperatives.</para><para>More so than most, President Reagan was a man who dreamed, a visionary who spied the shining city and who would not accept that it was an unreachable goal. I would like to share with honourable senators a tribute I posted on the Ronald Reagan memorial web site:</para><quote><para>President Reagan was the voice of liberty.

Finally, six months after the due date, the Howard government has realised that it can no longer stall and has belatedly released the revised campaign against domestic violence. The delay cost lost opportunities for community education over the Christmas holiday period, as well as $1.6 million in cancellation fees. The government's changes to the campaign mean that $20 million instead of the budgeted $15 million will now have to be spent. I doubt that the addition of the booklet to be sent to every household will be money well spent—it is reminiscent of the government's pathetic antiterrorist fridge magnet campaign—but the television segments, if thoughtfully placed, may well have a useful impact on community thinking. </para></talk.start><para>Unfortunately, the government has chosen to replace the educative and preventative focus of the original No Respect, No Relationship campaign with a crisis management approach, and there are concerns that recent well-publicised cases which resulted in no convictions may mean that women continue to be deterred from reporting crimes of violence. The original campaign had a segment called `Coaching boys into men' which could have been used by sports coaches, clubs and schools to encourage responsible behaviour by teams. The original campaign had a wider targeting approach to include specific issues and specific communities—for example, young Indigenous communities.</para><para>So the delay caused by the direct intervention of ministers, uncomfortable, for example, with a concept that verbal abuse is a form of violence, or with the concept that only male perpetrators were depicted in the advertisements, has meant not only a high monetary cost but lost opportunities and human costs. Does anyone else find it ironic that a big objection to the original campaign against domestic violence was that the television segments referred people to a web site for further information? Yet in answering questions on why there was no women's budget document this year, as there has been for the past 10 years or so, the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Patterson, said:</para><quote><para>I made a conscious decision not to release a women's Budget statement. Instead I used a more modern, user-friendly post-Budget publication outlining the Australian Government's achievements for women.</para><para>These changes will ensure that the Government communicates with women in a more up-to-date and accessible way.</para></quote><para>I think it strange that she considered a web site less suitable for a young, technologically aware target group. The budget has alerted women and families, who have suddenly been discovered by this uncaring government, that this is an election year. But, despite the smoke and mirrors and the attempts to patch up some of the worst effects of nine years of punitive economic policies, women and families do not fare well in this budget. The much vaunted tax cuts—a major feature of the budget—will not apply to most women, and women without dependent children will be especially badly off as a result of this year's budget measures. Total average women's earnings amount to $30,540—far short of the $52,000 needed for a tax cut. The number of women who work part time has increased from 42.5 per cent of all female workers in March 1996 to 45.7 per cent in April 2004. But even those women who work full time are unlikely to benefit: women's full-time average earnings in February 2004 were only $44,200. Women are strongly represented in the occupations that pay extra tax while getting no tax relief themselves—hairdressers, cleaners, shop assistants, receptionists, hospitality workers, enrolled nurses and social workers. These are the people who will shoulder the burden of the government's assistance to those who are better off than themselves. </para><para>Since the advent of the Howard government, the gap between men's and women's wages has widened substantially. In February 1996 the excess of male over female earnings—for total earnings in current dollars—was $229.10 but this has blown out to $312. This figure is from November 2003. Senator Patterson has claimed that under the Howard government women's wages have risen three times more than they did under Labor. This is not correct. Over the period from February 1983 to February 1996, female full-time adult total earnings rose by $315.20, or an annual average increase of 5.9 per cent. Over the period from February 1996 to November 2003, female full-time adult total earnings rose by $250.90, or an annual average increase of 4.6 per cent.</para><para>Work and family issues still appear to be beyond the comprehension of this government. Having systematically run down Labor's child-care programs over its years in office and reduced access to, and availability of, child care, it has suddenly grandly announced `additional child-care places' in this year's budget. However, it turns out that these additional places are restricted to outside school hours care and family day care places. These are needed, of course, but there is also a great need for quality community centre based care, which the government chooses consistently to ignore. Nothing has been done in this budget for the estimated 46,300 children whose families want access to centre based long day care. We understand that even the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs pressed cabinet for funding to address the unmet demand for long day care but got nothing. This government is so out of touch with Australian families, their lifestyles and their needs—and the needs of their children—that some members get highly stressed about segments of <inline font-style="italic">Play</inline><inline font-style="italic"> S</inline><inline font-style="italic">chool</inline> showing different types of happy families and yet they do not express any concern whatsoever about families struggling for access to quality care for their children. Is the government concerned that, at present, of the 4,383 child-care centres subject to national child-care accreditation only about 3,705 are fully accredited?</para><para>Women's community organisations also appear to have fared badly under this budget. By channelling grants to national women's organisations through national secretariats and by no longer providing disaggregated data for expenditure under this program in the budget papers, the government manages to be less than transparent about its latest cuts. It appears that the forward estimate for the whole of the Women's Development Program for 2005-06 is only $500,000. That is $1 million less than budgeted for in 2004-05. We have not been told which organisations will miss out on funding this year or in future years.</para><para>The Howard government has been the highest taxing government in Australia's history, yet most families and singles—disproportionately women—will miss out on any tax relief from this budget. True to form, the Howard government has sought to advantage the already well off at the expense of the less well off and the needy. Labor, under the leadership of Mark Latham, has pledged to cut government waste. One example of this is the government's expenditure of more than $100 million on taxpayer funded political advertising that is being paraded across television sets and newspapers and put in mailboxes. Another example is the wasteful cancellation of television time for the anti-domestic violence campaign last December. If the government had gone ahead with that campaign when it was scheduled, there would not have been that waste of taxpayers' money. Labor will reorder our priorities and we will invest in our families and communities. We do not believe this government has got its priorities right. Labor have pledged to invest in education and health as our major priorities, to restore services and to provide a ladder of opportunity for all Australians. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Western Australia: Coastal Development</title><page.no>23633</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>23633</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to speak on an issue which is arising—literally—on the beachfront along the coast of my home state of Western Australia. As some may recall from my first speech in this chamber, I grew up on the coast at Lancelin, just north of Perth, where my parents were involved in crayfishing. I worked on my father's boat as a deckhand and, despite my difficulties in getting a suntan, spent much of my life on the beach and on the sea. There is something about the vast oceans and wide beaches that surround this country that engenders an almost obsessive passion among the millions of Australians who choose to live there. I cannot explain it, but I certainly recognise and appreciate it.</para></talk.start><para>At this moment, there are several protests taking place in Western Australia where local residents and other members of the public have taken up the cudgels in defence of their particular patch of coastline. In the south-western seaside town of Augusta, local residents are railing against a proposed seven-hectare marina which, it is reported, would include breakwaters 550 metres out to sea, 70 boat pens, parking for 80 cars and trailers, a shop, a restaurant and apartments. All of this is planned for a town with a permanent population of approximately 1,200 people, including many retirees, and with many shops and services closing down.</para><para>It is true that property prices have skyrocketed in Augusta in recent times and that the town's numbers do swell in the summertime. Perhaps a marina of this scale may help to boost the number of holiday-makers who flock to Augusta in the summer and therefore help to tide over the local businesses during winter but, then again, maybe the attraction of Augusta is that it offers that quiet holiday getaway with pristine, clean beaches and no hustle and bustle and `developing' it into a seaside mecca may ultimately be to Augusta's detriment.</para><para>Further up the coast and closer to Fremantle at Port Catherine, near Coogee, environmentalists and local residents are locked in a fierce battle against developers reclaiming land from the sea to build a canal based luxury housing development. The main complaint here is that proper environmental studies have not been undertaken and that the beach will be locked away from public use for the benefit only of those living in the new development. In the metropolitan area closer to Perth, a group of local residents has formed to oppose high-rise buildings at Cottesloe Beach, arguably the jewel in the crown of Perth's local beaches. Much further north at Mullaloo, yet more residents are rallying to preserve their well-known surf and swimming beach. Last year, the Western Australian state government scotched the ambitious plan to develop a marina project at Ningaloo Reef at Exmouth after enormous public outcry and pressure.</para><para>Brought to my attention more recently was the impending development of Scarborough Beach, possibly the best known and most easily accessible metropolitan beach in Western Australia. It was revealed recently that the local council plans to give developers the go-ahead to build nine high-rise apartment towers—some up to 16 storeys high—in a one-kilometre square block right on the waterfront. A group of local residents known as Save our Sunset, or SOS, have taken the council to task over its lack of consultation with residents, its supposed collusion with developers and its obvious disregard for anyone who opposes it. They chose the name Save our Sunset because of the shadowing that would occur in the afternoon when the sun set in front of the high-rise buildings. The beach would be shaded in the mornings and the residents behind these buildings would be shaded in the afternoons. </para><para>Last month the SOS group proposed to hold a rally at Scarborough Beach and called for residents and supporters to attend. They duly applied to the council for a permit to hold this rally, only to be told that they would have to provide their own public liability insurance at a massive cost of $1,200 for two hours of coverage. I would hazard a guess that any other community organisation would not have been required to fund their own insurance but rather would have been covered by the council's umbrella policy. To their credit, the SOS group pooled their scant financial resources and held the rally anyway. Despite wet and windy weather, an estimated 2,000 people turned up to participate.</para><para>Some commentators have dismissed those protesting against developments of these kinds as protagonists who do not like change or are anti-progress, but in the case of Scarborough Beach this seems not to be the case. The SOS slogan is `Development Yes. High-rise No', and they advocate a maximum height restriction of four storeys for buildings along the beach. That does not sound to me like a group who want things to stay exactly as they are. As a past councillor and now a federal parliamentarian, I fully support the notion that to protest is the democratic right of every Australian. I applaud those people who have the passion, the dedication and the drive to organise themselves into coherent and cohesive lobby groups to oppose that with which they may agree to disagree.</para><para>I was surprised to learn that, prior to making its decision to support high-rise development, the council had not undertaken any comprehensive opinion gathering and that the results of that which it had done were never disclosed. So I undertook to do this myself. As a Democrat senator for Western Australia I have sent out some 22,000 questionnaires to City of Stirling ratepayers. I will not pre-empt what the outcome of that survey might be, because we want and expect it to be balanced and because the responses are still flooding in—we had more than 300 questionnaires returned to my office in the first two days of the mail-out.</para><para>Many of those received noted that this is the first time they have been asked for a view on the proposed redevelopment. Others made the direct statement that they do not want Scarborough Beach to become a kind of Gold Coast of the west. We have heard from all age groups, including people who have lived in the area for up to 55 years. The responses and anecdotal feedback we have received include the following comments: `The council only seeks residents' views in the hope that they are the same as the decisions they have already made,' `Developers should not be allowed to override the wishes of the people who live in the area' and `This is the same behind-the-scenes modus operandi as with the Observation City development in the mid-eighties'—a reference to an Alan Bond built 16-storey tower constructed at Scarborough in the 1980s.</para><para>Further comments included: `I think the beach could be more friendly for families with more amenities but not with high-rises.' Others said yes to redevelopment but without the Gold Coast look. Another said: `I am absolutely horrified that the council can do this. It is against what most people want. People want development, but not high-rises.' Further feedback suggested that all shires need redevelopment or improvement but this should never take from the local environment nor change the atmosphere and continuity of the district. Further comments included: `Please, no high-rise development on the beach. We can develop without spoiling the beach and environs'—and so on. Perhaps now is the time to look at an overarching and integrated mechanism for dealing with and progressing developments along Australia's precious and fragile coastline fringe. </para><para>Development along the shoreline involves competing interests and arouses different passions. Locals want change without losing character. Developers want value for money and certainty in process. Beach users want access and the assurance that urban growth does not overshadow urban freedom. Councillors want to balance growth with character, recognising the pressures to accommodate a growing population and demand for beach frontage, but are accountable to a community that is suspicious of unexplained change and anxious for consultation. Environmentalists want protection of sand dunes and water quality, while recognising the pressures of the retiree demographic and the power of the dollar. State governments are keen to illustrate a business-friendly ethos but with an eye to an electorate that is passionate about preserving the simple things that make shorelines so appealing.</para><para>This mix of local and state governments, new ideas and old values requires some guidance, some order and a sense of process. It is time to work towards such a process whereby everybody, within reason, can have their say on development proposals that strike deeply into the sunburnt psyche of many Australians. It is not enough to leave beachfront development to beachfront councils; the decisions they make are often short-term and parochial, while the outcome they create is long-term and national. My plea is for a national wake-up call to all those in public office to recognise the unique beauty and value of the Australian coastline, and to take steps now to regulate its development through criteria that meet with reasonable support and forethought. Ideally, this could include a state governed coastline development formula, with involvement from local government that does not give it absolute power. Overarching this could be Commonwealth oversight that could serve as an avenue of appeal for those aggrieved by any joint state-local government decision. Let us bring a streamlined whole-of-community approach, including architectural and environmental expertise and input from citizens and ratepayers as well as developers and investors to ensure the best for our beaches.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Vietnamese Community in Australia</title><page.no>23635</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>23635</page.no><name role="metadata">Tchen, Sen Tsebin</name><name role="display">Senator TCHEN</name><name.id>86Y</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—United Nations Security Council resolution 1500 marked a watershed in the world's recognition of the importance of the war in Iraq as part of the war on terrorism. Until this unanimous expression of world opinion, it had become increasingly commonplace for a parallel to be drawn between the Iraq war and the Vietnam War. Indeed, as far back as the beginning of 2003 that parallel was being drawn. I recall that my first experience of that parallel being drawn was in February 2003 when I attended the lunar new year festival, the Tet Festival, in Springvale, Victoria, where the then Leader of the Opposition used his address on this festive occasion to warn about embarking on a new Vietnam War. It was a rather incongruous gesture on his part, since most of his audience were refugees from that unfortunate country, but it has not stopped other people from drawing similar parallels since then.</para></talk.start><para>Of course, there are parallels to be drawn between the Iraq war and the Vietnam War. In particular, they are both part of a wider conflict: Vietnam as part of the war against communism and Iraq as part of the war against terrorism. Hopefully we will see another parallel come to pass in due course when democracy triumphs against terrorism as it did against communism. There are just over 150,000 Australians who have at least one parent born in Vietnam. These people are the true victims of the Vietnam War. They were uprooted and expelled from their home country by their own people to make a new life in Australia, quite often making very good contributions to the community they now call home. Nevertheless, these people with their experience of the Vietnam War have never been called on by the people who are interested in drawing parallels with the war in Iraq to make comment about their experiences, just as nobody that I know of who complains about Australia's participation in this war in Iraq has ever thought of asking the opinions of the more than 30,000 Iraqis who live in Australia by grace of the regime of Saddam Hussein about Saddam Hussein and the justness of the war in Iraq. </para><para>But I do not want to talk about the Iraq war tonight; I want to talk about the Vietnamese Australians who are the true victims of the Vietnam War. The Vietnamese Australians have often been the most hurt by inaccurate depictions of the Vietnam War in history textbooks and public statements by politicians and media commentators, particularly at this time when they are pleased to draw the parallel between this past conflict and the current one we are involved in. The way it is portrayed is that Vietnamese Australians are usually described as being people on the side of the bad guys, the bad guys being the Americans and the Australians who should not have been there. They are described as people who worked for these bad guys or who supported a corrupt regime which could not sustain itself and then fled when it was overthrown by a principled revolution.</para><para>From the Vietnamese Australians' point of view, these are lies and half-truths which have victimised their community's sense of identity, particularly that of their families and the younger generations who were born in Australia. There is consistent concern amongst the older generation that, if perpetuated, this could damage their grandchildren's view about their parents and grandparents. I have received a letter from Dr Tien Nguyen, President of the Vietnamese Community in Australia, putting the view of the Vietnamese community about this propaganda. His letter to me says:</para><quote><para>As we see it, the Vietnam War was a just war. It was the South defending itself against the North's ambition to grab its riches and to expand communist authoritarianism. South Vietnam lost, not because its soldiers were incapable or because communism was a principled cause, but because the West withdrew military supplies while Hanoi kept getting theirs from China and the Soviet Union.</para><para>The nightmares South Vietnam fought to prevent have now become reality. The Communist victors jailed more than a million people ...</para></quote><para>This is not a fictitious claim. I have here a comment by the then Vietnamese Prime Minister, Pham Van Dong, being quoted by Jean-Claude Labbe of the <inline font-style="italic">Paris Match</inline> in September 1978, shortly after the fall of Vietnam. He said:</para><quote><para>... we have liberated more than one million people who were guilty of collaborating with the enemy one way or another.</para></quote><para>The Communist regime had `liberated' one million people who had cooperated with the enemy! That liberation was by jailing them and putting them in correctional work camps. They killed thousands, they flattened southern soldiers' cemeteries and declared that all lands belonged to the Communist Party. Dr Nguyen went on to say:</para><quote><para>The regime is consistently among Asia's 3 most corrupt. Party bosses have amassed at least hundreds of millions of dollars. After 14 years of damaging policies, then 15 years of repair and billions in aid, per capita GDP is back to South Vietnam's pre-1975 levels.</para></quote><para>That is not taking into account inflation. He continued: </para><quote><para>Yet the many who loudly denounced Saigon or praised Hanoi, are now deafeningly silent. And, as the Iraq War debate goes on, many of the old untruths about the Vietnam War are <inline font-style="italic">again</inline> being repeated.</para></quote><para>That is a matter that I think is of concern to all of us. While history never exactly repeats itself, we seem to have a habit of repeating the mistakes of history. Those people who like to draw parallels between the war in Iraq and the Vietnam War should be reminded that in fact many of the concerns which we had about Communist domination in Vietnam—that it would create a domino effect and other concerns—and which are today fashionably considered untrue were valid. Let me repeat something said by someone who should know—Lee Kuan Yew—stating that in fact the Vietnam War was necessary to protect our way of life. He said about Vietnam's impact on Singapore and the ASEAN region:</para><quote><para>Although American intervention failed in Vietnam, it bought time for the rest of Southeast Asia. In 1965, when the US moved massively into South Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines faced internal threats from armed communist insurgencies and the communist underground was still active in Singapore ... America's action enabled non-communist Southeast Asia to put their own houses in order. By 1975, they were in better shape to stand up to the communists. Had there been no US intervention, the will of these countries to resist them would have melted and Southeast Asia would most likely have gone communist. The prosperous emerging market economies of ASEAN were nurtured during the Vietnam War years.</para></quote><para>This is from the book <inline font-style="italic">From Third World to First—The Singapore Story: 1965-2000</inline> by Mr Lee Kuan Yew, published by HarperCollins in 2000. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Education: Victoria</title><page.no>23637</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>23637</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to talk about the visit I made to two primary schools in the last two weeks in Melbourne—both very remarkable and very different schools. I was invited to go to the Huntingdale Primary School as part of Back to School Day. Huntingdale is a very small school of about 160 students. What makes it different is that it is a bilingual school. Learning is conducted in the school in Japanese as well as English. It is one of the few bilingual schools in Victoria.</para></talk.start><para>Japanese strikes me as being quite a difficult language to learn because of the characters and because of the sounds—and this is possibly true of most Asian languages. Nonetheless, the children at the school take to Japanese and to learning in Japanese—not just Japanese language but other subjects as well—like the proverbial ducks to water. As you would expect, there were a number of children for whom Japanese was their first language. But I was also struck by the very many children who were there from other countries, for whom both Japanese and English would be second, third or even fourth languages.</para><para>It has become a school which is attractive to parents and to children who value the whole concept of education in more than one language. There are students there, as I said, from many other countries around the world, which means that they have very effective English as a second language classes, year 1 intervention programs and so on. I was struck by the extent to which these young people were confident and very comfortable in using two languages and was convinced that their education was being benefited by the fact that this school was bilingual.</para><para>Parents have sought out this school for that reason too. It obviously has a very strong commitment to aiming high, which is, in fact, the school's motto. They have 2½ hours a week of Japanese language teaching and they have five hours a week of lessons in other subjects that are conducted in Japanese. They have a Japanese performing arts program. When I was there I watched a drama group rehearsing in Japanese for a play. I was also lucky enough to see a performance by the drum club in the school with amazing Japanese drums that are beaten with very large, club-like instruments. It was a truly amazing performance that these young people put on. They employ native Japanese-speaking teachers at the school and they also have young teachers who come to Australia as volunteers to work in the school. This is such an unusual learning experience—and teaching experience, I would imagine—that it has attracted these young teachers to come and work with the children. </para><para>The school has a sister city relationship with Otaki in Japan. Students, I understand, go on exchange visits to Japan on quite a regular basis and at quite a young age. The school has been bilingual since 1997. I understand it receives a small amount of extra funding from the state government in order to run that program. However, what it has not received from the government is funding for urgently needed capital works. This is a 50-year-old school. It looked to me as if it was constructed as a lightweight, temporary building 50 years ago. It desperately needs funding to expand, because there are more students now who wish to go there. But, like so many other government schools, it does not have what most people would regard as the most basic facility. It does not have a multipurpose indoor space for assemblies, performances or physical education. In fact, at the present time a double classroom is put together for that purpose, so the kids must be crammed in if there is an assembly. The space is neither flexible nor useful and is not what we would regard as a minimum standard for any school.</para><para>The classrooms are 50 years old and are very cramped. I went into one grade 5/6 classroom. There was, I estimate, less than a metre of space between the blackboard and the first row of desks. It did not seem to daunt the students in that room, who were very confidently able to engage in discussions about democracy, the parliament and current issues. They were very well informed and amazingly bright. But I wondered how much better a school like this might do if they had spaces which were flexible, comfortable and spacious. I also wondered if any non-government schools would regard this environment as being anything close to a reasonable standard. I think they would not. If we were able to properly fund learning environments in such schools we would see even greater innovation, even better outcomes, an even more satisfactory learning experience for children and a much easier teaching environment for the teachers at those schools.</para><para>I also visited the Derrimut Heath Primary School, which is a much larger school in the growing suburb of Hoppers Crossing, just out of Melbourne. It has extraordinarily good facilities—a great multipurpose centre and terrific classrooms—and an amazing bunch of teachers who do a terrific job with students who are very bright. When I was there, a year 5/6 debate took place in the assembly hall. In this debate I found young people who would run rings around many of the debaters even in this place. Their subject was `children should make rules for children', so it was very much focused on the question of democracy and the age at which young people can start to make decisions about what affects them. I adjudicated this debate. Sadly we had to find a loser and a winner, but they all deserve enormous praise for the way in which it was conducted.</para><para>This was obviously not a one-off for my benefit. These are the subjects that these young people are accustomed to talking about in this school. I asked them what it meant to be a leader, because one of the topics they wanted to talk about was leadership. Without any hesitation these young people put their hands in the air and offered up characteristics which to them were important in leadership—things like confidence, concern for other students, politeness, kindness and being well informed. The list went on and on. In other words, these are young people who have learned and engaged in the process of thinking about values in our society. It struck me that schools like this become denigrated when politicians, prime ministers and others go out and talk about government schools and the lack of values therein. In just two schools I have seen in the last two weeks—and I go to many schools and I can cite many other examples of this—values are being taught. Values are extremely important in these schools. It is not fair to the parents, the teachers or the children to suggest otherwise. </para><para>There is enormous innovation and a great sense of optimism in young people who are in both our primary and our secondary schools at the present time. I think there has been an enormous improvement in teaching, in pedagogy, in understanding what is being learned and in engaging with young people in such a way that they can fully participate in the learning process. I am enormously impressed with the work that is being done out there. I just hope that others in this place will take the opportunity to visit schools and see what is going on—not just go to private schools where there is money laid on to pay for facilities and all of the trappings that go with a private education but also go to government schools, because some of the best education in this country is being conducted in government schools. It is time in this place that we acknowledged and celebrated that and congratulated those schools on what they are able to achieve and the way they do it. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Agriculture: Apple and Pear Industry</title><page.no>23639</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>23639</page.no><name role="metadata">Watson, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WATSON</name><name.id>VJ4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, tonight I wish to address the concerns surrounding the proposed quarantine controls, which may not provide adequate protection from the introduction of fire blight and other pests and diseases, a matter for which I know you have a great deal of sympathy as a former producer. There is fear that fire blight could destroy Australia's apple and pear industry—an industry which has particular importance to Tasmania, which is often referred to as the Apple Isle.</para></talk.start><para>What is fire blight? It is a destructive bacterial disease for which there appears to be no effective treatment. It appears that it can kill entire orchards of apples and pears in a matter of weeks and it can also affect loquat, quince, hawthorn and other ornamental plants. It is particularly voracious and it has been called the foot-and-mouth disease of the horticultural industry, as you well know, Mr President. It causes a long-term reduction in the bearing capacity of trees by killing fruit spurs and destroying the wood which bears fruit the following season. The only treatment available to deal with fire blight requires repeated applications of an antibiotic which is not only expensive but not presently registered for use in Australia. It provides no guarantee that it will permanently eradicate the disease.</para><para>At the moment, Australia is fire blight free. However, Australia is at risk because New Zealand wants to export apples to us that may carry the disease. If this were allowed, Australia would be very vulnerable to the disease, as our climatic conditions are very favourable to it. Australian farmers are happy to compete in international markets. However, they do not want to run the risk of introducing a disease such as fire blight. If fire blight were to get in then Australia's $320 million a year apple and pear industry could be decimated. This not only would affect fruit growers but would also impact on canneries, distributors and transport businesses and would result in disastrous job losses in regional towns. </para><para>One study has estimated that the economic costs to Australia could be $922 million over six years and that Victoria's Goulburn Valley could face a loss of up to 90 per cent of its pear orchards. A similar result was predicted for the Stanthorpe area in Queensland. In my home state of Tasmania and yours, Mr President, the costs of fighting an outbreak of fire blight would probably mean the end for the majority of apple and pear growers.</para><para>The Tasmanian apple industry has a gross value of approximately $70 million and produces around three million cartons or 55,000 tonnes of apples annually. The industry directly employs approximately 1,000 workers as well as a substantial number of seasonal and/or casual workers. The Tasmanian industry accounts for approximately 18 per cent of the total Australian production but 65 per cent of the total of Australian apple exports, so that is a significant figure. Tasmania gained access to the important Japanese market in 2001 approximately, which at the time was worth approximately $2 million annually to the industry. At that stage, growth potential of up to 50 per cent per year for at least the next 10 years was forecast, with a future potential of up to $20 million to Tasmanian growers. The Tasmanian apple industry gained access to the Japanese market for one particular variety based mainly on the industry's disease-free status, as Tasmania has fruit fly free status. Tasmania exports apples to over 20 countries, including Japan.</para><para>There are numerous organisations relying on the sustainable future of the apple and pear industry for their own future sustainability in the Tasmanian market. The industry sources the majority of packing materials, such as cartons and trays, from Amcor Fibre Packaging. This company maintains a fairly substantial presence both in my home town of Launceston and in the Huon and relies heavily on the apple and pear industry for its continued viability within Tasmania. Other organisations and industries that are reliant on the apple and pear industry within Tasmania include transport companies—for example, Edwards Transport—fuel companies, nursery suppliers, beekeepers, spray and fertiliser companies—such as Serve-Ag—and pallet suppliers. Of importance also is the fact that people and small business operators located within the growing regions rely heavily on the industry for employment and as their customer base.</para><para>The potential risk of fire blight is of particular concern to the beekeeping industry, as bees are vectors for the disease and carry fire blight spores. If fire blight were introduced into Australia, there would be a need to quarantine bees and to seek out feral bee colonies in order to stop the spread of the disease. This process would add considerably to the beekeepers' costs.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BOT</name.id><name role="metadata">Santoro, Sen Santo</name><name role="display">Senator Santoro</name></talker><para>—It would be an enormous challenge.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>VJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">Watson, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WATSON</name></talker><para>—Yes, it is important to the Stanthorpe region, Senator Santoro. In the event that Tasmania's crops were subjected to an imported virulent disease such as fire blight, the economic impact on the growing areas and for the whole state really would be quite enormous—for example, approximately $13 million in direct industry wages is currently injected into the Tasmanian economy from this industry. It is likely that most of this would be lost within a very short space of time, creating a significant downturn in employment and economic stability throughout the state, particularly when coupled with the indirect impact on those groups reliant on the industry. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The important thing is that Tasmania's climate, with the majority of the annual rainfall occurring during the spring period, makes the state particularly susceptible to the establishment and ongoing infection of fire blight. Also of concern is the vulnerability to fire blight of two relatively new varieties of apples—namely, Pink Lady and Jonagold—which have been extensively planted throughout Tasmania's main apple-producing regions.</para><para>It is estimated that if fire blight were to become established in Tasmanian orchards there would be up to 30 per cent of production lost to this disease within five years. Consumers in Tasmania and the rest of the country would also feel the effects if fire blight were introduced. There would be reduced yields of fruit, increased production costs as a consequence and ultimately higher prices passed on to consumers. Supplies of both fresh and canned Australian fruit would also be reduced. It is also more likely that any fruit we import from countries which have fire blight will have been sprayed with chemicals that are not registered in Australia. There is therefore no way of telling what effects these chemicals could have on the health of Australians.</para><para>For growers Australia wide, the effects really would be disastrous. As I have said, production could be reduced by at least 25 per cent in one season and consultants have estimated that one grower in three would be bankrupted as a result. Further bad news is that net returns to apple growers could fall by as much as 25 per cent and net returns to pear growers by as much as 40 per cent. Production costs are also likely to increase to take into account measures to prevent and control the disease. Pruning programs would need to be implemented in order to remove the infected limbs and, possibly, entire trees.</para><para>As I have already mentioned, the antibiotic treatment which is used in other countries is not presently registered in Australia. So Australia could face losses of current and potential future markets because remaining production would be directed mainly towards the domestic market. Our imports of fresh and canned fruit would also climb to compensate for the reduced supplies in the domestic market. There would also be socioeconomic effects on the major growing and processing areas. I move to its importance in Victoria's Goulburn Valley, which the parliamentary secretary, Senator Troeth, would know about. It is predicted that gross farm income would fall by more than $20 million and cannery intake would fall by something like 65 per cent. It is estimated that 3,500 jobs and 300 permanent jobs would be lost in the apple and pear industry. There would also be other job losses in the order of 1,285 permanent jobs in other industries and businesses associated with the apple and pear industry. It is thought that in the longer term in the Goulburn Valley region alone the net farm income could fall permanently by 55 to 60 per cent—disastrous.</para><para>The apple and pear industry fire blight task force was set up to represent all growers of the industry, and its aim is to keep Australia fire blight free. There is currently a draft Biosecurity Australia import risk assessment report that could allow apple imports from New Zealand subject to strict quarantine controls. Biosecurity is of the view that the measures contained in the draft report are tough enough to deal with the pests and to protect Australia's disease free status. However—as you well know, Mr President—Tasmanian apple growers are not convinced and neither am I. If New Zealand apples are allowed in, the move will end an 83-year ban. According to the Tasmanian Apple and Pear Growers Association, there are only about three countries, including Australia, which do not have fire blight, and they are not comfortable with the measures that Biosecurity Australia is proposing. I hope that as a Senate we will reject the measures. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Reagan, Mr Ronald</title><page.no>23642</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>23642</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>NATS</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have been prompted by the previous speaker, Senator Santoro, to add my remarks of remembrance of the passing of the 40th President of the United States, and the most popular President ever known in the United States, Ronald Reagan. First of all, I would like to thank the Reagan family, who shared with the world a very public funeral service. They of course were grieving a father, whilst we were in many respects grieving and commemorating one of the great leaders of the free world, who acted decisively at a very crucial time in history. Of course we came to know him as a good and decent man also. The Reagan family led by example. The family of Ron, Patti, Michael and of course Ronald's much loved wife Nancy were simply inspirational during that whole week of grief and commemoration in America, from the east coast to the west coast. The family members, whenever they spoke, spoke with words of great hope. They were uplifting words for all those who listened. Their manner was just so stoic, and their faith was indeed real.</para></talk.start><para>The United States itself showed a genuine sadness for the passing of their former President, be it that he was 93. I think the current President, George Bush, put it superbly when he said that we just cannot let go of him, although he may have said his goodbyes some 10 years ago. As I said, the United States were genuine in their sadness. Their tribute was deep and heartfelt. Every step taken during the rituals and the funeral service was so genuine.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BOT</name.id><name role="metadata">Santoro, Sen Santo</name><name role="display">Senator Santoro</name></talker><para>—And dignified.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name></talker><para>—Thank you, Senator Santoro. It was indeed dignified. It showed the fondness that they had for their former commander in chief. It was a United States presidency showing all its triumph, its dignity and its grace. If it is ever said that President Reagan restored the respect and dignity of America at a time when it was at its lowest ebb, he also did it in his death and in the funeral service. I was also very struck by the speeches and the remarks of the leaders in Washington. Former President Bush, current President Bush, former Prime Minister of Canada Mulroney, Margaret Thatcher, a dear friend of the former president, and Gorbachev—all of them spoke with quite an open and passionate religious tone to everything they said. It was refreshing, and something Australia does not do as often or as openly as the United States does. Their words were, as I say, passionate, religious and uplifting for all those who do believe.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In fact it really did renew the spirit to continue the fight, to not yield in our new war, the war on terror, and to reject those same old voices—even if they are new voices just dressed up in another way—of moral equivalence that those during the Cold War were trying to subject upon us and which are being subjected upon us again in this time of the war on terrorism. It is the same old voices and the same old types that Ronald Reagan had to endure. If his passing has renewed that spirit to reject the moral equivalence of the evil that comes towards the free world and the democratic world then I would have to say that Ronald Reagan's passing was timely and timed perfectly—as he did with most things in his life. He would consider it as, equally, one of his greatest achievements.

The project to complete St John's Cathedral in Brisbane—the cathedral of the Anglican community in Queensland—and the Walking Together project at Longreach in the state's central west are both deserving of recognition and support.</para></talk.start><para>St John's Cathedral is the last Gothic cathedral to be built anywhere in the world. It is at a critical phase. After a decade of hard work, and with generous support from all arms of government, from cathedral parishioners and supporters and private benefactors, completion of this ambitious project is within sight. More than $18.5 million in work has been undertaken and funded. It has become essential to complete this work by the end of 2006, because this marks the end of the cathedral's service agreement with the English master mason Peter Dare, who has guided the construction of the final stage of the building since 1990.</para><para>Mr Dare has indicated to the cathedral that he wishes to retire to England in 2006, by which time he will have been at work on the building for 16 years. The Dean of Brisbane, the Very Reverend John Parkes, tells me Mr Dare's work has been absolutely vital to the outstanding quality of this building phase. Because of his retirement plans, the rate of construction must be greatly accelerated. Obviously this has significant implications for cash flow. As a result of this new imperative, the cathedral is seeking additional government support to enable it to meet the schedule. It is seeking $4 million from the Commonwealth, $2 million from the Queensland government and $1 million from Brisbane City Council over the next two financial years.</para><para>It was my very great privilege last week to visit the cathedral with the Minister for the Arts and Sport, my friend Senator the Hon. Rod Kemp, in pursuit of facilitating the cathedral's quest for support. I wish to thank Senator Kemp for his most empathetic and generous attitude towards a project which he was able to see in its full glory. I have this week delivered to Senator Kemp, to the Prime Minister, to the Treasurer, to another distinguished member of this chamber, Senator the Hon. Nick Minchin, the Minister for Finance and Administration, and to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage a submission from the cathedral prepared for the Cathedral Completion Fundraising Board by Brisbane architect Michael Kennedy. It is a good submission in a great cause.</para><para>The completion of St John's is more than just the completion of a building—as Mr Kennedy says so eloquently in his submission. It is the realisation of a dream that has been central to Brisbane's religious and cultural life for 115 years. The commitment and the result to this point have been tremendous. But financial support is a finite thing and, despite the efforts of the cathedral's fundraisers, funds raised have levelled out at around $1.1 million a year. With only this amount of funding the earliest the cathedral could be completed is 2012—and it is in fact unlikely ever to be completed, since escalating costs and inflation will force construction to cease. The proposal now is that financial assistance be granted by the three levels of government to ensure that completion of the structure—except the west front spires and the central tower—can be achieved by the end of 2006 at a cost of $9.3 million. This figure includes donations from the faithful and others above the requested government contributions.</para><para>The fundraising board that has been so hard at work grew from the commitment of the former Archbishop of Brisbane, the Most Reverend Dr Peter Hollingworth, whose enthusiasm and drive encouraged others to participate. The `Final Drive' campaign began in 1997 under the leadership of Brisbane businessman Mr Steven Wilson. He remains in an active advisory position today, having passed the leadership to another prominent Brisbane benefactor and businessman Mr John Allpass, who took over the job in 2001. Of course, we cannot forget those who preceded Mr Wilson and Mr Allpass, including the late Sir John Nosworthy, the foundation chairman of the cathedral completion committee, and the late John Earnshaw, also a past chairman of the committee who was always ably and staunchly supported by his equally dedicated wife, Mary.  </para><para>The other members of the fundraising board are the Archbishop, the Most Reverend Dr Phillip Aspinall; the Dean, the Very Reverend John Parkes; Mr Ken Talbot, who recently retired but continues to be involved in an advisory role; Mr Tim Fairfax; Mr Peter Hollingworth; the Reverend Canon Len Nairn; Mr Tim Samway; Mr Ian Walker; Mr Greg Vickery; Mr Bob Bryan, more recently in an advisory role; Ms Sallyanne Atkinson, a former Lord Mayor of Brisbane; Mr Ross Dunning; and Mrs Peter Nagle, as fundraising director. They are all very distinguished Queenslanders and working hard in the interests of a very great cause. We also cannot forget people who work tirelessly in other voluntary capacities. For example, there is Mrs Susan Blue, one of the original, if not the original, convenors of the Loaves and Fishes luncheon, a magnificent luncheon held every year within the cathedral precincts—in fact, inside the cathedral—which is just an absolute delight to attend. There is also Dr Patsy Quayle, who for many years was the Chairman of the Friends of the Cathedral and who, with the support of her husband, John, is a tremendous stalwart in the interests of the cathedral. Another is Mrs Barbara Nicholls. These people work tirelessly and bring great assistance to the effort I have been talking about tonight. In addition to the Brisbane fundraising board, a committee raising funds in Sydney for the cathedral's completion is led by Mr Geoffrey Underwood and Mr Bill Hayward. Collectively, the board and Sydney committee members have pledged $3.4 million to the project.</para><para>The master mason Peter Dare has brought new—or perhaps long lost—skills into Australia. He has lectured extensively and given freely of his time and skills. He deserves, as a true friend of Australia, to be recognised in this place. The completion of St John's Cathedral is a unique project for three reasons. Everyone working on site, from stonemasons to building supervisors, architects and clerical and religious officers, is actively engaged in the continuation of late 19th century building practices. The project is the contemporary completion of a 19th century architectural design conceptualised by John Loughborough Pearson, the pre-eminent church architect of Victorian England. No other original Victorian Gothic cathedral is under construction anywhere in the world. Pearson's design connects St John's to late 19th century British ecclesiastical buildings and, through that connection, to mediaeval European architectural tradition. I commend the project to the Senate and invite honourable senators to take an interest in this unique work of monumental art.</para><para>The other inspirational project that I want to mention tonight is something I have spoken about in the Senate before—the `Walking Together' project in Longreach. This is a project that has cast and erected in the grounds of the Australian Stockman's Hall of Fame at Longreach a statue to honour the memory of pioneer women. It depicts two girls—one Indigenous, one non-Indigenous—walking together in friendship. The winds of change blow in their hair and they look towards the future with confidence. That is a great message. The women of the inland have always carried the great load of nurturing and homemaking, and right from the start of European settlement they worked together to create a better life for all. We should honour the women who pioneered today's Australia—settler and Aboriginal alike. </para><para>Project chairman Rosemary Champion, of Longway station, Longreach, tells me they still need to find some money to complete this memorial. It is not a lot of money—except to people who do not have any to spare; it is just $5,000. Mrs Champion and the honorary secretary of the Central Western Queensland Branch of the Australian Stockman's Hall of Fame and Outback Heritage Centre, Gwen Rogers, of Glendon station, Longreach, are looking to finalise the donors plaque. As I told the Senate on 4 December 2003, the organising committee chose Dr Rhyl Hinwood of Brisbane from 12 outstanding sculptors throughout Australia.</para><para>The project was commenced in 2002 with funds bequeathed from the estate of Betty Bunkell Wakely and the estate of Mrs Rose McKenzie, originally of Rosebank, Longreach, and with funds raised by the Central Western Queensland Branch of the ASHF. The organisers' imperative is to bring their project to a successful and full conclusion. I believe our imperative in this place is to applaud the Walking Together project and to congratulate its organisers—people who by definition look forward with confidence to the future—and to do whatever we can to be of assistance to them.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 11.01 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>23645</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>23645</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following government documents were tabled:</para><quote><para>Australian Broadcasting Authority—Online content co-regulatory scheme—Report for the periods January to June 2002, July to December 2002 and January to June 2003.</para><para>Australian National University—Report for 2003.</para><para>Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency—Quarterly report for the period 1 October to 31 December 2003.</para><para>Australian River Co.

At its April 2003 meeting, PIMC agreed to a risk-based approach to the development and implementation of a national system for livestock identification and tracing. It comprises a number of complementary, mechanisms ranging from individual animal identification (such as the existing National Livestock Identification Scheme (NLIS) for cattle and National Flock Identification Scheme (NFIS) for sheep) through to herd/flock-based arrangements. The new system is called the National Livestock Identification System (Cattle) or National Livestock Identification System (Sheep), as appropriate. </para><para>(2)	In deciding upon this approach, a number of options were considered. These include: compulsory, individual identification for all cattle (that is, adoption of the NLIS); an NLIS system with modifications based on risk management criteria; and compulsory, individual identification for export cattle only. The risk-based approach agreed to by PIMC is designed to accommodate the practical differences between the extensive northern pastoral systems and the more intensive southern production systems.</para><para>(3)	There has been no expenditure by the Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (the Department) on feasibility studies on national livestock identification systems. Part of the $6.372 million spent by Meat and Livestock Australia Ltd (MLA) from 2001/02 to 2002/03 and the $1.996 million budgeted for 2003/04, on development of the NLIS is derived from the Australian Government matching contributions to research and development. In addition, in 2001-02, with the agreement of the Red Meat Advisory Council, the Australian Government released $1.3 million in red meat industry funds held over by the Department from the initial capitalisation of MLA for the purposes of funding enhancements to the NLIS database. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Murrumbidgee Valley</title><page.no>23651</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1168)</subtitle><id.no>1168</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>23651</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, upon notice, on 17 February 2003:</para></talk.start><quote><para>With reference to the Minister's joint statement of 11 February 2003, reference AFFA03/023WTJ, regarding the $5.3 million water saving pilot program in the Murrumbidgee Valley:</para></quote><para>(1)	What are the specific stated objectives of the pilot program as presented to the Commonwealth by Pratt Water and upon which Commonwealth funding was approved.</para><para>(2)	Can a copy be provided of the Pratt Water proposal upon which Commonwealth funding was approved; if not, why not.</para><para>(3)	What is the total budgeted cost of the pilot program.</para><para>(4)	Which Commonwealth departments are contributing to the funding of the pilot program; and (b) how much will each department contribute.</para><para>(5)	Which non-government organisations or individuals are contributing to the pilot program and what is their budgeted contribution.</para><para>(6)	(a) When will the pilot program commence; and (b) when is it due to be completed.</para><para>(7)	In relation to the joint media statement, which quotes Mr Pratt as saying that his company has contributed significant resources to get the proposal to its current stage of development and is contributing key staff to manage the project': (a) what is the quantum and exact type of resources Mr Pratt is referring to; (b) what is the number of staff Pratt Water will contribute to the management of this project; and (c) what are the names and qualifications of those staff.</para><para>(8)	Where exactly in the Murrumbidgee Valley the pilot program will be conducted.</para><para>(9)	(a) What consultations have been undertaken with residents within the Murrumbidgee Valley; and (b) who will be affected by the pilot program.</para><para>(10)	If no consultations have yet taken place: (a) when will these consultations take place; and (b) how will these consultations be conducted. </para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>23652</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	The feasibility study has two prime objectives:</para><para>	to prepare a full feasibility or `business case' for future investment by public and private investors in water savings within the case study area - the Murrumbidgee River System in southern NSW; and</para><para>	as a pilot study, provide lessons and analysis that may be applied more broadly in considering water savings investments in other areas of NSW and in developing a national approach to water savings.</para><para>(2)	A copy of the Pratt Water report, “Water in the Murrumbidgee Valley”, publicly released in August 2002, is available on Pratt Water's website.</para><para>(3)	The Murrumbidgee Valley Water Efficiency Feasibility Project has a total public contribution of up to $5.3 million, shared between the Australian and New South Wales Governments.</para><para>(4)	The feasibility study is being funded through the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality (NAP), which is appropriated to the Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry.

Specific sites include Tumut River, Murrumbidgee/Mirrool Creek, Yanco Creek, MIA and Coleambally Irrigation Areas and Barren Box Swamp. </para><para>(9)	(a) Since the project commenced, in excess of 80 public addresses have been given explaining and discussing the project, to a range of stakeholders in the Murrumbidgee Valley. One-on-one discussion has been ongoing and frequent, particularly within the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area and Coleambally Irrigation Area. Communication of the project's objectives and activities has also occurred through project bulletins, newspaper articles, radio interviews, the public website of the project and office visitors.

The current MLA veterinarian and his predecessors have been working with the operators of the Bassatin abattoir since early 2000 to improve the welfare of cattle slaughtered. The Australian Chief Veterinary Officer wrote to his Egyptian counterpart on 27 June 2003 seeking comments and advice in relation to allegations about Bassatin made by Dr Petra Sidhom in an article published in the June 2003 edition of the Australian Veterinary Journal. A reply to this letter has yet to be received. </para><para>(2)	Officials of my Office and the Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry met with Dr Petra Sidhom in separate meetings in November 2000 where she made general allegations about the treatment of cattle in Egyptian abattoirs and detailed the poor handling of European cattle unloaded at Alexandria. I understand that Dr Sidhom also had meetings during her November 2000 visit to Australia with MLA and Livecorp. Dr Sidhom made specific allegations about the treatment of Australian cattle in the article published in the June 2003 edition of the Australian Veterinary Journal. </para><para>(3)	(a), (b) &amp; (c) I have been informed that the livestock export industry funded the installation in early 2002 of an Australian designed slaughter control box at Bassatin and that the industry has also engaged and continues to engage an expert to advise the operators on improved handling of cattle. I understand that this expert has made a number of visits to Bassatin over the last few months and will make further visits in 2004. An Australian slaughterman has also been engaged to provide training to the local workers. Industry has also engaged in a redevelopment program with the Egyptian Government to upgrade the Bassatin abattoir. This project involves upgrading infrastructure, resurfacing the concrete flooring, modifications to cattle races and major repair work to livestock receival compounds to ensure the safe transition of animals through the facility. This investment by industry has had the effect of improving the welfare and handling of cattle processed through the abattoir. This information has been provided by Livecorp and is on the public record.</para><para>	On 18 July 2003, Minister Vaile and I jointly announced that the Australian Government and the livestock exporting industry would commit $150,000 to a project aimed at improving animal handling in the Middle East and North Africa, $100,000 from industry and $50,000 from the Government. This initiative has complemented the existing programs of the Australian industry with part of this project money being used to help fund the above concrete floor work.</para><para>	In addition to this combined industry and Australian Government project, I understand that the Egyptian government has allocated A$250,000 to upgrade facilities at other parts of Bassatin abattoir not traditionally used to process Australian cattle, thus broadening the impact of the Australian initiatives. </para><para>	Following the broad-ranging investigation into Australia's livestock export industry chaired by Dr John Keniry, I recently announced new Australian Government initiatives to improve animal welfare outcomes in the livestock export trade to the Middle East as part of an $11 million response to the Keniry Report. Part of this response includes a $4 million investment to help improve animal welfare practices in importing countries and to upgrade handling procedures. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Area Consultative Committees</title><page.no>23659</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2123)</subtitle><id.no>2123</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>23659</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 18 September 2003:</para></talk.start><quote><para>With reference to the answer to question on notice No. 1688 (Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, 8 September 2003, p. 14580) concerning Area Consultative Committees (ACC):</para></quote><para>(1)	Why have the ACC Handbook and the Governance Manual not been publicly released.</para><para>(2)	Can copies of the ACC Handbook and the Governance Manual be provided; if not, why not.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>23659</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Transport and Regional Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	The ACC Handbook and Governance Manual have been regarded as internal procedural documents that support the ACC Operational funding contract.

It is substantially the same as Senate Supplementary Budget Estimates Question No. 74:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Telstra has advised that during its continual feedback sessions with staff, including Telstra employee opinion surveys and focus groups, the majority of staff had indicated they wanted to know the quality of their customer service and how they were performing in comparison to their peers in all aspects of their job. As a result, some call centres display a team and individual balanced scorecard with a mixture of operational, quality and customer measures. The decision to display performance results varies from call centre to call centre depending on the culture of each individual centre.</para><para>As a tool used for continual improvement, many staff use the information on the reports to enhance their skills by consulting their colleagues who are performing well. To many staff, the displaying of performance outcomes is a visible recognition of a job well done. </para><para>In response to requests from staff, Telstra has advised it will continue to provide this valuable performance information. Staff who have specific concerns about their statistics being displayed can opt out and are encouraged to discuss this with their team leader or manager. The team leader or manager will take action to ensure the staff members' statistics are not viewed by anyone other than the staff member and their team leader. </para><para>(2)	Telstra has advised its call centres use system based rostering tools to match resources to call demand. The inputs to the rostering tool used in the calculation of available staff hours include all tea/meal breaks, team meetings, monthly one on ones, training and centre outages.

Calls will vary in length depending on the complexity of the customer's service related inquiry. </para><para>While operators are appreciative of customers who may wish to thank them for the service they have provided, operators may also be mindful of the need to not keep other customers waiting to have their calls answered.</para><para>In the case of calls to Call Connect (12456), on successfully locating the customer's desired number, the operating system automatically commences dialling the number, disconnecting the operator in the process to allow them to handle the next call they receive.</para><para>(4)	(a) and (b) Telstra has advised that as at November 2003, 55 percent of Telstra's call centre staff are Telstra employees (which is a combination of permanent full-time and permanent part-time employees and casuals). Telstra has advised that as at November 2003, 45 percent of Telstra's call centre staff are from agencies or outsourced providers. </para><para>Telstra has further advised that these percentages are dynamic in that they are driven by the various demands for Telstra's products from its customers based on:</para><para>	“The time of the day” </para><para>	“The day of the week”; and</para><para>	“The time of the year” (seasonal issues). </para><para>Telstra has developed a new form of part time employee called a supplementary worker and it is envisaged that this new employee type will facilitate better customer service outcomes and will aid in servicing Telstra's customers ever changing demands.

There is no evidence of any specific accumulation of uranium in the lymph nodes. When dust containing tiny amounts of DU is inhaled, it is absorbed into the blood stream. Approximately 90 per cent of the uranium is excreted via the urine within a few days. The remaining 10 per cent is stored in organs and tissues, in particular the kidney and bones, but also lungs, liver, lymph and other organs. It is then slowly excreted into the urine over a period of many years. The amount of uranium in the urine depends on the particular uranium compound, time since exposure, where the material is deposited and metabolic factors that influence the rate of transport of uranium within the body and kidney function.</para><para>(e)	Twenty-five personnel have had urinary uranium testing so far. All tests have been normal; that is, less than 70 parts per trillion.</para><para>(f)	The criteria used to determine which personnel have been exposed are outlined in HB 7/2003, annex B, paragraph 5. </para><para>(g)	The global position monitoring data has been made available, but this data is very limited.

The transfer of the responsibilities of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) to an Iraqi Interim Government on 30 June 2004 will not result in an immediate change to the legal basis for ADF personnel in Iraq. Iraq is a member of the Charter of the United Nations and is bound to carry out the decisions of the United Nations Security Council. The incoming Iraqi Interim Government will be bound to abide by the terms of UNSCR 1511 until the resolution is amended or revoked. The UNSCR 1511 mandate for the multinational force, including ADF personnel, will expire after the drafting of a new Iraqi constitution and the holding of elections under that constitution, currently scheduled for the end of 2005.</para><para>(2)	The Transitional Administrative Law was signed by the Iraqi Governing Council on 8 March 2004. The law covers the period between 30 June 2004 and the formation of an elected Iraqi government under a permanent constitution, which shall be no later than 31 December 2005. It recognises the continued application of UNSCR 1511 and the presence of the multinational force after the 30 June 2004 transfer of authority to the Iraqi Interim Government. Article 59 of the Transitional Administrative Law refers to the ongoing presence of a multinational force in Iraq under provisions of UNSCR 1511, while leaving open the option of further UNSCRs covering this issue. </para><para>(3)	UNSCR 1511 does not provide members of the multinational force, including ADF personnel, with immunity from the Iraqi legal process. CPA Order 17 currently provides privileges and immunities for coalition military personnel. The CPA is currently revising Order 17 to ensure its continuity beyond 30 June 2004, when the Iraqi Interim Government will have the power to rescind and amend any orders passed by the CPA. Article 26 of the Transitional Administrative Law provides that the laws issued by the CPA shall remain in force until rescinded or amended by legislation. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Foreign Affairs: Mr Kirk Pinner</title><page.no>23810</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2862)</subtitle><id.no>2862</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>23810</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 21 April 2004:</para></talk.start><quote><para>With reference to matters concerning Mr Kirk Pinner, an Australian citizen:</para></quote><para>(1)	Was the minister informed at any time in 2001 that Mr Pinner's passport had been taken from his possessions at a jail in Idaho, United States of America (US); if so, by whom and when.</para><para>(2)	What action did the minister take.</para><para>(3)	Did the minister inform his department about this Australian citizen and his difficulties in the US; if so, when; if not, why not.</para><para>(4)	Did the department inform its representatives in the US of Mr Pinner's difficulties; if so, when; if not, why not.</para><para>(5)	What advice was Mr Pinner given by Australian departmental representatives in San Francisco in relation to his immigration status in the US, given that he was on bail at the time and that his visa had expired; when was this advice given and by whom.</para><para>(6)	Was he advised to apply for a new passport.</para><para>(7)	Did Mr Pinner inform the Consulate-General in Los Angeles that he was on bail in the US or that he had consulted the Consulate-General in San Francisco when he applied for a new passport.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>23810</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Yes.

He stated that the letter might have been improved if the word “to” had been used instead of the word “or” on the second sentence. However he also noted Mr Cox's own acknowledgement in his original representation that the letter did in fact refer to exchange rates.</para><para>	Mr Cameron also advised in his letter that when customers are granted an Australian benefit they are automatically sent a letter advising of the grant. That letter sets out the obligations of the customer to advise Centrelink whenever their personal or financial circumstances change. Mr Cameron also pointed out that for customers living in Australia who are not comfortable with the English language, Centrelink offers a variety of support facilities. They are encouraged to use the Multicultural Call Centre by telephoning 13 1202, Monday to Friday, between 8am and 5pm.

The ECC is an internal Defence protocol that has been established for those Defence activities that are considered not to have a significant impact on the environment, but still require some degree of management or mitigation.

However, the matters raised in this submission are also relevant to other issues raised in the Department's paper, including Issue 5 (use of in-house lawyers) and Issue 11 (model litigant obligations).</para><para>NADRAC believes that Commonwealth agencies should adopt the most effective dispute resolution practices available both to prevent litigation in the first place and to better manage litigation once commenced. More explicit obligations on agencies in relation to the use of ADR, along with other changes to the Directions suggested in this submission, would help to achieve this. </para><para>NADRAC notes that the Tonge (2003) report found that few Commonwealth agencies reported using ADR. It agrees with the conclusion in the Department's <inline font-style="italic">Federal Civil Justice System Strategy Paper 2003</inline> (the Strategy Paper) that `it seems that there is capacity for the greater use of ADR by Commonwealth agencies' (p139) and believes that the increased use of ADR will help to reduce the level, cost and impact of litigation involving Commonwealth agencies. </para><para>As reported in the Strategy Paper overseas initiatives have effectively promoted the use of ADR by Government agencies. These include the US President's 1996 Executive Order directing agencies to employ ADR techniques and the UK Lord Chancellor's 2001 Pledge to use ADR in all suitable cases. The UK Pledge resulted in a 1200% increase in the use of ADR in 2003-2003 with estimated savings of over 6m. </para><para>Litigation involving Commonwealth agencies is perceived by many people to be often the direct result of either an incapacity or an unwillingness to compromise where such compromise would accord with the Commonwealth's policy and financial interests. The use of ADR, therefore, should not be considered as merely the application of additional formal procedures to the litigation process. ADR needs to be part of a conscious attempt to bring about behavioural, attitude and cultural change in how issues, problems and disputes are managed by Commonwealth agencies. The Directions are one means by which Commonwealth agencies can be encouraged and expected to adopt less adversarial and litigious approaches to dispute resolution.</para><para>The Commonwealth is the biggest single litigator, especially in the federal justice system. By being at the cutting edge of dispute management practices, the Commonwealth can directly promote effective dispute resolution in private business and in the broader community and, through this, contribute towards a less litigious society. </para><para>Through the Directions the Commonwealth can also further enhance the quality and consistency of ADR services, as recommended in NADRAC's 2001 report <inline font-style="italic">A Framework for ADR Standards</inline>. Such enhancement would capitalise on Australia's reputation as a world leader in the development of ADR.</para><para>The Government has indicated its support for the thrust of the recommendations in the ALRC 2000 report, <inline font-style="italic">Managing Justice</inline>, concerning dispute management by Commonwealth agencies, including recommendation 69 that `each federal department and agency should be required to establish a dispute avoidance, management and resolution plan [which] should be consistent with the model litigant rules'. NADRAC agrees with this approach, especially where an agency is involved in the handling of a significant number of claims and disputes.</para><para>NADRAC recognises that government agencies have considerations that may not apply to the same extent in the private sector. These considerations may include, for example, protecting the public interest, legislative constraints, international treaty obligations, parliamentary and public scrutiny, establishing a meaningful prospect of liability, discouraging frivolous claims and the need to create (or avoid) a precedent. These considerations do not reduce the relevance of ADR but require agencies to assess how best to use different forms of ADR at various stages of a matter.  </para><para>In summary, changes to the Legal Services Directions should be an element of a broader strategy involving:</para></quote><para>1.	a focus on the prevention of disputes in the first place</para><para>2.	a commitment to use ADR where disputes occur, both before and during litigation </para><para>3.	improved dispute resolution practices by those involved in Commonwealth litigation and legal services</para><para>4.	the development of high standards of ADR practice, and</para><para>5.	broader whole-of-organisational changes to the prevention, management and resolution of disputes involving Commonwealth agencies.</para><quote><para>Part One of this submission outlines these broader strategies.

Part Three suggests possible practical steps that could be taken to facilitate the implementation of changes to the Directions. </para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Part one: General</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">A focus on dispute prevention</inline></para><quote><para>Commonwealth agencies need to anticipate the types of disputes that may arise and to develop strategies to prevent their occurrence. Although some disputes are beyond the control of the Commonwealth, successful strategies exist that can assist in resolving issues and problems before they become significant `disputes'. These strategies include, for example:</para></quote><para>1.	building the communication, negotiation and conflict resolution skills of people across the agency</para><para>2.	in relation to customer complaints and service charters, empowering front line staff to resolve matters at source wherever possible, without requiring the customer to escalate the matter </para><para>3.	in relation to contracts, the use of partnering, relationship contracting and dispute resolution clauses, and</para><para>4.	in relation to staff conflicts, building the conflict resolution skills of managers and enhancing dispute resolution procedures within certified agreements.</para><quote><para>It is important also to identify and address in a systematic way the factors that drive parties towards or away from litigation. Such factors may involve the agencies themselves, potential litigants and the interaction between them. For example, if the costs and risks of litigation are borne by the legal services section but the costs and risks of settlement by the relevant line area, the line area may not be motivated to avoid litigation. If an agency lacks effective complaints and grievance processes, an aggrieved party may feel that the initiation of legal proceedings is the only means by which they can have their concerns addressed. </para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Commitment to the use of ADR</inline></para><quote><para>Reducing litigation requires a commitment to use ADR from the earliest stage and, wherever possible, prior to formal legal proceedings. In considering the nature of this commitment, a disinction is made between:</para></quote><para>1.	disputes of a `corporate' nature, which arise out of an agency's business role, including transactions with suppliers, customers and employees, and</para><para>2.	legal proceedings that arise out of an agency's public policy and regulatory capacity, that is, its role in representing the interests of the state. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Corporate role</inline></para><quote><para>In disputes of a corporate nature, a commitment to ADR would best be expressed as a general presumption to use ADR, except where clearly inappropriate.  </para><para>The presumptive position creates a perception that the use of ADR is normal and expected, and breaks the nexus between the initiation of, or agreement to use, ADR and a special desire to negotiate or `settle'. A perception remains among some legal practitioners that a decision to use ADR indicates special features about the particular case, for example, that the Commonwealth has doubts about the merits of its case. Agencies may therefore be reluctant to initiate the use of ADR in order to avoid showing `weakness'. Moreover, if the use of ADR is seen as an unusual step by the Commonwealth, a decision to initiate ADR may give rise to unrealistic expectations on the part of other parties. Such expectations may inadvertently decrease the chance of settlement. If seen as an `unusual' step, the motives and rationale behind a decision to use ADR to settle a matter could also be questioned in, for example, a Senate Estimates hearing or the media. </para><para>A binding policy position to use ADR, except in defined cases, gives a clear signal that the Commonwealth is willing to use appropriate methods to clarify issues, and to resolve or limit these issues, even if it is confident about the merits of its position. Such a policy position also provides a degree of protection to agencies and supports their attempts to settle matters out of court.</para><para>ADR may be inappropriate for individual cases on various grounds, such as lack of time, lack of availability of ADR, an unmanageable imbalance of power, an inability to identify the parties to the disputes, entrenched conflict or an assessment that there are no reasonable prospects of satisfactory resolution. Agencies should not automatically dismiss the potential of ADR in such matters, however. In the experience of NADRAC members, ADR has led to successful resolution in matters, where, on face value, this would not have appeared to have been possible. </para><para>In practical terms, the commitment to use ADR would mean that, with respect to disputes of a corporate nature, an agency would: </para></quote><para>	commence legal proceedings itself only after ADR has been initiated and (a) has been declined by the other party or (b) has been attempted without satisfactory resolution</para><para>	where it is the respondent to an application (which is more common), suggest, or agree to participate in, ADR at the earliest possible opportunity</para><para>	continue to explore, support and facilitate the use of ADR at all subsequent stages in the dispute, and</para><para>	in matters where the agency decides that ADR is inappropriate, communicate this position at the earliest possible stage. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Public Policy Role</inline></para><quote><para>In relation to matters involving the public policy role of Commonwealth agencies, the commitment may be better expressed as maximising the potential use of ADR to prevent or limit litigation, within any legislative or policy constraints that apply.</para><para>In many respects, this commitment is already expressed through various statutory and policy frameworks currently in place. For example, native title matters are mediated in the first instance through the National Native Title Tribunal, administrative appeals are subject to the conciliation and mediation procedures of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, international disputes may be subject to treaty obligations that mandate the use of ADR and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission may use various negotiation processes under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). In such situations, Commonwealth agencies need to continue to develop their dispute resolution practices, as outlined in the next section.</para><para>There may also be types of cases where legislation, Government policy or international treaties prevent the use of ADR, at least at an early stage in proceedings. Possible examples include immigration matters, revenue collection, constitutional cases, government regulation and extradition. Some matters, such as differences between Commonwealth agencies, are not subject to litigation and may need to be resolved at a higher level of government. Special considerations may also apply to disputes involving tied areas of legal work (section 2 of the Directions) and significant issues (section 3.1). </para><para>Even where ADR is not regarded as usual practice, however, some form of ADR may well be beneficial for some cases or at particular stages. Agencies therefore need to actively consider such options and use ADR whenever appropriate. </para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Improved dispute management practices by legal services</inline></para><quote><para>The Commonwealth should ensure that its own legal services are at the cutting edge of dispute resolution practice. </para><para>As well as preventing disputes and promoting the early use of ADR, agencies and their legal services need to review a matter at all stages in the litigation process in order to assess the value and likelihood of settlement, and to determine the appropriateness of different forms of ADR to facilitate such settlement. </para><para>Legal services should be familiar with the range and applications of ADR processes, and know when and how to use such processes for different types of disputes. An increasing range and sophistication of ADR processes is now available, including `hybrid' processes that combine facilitative, advisory and determinative approaches. The most appropriate form of ADR needs to be used in the right case and at the right time. ADR can and is used at many stages including the pre-litigation stage, pre- and post-filing, after hearing but prior to judgement, at the appeal stage or after court action is finalised. ADR does not only deal with the substantive elements of a dispute but may be used, for example, to clarify technical issues, streamline procedures or deal with ongoing relationship issues between the parties. In complex disputes ADR may need to be multi-staged. For example, informal methods may be used early to clarify and narrow issues and more formal processes used later to deal with substantive issues. </para><para>Although statutory, policy and other constraints mean that some litigation involving the Commonwealth is unavoidable, NADRAC is of the view that improved dispute resolution skills and practices on the part of those responsible for the conduct of Commonwealth litigation would assist in avoiding or settling disputes at an earlier stage. Such improvements would also enable the Commonwealth to keep pace with practices in the private business sector.</para><para>Court officers, ADR practitioners and legal practitioners have expressed to NADRAC members a degree of concern about the behaviour of Commonwealth agencies as litigants. These concerns include a lack of authority to settle on fair and reasonable terms, and a lack of dispute resolution knowledge and skills on the part of Commonwealth officers and of lawyers engaged by the Commonwealth. As with other large organisations, representatives of Commonwealth agencies may well feel uncomfortable about compromising and may prefer to leave difficult decisions to others, including the courts. The comment has also been made that, in assessing criteria for settlement, Commonwealth agencies and their legal advisers may take an overly narrow view and consider only the direct legal costs of litigation and the probability of success in court. There are many other costs and risks that could legitimately be considered, including loss of time, diversion of management focus and damage to business relationships and reputation.</para><para>Suggested strategies to improve dispute management practices include:</para></quote><para>1.	Build the dispute resolution skills of internal and external legal services. Relevant skills include listening, negotiation, facilitation, problem-solving and advocacy skills suited to the non-court dispute resolution environment. For example, in mediation, the use of open-ended questions by legal representatives, which would be inappropriate in a court setting, may be helpful in uncovering issues underlying the dispute. </para><para>2.	Ensure continuing responsibility on the part of agencies and legal services to explore and promote means to resolve disputes. The engagement of external legal services does not mean that the agency can abdicate its responsibility. Nor can the external legal service assume that the agency has explored all options for settlement prior to engagement. There needs to be continuing discussion between the in-house legal sections and legal service providers about how best to limit litigation or settle the matter, including when and how to use ADR.  </para><para>3.	Select an appropriate person to represent the agency in dispute resolution processes. Such a person needs to be a skilled communicator, be at a sufficiently senior level, have authority to settle and be familiar with the issues. In some situations, however, the person may need to be somewhat removed from the original problem, for example, where the presence of an officer directly involved perpetuates or escalates the dispute. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Facilitating the development of high standards of ADR practice:</inline></para><quote><para>ADR services may be provided to Commonwealth agencies by individuals, or by private and public organisations. As well as building the skills of its own legal services, the Commonwealth can contribute to the development of high standards of practice by working with ADR practitioners and organisations to improve their knowledge and skills in dealing with disputes involving government agencies. Commonwealth agencies could also provide feedback to ADR organisations about the effectiveness of different ADR approaches, which would assist the development of improved practices on the part of ADR practitioners.</para><para>NADRAC believes that the development of ADR standards is critical to its acceptance and effectiveness in all disputes, including those involving Commonwealth agencies. The Commonwealth can play a direct role in the development of such standards through its own contractual arrangements. Where a Commonwealth agency has control over the engagement of an ADR service provider, it should ensure that the service provider complies with appropriate standards of practice. As the Issues Paper points out, the elements contained in the code of practice in NADRAC's 2001 report on standards are a useful benchmark for assessing compliance. </para><para>In doing this, however, agencies need to be conscious of the fact that the credibility and acceptance of ADR depends largely on the independence and impartiality of ADR practitioners and organisations. The Commonwealth therefore may need to be careful about how it engages private ADR providers to ensure that it does not create a situation of real or perceived bias in its favour. Such bias could be created directly, for example, through the nature of its contract for services, or indirectly, for example, through becoming overly familiar with individual ADR practitioners or creating incentives on the part of an ADR service provider to obtain more Commonwealth work.</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Broader systems</inline></para><quote><para>The use of ADR and improvements in dispute resolution practices by legal services should be part of a multi-faceted approach across and within Commonwealth agencies. Such an approach would comprise:</para></quote><para>1.	A high level commitment to reduce the level and cost of government disputes and litigation, including the use of ADR.</para><para>2.	Building such a commitment into relevant performance measures and reporting mechanisms at the agency, section and individual levels. In this regard, the Australian National Audit Office study of legal services in the Australian Public Service may be pertinent. </para><para>3.	The development of dispute avoidance, management and resolution plans at an organisational level, as recommended by the ALRC. Such plans are especially important for agencies that handle a significant number of disputes. </para><para>4.	Building corporate knowledge in preventing and resolving disputes. The establishment of an inter-agency working group to share ideas about effective dispute management practices was recommended by the ALRC. NADRAC supports this recommendation. The outcomes of dispute management processes need also to be continually evaluated. </para><quote><para>It is acknowledged that many of the strategies above go beyond the legal services covered by the Legal Services Directions themselves. For example, customer relations, procurement, employment and industrial relations issues may be subject to a range of governing mechanisms that would not necessarily be described as `legal services'. If poorly handled, however, there is a good chance that such matters could become the source of continuing conflict and lead directly or indirectly to litigation. Legal services therefore have a significant role to play in identifying potential sources of disputes and participating in organisation-wide approaches to dispute prevention, resolution and management. </para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Part two: Recommendations on the wording of the Legal Services Directions</inline></para><quote><para>NADRAC sees ADR as integral to the prevention, management and resolution of disputes. ADR should also be improved continually and applied flexibly, taking into account the different types of issues faced by Commonwealth agencies and the range of contexts in which disputes may arise. For these reasons, NADRAC has not recommended a set of prescriptive steps or a separate appendix on ADR. The changes suggested below are strategic in nature and designed to facilitate the broader changes recommended above. Support for the implementation of these changes will also be important and follow up actions are suggested in Part 3 of this submission.</para><para>Suggested amendments are shown below in bold italics. The placement, numbering and precise wording of these amendments may, of course, be dependent on any other changes made to the Directions in the course of the current review. </para></quote><para>1.	NADRAC recommends the addition of a new clause to the body of the Legal Services Directions, before clause 4.2. The clause should create a presumption that agencies will use ADR as early as possible in all disputes, require agencies that commonly handle a significant number of disputes to develop dispute management plans, and require reporting on the level, nature and outcomes of disputes, including the use of ADR. The suggested wording is:</para><para>	Agencies shall use alternative dispute resolution processes to avoid, prevent or limit litigation at the earliest possible stage in all disputes arising out of their corporate role, except where the use of such approaches is clearly inappropriate. </para><para>	Agencies which commonly handle a significant number of claims and disputes should develop a dispute avoidance, management and resolution plan. </para><para>	Agencies which rarely handle claims or disputes may deal with matters on a case by case basis with reference to these Directions and the Model Litigant Obligations at Appendix B.</para><para>	The following sub-section could be included either in the proposed new clause above and/or after clause 11(d):</para><para>	Agencies shall monitor and report on the level and outcomes of disputes, and on the use of alternative dispute resolution methods. </para><para>2.	Amend 4.3 of the Directions by adding the following words </para><para>	Claims are to be handled and litigation is to be conducted by the agency in accordance with legal principle and practice, taking into account the legal rights of the parties and the financial and other risks to the Commonwealth (including the agency) of pursuing its rights. </para><para>	And adding to note 1(a):</para><para>	In considering the appropriateness of settling claims, `legal principle and practice' means an assessment both of the legal merits and the relative risks and costs associated with settling the claim or continuing with litigation. </para><para>3.	Add to clause 4.7:</para><para>	A FMA agency is not to start court proceedings unless:</para><para>	(a) reasonable attempts have been made to resolve or limit the matter through alternative dispute resolution, as outlined in [new clause suggested at point 1 above] and Appendix B, and. </para><para>	(b) the agency has received legal advice from lawyers whom the agency is allowed to use in the proceedings that there are reasonable grounds for starting the proceedings </para><para>4.	Add a new paragraph at section 5.1:</para><para>	An FMA agency may only use an in-house lawyer to conduct court litigation as solicitor on the record or as counsel with the express approval of the Attorney-General. Factors relevant to giving approval will include:</para><para>	the extent to which the in-house lawyer has knowledge of alternative dispute resolution techniques and processes. </para><para>5.	Add a new section after section 6: </para><para>	Engagement of alternative dispute resolution practitioners</para><para>	In engaging alternative dispute resolution practitioners, consideration is to be given to the practitioner's compliance with relevant professional standards.</para><para>6.	Add to Clause 11:</para><para>	11.1 The Chief Executive of an FMA agency is responsible for ensuring that:</para><para>	.... those responsible for the conduct of litigation, including lawyers providing legal services to the agency, have knowledge of alternative dispute resolution techniques and processes ...</para><para>	... management strategies include a requirement to consider the desirability of using ADR as either a real preventative option to any proposed litigation or in conjunction with any litigation.</para><para>7.	Add the following words to the `General Notes on the Directions':</para><para>	1. Unless otherwise indicated, use of the term `litigation' in these Directions is intended to include proceedings before courts, tribunals, inquiries and in alternative dispute resolution processes. Alternative dispute resolution processes may be determinative, such as arbitration, advisory, such as expert appraisal, facilitative, such as mediation, or a combination of these, such as conciliation.</para><para>	Legal services and alternative dispute resolution also include (but do not subsume) proactive processes designed to prevent or limit litigation in the first place.</para><para>	`Corporate disputes' refers to disputes that arise out of an agency's business role and its transactions with contractors, suppliers, employees and customers. </para><para>8.	Amend Appendix B (Model Litigant Obligations): </para><para>	(d) endeavouring to avoid, prevent and limit the scope of, litigation, wherever possible, </para><para>	using alternative dispute resolution approaches to resolve or limit corporate disputes at the earliest possible stage, except where such approaches are clearly inappropriate</para><para>	continually reviewing the prospects for settling a case and the means by which such a settlement could be achieved </para><para>	participating fully and effectively in, ensuring appropriate representation at, and acting in good faith in, alternative dispute resolution processes </para><para>9.	Amend Appendix C:</para><para>	Monetary claims .... If there is a meaningful prospect of liability, the factors to be taken into account in assessing a fair settlement amount include:</para><para>	(a) the prospects of the claim succeeding in court,</para><para>	(b) the risks and costs associated with continuing to defend the claim Such risks and costs may include time, the cost of legal action, damage to the agency's reputation or its relationships with suppliers, customers or the public. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Part three: Implementation of changes </inline></para><quote><para>Implementation of the changes suggested above will require support, taking into account the need of different agencies. For example, large agencies with a high volume of disputes may need guidance on the development of dispute avoidance, management and resolution plans, whereas small agencies that are rarely involved in litigation may need access to practical resources as and when required. </para><para>Strategies to promote better dispute management practices have been suggested in the past by the ALRC and in the Tonge report. NADRAC would be happy to work with the Department to further develop these strategies and to help to identify resource implications.</para></quote><para>1.	Awareness-raising</para><quote><para>The implications of amendments to the Legal Services Directions, including new ADR provisions, will need to be brought to the attention of CEOs, legal services and other relevant areas. High level communication with agencies with a significant number of disputes would be especially important. In relation to legal services, an edition on ADR in the OLSC Bulletin may be useful.</para></quote><para>2.	Central guidance, information and resources</para><quote><para>Legal services and other relevant areas in Commonwealth will need ready access to information and guidance on dispute management. There are many useful resources currently in existence, including the proceedings of NADRAC's 2003 conference ADR: A Better Way to do Business and the Department's 1999 conference on the Management of Disputes Involving the Commonwealth. A new Australian Standard on Dispute Management Systems is also anticipated in the near future.</para><para>It would be useful if information about such resources were made available at a central point and through a Web page. The information would need to be updated and further developed over time. </para></quote><para>3.	Best practice case studies</para><quote><para>The context of Commonwealth agencies differ, and approaches to dispute resolution need to be developed to suit the context. ALRC 62 identified several innovative dispute resolution strategies adopted by Commonwealth agencies. Initiatives, such as the ADR program within the Australian Defence Force, provide useful models to other agencies. It would be useful to gather and promote information about these initiatives. </para></quote><para>4.	Skills development and capacity building</para><quote><para>It would be desirable if the Department sponsored or facilitated opportunities for skills development and information exchange. Such opportunities could involve legal services, other relevant areas and ADR practitioners and could comprise formal training courses as well as informal sessions to encourage sharing information about effective ADR practices. </para></quote><para>5.	External ADR services</para><quote><para>It would be useful to provide guidance to agencies about selecting private ADR providers. NADRAC would be willing to work with the Department to develop a guide or checklist that outlines matters that the agency may wish to consider in engaging an ADR practitioner or organisation. Such guidance would encourage initiatives by ADR organisations to develop common accreditation standards for practitioners. </para></quote><para>6.	Model clauses </para><quote><para>The development of model contractual clauses may also be useful in relation to both the use of ADR in contractual disputes and the engagement of legal service providers.</para><para>Many Commonwealth agencies currently have dispute resolution clauses within their standard form contracts for the supply of goods and services. It would be useful to examine where these have been used successfully and to develop model clauses that could be adopted by other agencies. </para><para>Contracts for the provision of legal service providers to the Commonwealth could also include specific obligations with regard to the use of ADR and adoption of the effective dispute management practices mentioned in this submission.</para></quote><para>7.	Structures</para><quote><para>It may be useful to explore, especially with larger agencies, the possibility of establishing internal working groups or other structures to develop (or refine) dispute management plans and to implement relevant amendments to the Legal Services Directions. Such working groups would report to the CEO and could comprise, for example, senior line management, legal services, human resources, customer services, procurement and other relevant corporate services areas. Such groups could develop core principles applying to the management of all disputes, while recognising that separate structures, systems and approaches may be needed to address particular types of disputes including conflicts over human resource issues, unresolved complaints with customers, contractual disputes with suppliers and inter-agency disputes.</para><para>As well as intra-agency groups, an inter-agency working group, such as recommended by the ALRC, would also be useful. In this regard, it is noted that the US Department of Justice established an Office of Dispute Resolution, chaired by the Attorney General which, among other things, coordinated an Interagency ADR Working Group. NADRAC believes, in the Australian context, such a group need not have an ambitious role or be resource intensive, but may simply make use of existing resources and assist in implementing some of the strategies mentioned above. As an interim step,the Attorney-General's Department may wish to meet with other key central agencies, such as the Ombudsman, the Public Sector and Merit Protection Commission and the Department of Finance and Administration, to consider the feasibility and functions of such a group.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Industry: Furniture Manufacture</title><page.no>23840</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2880)</subtitle><id.no>2880</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>23840</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, upon notice, on 6 May 2004:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Is it correct that Australian furniture manufacturers are competing globally on an uneven playing field and that, while Australian manufacturers take responsibility for their employees, the community and the Australian environment seriously, overseas manufacturers and importers do not adhere to these high standards.</para><para>(2)	Is it correct that the furniture industry is forced to compete against an opposition which does not label correctly, which uses environmentally-damaging materials and which does not comply with appropriate standards for its employees.</para><para>(3)	What is being done to enforce labelling of all products and to ensure products comply with Australian standards.</para><para>(4)	Can Australian manufacturers be assured that they will have access to sustainable timber resources.</para><para>(5)	What support is the Government giving to this industry group.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>23840</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Minchin</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Like other Australian manufacturers, Australian furniture makers compete with foreign competitors based on the merits of their products, and the comparative advantage in their production. This comparative advantage can derive from different market conditions prevailing in each country, including environmental, cultural and labour market conditions. Given that these conditions, including regulations and established business practices can vary considerably from country to country, it is difficult to make generalisations on how this affects actual competition in the Australian market. </para><para>(2)	As above.</para><para>(3)	The Furnishing Industry Association of Australia in consultation with the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has developed a voluntary code of practice - customer information document. The code of practice will ask signatories to include on product labels a range of consumer/product information. A self regulatory approach such as the code of practice will avoid unnecessarily or prematurely imposing any mandatory compliance costs on industry, small businesses and the wider community.</para><para>(4)	Australia is a world leader in sustainable forest management with decades of experience in competitive management of our hardwood and softwood resource. Land management is the constitutional responsibility of State governments and the Australian Government has no direct role to play in the management and/or allocation of public forest resources. However, as a means of demonstrating the environmental credentials of Australian forest managers, the Australian Government supported the development of the Australian Forest Standard (AFS). The AFS is Australia's only national forest management certification standard that is recognised by Standards Australia and the Programme for Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) Schemes. Certification systems, combined with Australian government initiatives such as the development of national approaches to forest management (encompassing the National Forest Policy Statement, Regional Forestry Agreements, and codes of forest practices) now mean that Australian manufacturers of wood products can be assured that Australian forests and forest products are sustainably managed.</para><para>(5)	The Government worked closely with the industry on the development of the Furnishing Industry Action Agenda.

The Australian Government response was launched on 24 July 2000 with funding of $4.0 million provided over 3 years to implement the Action Agenda recommendations. The Action Agenda identified key elements for future development of the industry and concluded in 2003. Following the Action Agenda the Government committed $3.8m to the industry via the Innovation Access Program for the development and implementation of the `Australian Furnishing Industry Technology Network'.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Foreign Affairs: Syria</title><page.no>23841</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2882)</subtitle><id.no>2882</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>23841</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 6 May 2004:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Is the Government aware that Kurdish people in Syria, of whom there are 2 million, have been deprived of their basic human rights and denied their identity.</para><para>(2)	What representations has the Government made on behalf of these people, who have had their citizenship stripped from them, do not have any legal rights, and cannot purchase any property, own a house or travel internationally.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>23841</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The following answer has been provided by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	The Syrian Government imposes a range of restrictions on the general Kurdish population, including in relation to the use and expression of the Kurdish language and culture, and political activity.
