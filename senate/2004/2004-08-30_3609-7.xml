The request of the committee was in response to the many care leavers who travelled here today who would not be able to witness the tabling if it were at the regular time later, as they wish to return to their homes this evening. I am very pleased that we have been able to welcome these care leavers and their families into Parliament House to be part of this milestone in the history of the provision of care in Australia.</para><para>When we began this inquiry I was, to say the least, very concerned about what we were embarking upon. My concerns were that we were not going to be able to do any good for the people whose lives we were looking into, that we would open wounds that we would not be able to heal and that we were not counsellors, we were policy makers, and we would leave people more damaged than they were at the outset. I was very wrong. For many care leavers this inquiry has brought a sense of healing that has not been evident in their dealings with government, the churches and institutions to date. It has provided the opportunity to share their experience, to be given recognition of the pain that they have experienced and to put some of the past behind. But for many, though, this inquiry has not brought closure. It is hard to see how for some any process would, as the hurt is so great.</para><para>I am proud to have presented this report on behalf of the committee. I want to place on record my thanks to all members of the committee for their compassion and diligence throughout the hearings and through the compilation of the report and recommendations. I also wish to thank Senator Hutchins for his work as the chair of the committee prior to March. This report is an example of how the Senate works at its best. We came to the inquiry as individuals and left our party affiliations at the door. Our recommendations are the result of our personal thinking and it is our hope that they will make real changes to the lives of care leavers into the future. The report has deviated from the usual Senate style of writing a report. We have tried to give voice to those who gave us the evidence rather than interpret their words. The report, therefore, uses many quotes from the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and from the submissions.</para><para>The committee received 614 submissions, of which 174 are confidential given the nature of their content. Overwhelmingly, they make tragic and distressing reading. They tell of neglect, of shocking abuse, of predatory behaviour from so-called carers and of criminal activity. The evidence is also there that authorities in the church and in governments either knew or should have known that much of this horrific activity was occurring. The committee thank those who made submissions and gave evidence for allowing us into their lives. We hope we have done justice to their stories. A recurring message in the submissions is that the person making the submission was doing it not for himself or herself but for those who could not—for those who could not because the pain in reliving their experience was too great, because the hurt they have lived has manifested into mental illness that renders them incapable of participation or because they have passed on through illness, age or, even more tragically, suicide. This report is a tribute to all who have made submissions and to those who could not. </para><para>It is also important to note that all experiences reported were not negative. A few submissions told of pleasant times, of outings and of thoughtful and caring adults. It also should be noted that institutions varied in their treatment of people over time. The personnel who provided the care directly influenced the experience of the children there. But, even for those whose experiences did not include neglect or abuse, the lack of love is a constant. How that can be overcome is a challenge but one that must be dealt with in planning future care arrangements for children. </para><para>Today should be seen as a significant milestone in the history of the approximately 500,000 people who have been placed in care in institutions, including orphanages, group cottage homes, homes for children with disabilities and juvenile detention centres, and in foster care in Australia since colonisation. It is an opportunity to place on record a summary of the experiences of care leavers, which goes some way to telling the true history of what has occurred. More needs to be done to continue to tell these stories, and there are recommendations in the report that are directed to that end.</para><para>But looking to the future, the report is hopefully a blueprint for governments and non-government institutions to deal with the legacy of poorly provided care. There are 39 recommendations in the report, most of which are unanimous recommendations of the committee members. We have recommended that the federal government issue an apology acknowledging the hurt and distress suffered by many children in institutional care, and that those states and territories, churches and other authorities that have not done so should do the same.</para><para>We have recommended that the federal government establish a fund with contributions from the states and territories, churches and other organisations involved in the provision of care. This fund should provide an alternative method for accessing redress which will not require applicants to meet legal proof requirements, and a claim that can be supported by a reasonable likelihood that the abuse occurred should be dealt with. We have recommended that a process for reviewing complaints about care experiences should be established, and that it should be independent of governments or churches.</para><para>We have called on the churches and other care providing organisations to open their books and allow care leavers all the information which has been collected about them so that any legal proceedings that should be progressed are progressed. We have said that if this does not occur then the only course of action is for the federal government to implement a royal commission so that justice can be done. Committee members were mindful of the costs and the varying benefits associated with the establishment of a royal commission, and there are different views in the committee about the appropriateness of this course of action. But it is my view that it might be the only way that justice can be done. There are other recommendations in the report that I commend to governments, churches, other care providing organisations and the broader community. </para><para>Finally, I need to offer some thanks. I want to thank an organisation called CLAN. CLAN is a nationally established organisation that provides support to care leavers. They are represented by a fabulous woman, Leonie Sheedy, whom all care leavers will join with me in thanking for the leadership, compassion and enormous understanding that she provides to care leavers and their families. There is a range of other support services and I also commend them on the work they do. They are funded varyingly across the nation, and our recommendation suggests that more needs to be done by state, territory and federal governments to support that work. As a result of today's tabling of this report, we expect there will be many care leavers in the community who did not know about the process that we embarked upon and who will wish to receive support. I encourage any journalist writing about the tabling of the report today to publish, wherever possible, the phone numbers of support organisations so that people can access services immediately.</para><para>I also want to thank the counsellors we employed during the process of the inquiry who came to all of our hearings and assisted not only care leavers but also all of us in talking through the experiences that we heard about. Thank you to all of you. Thank you for the work that you continue to do and the special talents that you have in working with care leavers in our society. I want to thank Hansard and the people from sound and vision who shared the harrowing stories with us during the hearings. Finally and most importantly, I need to thank the secretariat of the Community Affairs References Committee. They are a fantastic group of people who have gone well beyond their roles as staff of the Senate. They have worked late nights and they have worked weekends for months, and their careful consideration of all the issues has provided—with the support of the senators who gave their time to this committee—what I think is an excellent report.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>26615</page.no><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name><name.id>TH4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As Senator McLucas has said, today is a very special day because of the tabling of the report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Forgotten Australians:</inline><inline font-style="italic"> a</inline><inline font-style="italic"> report on Australians who experienced institutional or out-of-home care as children</inline>. I would also like to start by thanking all those who gave of their lives—those very people in the gallery today. Good luck to you all. This has been a very tough inquiry for each and every one of us. Their heart-rending stories, their cruel stories and sometimes their funny stories are something that we can all cherish.</para></talk.start><para>I would also like to thank the secretariat in Elton Humphrey and his team. As Senator McLucas said, they are probably the most outstanding secretariat you could wish for. I have had the pleasure of working with them for many years and they just give and give—but this is a different sort of giving. This, as Senator Murray and I know, is the second time they have given. The report on child migrants was a very tough report; this one has been no easier. It has been no easier on any of us, but it certainly has not been easy on the secretariat for the way in which they have tackled it. To Senator McLucas and all the members of the committee, I would like to say thank you. Senator Murray, good on you for bringing it to the chamber again, because that too is important. </para><para>There are some privileges one gets in this job that outsiders would never contemplate as a privilege. This is one of them. These are reports about people, childhoods, teenage lives, relationships, marriages, successes, failures, adulthood, sickness and health—the list goes on. For the people who have shared all those experiences with us in the hope that we may be able to very belatedly help right some of the wrongs, it is a weight we were prepared to try and lift. I hope that we can meet some of those expectations.</para><para>When one looks at why children were placed in institutions one sees that the list of reasons is almost endless. Family poverty, being orphaned, being born to a single mother, family dislocation, domestic violence, divorce, mental illness, a parent's inability to cope with children, or child sex abuse by a parent or step-parent are only part of the story. Any one of those reasons would be difficult enough for a child. But for a child to be placed into care, separated from their parent or parents and often from siblings, and then have to face all types of abuse, child slavery, cruelty, hunger, a lack of education, a lack of warm clothing and, probably worst of all, the total absence of love and nurturing is just profoundly sad.</para><para>Those of us who have never experienced that do not know what these people have gone through. As someone who has experienced love from their parents and from their entire family, it is incredibly difficult to look these people in the eye. They are brave, they are tough, they fight and they do not ever stop. Those of us who have had that love and care can only say, `We love you; we cherish you.' There are so many sad stories to focus on but to me one of the saddest realities is that some care leavers have discovered more recently that while they were suffering there had in fact been offers from extended family members to provide a home for them to prevent them from going into or being in care, yet these offers were usually ignored or denied by the department or agency. One can only wonder how different the outcome would have been for those so lucky.</para><para>There are so many who suffered such sadness, believing that no-one cared about them, only to find decades later that parents, siblings and extended family members had written letters or had sought to visit. None of this information was ever made known at the time nor was it made known that the letters they had written to family members had never been sent. What cruelty is that? That children were placed in institutions for care yet did not even receive the basics of what any reasonable person would consider care is beyond belief. To have taken from them on arrival everything that was in any way special—a teddy, a doll, clothes, jewellery, shoes or other treasures—was further demeaning and demoralising. All this, I might add, was often done after being strip searched. For many, not receiving an education meant being permanently consigned to life skill difficulties. One quote says it all:</para><quote><para>I now know why my education was lost, because of a night time I was bashed, raped and molested, then stay awake all night wondering if they were going to come back. Then be bashed by the nuns at school for falling asleep in class, so I guess that's why I can't spell today.</para></quote><para>The use of experimental medications, examinations and drugs appeared rife. Who in their right mind would force children to take mind-altering drugs, subject them to brain scans and various other neurological tests under the guise of intelligence tests, or subject young girls to enforced, painful gynaecological examinations? One may well ask why such cruel practices were never detected by the authorities, why operators of institutions were not deregistered or why the perpetrators of the violence and sex abuse were never prosecuted. It all comes down to the fact that there was a total lack of state government regulation. Either the inspections by welfare officers were carefully stage-managed or the officers studiously ignored what they saw—both of which, in my language, are reprehensible behaviour. </para><para>What is almost worse in this situation is that, when perpetrators of abuse and assault were identified, they were allowed to resign before formal action was taken against them. Apart from the appalling treatment of children, the parents of some of the children who sought to maintain contact were deceived and threatened and were too frightened to lay any complaint about the signs of abuse they saw for fear that the children would suffer further. What a position for those parents to be placed in. I wish to quote a section of the report about the often heard statement that standards were different then. The report states:</para><quote><para>The response that times were different and that standards and people's thinking and understanding of children's needs have changed, fails to explain or recognise the severity of the documented behaviours. Corporal punishment may no longer be in vogue. But when do a few whacks with a ruler become assault? When do the oft documented beltings and floggings become criminal assault? When did the `standards of the time' change that condoned the perpetration of neglect, cruelty, psychological abuse, sadism, rape and sodomy?</para></quote><para>I submit that what is criminal today was criminal yesterday in this regard. To listen to the legacies of such treatment—legacies such as low self-esteem, lack of confidence, depression, fear, distrust, anger, shame, guilt, obsessiveness, social anxieties, phobias, recurring nightmares, tension, migraines and speech difficulties—is beyond comprehension. Many cannot read or write, many have had lifelong alcohol and drug problems or have ended up in the mental health or prison systems, many cannot form or maintain trust in relationships and many have contemplated or taken the ultimate step of suicide. One witness said:</para><quote><para>I don't know how to show my family, especially my own children how I feel about them. I can't put my arms around them and tell them I love them ... and most of my married life I can't stand being touched. </para></quote><para>Many lack parenting skills due to the total absence of role models. Some have been successful; others have not. One witness stated:</para><quote><para>Then at the age of 36, I met my wife. We married in 1982 and had two baby girls within two years. As I was unemployed for 5 years after we married, and although it was tough, I was able to spend a lot of time with my daughters. I was determined they weren't going to miss out like I did. I spoilt them rotten. Dorothy and the girls have been the making of me. For the first time I experienced happiness. Without them I think I would be dead now, either through alcoholism or a successful suicide. </para></quote><para>I do not have much time left but I have to say that I hope that state, territory and Commonwealth governments, the churches and the agencies look very closely at the recommendations that we have made. It is about time the wrongs were righted. It is about time everyone decided that what was illegal then is illegal today, and vice versa. It disturbs me that some of the state governments do not believe that things are going on today when in fact they still are. I conclude my comments by commending the report to the Senate. May I extend to the care leavers and their loved ones a wish that from hereon their lives will take a fresh turn for the best.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>26617</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Let me begin by acknowledging and welcoming all those in the public gallery who have journeyed to Canberra today to witness this historic tabling of this groundbreaking report, suitably titled <inline font-style="italic">Forgotten Australians</inline>. This report means so much to so many—not just the half a million plus directly affected but the millions of Australians indirectly affected. </para></talk.start><para>Three years ago, in August 2001, the Senate Community Affairs References Committee's child migrant report, <inline font-style="italic">Lost innocents: righting the record</inline>, was tabled in the Senate. That inquiry had an intensely personal dimension for me because of my own background. When I rose to speak to the report, I just could not; so Senator Sue Knowles delivered my speech for me. There is a message in that in itself, because these painful inquiries draw all senators together in a shared sense of outrage, compassion and a need to find remedies. We are forever bonded and affected by the pain we have witnessed. This report into children in institutional care is the third in the trilogy—the first being the 1997 <inline font-style="italic">Bringing them home </inline>report on the fate of the Aboriginal stolen generation and the second the 2001 report of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee inquiry into child migration.</para><para>The day I encountered Norman Johnston and his band of protestors outside the parliament, pleading for a child migrant inquiry, is probably the birthplace of both these reports. Norman and Margaret Humphries personify the campaigners for the first report, and Leonie Sheedy and Joanna Penglase personify the campaigners for the second report. We owe them all a great debt of gratitude.</para><para>But it is to the witnesses I dedicate this tabling speech. To every care leaver who submitted their intensely personal story to this inquiry, I thank you and honour your courage in doing so. Often these stories were being told for the very first time. I saw wives, husbands and friends listening in amazement as they heard such personal, intimate stories put down on the public record. There were so many tears: from the witnesses, the audiences, the senators, Hansard and our secretariat. For many witnesses, a measure of healing was gained through being able to finally tell their stories, knowing that they were believed at last. I also wish to honour the many thousands who were unable to or could not relive their experiences through writing or making a submission.</para><para>With me on this committee has been Senator Steve Hutchins—the first chair—who helped me negotiate the terms of reference for this inquiry with Labor. I and we owe him a great deal, and he has done himself and his party proud. Senator Jan McLucas followed Senator Hutchins as chair, and she has been outstanding in her determination to do right by those who have been in care. Senator Sue Knowles is, as I am, a veteran of both inquiries. As deputy chair she has again shown her compassion and determination that justice be done and remedies be found. In Senators Gary Humphries and Claire Moore we have fortunately found people of great heart and great strength. My Senate colleagues: I salute your efforts and am deeply grateful for them. Your humanity and compassion honour you.</para><para>There was also Hansard, who had the painful task of recording it all. We have all experienced what the psychologists refer to as `referred pain'—none more so than the bruised, supportive secretariat to this harrowing inquiry. To Elton, Ingrid, Geraldine, Christine, Leonie and Peter, I extend my grateful thanks. It would be difficult to find a more hardworking group of people than these. Their commitment deserves the highest praise.</para><para>Then there is Dr Marilyn Rock, my electorate officer and senior adviser, who has dedicated five hard years to this cause of getting recognition, help and remedies to all those who have suffered in institutions and care. Quite simply, I could not have put in the effort that I have without her valuable professional and humane support. All over Australia, people turn to her for help.  </para><para>This quote from a submission captured a fundamental truth:</para><quote><para>While I have survived extreme deprivation I am left with deep emotional scars. I have a sense of abandonment, exploitation and not belonging ... I feel it impossible to fully recover from my experiences.</para></quote><para>Understanding this truth is set to alter public policy towards children forever. What is that truth? If you badly harm a child you will have decades of a badly harmed adult to cope with. It does not end there. The effects of the harm are often transferred to the victim's children, creating generational social problems. Although there are good stories, the sheer scale of damaged people is staggering.</para><para>That so many endured a childhood deprived of love and security of their own families is certainly sad. That so many were subject to abuse and neglect, including criminal sexual and physical assaults, is unforgivable. That so many are scarred and live on the margins of society as adults without programs to assist them is scandalous. My hope is that this report, in conjunction with the two earlier reports, will mean that bureaucrats, policy makers and politicians will at last be able to comprehend the importance of the issues affecting the survivors of childhood abuse. The message is getting out that the abuse, neglect and assault of children can no longer be tolerated, not only because it is wrong but because of the long-term social and economic effects.</para><para>There is now an extensive body of research that clearly shows that if you hurt and break the spirit of a child you end up with a hurt and broken adult, with all of those consequences. Even the well-adjusted struggle. A 70-year-old wrote of the lasting effects:</para><quote><para>Every now and then a door opens in the memory bank and the ghosts escape to make us lonely children again.</para></quote><para>There were those who had good outcomes, in places run by good people. But too many have led and are leading lonely, marginal lives from which there appears no escape. They also live with the pain of lost family members and of lost identities. For too many, their childhood remains a private hell stained with memories of beatings, sexual assault and molestation, and exploitation as child labour. Sadly, because of the planted guilt, blame and shame, most have learnt not to rebel against injustice, not to speak out. They have remained silent. It is those who failed their duty of care that should carry the burden of guilt, blame and shame; not the survivors.</para><para>This powerful report records acts of at times unbelievable violence against vulnerable children in care. It records fear, neglect and the longing for love. It records siblings being torn and kept apart. It records the withholding of letters to and from loved ones. It records being stripped of all personal belongings and dignity. It records being deprived of sufficient nourishment and of education and basic health. The argument that this was how it was done back then holds little sway. Denial is shorthand for the abdication of responsibility. The report records adult lives plagued with mental health problems, alcoholism, drug dependence, homelessness, welfare dependency, failed relationships, prison terms, premature deaths due to suicide and the longing and searching for identities and family members. The report also bears witness to positive stories of overcoming adversity and of those who through the love and support of others have found their own healing.</para><para>Politicians and policy makers have to understand the scale and effects of child abuse. Professor Fiona Stanley, the 2003 Australian of the Year, is reported in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian </inline>of 9 November 2002 as stating that Australia faced a looming social crisis and a lifetime of costly government expenditure if a national program for children's welfare was not established. It is not a question of isolated individual incidents that are sad or repugnant. It is a question of a widespread social problem with huge social and economic costs. With the knowledge we now have, the cycle of abuse that is often passed on to the next generation must become a priority for those in a position to make a difference. Here I look to the Liberal and Labor parties. A resolution is needed. Only by the Commonwealth and state governments having the political will to commit money and resources to bringing the recommendations alive will some justice be restored for these people. Not only is it time; they deserve nothing less. </para><para>Senator McLUCAS (Queensland) (1.01 p.m.)—I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TELECOMMUNICATIONS OFFENCES AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL (NO. 2) 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>26620</page.no><id.no>R2131</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>26620</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 10 August, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Coonan</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>26620</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R2131">Crimes Legislation Amendment (Telecommunications Offences and Other Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2004</inline>. It is an omnibus bill which updates a number of offences originally enacted in 1989 relating to misuse of telecommunications services and moves them from the Crimes Act to the Criminal Code. The bill also creates a number of new offences on a range of topics. Those topics include offences of using a carriage service, including the Internet, to access, transmit or publish child pornography or child abuse material and of procuring or grooming a person under 16 years of age for sexual activity. These complement existing offences in place at the state and territory level. Also included are offences of using a carriage service, including the Internet, to make threats to kill or cause serious harm, to perpetrate a hoax relating to explosive or dangerous substances or to engage in menacing, harassing or offensive behaviour.</para></talk.start><para>The bill also includes offences to prevent the rebirthing of stolen mobile phones and the copying of mobile phone SIM cards. It also deals with offences of making hoax or vexatious calls to emergency service numbers. It includes offences of contaminating goods, threatening to contaminate goods or perpetrating a contamination hoax. There are also offences of dishonestly obtaining or dealing in personal financial information, which are targeted at credit card skimming and Internet banking fraud. These implement model legislation developed jointly by the Commonwealth, the states and the territories. Clearly, it is an omnibus bill which covers a range of issues and will provide a move to the Criminal Code. The bill also makes a number of miscellaneous amendments to criminal law statutes, dealing with matters including alternative verdicts, knowledge of criminal law, proof of narcotics offences and international assistance in criminal matters.</para><para>It is worth touching on a couple of background issues in relation to this bill. As was noted in the House of Representatives, the bill appears to have had a long period of gestation within this government if the public statements of numerous ministers, past and present, are anything to go by. On 4 April 2003—almost a year and a half ago—the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison, issued a media release titled `New offences to clamp down on Internet child pornography'. That release made mention of the offences covering child pornography and material that incites suicide. Then on 20 August 2003—just over a year ago—Senator Ellison and the then minister for communications, Senator Alston, issued a joint media release titled `Using internet for offensive and menacing purposes to be outlawed'. This release mentioned offences dealing with offensive, menacing or harassing Internet content. It also reannounced the child pornography offences and mentioned the offences dealing with the rebirthing of stolen mobile phones. </para><para>Then there was silence for quite a while. But on 14 March 2004 Senator Ellison and the then minister for communications, Mr Daryl Williams, issued a joint media release titled `Tough laws to target Internet child sex crime', reannouncing the legislation and releasing an exposure draft. On 19 March 2004 Senator Ellison issued a media release titled `Agreement reached on new national laws to outlaw credit card skimming', which announced the offences concerning fraudulent dealings with personal financial information. What we have is a start date of almost a year and a half ago and a collection and a reissuing of matters in the announcements by the minister, an old minister and a newer one. It finally culminated on 25 June 2004, when Senator Ellison and Mr Williams, the then communications minister, issued another media release, `Internet child sex abuse offences Bill tabled', to coincide with the introduction of an earlier bill in the Senate which bears the same name as the current bill—minus the words `No. 2'—and which we understand the government will no longer be proceeding with. All of these announcements have culminated in the current bill, which was introduced into the House on 4 August.</para><para>The bill was referred to the Senate committee following the introduction of the bill into the House of Representatives. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee inquired into the bill. The time allotted for the inquiry was only short—a total of six days—but nevertheless the committee had an opportunity to put a number of issues raised in a submission from Electronic Frontiers and a <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> prepared by the Parliamentary Library to the Attorney-General's Department and the Australian Federal Police for response. In considering the bill, the committee was mindful of the fact that it incorporated changes made in response to submissions received on an exposure draft released earlier in the year.</para><para>It is worth mentioning two issues that were discussed by the committee, namely offensive use of a carriage service and defences in respect of child pornography and abuse material. I mention those particular issues because they are the subject of proposed amendments by the Democrats. In relation to the first matter—offensive use of a carriage service—the committee noted that the indicative criteria of offensiveness are drawn from the national classification scheme and would be for a jury to apply based on a criminal standard of proof.</para><para>The opposition has carefully examined this amendment and weighed a number of factors. The amendment updates the existing offence in section 85ZE of the Crimes Act. The existing offence applies an objective standard of offensiveness to the use of all carriage services except the Internet, to which a subjective standard applies. An objective standard, under section 471.1.2 of the Criminal Code, also applies to the use of postal and similar services. The origin of this distinction is the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Act 1999. Its rationale is not entirely clear from the parliamentary debates, but it seems to have been designed to emphasise that offensive Internet content would be dealt with primarily by the online content scheme rather than the Crimes Act. While the case for applying a different standard of regulation to the Internet understandably commanded more support when the Internet was younger, the community is now more conscious of the dangers posed by some Internet content and has a legitimate expectation of an equivalent degree of protection to that applying to other communications media. On that basis, and considering that a criminal standard of proof applies, the opposition is prepared to support this aspect of the bill and will not be supporting the Democrats' amendment, which maintains the status quo. </para><para>In relation to the second matter—defences in respect of child pornography and child abuse material—the committee heard evidence from the Attorney-General's Department about the drafting of this aspect of the bill. The department told the committee it had attempted to craft a general defence relating to research into paedophilia and child abuse but received public feedback on the exposure draft which suggested that the general defence would be susceptible to misuse. The department also gave evidence that it consulted with the Australian Institute of Criminology on the prevalence of genuine research of this kind and determined that a mechanism involving approval by the minister was workable. The department also drew the committee's attention to comparable approval processes in other legislation for research into prohibited drugs. On the basis of the explanation provided to the committee, the opposition is now satisfied that the proposed approval mechanism is not inappropriate. Therefore, the opposition will not support the Democrat amendment.</para><para>In conclusion, the opposition provides its support for the passage of this bill. The overwhelming majority of this bill is not controversial, although it did have quite a substantive gestation period, and it makes improvements to the criminal law. With that explanation on those two more controversial issues in relation to the two Democrat amendments, the opposition supports the passage of this bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>26622</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R2131">Crimes Legislation Amendment (Telecommunications Offences and Other Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2004</inline> introduces a range of new offences relating to the use of a telecommunications network or carriage service, including interfering with a telecommunications service or using a telecommunications service in a range of areas, including with an intention to: commit a serious offence; make a threat or a hoax threat; menace, harass or cause offence; access, transmit, make available, publish or distribute child pornography or child abuse material; and procure or `groom' a person under the age of 16 years for sexual purposes. In addition to the telecommunications offences, the bill creates new offences relating to the contamination of goods, credit card skimming and child prostitution on Australian aircraft.</para></talk.start><para>It also makes changes to the criminal justice process. For example, it codifies the maxim that ignorance of the law is no excuse by providing that a person is to be held criminally liable even if he or she is ignorant of, or mistaken about, the law creating an offence. In addition, a jury will be able to find a person guilty of a crime if the jury is satisfied that the person was responsible for the crime regardless of whether the person actually carried out the crime themselves. The bill further amends the Customs Act so that it would not be necessary to prove that a person charged with importing narcotics intentionally brought the prohibited substance into Australia. Finally, amendments to the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act will make it easier for foreign countries to obtain evidence from Australia in criminal prosecutions. </para><para>The Democrats moved to refer the original <inline ref="S422">Crimes Legislation Amendment (Telecommunications Offences and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline> to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for inquiry. That bill also contained a number of contentious provisions relating to the use of a carriage service to disseminate information inciting suicide, which the Democrats believe could potentially stifle debate on the issue of euthanasia. However, we are pleased that the government has chosen to deal with those provisions in a separate bill, which is now before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee—although I understand the hearings on that are being delayed by the prorogation of parliament. However, our concerns in relation to the original bill were not confined to the suicide provisions, and we were therefore pleased that the government also referred this bill to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee for further consideration.</para><para>Unfortunately, the committee's inquiry was incredibly rushed. The bill was referred to the committee on 5 August this year. A public hearing was held four days later and the committee reported to the Senate on 11 August. Only five submissions were received. I understand that a number of groups contacted the committee secretariat and indicated that the short time frame of the inquiry made it impossible for them to participate. It is disappointing and it illustrates how the incredibly valuable role of Senate committees in properly scrutinising legislation can be emasculated by the demands of government. </para><para>However, despite the extremely short time frame of this inquiry and the small number of submissions, the inquiry was nonetheless helpful in considering the provisions of the bill. One point that emerged from the committee inquiry was that the government appears to have undertaken fairly widespread consultation on the bill prior to its introduction. Electronic Frontiers Australia—EFA—indicated that many of the issues and concerns which they had expressed in April had been addressed and resolved to their satisfaction by the Attorney-General's Department prior to the introduction of the bill in June. We Democrats take this opportunity to acknowledge and commend the government on engaging in a proper and good process of consultation. We note that this level of consultation does not always occur, yet the benefits of it have been made clear, at least in this instance. </para><para>However, we Democrats do note and are disappointed by the fact that a number of the provisions of the bill do pre-empt the completion of the government's review—which was announced in July this year—into illegal or offensive content on mobile telephones and other mobile devices. I think one has to question the value of such a review when its outcome is being pre-empted by the legislative change just one month after the announcement of the review. </para><para>Although many of the Democrats' concerns about this bill have been allayed as a result of the committee inquiry, we do have a number of outstanding concerns. The first of those relates to the offence of using a carriage service to menace, harass or cause offence. The offence occurs if a person uses a carriage service and does so in a way that reasonable persons could regard as being menacing, harassing or offensive in all the circumstances. Our particular concern in relation to this offence is that there is no requirement for the person to have intended to menace, harass or offend another person, nor that any person was actually menaced, harassed or offended. As a consequence, concerns have been raised about the potential impact of this offence on those who use the Internet or email to advance or elicit support for a particular cause—for example, to organise a peace rally. There are some fears that these provisions could stifle genuine political debate on the basis that using a carriage service to advance a particular cause could be seen by some as menacing, harassing or offensive. </para><para>We Democrats accept the point made by the Attorney-General's Department during the committee inquiry that it would be very difficult to successfully prosecute a person who uses a carriage service to express a genuinely held opinion, particularly in the context of political debate. However, we do not believe that serious concerns about the elements of an offence should remain unaddressed simply because the offence will be difficult to prosecute. That is simply not good law making. We should be addressing any concerns in the text of the legislation, not in the way in which it is applied within the community.</para><para>Another concern which we Democrats have relates to child pornography offences. The bill provides that it will be a defence to child pornography offences if the defendant can demonstrate that their conduct was of public benefit. The bill contains a very strict definition of what is considered to be `of public benefit' in these circumstances, including the undertaking of research `approved by the minister in writing'. While the Democrats certainly welcome the provisions relating to the new child pornography offences contained in this bill, and the fact that there are only a very limited range of defences, we are concerned by any provision which requires genuine, independent research to be vetted by the minister.</para><para>We have discussed this concern with the Attorney-General's office and we understand that the government takes a view. However, it has clearly been a difficult issue for the government. In his evidence to the committee, Mr Geoff McDonald from the Attorney-General's Department said:</para><quote><para>... I suppose one of the most difficult issues that we did face was the whole issue of research into paedophilia and making sure that we had an appropriate mechanism for dealing with that. We had a general test, which related to research, and some of the feedback we got was that this had actually been misused by people in the past. Consequently we tightened up the provisions in relation to research. We spoke to the Australian Institute of Criminology about just how prevalent this research was, and the information we received was that it was not very prevalent. To make sure that there was certainty with the provisions, we decided that where it was specific research into paedophilia we would have an approval process from the minister for justice. We were concerned that it was difficult to get a good general formula.</para></quote><para>We Democrats accept that this has been a genuinely difficult issue for the Attorney-General's Department and we acknowledge that there may be some scope for a general defence of public interest research to be abused. However, we do not believe that this warrants a system in which independent research ought to be vetted by a minister. In our view, it would be much more appropriate for a court, rather than a minister, to determine whether particular research is of public benefit, otherwise a political perspective may well be brought into that determination. We Democrats will be seeking to address that issue further during the committee stage.</para><para>Finally, I want to take this opportunity to make some brief comments about the principle that ignorance of the law is no excuse, which is addressed in the bill. In particular, I would like to highlight some observations that I recently provided to the <inline font-style="italic">Alternative Law Journal</inline> regarding legal education. I argued:</para><quote><para>Our daily lives are governed by thousands of Acts, Regulations and common law precedents. Yet, as the Bill before us reinforces, if we breach any of these laws, ignorance is no excuse and we will find ourselves criminally liable. </para></quote><para>This leaves us with the anomaly that we are all presumed to know a vast array of laws, which no judge, lawyer or law-maker could possibly be completely familiar with, and there may be many serious criminal consequences if we make a mistake. However, one way in which to overcome this anomaly is to ensure that the law corresponds to community standards. In other words, we can endeavour to create the kind of legal system which ensures that, if you live your life in a way that roughly accords with community standards, you can be pretty confident that you are not breaking the law.</para><para>For this reason, it is vitally important that the law reflects community standards. To ensure that this is the case, those of us who make laws should be held accountable through the democratic process, while judicial accountability arises from the provision of reasons for decisions. But whether we are talking about new laws or the judicial development of existing law, it is vital for the community to have a basic understanding of the democratic process and the law for these accountability mechanisms to work effectively.</para><para>Unfortunately, there is evidence to show that many Australians do not possess a basic understanding of the law. The Civics Expert Group report of 1994 found that only 18 per cent of Australians showed some degree of understanding of the Constitution and only 41 per cent knew how the Constitution can be changed, despite the vast majority having voted in referenda. Only 40 per cent of Australians could correctly recall the names of both houses of parliament and only 50 per cent knew that the High Court is the highest court of appeal. The Civics Expert Group report argued:</para><quote><para>When lack of knowledge on how government institutions work and an uncertainty of what the civic ethos means is coupled with a mistrust of politics, a danger arises. Our system of government relies for its efficiency and legitimacy on an informed citizenry; without active, knowledgeable citizens the forms of democratic representation remain empty; without vigilant informed citizens there is no check on potential tyranny.</para></quote><para>We Democrats believe that civics and legal education have an important role to play in making our system work effectively, and there is a real need for a more comprehensive approach to civics education in this nation. A greater understanding of our legal and democratic systems is needed within the Australian community to ensure that the `ignorance of the law is no excuse' rule does not result in grave injustices and the conviction of individuals who never intended to commit a crime. This is particularly crucial at a time when, increasingly, the government is moving towards the creation of strict and absolute liability offences. I take this opportunity, in the dawn of an election campaign period, to challenge the government on the issue of civics education and to ask what it is doing on this front to address the issues that were so clearly identified by the Civics Expert Group some 10 years ago.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>26626</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R2131">Crimes Legislation Amendment (Telecommunications Offences and Other Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2004</inline> by and large deserves support. There are some aspects of the bill, however, that are disconcerting. Major issues have not been addressed by this legislation. The legislation deals with the issue of abuse and the definition of child abuse material. The legislation defines child abuse material as:</para></talk.start><para>(a)	material that depicts a person, or a representation of a person, who:</para><para>(i)	is, or appears to be, under 18 years of age; and </para><para>(ii)	is, or appears to be, a victim of torture, cruelty or physical abuse;</para><para>and does this in a way that reasonable persons would regard as being, in all the circumstances, offensive ...</para><para>Let me deal with the matter of offensiveness. One child expert, Professor Freda Briggs, has described certain types of child pornography as offensive. The words she used were `child abuse'. That material is currently available, freely, on the Net and without any proper regulation. This is very disconcerting to many parents. The legislation is meant to deal with the use of the Internet to facilitate or exploit the sexual abuse of children through child pornography. Of course, I support that aspect of it, but I want to ask why we are not dealing with the use of the Internet to facilitate or exploit the sexual abuse of children through children's accessing pornography on the Internet, because exposing children to pornography on the Internet is child abuse too. Why isn't that dealt with by this legislation?</para><para>Parents whose children use the Internet are advised to take a number of precautions, including the installation of Internet filters and ensuring their children are supervised, but many children are still falling prey to Internet pornography. The current regulations are dealing in an unreal world, because many children are unsupervised and fall prey to Internet pornographers. Last year the Australia Institute found that 84 per cent of boys and 60 per cent of girls aged 16 to 17 years of age have had accidental exposure to Internet sex sites. The Institute reported that this included images of bestiality and violent scenes of women being raped, and that studies showed a `relationship between pornography and sexually aggressive attitudes and behaviour'.</para><para>I was very pleased when the Australian Labor Party was going to adopt a more restrictive approach to the online regulatory scheme, because that scheme is totally inadequate at the present moment and is largely influenced by the force of the Internet Industry Association's rejection of a requirement for compulsory filtering on an opt-out basis. However, I was very disappointed when the federal opposition eventually decided, by way of an internal policy change, not to accept the Australia Institute's proposal to protect children from pornography on the Internet. The Australia Institute proposed that there be mandatory filtering of the Internet to block pornography, with adults having the option to opt out of the system.</para><para>Parents across Australia want some help so that they can allow their children to access the benefits of the Internet without the constant danger of their being confronted with Internet pornography. The government and the opposition should bite the bullet and provide families with real solutions to fix this problem. It is a vast problem out there, and one which I believe will become significant in the next few months. To protect children and to assist parents, Internet service providers should provide compulsory filtering of Internet content on an opt-out basis. Many parents do not know the importance of installing filters and of supervising their children's Internet use. Those adults who do not want Internet content filtered can elect to opt out of the system.</para><para>The Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts commissioned and published a report from IT consulting company Ovum, which provides a fully costed proposal for a system of Internet filtering. Ovum estimated that set-up costs for ISPs would be $45 million, with recurring annual costs of $33 million. These costs could be covered by the government and they represent a very small amount when it comes to protecting our children. The friends of the pornographers have argued for years that any proposed action to protect children will not work and that community education is the only answer. The evidence is in that community education has had only a limited effect. If we want to protect children from damaging pornography, we cannot continue to sit back and do nothing. </para><para>The Internet Industry Association, as I indicated, have fought a rearguard action to thwart attempts to protect children from Internet pornography. I will deal shortly with the new third generation material. The Internet Industry Association have demonstrated their total lack of interest in helping parents to protect their children from Internet pornography. Following their `family friendly ISP' branding scheme, which merely requires ISPs to comply with the IIA codes of practice, just 11 of their 563 ISP members have signed up. That is how much control they have over this. They have signed up only 11 of their 563 members—just under two per cent of ISPs—following their much heralded Internet content plan.</para><para>If the government or the opposition want to find a way to help parents, they should remember that the Internet Industry Association is part of the problem, not part of the solution. Children should be protected from pornography—Professor Briggs called it child abuse—and it is not dealt with in this legislation. Almost everyone agrees that children should be protected from pornography, but not enough has been done to protect children from damaging images accessed on the Internet or by devices like 3G mobile phones.</para><para>How can we address this appalling situation so that children can enjoy the great benefits of the Internet and mobile telephones, without the pitfalls? Also bear in mind that the kids that I am talking about are, from a very early age, computer savvy and mobile phone savvy. As I mentioned, one way would be through compulsory Internet filtering. The Australia Institute found that 93 per cent of parents `would support a system that automatically filtered out Internet pornography going into homes unless adult users asked otherwise'. With this safeguard, those children with parents who do not know about filters or who face work or other pressures and are unable to supervise their children's Internet use will at least have some limited protection.</para><para>The online content co-regulatory scheme was set up to protect Australians from unwanted pornography and to take down illegal sites. The evidence collected by the Australia Institute shows that the current regulatory arrangements to protect children have failed. New third generation mobile phones are proving a further challenge to the protection of children. We should be worried about the potential for damage to children from their mobile phone use. A 2003 forum co-hosted by Childnet International and the Japanese Internet Association heard that children can be put in danger by what they might see or by whom they might meet online.</para><para>The government has referred the issue of how to handle pornography on 3G mobile phones for further review. There are over 14 million mobile phone accounts operating in Australia. Roy Morgan Research says that one in six teenagers own a mobile phone. More than 20,000 mobile phones are linked to the new 3G, or third generation, network. These new phones and similar mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants, can allow access to pictures, video streaming and Internet content. To date, 3G coverage is limited to Adelaide, Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney.</para><para>Mobile phones are virtually impossible for parents to supervise. There are no filtering devices available for Internet enabled mobile telephones, but carriers should install filters on their networks. At least one of Australia's 3G carriers already offers so-called adult content. It uses a PIN as a way of restricting access to minors, but the Australian Communications Authority has described PINs as `nearly useless'—that is the view of the Australian Communications Authority—for preventing children viewing content, as they change hands easily. This will be an unwelcome surprise to many parents who see mobile phones as a way of maintaining easy contact with their children and ensuring their safety, not as technology which might threaten their wellbeing. While parents might buy a mobile phone for their children's security, children are more likely to see it as an expression of their growing independence. Children have the skill and competence to use the technology, but they do not always have the maturity to decide what they should or should not see or do. </para><para>In May the government issued directions to the Australian Communications Authority to put in controls over SMS and multimedia messaging services, or MMS, so that children will not be able to see MA or R-rated content—X-rated content is not permitted—but it is very difficult for telecommunications companies to distinguish between a mobile phone used by an adult and one bought by an adult for their child. These safeguards need to be put in place before a new device or technology is put onto the market, not after. We need to protect our children; whether children are using computers or mobile phones, we have to ensure that they are safe. We have wasted enough time on this legislation. It ought to go through, but it ought to go through with the recognition that child abuse is as described by Professor Briggs.</para><para>Very young people have had access to some of this material, including R-rated material and X-rated material. I have had quite a number of distraught parents writing to me and telling me stories about their children—very young children; I am talking about three or four years of age—who have seen this material on the screen. These parents have appealed for me to do something. Of course they are emotionally disturbed and upset. I can recall one particular case where a seven-year-old had seen so-called sexually explicit material and then tried the actions out on a younger sibling who was two years of age. We have got this potential because we are not doing anything about it.</para><para>I would like to know if the original bill has been amended, as Senator Greig said, by the Attorney-General's Department on the request of the EFA—Electronic Frontiers Australia. I would like to find out in the committee stage precisely what was required, what was requested and what amendments were made on behalf of the EFA.</para><para>I will leave the matter there. I do not suggest we hold this bill up at the present moment; if there is an amendment, as I understand it, then it has got to go back to the House of Representatives and if it is unamended it can go into law. That is as I understand it. This matter has really got to be looked into at some stage and looked at very seriously. If one of the major parties came out with a policy on this particular matter, then there would be millions of parents around the place who would be very pleased that such a decision could be arrived at which would truly protect their children.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>26629</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank senators for their contribution to this bill, which is a very important one and by its very description indicates the broad area that it relates to. The <inline ref="R2131">Crimes Legislation Amendment (Telecommunications Offences and Other Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2004</inline> incorporates a number of provisions touching on areas which the average Australian would come into contact with on a daily basis. Of course, the provisions dealing with telecommunications are perhaps the ones which have been the most controversial. Significantly it contains reference to child pornography and its relationship to telecommunications, particularly the Internet. That one is by far the most significant aspect of this bill, one which is perhaps the easiest to deal with. </para></talk.start><para>The history of this bill has of course involved a great deal of consultation, as Senator Greig has pointed out, because it not only deals with child pornography on the Internet or transmitting it by telecommunications but also deals with the question of harassing a person, menacing that person or treating them in an offensive way on the Internet or using telecommunications for that purpose. It also deals with the improper use of an emergency call service, threats and hoaxes made using a telecommunication service and modification of the international mobile equipment identity number of a mobile phone. There is also a provision which deals with credit card skimming, which is becoming more important in the daily lives of Australians who have a credit card. In addition, there is the question of contaminating goods and interfering with trade. This situation has arisen recently. There is a particular case which I will not refer to as the matter is ongoing, but internationally this issue has presented itself.</para><para>For those reasons this bill is broad in its nature. I will deal first with the most significant provision of this bill, that dealing with child pornography. We need to ensure that our children, who are more technically adept than any generation before them, are protected from those who would use the Internet, and now mobile phones, for predatory and abusive purposes. I might just touch on what Senator Harradine has mentioned. It is of great concern that children can access pornography on the Internet, or any undesirable content. This bill was not designed to address that issue. This bill was designed to crack down on those people who use the Internet for the purposes of disseminating child pornography, accessing it and downloading it, and on those who use the means of telecommunication for the purposes of child pornography.</para><para>Authorities tell us that today 80 per cent of child pornography is transmitted by, or as a result of, the Internet. That is a disturbing feature. The question that Senator Harradine raises as to filtering and the regulation, if you like, of the access of children to the Internet is a very important issue and one which we will have to confront. This bill brings into law new offences which deal with the use of the Internet to access, transmit or make available child pornography and child abuse material. Other offences involve the use of the Internet to groom or procure children with the intent of engaging in sexual activity with them. Unfortunately, this activity has been on the rise recently. These offences will ensure that paedophiles who use the Internet to access and disseminate child pornography, which not only depicts the use of young children but fuels future child abuse, could face periods of up to 10 years in jail.</para><para>Perhaps more importantly, the grooming and procuring offences will enable the Australian Federal Police to interact with and arrest Internet predators before they abuse more children that they have, or intend to have, contact with through Internet chat rooms and the like. These offenders will face even longer jail terms, of up to 15 years. What we are about here is preventative action in relation to those paedophiles, those perverts, who want to use the Internet to groom children to make contact with unsuspecting children so that they can have their evil way with them. </para><para>These offences demonstrate the commitment by the Australian government to child protection, and our zero tolerance of child sexual abuse. I appreciate the support that has been given to this bill in the Senate chamber today. As Senator Harradine has indicated, should this bill be amended, then it will not be able to pass into law—it would have to go back to the House of Representatives, and we know that is not possible.</para><para>The fact that there is a lack of controversy about this bill, which has such wide application, is indicative of the history of the bill and the consultation which has taken place. I would say, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, to Senator Harradine that this bill did not originally contain provisions for filters, or the sorts of provisions which Senator Harradine has spoken of. They would find their place in separate legislation. It is not as if we have had representations about those provisions and taken them out of the bill. But we can address his concerns during the committee stage.</para><para>Other measures I have referred to concern offences dealing with the improper use of an emergency call service, the use of a telecommunications service in a menacing, harassing or offensive way, threats and hoaxes made using a telecommunications service and modification of the international mobile equipment identity number of a mobile phone.</para><para>What we have found increasingly in this day and age is the use of hoax calls. That makes it commonsense that we should have offences relating to those sorts of calls. Our authorities—those people who deal with emergency services, law enforcement and the like—have a tough enough job as it is without having to put up with hoax calls, particularly in the present security environment. It is important that we send a very clear message to the community that we will not tolerate our emergency service numbers being abused in this fashion. Unfortunately, the Internet has been used to make attacks on individuals. We have seen the Internet being used to menace and harass people. This is something which we will not tolerate in any other medium in our daily lives, and it should not be tolerated in a telecommunications service.</para><para>There are also comprehensive new contamination of goods offences. These offences reflect the economic loss and public alarm that can arise from the actual contamination of goods as well as from someone threatening to contaminate goods or falsely claiming that particular goods have been contaminated. These offences will be an important addition to the federal Criminal Code. They will complement existing state and territory offences as well as extending to threats made to contaminate Australian goods from outside Australia. This is an extremely important provision. Whilst we firmly believe, as Australians, that we should have freedom of speech, we do not believe that a protest should take the form of contamination of goods—a sabotaging, if you like, of our trading with other nations. If someone has an objection to our trading with a country or to a particular trade, then the contamination of those goods is not the way to express that opinion. This is behaviour that could cause Australia great damage economically. It could also be used to damage or harm a particular business. It is a behaviour which should be outlawed, and which will be comprehensively outlawed, by this bill.</para><para>I mentioned credit card skimming. Increasingly we are finding that credit card fraud is affecting average Australians. Out of the $1.1 billion a year worth of identity fraud, $200 million is caused by credit card fraud. In particular, we estimate that $50 million per year is caused by the use of credit card skimmers. We are seeing increasingly sophisticated attempts at ATMs and at retail outlets to skim credit cards and to transpose the details onto blank credit cards with a new identity, and we then find that an individual has been robbed of his or her credit or money accordingly; the victims are average Australians. Credit card fraud is on the rise and the Australian Federal Police are doing a great job in fighting it through their Australian High Tech Crime Centre. I have set up a group that includes representatives from banks and other financial institutions to address this very issue. There is an education program being embarked upon in relation to that. This demonstrates yet again the broad nature of this bill and the very important provisions that we have in it to protect the average Australian. </para><para>These offences not only cover credit card skimming offences but also target dishonest dealing in personal financial information without the consent of the person to whom that information relates. The possession and importation of credit card skimming devices will also be caught by new offences, with penalties of up to five years imprisonment to apply to those instances. At the borders great work is being done by Customs in the seizure of blank credit cards from organised gangs who have tried to import them into Australia. That has resulted in stopping harm that could have been perpetrated within Australia on unsuspecting small businesses in particular and also on individuals.</para><para>This bill contains provisions that are critical to law enforcement in this country, particularly in relation to the protection of children by way of the provisions that deal with child pornography. The violation of children is perhaps one of the most ghastly offences that we can contemplate. Certainly, as has been said before, it is a crime that screams out to heaven for vengeance because of the damage it can cause a child for the rest of his or her life. We heard a debate earlier in the Senate today in relation to a Senate report in which mention was made of just that, in another context.</para><para>These are very important provisions. I commend them to the Senate and urge the speedy passage of this bill. In closing I add that the Democrats have two amendments which the government has looked at carefully.

As I stated then, we Democrats are concerned that there is no requirement that anyone is actually menaced, harassed or offended, and only that a reasonable person would regard the use of the carriage service as being in all the circumstances menacing, harassing or offensive.</para><para>This leaves the quite ridiculous situation where what might appear to look like stalking to any reasonable person, and therefore liable to prosecution under this section, could actually be welcome communication on the part of the recipient. We Democrats accept the Attorney-General's argument that this offence would be difficult to prosecute, but we do not believe that is any reason to pass bad law, particularly when the problem can be fixed so readily. This Democrat amendment makes a minor change to section 474.17(1) to make it a requirement that another person is actually menaced, harassed or offended by the use of the carriage service. I understand that the government and the minister seem to be arguing that the amendment is not necessary, but I ask the minister to explain to the Senate what would be wrong with amending the bill in this way and why the bill would not be able to go forward in a reasonable way because of the amendment. For example, would it result in some wild deviation from the intent of the legislation? We do not believe so. This amendment is simple and it ought to be uncontentious. We Democrats believe that it does improve the legislation, and I commend it to the Senate. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>26632</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Firstly, the government does not support this proposed amendment, as I indicated. The government believes that it is unnecessary and that it would operate against one of the principles behind the offences in the Criminal Code in that, by requiring another person to in fact be menaced, harassed or offended by the offending use of a carriage service, a subjective standard would be introduced into that offence. By a subjective standard we are talking about the state of mind of that other person. This would have the effect that, where a person uses a carriage service in a way that any reasonable person would consider to be menacing, harassing or offensive, that person could not be prosecuted unless a person was willing to testify that they had in fact been menaced, harassed or offended by the conduct.</para></talk.start><para>This outcome would be determined by how sensitive to such conduct the particular person is who comes across the material on the Internet or who receives such an email. The proposed section is an updated version of section 85ZE of the Crimes Act 1914. In amending this offence the government has purposely tried to move away from the subjective aspects by introducing the objective standard of the reasonable person for all three elements of the offence—namely, menacing, harassing or causing offence. The reasonable person formula is not something that is strange to our law. That formula allows community standards and commonsense to be imported into any decision on whether particular conduct is in fact menacing, harassing or offensive. The fault element that applies to the requirement of the offence that a reasonable person considers the conduct to be in all circumstances menacing, harassing or offensive is recklessness. This means that, for a prosecution to proceed, the offender must be aware of a substantial risk that their conduct would be considered by a reasonable person as being menacing, harassing or offensive and that, knowing this to be the case, they unjustifiably continued their conduct. Any consideration by the arbiter of what a reasonable person would think, usually a jury, given all the circumstances in which the offence occurred, would include some consideration of the issues.</para><para>Progress reported.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>26633</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Immigration: `Children Overboard'     Affair</title><page.no>26633</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>26633</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to Senator Hill representing the Prime Minister.

We boast also about having brought down interest rates. I mentioned in the last answer interest rates under Labor: housing interest rates up to 17 per cent. They are now down to the lowest rates in the last 30 years, and consistently low, allowing Australian families the opportunity to not be concerned as they were under Labor. </para></talk.start><para>We made the tough and necessary decisions to deliver seven budget surpluses. That has enabled us to pay some $70 billion of Labor's accumulated debt. That means we are now able to invest more money than ever before in our priority areas of health, education, families and Defence. The economic credentials of the Howard government are on the record and they stand in stark contrast to the abysmal record of the Australian Labor Party. All Australians know that you cannot trust Labor on the economy. You cannot trust Labor on tax. All Australians remember the l-a-w tax cuts.</para><para>Senator Mackay shakes her head. She would like to disown the past of Labor but she will not be able to. She remembers that Labor promised tax cuts when they actually increased them. She remembers Labor bumping up taxes on Medicare, cigarettes, wine, cars, car parking, credit unions, friendly societies and light fuel oil, and she remembers fringe benefits tax, departure tax, company tax and wholesale tax not just once but twice. Already today Mr Latham has found it impossible to justify or even explain his new national payroll tax. When asked about it today, he said, `What payroll tax?' Now, we know he would not lie to the Australian people, so he must just be very forgetful.</para><para>At least Senator Mackay laughs at that one, because it seemed a good idea at the time to have this new payroll tax. Senator Conroy is looking miserable in the front row, I notice. But today, when put under pressure, Mr Latham said, `What new payroll tax?' He cannot have it both ways. Either he told a porky today—we have heard a lot about that in recent times—or, on his first day of the campaign, he disowned his own policy. He said that Labor's employee entitlements scheme will be funded by a levy of 0.1 per cent of payroll for businesses with more than 20 employees. If it sounds like a payroll tax and it looks like a payroll tax, most Australians will assume it is a payroll tax.

Throughout that campaign the then Labor government asserted that the Commonwealth budget was in surplus. The reality, which former ministers like Mr Crean and Mr McMullan must have known, was that the Commonwealth budget was then in deficit to the tune of $10,000 million. That Labor deceit was the reason this government introduced the Charter of Budget Honesty, so that no future Australian government could any longer deceive the Australian people about the state of Commonwealth finances. Labor opposed that charter and have treated it with contempt in opposition.</para></talk.start><para>A key feature of that charter is the opportunity for both the government and the opposition of the day to have their promises independently costed by the departments of Treasury and finance. In the 1998 campaign the ALP submitted only 28 of their 319 spending promises for costing four days before the election, and a further 87 less than 48 hours before the election. Then in 2001 they submitted their first promises for costing just five days before the election, and even by polling day they had submitted only around half of the promises that they had made in the election. So the key question for the Labor Party and for the Australian people is: will this new found interest in truth and honesty from the opposition result in them complying with the Charter of Budget Honesty for the first time since it was introduced in 1996?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>—Come on; you're going to have to do better than that!</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

Mr Latham promised that we would see this list weeks and weeks ago, yet we have seen nothing of it. Labor then claimed they were going to get PricewaterhouseCoopers to audit all their policies, but then PricewaterhouseCoopers had to come out and deny that that was the case; all they were going to do was pull out their adding machine and see if the numbers added up. Now we have the shadow Treasurer telling us that the tax policy is already done, that it has already been fully costed and that it is finalised. But where is it? It was promised just after the budget. It was promised 17 weeks ago and we still have not seen the policy. So there is no guarantee they are going to submit their policies for costing. We still have not seen the tax policy. They simply cannot be trusted to keep the budget in surplus, and they therefore cannot be trusted on the critical issue of keeping interest rates down. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Mr Latham has his suddenly newly found honesty.

Australians are much better off as a result of our good economic policies and our strong economic performance and discipline in relation to the budget, which we believe the Australian people will acknowledge when it comes to polling day.

The guarantee for untimed local calls that Telstra has in place was initially put in place by this government. Of course, another condition of Telstra's licence is a guarantee that low-income people in the community get a subsidy for their telephone service. This government is committed, as indeed is Telstra, to the provision of basic telephony for all Australians. These guarantees are very important consumer safeguards. The fuss made last week arose when the shadow spokesperson for communications, Mr Tanner, tried to beat up some story that an inquiry into Telstra's pricing meant that somehow untimed local calls were the subject of review. That was never the case. Untimed local calls are enshrined in legislation and it is an absolute guarantee for all Australians, as is indeed the consumer guarantee for low-income earners. </para></talk.start><para>The recent inquiry undertaken by the ACCC relates to the fact that the caps on prices of these services are due to expire next year. Obviously, this government is interested to ensure that an appropriate inquiry be had so that consumers are protected. The ACCC is best placed to make inquiries and take into account consumer concerns—as well as the other matter concerning Telstra and other telecommunications carriers—to ensure that there are appropriate services for consumers. That is why there is an inquiry. Of course, it is subject to a ministerial determination. But there is no suggestion that the policy on untimed local calls will be changed and it is part of legislation that was passed by the parliament.

On what basis would Telstra make that statement, indicating to the public that it could consider removing that subsidy?

The Prime Minister indicated that we will maintain downward pressure on the cost of private health insurance. With the increasing costs in health—for example, a prosthesis for a hip replacement costs up to $15,000—you cannot not expect increases in private health insurance premiums. From memory, under Labor the increase was 12 per cent each year. I will stand corrected on that, as that is from the top of my head. In one year alone there was a 17 per cent increase in private health insurance premiums under Labor, when people were fleeing private health insurance. Only those who were older and sicker and were going to cost more were left in private health insurance. Labor had no plan to ensure that private health insurance was sustainable into the future. The government brought in a rebate which Labor said for a very long time that they were not going to support and now, before the election, they say that they will. But I would bet my bottom dollar that, if they ever got into government, you would see that 30 per cent rebate disappear faster than you could say `Jack Robinson'. </para></talk.start><para>Another thing the government did was to ensure that younger people who went into private health insurance and stayed in for a long period, making a commitment to private health insurance, were not penalised by someone coming in as a Johnny-come-lately 30 years later and getting the same benefit. If people came into private health insurance later, they would pay a two per cent surcharge each year. We put in place measures to ensure that private health insurance was sustainable. A former senator, Graham Richardson, said when he was health minister in a Labor government that private health insurance was not sustainable. I know there are people on the Labor side of politics who actually detest private health insurance and do not take it up. A former Labor health minister, Dr Lawrence, said that she would not take out private health insurance. Labor had a Prime Minister who said that he would not take out private health insurance, and you have a leader who took up a public hospital bed when he could have gone into a private hospital bed.

Of great pride to everybody on this side of the chamber are the government's achievements in relation to caring for and providing better outcomes for first Australians. Since 1996 we have increased spending on Indigenous programs by 39 per cent in real terms. We are now spending 39 per cent more in real terms than the Labor government did in their last year in office. We do not do this because there are votes in it—there are not many marginal seats that have a large number of Indigenous voters in them—we do it because they are first Australians and they deserve value for money.</para></talk.start><para>Let me turn to some of our specific achievements. Death rates from respiratory illness were over seven times the rate for non-Indigenous Australians from 1992 to 1994. They are now four times the rate. They have come down from seven to four. They still need to come down further, but that is in itself an achievement. Death rates from infectious and parasitic diseases were over nine times the rate for non-Indigenous Australians from 1992 to 1994. They are now down to five times the rate. These are important achievements. Five times the rate is still woefully high and it is still unsatisfactory, but it is a real achievement to bring the death rate down from nine times that of non-Indigenous Australians to only five times. In the Torres Strait, for example, there has been a 41 per cent reduction in diabetes related hospital admissions.</para><para>There is more we could say on health, but let us turn to education and employment—where you give people real opportunities. The year 12 retention rate for Indigenous Australians increased from 29 per cent in 1996 to 39 per cent in 2001. If education gives you a chance, the year 12 retention rate going from 29 per cent to 39 per cent is surely an achievement. The number of vocational education and training students has almost doubled since 1996. Unemployment rates are down. Employment participation rates are up. In 1996 there were fewer than 4,000 new apprentices, and there are now almost 8,000. Overcrowding rates are reducing. More communities have access to sewerage, electricity and water. I give credit to the state governments for having done that. Deaths in custody have reduced since 1996 and are now less than the non-Indigenous rate. But we want better outcomes, and that is why we chose to abolish ATSIC and to radically reform service delivery. We have already made achievements but we want to go further.</para><para>As to alternative policies, I am a bit uncertain. Senator Scullion, there is plenty more that I would like to say on this issue. I was watching <inline font-style="italic">60 Minutes </inline>last night and I saw Mr Latham list as an achievement getting rid of ATSIC. Fancy a woman reporter saying, `What are your achievements?' Affronted, he said, `I've been achieving things in the parliament—the abolition of ATSIC.' Well, hello! It is still there because you refused to pass a bill to get rid of it. He said it again on radio this morning. `I got it done,' he says—it is always about the boy—`so too the abolition of ATSIC. So there are runs on the board. There are achievements from opposition.'

It is actually Sergeant Schultz—`I know nothing.' `I know nothing' is his favourite statement. `Nobody told me. I know nothing.' The Prime Minister did not know about Abu Ghraib. He did not know about `kids overboard'. He does not know the GST is a federal tax. Each year this government produces a budget that is qualified by the Auditor-General. Why? It is because this government chooses to pretend to Australians that the GST is a state tax. I spoke for about five hours on the GST in this very chamber, because the GST is a federal tax.

He said, `Here is my plan to put a new tax on Australians, and I now ask you whether you will approve of that plan by re-electing my government'—which, of course, the Australian people did.

Australian students and their families discovered just a year or so later that the Labor government was going to impose a charge for the right to obtain a university education.</para><para>We know that the Labor Party have made many promises in this campaign, and we can trust them to do a number of things to pay for those promises. We know they will reduce the diesel fuel rebate by $467 million. We know they will abolish the Office of the Employment Advocate and take away protection for Australians negotiating better wage outcomes. We know they will abolish extra industrial relations commissioners. We know they will abolish Invest Australia, which attracts people and investment into this country to support the retention and growth of the Australian economy. We know they will scrap the National Office for the Information Economy and the Australian Government Information Management Office. We know all those things but we do not know where the unspecified $852 million, and counting, in savings will come from. Until Labor spell out that and explain what jobs will be lost, particularly in the Australian Public Service, as a result of those decisions that have not yet been shared with the Australian community, they have no right to come into this place and raise the question of truth in government. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>26652</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In this debate to take note of answers to questions asked of Senator Hill today, I think it is important to focus on the question of trust because the minister in answering questions today was very keen to move on and to say that the Australian public are not interested in these issues. I disagree: I think people are interested in these issues. They are interested in the question of whether the Prime Minister lied to them and I think they regard that as fundamentally important, and I share that view.</para></talk.start><para>What has happened is that Mike Scrafton, a former senior Defence official, has effectively exposed the Prime Minister as having lied to the Australian public. His evidence has bought this issue to the head of Australian public life. Mike Scrafton has made it clear that John Howard, the Prime Minister, knew that no children had been thrown overboard and that the Prime Minister had continued to misrepresent that position to the Australian public. The question of the truthfulness of the Prime Minister is central to the political and public debate in this country. What Mike Scrafton did in clearing his conscience, if you like, is tell the truth and to make it clear that, in his view, the Prime Minister knew. The PM was a bit unsettled by all that. He has looked a bit off balance for the last few months but he was very unsettled by those comments. He responded to them, knowing that it was biting in the Australian public, despite what the minister has said, and that there was concern in the Australian community. The Australian public do not like being lied to, they were unsettled and concerned by the suggestion that the PM had lied to them and their doubts were confirmed, if you like, by Mike Scrafton's evidence. </para><para>What did the PM do? He sent a couple of people around without any public announcement to see a couple of the Defence Force people who had done the report into the `children overboard' affair to see what they had to say. It was the first time that the Prime Minister had genuinely sought answers to key questions in this area, but again he got the answers he did not want, the answers that he had been keen to conceal for three years. When Major General Powell and Commander Michael Noonan were interviewed, they backed Mike Scrafton. They said that yes he had told the Prime Minister. They supported his version of events. So suddenly the Prime Minister is sitting in his office confronted with the fact that he had gone out and sought the information for the first time, while being off balance and unsettled, he had gone to the Defence Force major general and the commander and asked their views, and they backed Mr Scrafton. They said that the Prime Minister was told and that he did know that what he was telling the Australian public was not true.</para><para>So then the Prime Minister had this problem: he had the information that destroyed his case, but what to do with it. So the next day he raced around and got four of his staff to sign documents saying that they backed his version of events, that he had told them that he had not been told. They were not directly involved of course but they backed their boss. Funny that: they backed their boss. Then he had to get it all out because he knew that this was like a cancer eating at the core of the government. If this came out during the election campaign he knew he would be dead in the water so he released it and set about the campaign of denigrating Mr Scrafton. What we have seen again is that the truth will out: when the Defence officials were asked the proper questions they backed Mike Scrafton. This is Mr Scrafton who worked for the Liberal government. This is not some Labor hack; this is a person who was employed by the Liberal Party in a ministerial office who came out and told his story. When the Australian Defence Force personnel were asked their version, were finally asked to tell their side of the story, they backed Mr Scrafton not the Prime Minister. The general and the commander both backed Mr Scrafton. They have no political interest in this, but they were prepared to tell the truth.</para><para>It reminds me of Air Marshal Houston: when he was finally asked during the Senate committee process whether children had been thrown overboard, Air Marshal Houston was honest. That destroyed the government's case then. This is a government determined to hide the truth, to continue with the big lies, to prevent the evidence about `children overboard', about Abu Ghraib and about Iraqi intelligence coming out. This is a government that has misused the Defence Force terribly over the last few years for their political ends and refused to allow them to act in a professional and impartial manner. They have used them to their political advantage and caused a great deal of distress inside Defence at the way they have been politicised. Ever since former Minister Reith, but continued under this minister, Defence has felt politicised and used. But when asked the right questions, when allowed to tell the truth, they have always honestly and openly told the truth, and that has destroyed the government's case. It has destroyed John Howard's case and proven that he lied to the Australian public. This will out: the Prime Minister is now exposed. Just like the 43 senior diplomats and former Defence officials, people want truth in government. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Marshall, Gavin (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Marshall)</inline>—Order!

We have seen already in the first 24 hours of the election campaign, including question time today, Mr Latham saying that the Prime Minister has lied and deceived and been dishonest. We had Mr Howard this morning saying that Mr Latham has lied. The Democrats believe that neither Labor nor Liberal can be trusted, and certainly not trusted and given the absolute power that rests in the hands of a Prime Minister without the protection of an independent Senate to control and prevent that abuse of power.</para></talk.start><para>It has already come down to accusation versus accusation. I do not know if people remember the old cartoon <inline font-style="italic">Spy </inline><inline font-style="italic">v.</inline><inline font-style="italic"> Spy</inline>.

We need to do better than a liar versus liar campaign. We need to do better than a liar versus liar form of political debate and mechanism for determining decision making in government in this country. That is why having an independent Senate that can examine the truth is so important and why the role of the two larger parties, such as in the Senate in question time today, really exposed what a lack of any substance to debate we get from them on the issues that affect people. We had a simple question today—it could not get more simple—to the Minister representing the Treasurer here: do you still believe the Senate should have the power to block supply?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>EP5</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator Ferguson</name></talker><para>—It was an out of order question.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name></talker><para>—It was not out of order and it was not ruled out of order to ask: does the representative of the Treasurer believe that it is economically responsible for the Senate to block supply? This government is already going on about how it is economically responsible. The Democrats agree that being economically responsible is important. That is why we have taken that approach in the Senate on a whole range of economic legislation. We agree that you need to get those foundations of prosperity and those foundations of a solid economy in place to more effectively address other issues of importance like more protection of the environment and assisting people in need with social services and all the other aspects of society. We can make the economy work better—we can certainly make it work fairer—but we do need to be economically responsible.  </para></talk.start></continue><para>How laughable is it for them to emphasise economic responsibility but then refuse to rule out the simple action of blocking supply? Nothing could be more economically irresponsible and disruptive to this economy than preventing the passage of legislation that allows the ordinary annual services of government to occur, yet this Liberal Party would not rule it out. We all know—and it is quite clear—there is a possibility, even if the Labor Party moves into government, that the coalition could well have a blocking majority—38 out of 76 seats. They on their own could block anything passing. Certainly, as has been demonstrated by vote in this Senate, the Greens quite openly say they also believe the Senate should retain the power to block supply. The Democrats disagree with them on that, as do the Labor Party. </para><para>There is clearly a prospect of Labor being in government but a majority in the Senate being willing to block supply. You do not get much more economically irresponsible than that from a government that likes to preach it, yet here it is slithering all around the place, dodging straightforward, black-and-white simple questions. It is no wonder people cannot trust the Prime Minister when he talks about economic responsibility and it is no wonder they are not confident that they can trust Mr Latham to perform responsibly, to tell the truth and to not backtrack on core promises, because we have already seen that even in the short time he has been opposition leader. That is why you need a strong Senate, independent of whoever is in government. I urge everyone listening to remember that they have two decisions to make on polling day—not just whom they put in the Lodge but whom they put in the Senate to watch over them. The stronger the Senate is, the more freedoms are protected and the more responsible our system of government will be.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><petition.group><petition.groupinfo><title>PETITIONS</title><page.no>26655</page.no></petition.groupinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1</name.id><name role="metadata">The Clerk</name><name role="display">The Clerk</name></talker><para>—Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows:</para></talk.start></interjection><petition><petitioninfo><title>Medicare: Reform</title><page.no>26655</page.no><no.signed>63</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>8HC</name.id></name.ids><names><name>Senator Harris</name></names></petitioninfo><quote><para>To the Honourable President and members of the Senate assembled in parliament:</para><para>The petition of the undersigned citizens of Queensland shows that we reject the Howard Government's proposed changes to Medicare.

The Notice revokes and re-makes the Broadcasting Services (Events) Notice No. 1 of 1994. The new instrument continues to prevent pay TV licensees from acquiring a right to a listed event until it has first been acquired by a commercial free-to-air broadcaster reaching more than 50 per cent of the Australian population, by a national broadcaster, or the right has not been purchased by a free-to-air broadcaster and is de-listed.</para><para>The new instrument separates protected events into two separate anti-siphoning lists. Schedule 1 re-makes and clarifies the original anti-siphoning instrument and therefore protects sporting events taking place up to 31 December 2005. Schedule 2 protects a revised list of events which will take place between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2010.</para><para>The Explanatory Statement for the new instrument notes that “in substance, the events listed in Schedule 1 are the same as the events listed in the previous anti-siphoning list. The previous list has been updated to include correct names for certain sporting bodies and competitions, and to remove out-of-date references.”</para><para>As part of the reforms to the anti-siphoning list announced on 7 April 2004, the Government decided to include on the anti-siphoning list the Olympic and Commonwealth Games to ensure that these important events continue to be available to viewers on free-to-air television. The Committee has noted that the list at Schedule 1 does not include the 2004 Olympic Games. This event has not been added to Schedule 1 because, as noted above, no events that take place before 31 December 2005 have been added to the original list which is now replicated in Schedule 1. In addition, as the rights to the 2004 Olympic Games have already been acquired by a free-to-air broadcaster, there would be no practical purpose served by their addition to Schedule 1.</para><para>The Committee has also noted that the Explanatory Statement for the new anti-siphoning instrument indicates that Schedule 2 of the list does not include Australian Football League (AFL) State of Origin matches, whereas you suggest that these matches are in fact included on the list.</para><para>In fact AFL State of Origin matches are only included in Schedule 1 (at sub-item 2.2 of that Schedule) because they were included in the original instrument. Item 4 of Schedule 2, which relates to Australian Rules Football, does not mention AFL State of Origin matches. Events of this kind that take place before 31 December 2005 are therefore protected by the anti-siphoning scheme, while events that take place after that point are not. (I note that AFL State of Origin matches have not taken place for a number of years.) </para><para>You also note that an item relating to Rugby League matches that appears in the list at Schedule 1 does not appear in the list at Schedule 2, ie “Any other match involving the senior Australian representative team selected by the Australian Rugby League, whether played in Australia or overseas”, (sub-item 3.4). The Explanatory Statement fails to note that these Rugby League matches have not been included on the list at Schedule 2 of the new instrument. While this is an oversight in the Explanatory Statement, the non-inclusion of this item is a direct decision by the Government which is unrelated to the issue of AFL State of Origin matches.</para><para>I hope that this information is of assistance.</para><para>Yours sincerely</para><para>HELEN COONAN</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nettle</inline> to move on the next day of sitting:</para><motion><para>That the Senate—</para><para>	(a)	notes that:</para><para>	(i)	on the weekend of 28 and 29 August 2004, as many as 400 000 people marched in New York, protesting the neo-conservative agenda of George W Bush and the Republican Party,</para><para>	(ii)	opposition to the war and occupation in Iraq is growing in the United States of America and around the world, and</para><para>	(iii)	opposing the agenda of the present White House is not anti-American but rather a view shared by a majority of Americans and the world's people;</para><para>	(b)	congratulates the hundreds of thousands of Americans who marched on the weekend in New York and across the United States of America;

Sometimes, apparently, channels of communication are blocked, and this appears to be one of those times. I accept that that can happen. I am sorry that it has happened. My understanding is that it was worked through the forums we have off chamber. If Senator Harradine was not aware of that, I apologise to him. It is a matter beyond my control but, of course, we accept responsibility for that.</para><para>The situation is, however, that the parliament is to be prorogued tomorrow. We have already had a motion pass the Senate in relation to the adjournment of the Senate tomorrow, so this matter is indeed an urgent one. I think there is an unarguable case for urgency. That at least is supported by the fact that the government is willing to give leave for the matter to be debated and determined. That does not go to the substance of the issue.</para><para>This is in the context of Mr Howard having used what is a very unusual tactic: to effectively dissolve the House of Representatives today so that the House does not sit, and prorogue the Senate and the parliament tomorrow. Why has the government proposed, as Senator Hill did to me yesterday, that the Senate decide not to sit these two days? That was a suggestion that was made. The fact is that, if the House had sat on these two days before prorogation, Mr Howard would have had to face two question times. He would have had to answer directly questions about his misrepresentation of the children overboard incident during the election campaign. He would have had to defend his version of his conversations with Mr Scrafton in the dying days of that campaign. More importantly, he would have had to explain his continuing refusal to be frank and truthful with the Australian people.</para><para>It is quite clear that Mr Howard chose to dissolve the House to avoid this situation. He did not want to be held to account. He chose to cut and run. I actually wonder if Mr Howard thought the issue through in relation to the Senate. On the one hand, he says to us that he allowed the Senate to sit in order to avoid the charge that he was trying to evade scrutiny; on the other hand, the Leader of the Government in the Senate was proceeding on the assumption that the government and the opposition could simply agree not to sit and petition the Senate President accordingly. But that is not the case. The Senate had determined that it would resume sittings today. In the absence of prorogation, those sittings proceed. There is no provision in the standing orders for a majority of senators to cancel a scheduled sitting.</para><para>The only way we can effectively make a decision about this substantive matter before prorogation is to do it in a sensible, and I think civilised, way—which is by leave. In the absence of leave—which I had expected would be forthcoming, given the off-chamber discussions that took place—a suspension of standing orders is the only viable option.</para><para>I think the case for urgency in relation to this matter is unarguable. Whatever the Senate determines to do in relation to this matter, it has to determine it before five o'clock tomorrow. That is the end game. If we follow the normal processes, there is no guarantee at all that we can complete our deliberations on this matter, so I think the arguments for dealing with it now are substantive. I understand there is even debate going on at this time around the chamber about the possibility of the Senate not even sitting tomorrow, if it completes most of its business today. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name></talker><para>—We all hope.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—You might hope that, Senator Hill.

I accept that there is an urgency to dispose of this motion because I think it is a disgraceful abuse of the Senate. It is an unprecedented abuse of the Senate to set up a select committee to meet during an election campaign to, in effect, operate as a campaign tool of the Labor Party—or, I should say, this alignment between the Labor Party and the Greens, because there is hardly any division between the two as it now stands.

Sadly, the Independents, who you might think would be prepared to assess this issue objectively and independently, are not going to. They are going to allow themselves to be used as part of this parliamentary abuse, this campaign tool of the Labor Party at public expense. It is important that this be seen for what it is and that it be disposed of quickly. Therefore, there is an issue of urgency: the sooner it is got rid of, the better.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>26666</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The point that Senator Faulkner made to the chamber is a valid one. Obviously this is an urgent motion. I had not thought of the point that was, by interjection, made by another senator—that it had to be dealt with and disposed of today. I now accept that point. I would seek to amend the proposal so that, rather than it being referred to a select committee, the matter is referred to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee for inquiry and report on or before 7 October 2004. The motion refers to `implications of these statements for the findings of the Senate Select Committee on Certain Maritime Incident'. I would add `and for policy'. The 14 points contained in the motion would not be required, because they would be contained in standing orders governing the actions of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee. I really would appeal to the opposition to have a look at referring the matter to that committee. It is important that there is no hint that the inquiry is being conducted by a stacked committee. The evidence will come out. Presumably, they can call for it. I strongly recommend to the Labor Party that they take this amendment and follow it through. I will now be supporting Senator Faulkner's motion for the suspension of standing orders, because it is a valid point that he makes about time. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>26666</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As I understand it, the Senate at the moment is debating a motion for the suspension of standing orders to give urgency or priority to establishing a select committee to examine the so-called Scrafton matters. That is something the Democrats are on the record as supporting. Clearly it is an urgent matter. Therefore, we will support the suspension of the standing orders to allow consideration of that question by the Senate. I do believe that the Senate is in fairly extraordinary and unique circumstances. The Prime Minister's decision to announce the election campaign early and not have the House of Representatives sit but have the Senate sit on its own does, no doubt quite deliberately, leave the Senate in a fairly absurd situation.</para></talk.start><para>There is one thing the Prime Minister has said in this election campaign that I do agree with—I am not sure there are too many more so far, but there is certainly one—and that is that the government does not control the Senate. The Democrats believe that it is absolutely essential that that remains the case. That is a key matter for the election campaign. Even though the government does not control the Senate, it has obviously made a farce of these sittings by not having the House of Representatives sit. There is no point in amending legislation, which is a key part of the Senate's role and value, because the House of Representatives is not there to consider the amendments. Therefore a lot of what we are dealing with, separate from this matter, is basically a farce and another example of the Prime Minister's contempt for the parliament, contempt for the Senate and contempt for democracy. Those are themes we can expand on and engage on during the election campaign itself. Not surprisingly, given our party's name, the Democrats are in favour of strengthening democracy, and I think most of the electorate are as well. We will see how that goes on polling day.</para><para>The matter before us, to suspend standing orders to decide whether or not to establish a committee, is obviously urgent. It is one of the few substantive matters left on the Senate agenda that can effectively be dealt with and that would have any significant value to it. Therefore it should certainly be given urgency. For the government to try and suggest that it should not even be put to a vote is just another example of them dodging scrutiny. To try and prevent the matter even coming to a question—as they are doing by opposing this motion for suspension—is a clear example of them trying to avoid scrutiny, despite all of their protestations that they are not. We certainly support the motion. We will listen to further arguments about any improvements to the motion. Clearly we are in favour of having an opportunity for the truth to be put more clearly on the record and for those claims to be tested—obviously not just by the Labor Party but by any government members. The forensic, incisive examination that relevant government members may try to bring to the inquiry—and obviously the independent approach that the Democrats will bring—will enable those matters to get tested, and that is important. It is a matter for the public, then, to choose what to make of that extra information rather than for the committee to decide. I certainly support the suspension motion to allow us to debate the substantive motion. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>26667</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I disagree with Senator Harradine's view that this matter should be referred to a legislation committee with a government majority.

He was the leader of the opposition that set up, controlled and manipulated the Loans Council inquiry that met constantly during the 1993 election in airport lounges in total high farce. He has forgotten that; amnesia has hit the poor old Leader of the Government here today. You just had to look at him at question time. It reminds me of the old saying of Michael Foot: `like a rag doll pumped full of benzedrine'. That was Senator Hill's performance today—absolutely excitable. You usually react that way when you are down in the polls, so it is good news for me if you are reacting that way. I do not know anything about the polls, but if you do that is good news.</para></talk.start></continue><para>A select committee is always the obvious way to go. We have shown our bona fides here, because quite properly it was pointed out that the original reporting date was two days before the federal election. That would be a bit red-hot, so we have changed it to 24 November because the other date was chosen before the election date was known. We have moved it out; we do not intend to run a witch-hunt a la the loans inquiry that Senator Hill was fully responsible for back in 1993. The old Liberal Party amnesias met. Of course, then we get the secondary line from Senator Hill: `Time to move on.' When we write Senator Hill's epitaph—and I hope it is a long way away; I do not wish him any harm—I know what will be on it: `Let's move on.' He does not like scrutiny; he does not like to be held accountable for actions in the past. `Always move on. Don't worry about yesterday's lies. Don't worry that three days before a federal election the Prime Minister inadvertently or deliberately misleads the Australian public. That doesn't matter anymore; that's past history. We just want to fight the next election on our own rules. We'll set up the rules,' they say.

On that I agree. I will not be part of a 1993 loans inquiry. That was a total, absolute political farce that you produced, you wrote, you directed and you acted in—and you have conveniently forgotten it now, 11 years later. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name></talker><para>—Why do you stack this one?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>—Senator Hill says it is stacked.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name></talker><para>—It is stacked.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>—A select committee normally does not have a government majority or an opposition majority, but you say that it is stacked.

You do not want the truth to come out; you will do anything to prevent the truth coming out, because it goes to the credibility of a Prime Minister who has closed down the House of Representatives.

But I ask this question: if that is the case, why has he dissolved the House of Representatives? And why has the government proposed—certainly Senator Hill did to me yesterday—that the Senate decide not to sit on these two days? It really does not make a great deal of sense. If the House had sat on these two days, before the prorogation of the parliament, Mr Howard would have had to face two question times. He would have had to answer directly questions about his misrepresentation of the `children overboard' incident at the most sensitive time of the political cycle during the last election campaign. He would have had to defend his version of his conversations with Mr Scrafton in the dying days of that campaign. More importantly, he would have had to explain his continuing refusal to be frank and truthful with the Australian people. He would have had to be held to account for what the Liberal Party president of yesteryear, Mr Shane Stone, described three years ago as his meanness and trickiness.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>008W7</name.id><name role="metadata">Brandis, Sen George</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—It is all right for Senator Brandis to roll his eyes about Mr Stone; apparently he is just another enemy of Senator Brandis.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is quite clear that Mr Howard chose to dissolve the House to avoid parliamentary scrutiny. He did not want to be held to account. He chose to cut and run. As for the Senate, as I have said before, you really have to wonder whether the Prime Minister actually thought through the sitting of the Senate, because he seems to be in two minds about this: on the one hand he said that he allowed the Senate to sit in order to avoid the charge that he was trying to evade scrutiny; on the other hand his leader in the Senate was proceeding on the assumption that the government and the opposition could simply agree not to sit and petition the Senate President accordingly. We know that that is not the case. The Senate had determined that it would resume its sittings today, and in the absence of a prorogation those sittings must proceed. There is no provision in the standing orders for a majority of senators to cancel a scheduled sitting of the Senate. We have the circumstance where the Senate did not have any option but to sit. </para><para>We also had the circumstance of a dithering Prime Minister taking so long to make up his mind about when to have the election that by the time he made his announcement at one o'clock yesterday afternoon most senators and a good number of members of the House of Representatives were already in Canberra or in planes on their way to Canberra. Heaven knows what that cost the taxpayers' purse; we will find out in due course. But we say that, given that we are here, we will give the taxpayers of Australia their money's worth. We will do what the Senate is charged to do, and that is to hold the government to account.</para><para>Senators will recall, I am sure, the inquiry conducted by the Senate Select Committee on a Certain Maritime Incident into the shameful so-called children overboard affair in October and November of 2001. That inquiry was established in February 2002 and it reported in October of that same year and made a number of very important findings. This afternoon I want to remind the Senate of some of those findings of fact in the report of the Senate Select Committee on a Certain Maritime Incident. Let us have a look at them:</para><quote><para>No children were thrown overboard from SIEV 4.</para></quote><para>	...	...	...</para><quote><para>Photographs released to the media on 10 October as evidence of children thrown overboard on 7 October were actually pictures taken the following day, 8 October, while SIEV 4 was sinking.</para><para>By 11 October 2001, the naval chain of command had concluded that no children had been thrown overboard from SIEV 4.

The committee was unable to complete its work because of the government's refusal to allow key witnesses to give evidence. One of those key witnesses has now come forward. Mr Mike Scrafton, freed of the constraints imposed on him by the government, has come forward to tell his side of the story. Two weeks ago, on 16 August, Mr Scrafton, who had been Mr Reith's defence adviser at the time of the children overboard affair, revealed that he told the Prime Minister on 7 November 2001, the day before the Prime Minister appeared at the Press Club, that the video of the incident was inconclusive, that the photographs released in early October were definitely of the sinking of the vessel the day after the incident, that no-one he had dealt with in Defence on the matter still believed children had been thrown overboard and that he had the impression that the ONA report which confirmed that children had been thrown overboard was based on the public statements of the then minister for immigration, Mr Ruddock. </para><para>Mr Howard denies Mr Scrafton's version of events and has questioned Mr Scrafton's integrity. Yet Mr Scrafton's account has been backed by Jenny McKenry, the then head of the Department of Defence public affairs and corporate communications area, whom he spoke to the next day about his conversation with Mr Howard. It has been further corroborated by Major General Powell, who conducted the parallel military inquiry into the incident, and his assistant in that inquiry, Commander Noonan. These two officers had interviewed Mr Scrafton in December 2001 and recalled that he had given them similar accounts of his conversations with the Prime Minister. Clearly, Mr Scrafton's statements are directly relevant to the work of the previous Senate inquiry and may well provide the missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle. Mr Howard and his minions—like Senator Hill—will no doubt accuse the Senate of conducting a witch-hunt.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name></talker><para>—Correct.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—Of course you will. You will accuse the Senate of seeking to refight the lost battle of the last election and of being obsessed with the past.

Mr Howard said that the Senate should sit to deal with this matter. Mr Howard said that the Senate should sit and do their darnedest. This is core business for the Senate. We are here to hold the government to account. We have conducted one inquiry into this affair. It was a very comprehensive and very effective inquiry, but it was thwarted in its attempt to get to the bottom of these issues.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Now one of the witnesses—or non-witnesses—Mr Scrafton, has made public statements that might enable us to complete the unfinished business of that earlier inquiry. Furthermore, Mr Scrafton has indicated his willingness to give evidence on the record. Clearly, we ought to be giving him that opportunity. There are others, such as Ms McKenry, Major General Powell and Commander Noonan, who also may be able to assist the Senate to assess Mr Scrafton's evidence. If the Senate agrees to establish an inquiry it is the opposition's intention to conduct hearings as quickly as possible. We do not anticipate that more than one day of hearings would be necessary. We are very conscious of the fact—and all senators should be conscious of the fact—that we are in an election campaign, even if the Senate is sitting. Quite frankly, most senators and most parliamentarians have other priorities. I admit that I have other priorities: to ensure, if I can, a Labor victory in this election. I am sure every senator will be strongly campaigning in their or their party's interests in the election. </para><para>A lot has been said, even in interjections in the chamber today, about the subpoenaing of witnesses. I want to make it very clear that the opposition will not be seeking to subpoena ministerial staff during an election campaign. We believe that that issue is best left until after the election. Mr Howard has staff working for him in this election campaign and we have to assess whether is reasonable for ministerial staff—in this case, prime ministerial staff—to be subpoenaed during an election campaign. I certainly accept that staff have other priorities during a campaign and I accept that parliamentarians—in government, in opposition or on the cross-benches—are entitled to expect full-time dedication from their staff at such a critical stage of the electoral cycle. Contrary to what has been said in this chamber today, I do not anticipate the committee handing down a report this side of the election. Originally there was a reporting date of 7 October.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name></talker><para>—That is the date I was given.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—It may have been the date you were given.

I thought that in question time today, frankly, you ought to have had a long drink of water, a Bex and a good lie down, Senator Hill, because you seemed to have been totally out of control. The original proposed reporting date was set before the election was called, and the motion before the chamber today proposes that the committee report on 24 November. Senator Hill was critical of us in question time again today—an abusive question time—for setting up a Senate committee inquiry to proceed during an election campaign. We all heard that extraordinary outburst. But Senator Hill must surely know there is nothing at all extraordinary about Senate committees continuing their work into an election campaign, and there are any number of precedents. Indeed, I am surprised Senator Hill does not recall the Select Committee on the Functions, Powers and Operation of the Australian Loan Council, which pursued its witch-hunt throughout the 1993 election campaign. I had the misfortune to serve on that Senate select committee. At the time all that was going on, Senator Hill was the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. But I can assure Senator Hill, I can assure all senators and I can assure the Senate that we are not seeking to emulate that sort of performance—Senator Hill's performance on that occasion. Our main purpose in seeking to establish this committee is to examine, under oath, the statements made by Mr Scrafton and their implications for the findings of the earlier inquiry into the `children overboard' affair. We are seeking to discharge our accountability obligations to get to the bottom of what has been undoubtedly one of the most shameful episodes in Australian politics. I believe this is the way forward; this is the way to do that. I commend this motion to the Senate.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>26673</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This is an unprecedented abuse of the Senate.

This is a Senate select committee being set up at public expense after an election has been called to meet during the course of the election in order to seek to make a political point against one particular party. It is the Australian Labor Party joining with the Greens and, I suspect, with the Australian Democrats to establish this committee to call a witness who they believe will give evidence that will damage the government, and they will do that at public expense. They will pass a resolution today that gives them the numbers to control the committee: when it will meet, how often it will meet, which witnesses it will call, which witnesses it will not call, whether it swears its witnesses or whether it subpoenas its witnesses. If you look at the order that they seek to have passed, the motion says:</para></talk.start></continue><motion><para>That the committee be provided with all necessary staff, facilities and resources and be empowered to appoint persons with specialist knowledge for the purposes of the committee with the approval of the President.</para></motion><para>It is set up to do a job. It is set up for the specific political purpose of damaging the government, and it is being set up, as I said, in an unprecedented way after an election has been called. As I said during question time and as I say again, I know of no other political abuse of the Senate of this type. It clearly should be an embarrassment to the Independents. I do not think anything would embarrass the Australian Labor Party but the fact that the Independents have been sucked into this abuse by the Australian Labor Party is, I think, particularly disappointing.</para><para>It is true that they were even going to go so far as to demand that the committee report—in other words, make a finding that the Labor Party would control—before the election was held. The draft of the motion that was given to the Government Whip this morning provided for a reporting date of 7 October. It would seem that even Senator Faulkner, when he reflected upon that this morning, was too embarrassed to come into the chamber and move a later reporting date, so he moved the later reporting date without giving us notice that he had changed his mind. That was supposed to just slip through. What it amounts to, however, is the Labor Party using its numbers in conjunction with two Independent groupings to establish a campaign tool that will be utilised at public expense, during the course of this campaign, against the government's interests. That is a disgraceful abuse and it should be seen as such. It should be seen as a sham. That is what disturbs me most—that, because it will appear under the order as a select committee of the Senate, it will therefore gain the legitimacy of the Senate. That is the abuse that is occurring here.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>EP5</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator Ferguson</name></talker><para>—It's a show trial.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name></talker><para>—As Senator Ferguson says, it is a show trial being given the legitimacy of the Senate.

Last week the Labor Party announced that it was going to do this—to, in effect, have a go at the Prime Minister through this process. The Prime Minister did not prorogue the parliament because if he had done so Senator Faulkner would have argued publicly that the Prime Minister had something to hide. The Prime Minister has nothing to hide in this instance, as should have been evident when in the last campaign he put on the record the videotape that did not really prove either side of the argument. Even though it did not assist the Prime Minister, he put it on the public record because he believed the public had a right to be informed. The Prime Minister received two statements last week that also did not assist him but immediately decided to put them on the record because the public have a right to be informed. This is a Prime Minister who has nothing to hide—nothing to hide at all. If he had not allowed the Senate to sit, it would have been said by the Labor Party that he was not prepared to face scrutiny. </para><para>Yesterday I asked Senator Faulkner if he was serious about this task, because I really doubted that, when it came to the crunch, Senator Faulkner would sign on to abuse of this type and dimension. I said to him, `Do you really plan to go ahead with this? If you do not, I have advice that under standing order 55 an absolute majority could change the sitting times of the Senate.' Of course, that was not the way the Labor Party wanted to go, because it wants to use this abuse for its short-term political goal, no matter what might be the long-term consequences of the precedent that it is establishing. So the Labor Party was not interested in that. But it is a bit cheeky of Senator Faulkner then to come into the Senate today and say that we really have to go through this sham because the sitting pattern of the Senate has forced us to sit and we have no choice. The Senate could actually pass some important legislation that is on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper </inline>today. Then it would be doing something useful.</para><para>It was said by Senator Faulkner that we on this side of the table wish to attack the integrity of Mr Scrafton.

We are not interested in Mr Scrafton in this, and the Labor Party is not interested in Mr Scrafton except that it wants to use him as a tool to attack the Prime Minister's personal standing. In some ways, I regret that Mr Scrafton has allowed himself to be drawn into this sham—this abuse by the Labor Party. I would be interested to know whether the Labor Party gave him a call and asked whether he actually wanted to appear before the Senate inquiry that is being set up here today. I doubt very much whether it did that. Why is the Labor Party wishing to so personalise this campaign? Why is it wanting to drag this campaign into the gutter when it really should be all about the alternative programs that are being offered to the Australian people? The Australian people should be able to choose between the different tax policies, security policies, health policies and education policies. Why is he wishing to turn this into a personalised campaign and drag it into the gutter? It is, of course, because that is the nature of Mr Latham. That is his style.

Let us remind ourselves for a moment what was happening on that awful morning of 7 October 2001. I invite honourable senators to refer to the log of HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide</inline> as it was put before the Senate committee. The senators on the other side no longer wish the Australian public to reflect on this. As early as five o'clock in the morning, reports were coming in and being recorded in the log that persons were on the side of the boat ready to jump overboard.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7Y6</name.id><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator Crossin</name></talker><para>—Why?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name></talker><para>—Because they did not want the boat turned around.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7Y6</name.id><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name></talker><para>—It was their business to jump—`They can jump overboard,' says the honourable senator. It does not matter that the sailors have got to rescue them and save their lives. That does not matter at all. At 5.08 the boat people were telling others to jump overboard. This went on for some time, and an action was taken to disable the vessel. At 5.50 the report came in from the sailors who were in the boat that they believed the last person overboard was a child. That was recorded in the log. It went on. At 5.57 the log recorded: `Appear to be preparing to throw small child overboard.' This is not invented by the government; this is in the logbook of HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide</inline>. Threats were recorded at 6.08 that, if the people in the boat were not given the answer that they would go to Australia, they would jump out of the boat in five minutes. At 6.26 the log recorded: `Threatening to throw women and children overboard first.' At 7.29 the log recorded: `Started demolishing the SIEV'—the boat. And so I could go on, right up to the events of the following day when, as we now know with the wisdom of hindsight, individuals were again in the water and had to be rescued.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Out of these events the report came through Defence officials to the government—not in dispute—that the children had been thrown overboard. It was right at the end of the campaign, predictably through the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>, that suggestions were made that, despite all these threats and the evidence of a child being held overboard, maybe the children were not dropped into the water. What was the Prime Minister's response to this? He required that the video be examined—the video that could have cleared it up one way or another. When it did not assist the Prime Minister, what did he do? He said, `Make it public,' just as he did last week when he got those two statements from the military officials Powell and Noonan. They did not help the Prime Minister, but he said immediately: `Make it public. I've got nothing to hide.' </para><para>It is true that Mr Scrafton seems to have a different recollection of two phone calls. He claims that there were three phone calls, so there are even differences in that regard—a different recollection to that of the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister's staff and the others who were with the Prime Minister. That is not in dispute. There are differences of recollection. The matter could be left there because all of it is on the public record. But the Labor Party are not prepared to leave it there, because they reckon they can use it in this campaign as well. I do not mind their using it in this campaign; what I mind is their abusing the processes of the Senate to use it in this campaign—to set up a Senate committee at public expense after the election has been called, with the sole purpose of putting on the table evidence controlled by the Labor Party, only the evidence the Labor Party and the Independents want which they believe will give them a political advantage in this campaign. It is that abuse which is such a disgrace. All Australians should understand that it is an abuse.</para><para>It is no attempt to, as Senator Faulkner said in his speech today, get at the truth. The Labor Party are not interested in the truth in this matter. There has never been an attempt to get at the truth. If they had wanted Mr Scrafton to give evidence they could have subpoenaed him at the last hearing, but they decided not to do so because they suspected his evidence might not be of help. Now that they believe his evidence will be useful they will set up a new inquiry after the election has been called, suck in the Democrats and the Greens, put his evidence on the table and say, `Here, this helps our gutter campaign against the Prime Minister.'</para><para>I urge the Senate, before it is too late, not to create this precedent today—not to abuse the Senate and its institutional structure in this way. The Labor Party should go out and do its worst during this campaign. It has already signalled that it wants a personalised, dirty campaign—that it does not want a campaign on the issues. It should go out and do its worst, because the people of Australia do not want to hear that. But to abuse the Senate in this way is not something that it should do, even for short-term political gain. On that basis, I urge honourable senators to throw this motion out before it is too late.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>26677</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—That was an extraordinary performance by Senator Hill.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name></talker><para>—You're one to talk!

Minister Hill has made an extraordinary tangential and farcical argument that this is some abuse of the Senate. Let us put a few simple facts on the table. First, this extra information which has come out has only come out since the Senate last sat. This is the very first opportunity that the Senate has had to act on this matter. Secondly, it is a fact that the Senate and the House of Representatives could have quite legally and appropriately sat this week with the election day that the Prime Minister has chosen.

That is a key choice for them on election day.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is true that the Prime Minister chose that the House of Representatives not come back, even though quite clearly it could have sat all through this week, according to the Constitution and the law, and he could still have had the election on the day that he liked—but he chose to avoid the scrutiny. As he himself said, the government does not control the Senate—no party controls the Senate. For all Minister Hill's talk about this being a stacked committee and a Labor dominated committee, it is not, and his own words during his speech demonstrated that, because he said, `If this motion is passed, it will be passed by the Labor Party with the support of Independent groupings.' The Democrats are an independent grouping: I cannot speak for any other people on the crossbench, but I can certainly speak for the Democrats and the record shows we are an independent grouping. So there is no Labor dominated committee and the Democrats' record shows that we act independently on matters like this. Everybody knows the Democrats' view on refugee policy, but this is not about refugee policy; this is about honesty and trust.</para><para>The Prime Minister himself said, `This election is about trust.' How can it then be `inappropriate or irrelevant'—to use his words—to investigate and to provide the opportunity for more information to go on the public record as to what was said on the very eve of the last election about a major issue that affected the campaign and whether or not there was deliberate dishonesty? Surely, if the election is about trust, as the Prime Minister says, the public need to get as much information as they can to know if they can trust the Prime Minister. When he tells them something in his National Press Club address—as I am sure he will have in the last week of the election campaign—and asserts as strongly as possible that such and such is true, this time will people ask, `Can we trust him?' They should be able to make that judgment on as much evidence as possible. Frankly, this is not about the Senate committee reporting back the views of the members of the committee in any report or anything else. That is not what matters. What matters is that the public have as much information as possible for them to determine their views about an election that the Prime Minister himself has said is about trust.  </para><para>To demonstrate this—and I remind the Senate of an example not just to do with the original Select Committee for an inquiry into a Certain Maritime Incident, colloquially known as the `children overboard' inquiry, although it actually looked at a much wider range of things—as the main non-major party—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>008W7</name.id><name role="metadata">Brandis, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator Brandis</name></talker><para>—According to popular culture, you emerged as the hero of it, Senator Bartlett.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name></talker><para>—I could not comment on that, but I am sure Senator Brandis is far more in tune with popular culture. The fact is that as the main independent voice on that committee—Senator Murphy was also a member of the committee and I hope he would not mind my saying that I was more heavily involved than he was—there were some extra comments of mine separate from the Labor members' comments in the report. I would also remind the Senate of the very contentious Senate inquiry that was set up into the so-called cash for visas issue. It was actually called the Select Committee on Ministerial Discretion in Migration Matters—another committee with a colloquial title, this one being `cash for visas'. I think it is fair to say that nobody in this chamber has been more critical than I have been of the former Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Mr Ruddock, about immigration matters, and extremely strong and very damaging allegations were made against Minister Ruddock and a Senate inquiry established, quite appropriately, to examine those allegations and to determine whether there was truth in them. We did everything we could to reveal the truth. There were failings by government and there were criticisms that I made about the government not cooperating as much as they could have, but I said, quite separately and independently of the Labor members, that I did not believe that the minister had been guilty of cash for visas or anything like it and that there was no evidence at all to back that up. I acknowledge that we could not get to some of the evidence that we should have got to, but there was nothing I saw at all that suggested that there was anything like so-called cash for visas. Obviously, given my strong criticism of Minister Ruddock, it would have been politically more wise for me to have come out and slammed him as being corrupt and as having totally abused the system in that way—I think it has been abused in plenty of other ways, as I have made clear—but I did not do that because I did not believe the evidence backed that up.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Democrats are able to be independent. We have shown that on plenty of issues in this chamber and we have shown that on very contentious, very politicised issues that have been sent to Senate committees, even those about this sort of area. So it is not true to say it is a stacked committee and it is not true to say that it is Labor controlled—and certainly I will approach it from an independent perspective. As I have said, my view is that the main task of it will be to just get out into the public arena further information that was not able to be got out before and to have those pieces of information tested, including of course by government members, and questioned. If some of the government people in the background are quite happy to smear Mr Scrafton or say that it does not prove anything, here is a chance for them to test it face to face in public by asking the questions that should be asked—we can all ask those questions—rather than just have the farce of Mr Howard asking for some questions to be asked in private of Major General Powell and then his releasing some transcripts. Let us have it out in the public arena where we on all sides can ask the questions and the person can expand his evidence in the public arena under the protection of parliamentary privilege.  </para><para>I am sure he did not really believe what he was saying, but despite all Senator Hill's farcical suggestions that this is an abuse of the Senate this is actually core business of the Senate. That is why I believe it is an important matter. It is not something such as was done by Senator Hill when he was in opposition where we would have the committee holding hearings and meetings all over the place during the campaign. I expect it to be a single hearing—probably a long hearing but a single day's hearing—and unless very significant information comes out that demands instant follow-up I suspect, without pre-empting the hearing completely, that that would do it. I cannot completely pre-empt it, of course, but that is certainly the way I am leaning at the moment.</para><para>It will provide an opportunity for everybody. If Senator Brandis is chosen to be on the committee again—and I think it is beneficial to have people on this committee who were part of the original one—he can continue to build on his reputation as the great defender of Mr Howard and his integrity. Other Liberal members of the committee can do the same. They can test the evidence. We will see who is put forward as chair, but while people can make their political points the record speaks for itself. The Democrats will take an independent approach on this. If I end up being selected as the member for that committee, that is certainly what I will do.</para><para>It does need to be mentioned, too, that we should look more widely at what that committee achieved. There was the specific issue about whether or not there was deliberate deceit and how wide that deliberate deceit was during the last election campaign. The committee was able to go only so far. I would point out that, in his letter to the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> when Mr Scrafton produced further material on the public record about what happened according to him, he specifically stated that one of the reasons he did not respond positively to the invitation by the Senate committee to appear was that he was not issued with a subpoena. He was directed by the government or by ministers not to appear, as has happened in the past.</para><para>It is quite understandable that staff or other public servants in that position feel that they should not appear, if that is how they are directed, unless there is the extra weight of the subpoena. I acknowledge that puts them in a more difficult position, but if the matter is serious enough, as this was, then I believe that is what should be considered. Mr Reith should have been first in the queue—I do not think there is any doubt about that—but if we were to go further, believing we needed to get further to the truth, then as is clearly on the public record at the time I believed we should have subpoenaed other witnesses and at least tested it that step further to see what happened. But, of course, I was not able to get support when I stepped up to the plate and so that did not happen. I accept the reasons that Senator Faulkner put forward for that—I think they were genuine—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>008W7</name.id><name role="metadata">Brandis, Sen George</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>EP5</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name></talker><para>—I think it is worth noting Mr Scrafton's comment in that letter for future reference when these sorts of questions arise again.

That is very unlikely to happen. I cannot foresee the circumstances at the moment where that would be likely to happen prior to the election. One can never be categorical about these things, but again that is where I see things. </para></talk.start></continue><para>We are not talking about dragging people before the committee against their will in an election campaign.

It is all right; it does not matter. The cost of having a single hearing is extremely small, and to try to grasp at the public expense straw shows how desperate Minister Hill was to try to find a reason about this. Finally, on a slightly broader scope, as I said at the start, the original certain maritime incident inquiry was about a lot more than just the `children overboard' incident. A lot of the other material that got into the public arena has been incredibly useful in enabling a more informed debate about the reality of the refugee policy in a whole range of areas. There are of course still unfinished areas, unfinished business and unanswered questions.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I would like to note, with pleasure, that in a number of newspapers as well as on the Channel 9 <inline font-style="italic">Sunday </inline>program we actually heard from the refugees themselves—the people who were accused, repeatedly, of throwing their children overboard and deliberately putting their children at risk of drowning as a form of blackmail. These are the people in relation to whom it was directly said by Mr Howard, Minister Downer and, I think, Minister Ruddock: `We don't want people like that in this country. We don't want them here. We won't let them here.' Of course, many of them are now here, so that bit was not true either.</para><para>But the simple fact is that we have never heard from those people themselves. We have never had an apology for the false accusation. When Mr Howard was asked, `Do you owe the people on that boat an apology for saying they threw their kids overboard?' he said, `No, I'm not apologising for having stated things that I believed to be true.' I think that when you do say something that people take offence to, even if you believed it to be true at the time and you find out that you are wrong, most people do apologise. Certainly when you are the leader of a nation who has defamed a whole group of people and you are found out you are wrong, sure you might say, `I'm only saying what someone else told me,' but you still apologise—you apologise when you cause offence, even if you think there is some substance behind your comment a lot of the time.</para><para>The facts are that there has never been an apology to these people and they have never had the opportunity to have a say themselves. We did examine the prospect of enabling them to give evidence before the Senate committee inquiry. At that time, of course, they were all locked up on Manus Island outside the jurisdiction of the Australian parliament—another very clever move by Mr Howard to avoid scrutiny and prevent people from accessing justice. They were unable to appear at that time, and the committee decided that it was not really workable to try to get evidence from people in a detention centre in Papua New Guinea. The fact now is that many of them are in Australia, despite what government ministers said at the time, and it is good to see them finally getting a voice. But that is all they are getting. There has been no acknowledgment one way or the other about the veracity of what has been said, but we are at least hearing from them and acknowledging them as human beings and as the people who have been defamed in this. </para><para>I note that the Democrats were the first to question the veracity of the `children overboard' claim. Our former leader, and my predecessor, Senator Stott Despoja immediately publicly questioned what the evidence was. It was unfortunate—and, frankly, hard to comprehend—that, although many people in Defence recognised within two days that things were not as had been said, somehow that did not get through. There are plenty of things to learn from that, in a whole range of ways.</para><para>Now there is more information that could be put in the public arena. There would be benefits in doing so, and establishing this committee would be an effective way of doing so. It is obviously a contentious and politicised issue, but the record shows, certainly from the Democrats' perspective, that we are able to approach it as independently as possible. My main goal in supporting this motion, and in being part of the committee if it ends up happening, is simply to allow the information to get on the record, to hear from Mr Scrafton and perhaps one or two other people and to provide the opportunity to test some of their views, ask questions and explore those matters. Then that would be on the record for the public, the voters, to be more informed on polling day when they make their choices of who should be Prime Minister—a question of trust—and who should be in the Senate for the times, which inevitably arise whoever they pick as Prime Minister, when they find out that they cannot be trusted.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>26682</page.no><name role="metadata">Brandis, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator BRANDIS</name><name.id>008W7</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The question raised by Senator Faulkner's notice of motion, circulated earlier today, for the proposed new `children overboard' committee is a factual question. It amounts to this: whether or not Mr Scrafton did or did not say certain things to the Prime Minister on 7 November 2001. I will come back to the issue of the reliability of Mr Scrafton's different accounts of that conversation in a moment.</para></talk.start><para>I want to begin by making the point that inquiries into questions of disputed fact are inquiries which parliamentary committees are peculiarly ill suited to make. They are inquiries that courts are very well suited to make because courts approach questions of disputed past facts with objectivity, are governed by rules of evidence, and the participants in the process have no agenda other than to put alternative versions of the facts before the court. But in Senate committees—and we saw this classically in the `children overboard' committee which, like the new foreshadowed `children overboard 2' committee, was primarily concerned with questions of disputed past facts—there cannot be an objective, neutral, careful, analytical inquiry. For a start, every one of the inquirers, the senators, has by definition a political agenda. </para><para>There is no point in being pious or oh so pure about this: every senator by definition is a politician and has a political approach to the factual inquiry, which is not governed by rules of evidence which subject the process of inquiry to any kind of rationality. Senators from all points of view—government senators are guilty of this as are opposition senators—use the opportunity to make political points. There are some kinds of Senate committee processes, particularly about matters of policy, where that is perfectly appropriate, but the process is badly suited to eliciting factual truth. If there is one thing I believe in more than anything else, it is that facts are not ideological. There are not Labor Party facts or Liberal Party facts or Australian Democrat facts; there are just facts. Either an event happened or it did not. You cannot have a political construct on whether or not that fact happened. As a very distinguished barrister who was once a mentor of mine used to say, facts are stubborn and impressive.</para><para>The process of a Senate committee to try to elicit evidence of whether or not a fact existed, or whether or not words were exchanged during a conversation, is not something that the political process—that dialectical process of clashing political values—is suited to discover at all. As a result you get the bizarre view that the findings of a Senate committee into questions of disputed fact are somehow the result of some forensic process. They are anything but that. That is why we on the government benches do not support Senator Faulkner's motion—from my point of view, not because it is an abuse of Senate process but because it entirely lacks utility. How is the Australian public going to be any the wiser about what Mr Scrafton may or may not have said to the Prime Minister in the course of a conversation three years ago when Senator Faulkner says one thing and other senators say other things—particularly in the course of an election campaign where the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats have made this the very issue on which they want to campaign? How is that, in heaven's name, going to be a process which will elicit objective truth? Of course it will not.</para><para>If you had any doubt about that, you only had to listen to Senator Faulkner's speech to the chamber in moving his motion. Senator Faulkner announced in moving his motion that the Prime Minister had misled the Australian people about what Mr Scrafton said to him. That is what he said. We heard him in this chamber an hour ago in the course of moving a motion to set up a Senate inquiry, of which he will be a key principal, to decide whether or not the Prime Minister misled the Australian people about what Mr Scrafton said to him in the course of the conversation three years ago. So in moving for the committee to be established he has already announced his conclusions. In the very speech in which he advocated why there should be a committee, he demonstrated by announcing his own conclusion why no such committee can have any worthwhile value other than being a forum for political point scoring. That is why government senators think that this is not a worthwhile exercise, in particular in the course of an election campaign.</para><para>In the course of the debate assertions have been made about the Prime Minister's motives. So the second point that I want to make is this: there have now been three occasions by which the Prime Minister's motives in this can be tested. The first occasion happened a long time ago. It happened three days before the 2001 election, on 7 November 2001, during the celebrated telephone conversation with Mr Scrafton. Although there is now an area of disagreement between the Prime Minister and Mr Scrafton as to what Mr Scrafton told him, there is one thing both the Prime Minister and Mr Scrafton agree Mr Scrafton did tell him. Mr Scrafton said to him words to the effect: `Well, Prime Minister, as requested I have reviewed this video, the video of the so-called `children overboard' incident. It does not support the government's case; it is inconclusive.' That word `inconclusive' is the word used by both Mr Scrafton and the Prime Minister in their recollections of what Scrafton said to the Prime Minister. </para><para>So what did the Prime Minister do? He immediately said, `We had better release it,' and he did. So when told that this one contemporaneous document, the famous grainy video, did not support the position the Prime Minister had put out there in the public arena—a video which had become the most important piece of evidence about the controversy—with an election three days later, the Prime Minister said, `Although this does not support my position—if anything, it weakens my position—we will get it out there,' and he did. How is that conduct contrived to mislead people?</para><para>Then last week, within a fortnight of Mr Scrafton publishing a new version of his conversation with the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister caused statements to be taken from Major General Powell and Commander Noonan. Those were the two gentlemen who conducted the military inquiry. After the 2001 election there were two internal inquiries. There was the Bryant inquiry, which the Prime Minister himself had instructed to be convened to find out what happened, and the Powell inquiry, which was the internal military inquiry. So after Mr Scrafton changed his position and announced in his letter to the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper on 16 August a revised version of events, the Prime Minister caused Major General Powell and Commander Noonan to be interviewed. Do you know what they said? It was a point that much was made of by Senator Faulkner. They said, `When we spoke to Mr Scrafton in November 2001 what he said to us then was what he is now saying in his letter on 16 August 2004.' In other words, again, evidence against the Prime Minister's version of events. What did the Prime Minister do? He said, `We had better release it.' So he released statements from Major General Powell and Commander Noonan. I pause to say that what Mr Scrafton told Powell and Noonan was quite different from what he told Jennifer Bryant, who ran the internal Public Service inquiry, but that is another matter. The fact is that that piece of evidence, contrary to the Prime Minister's interests, again in the shadow of an election being called, was received by the Prime Minister—it did not help his case; in fact it hurts his case—and what did he do? He said, `We had better release it,' and he did. How is that behaviour designed to mislead people? </para><para>Thirdly, after the Prime Minister decided to call an election on 9 October and he visited the Governor-General yesterday and advised him to prorogue parliament and dissolve the House of Representatives, he made a decision to allow the Senate to continue to sit for today and tomorrow. As you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, I am always lost in admiration for Senator Faulkner's thespian skills. But for Senator Faulkner to maintain with a straight face the view that somehow the Prime Minister forgot to prorogue the Senate, forgot that maybe the Senate might be seized of the `Scrafton affair', as it is now being called, forgot that if the Senate was not prorogued before Tuesday afternoon the Senate might set up another `children overboard' committee, I think is an Academy Award winning performance by Senator Faulkner and one of the finest examples of sangfroid I have ever seen in this chamber. </para><para>Of course the Prime Minister knew that if the Senate sat today this would be the first order of business. Every political observer in Australia and every newspaper columnist knew that. So the Prime Minister—creating, I think, an historical precedent—having dissolved the House of Representatives and having made a decision to prorogue the parliament, deliberately delayed the prorogation of the parliament until 4.59 tomorrow afternoon specifically to enable the Labor Party to move the motion that Senator Faulkner has now moved so that the last thing that could be said against the Prime Minister is that he was trying to sweep it under the carpet, that he was trying to cover it up.  </para><para>So there we are: against all of these fast and loose allegations that the Prime Minister is involved in an act of deception, every time a piece of evidence surfaces that is contrary to the view the Prime Minister has consistently maintained throughout, the Prime Minister publishes it and he invites his political opponents, in the shadow of an election, to set up this inquiry rather than, as would be the ordinary course of events, proroguing the parliament at the time of the dissolution of the House of Representatives—that is, yesterday. So the bona fides of the Prime Minister, his respect for process and the pains to which he has gone to ensure that it cannot be rationally or honestly maintained by any fair-minded person that there is a cover-up here, cannot be questioned or brought into doubt.</para><para>I said before that Senate committees, whatever they might be good at, are very bad fact-finding tribunals for all the reasons I recited. Nowhere can that be better seen than in the report of the first `children overboard' inquiry, which was not a respectable document. The myths by an obsessed media and political insiders on the left wing of Australian politics have, in a bizarre way, raised this document to some almost sacerdotal significance. It is nothing of the sort. You only have to look at the findings at variance with the evidence to realise that that is so. In the last couple of hours as I have been preparing for this debate I have gone at random through the first few pages of the majority's report of the first `children overboard' inquiry—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>EP5</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator Ferguson</name></talker><para>—So have I.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>008W7</name.id><name role="metadata">Brandis, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator BRANDIS</name></talker><para>—Senator Ferguson who will follow me in this debate has done the same exercise—to pluck out what are represented as findings of fact which are at variance with the evidence. Mr Acting Deputy President, it is hard work. There were 2,181 pages of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> transcript of this inquiry. There was a bundle of tabled documents almost three-foot high. Do you think that those who signed off on this document had actually carefully scrutinised, analysed and subjected that evidence to a forensic analysis? Of course they had not. Do you think the journalists, who accepted uncritically what they said, did the same thing? Of course they did not. What has been done has been to uncritically accept, as if it were holy writ, political rhetoric which dances around on the basis of a volume of evidence, unanalysed and unscrutinised, which does not actually support the so-called findings of fact. Let me just give you a few examples.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There is a finding of fact that on or about 17 October 2001 Admiral Barrie informed Minister Reith that there were serious doubts about the veracity of the report that children had been thrown overboard from SIEV4. That is what the finding of fact is. But do you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, what that finding of fact omits to say? You do not even see a mention of it until you get to the government senators' report. It omits to say that Admiral Barrie qualified that evidence by saying that, on being pressed by Mr Reith, he nevertheless adhered to the original report. So what is described as a finding of fact that Admiral Barrie told Mr Reith that, obscures the real evidentiary truth that on that date, 17 October 2001, Admiral Barrie affirmed to Mr Reith his advice that the original advice which emanated from the bridge of the <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide</inline> from Commander Norman Banks ought to be adhered to. You do not see a word of that in the majority's report because it did not fit in with their political objectives. </para><para>Then we see as a finding of fact that on 7 November 2001 the then acting Chief of the Defence Force, Air Marshal Angus Houston, informed Minister Reith that children had not been thrown overboard from SIEV4. That is represented as a finding of fact. Again it is untrue, because, if you look at the evidence, what Air Marshal Houston told the committee was that there was a belief in Defence that the original report was wrong, but he also told Mr Reith that he, Air Marshal Houston, had no personal knowledge of or involvement in these events whatsoever, that he was conveying to Minister Reith second-hand, hearsay, what some in Defence were saying and that he was not in a position to countermand Admiral Barrie's original advice, which he had affirmed to Mr Reith on 17 October. So what is represented as a finding of fact, if you look at the evidence which underlies it, is in fact directly at variance with the substance of what the witness said. Then we have this rather preposterous claim:</para><quote><para>The committee finds—</para></quote><para>dwell on that word `finds', implying as it does the product of some careful analytical forensic scrutiny of the evidence—</para><motion><para>that Mr Reith deceived the Australian people during the 2001 Federal Election campaign concerning the state of the evidence for the claim that children had been thrown overboard from SIEV 4.</para></motion><para>That so-called finding notwithstanding that, at every point in time up to and including the date of the election on 10 November 2001, the man upon whom Mr Reith had a statutory obligation, under the Defence Act, to rely on as his ultimate source of advice on operational matters—the Chief of the Defence Force, Admiral Barrie—continued to say to Minister Reith that the original report that children had been thrown overboard should be adhered to; that although there were doubts, those doubts were not of sufficient weight to cause him to abate from his original report. So that finding against Mr Reith was made in the face of that evidence unmentioned by the majority and of course, allow me to say, in the absence of the committee having heard directly from Mr Reith because the Labor senators refused to subpoena him.</para><para>So there is truth and there is spin. There is reality and there is rhetoric. There is political propaganda and there is empirical fact. The first `children overboard' inquiry was an example of spin, rhetoric and propaganda, and we fear the second `children overboard' inquiry will be nothing but more of the same.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>26686</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak in support of the motion as amended by Senator Faulkner.

As I think Senator Bartlett said a moment ago, his argument about funding started to put his case at a ludicrous level.

Why is it that now—after they reported in detail their comprehensive version of what came before the Senate select committee—coalition senators are saying, `You can't send it to a Senate select committee because that would be a witch-hunt'? </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>EP5</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator Ferguson</name></talker><para>—Hang on, this is Senator Harradine's amendment, not ours.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>GB6</name.id><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name></talker><para>—Yes, and I will get to that point, Senator Ferguson. There is nothing at all in the government senators' report that describes this first inquiry as having been conducted like a witch-hunt. Senators from the coalition cannot complain that they did not have adequate time to question witnesses. They cannot complain that we did not hear from the witnesses that they wanted to hear from. In fact, as I recall, Senator Brandis got extensive credit for being able to extend the terms of reference of this inquiry so that we could deal with `certain maritime incidents' rather than the single `children overboard' case—and indeed we did. I assure Senator Harradine that the concerns being raised now in some of the contributions by coalition senators—and certainly by Senator Hill—about the process, or the manner in which this inquiry was conducted, were not reflected in the government senators' report.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Looking at what process is being envisaged here, the terms of reference Senator Faulkner put forward are quite clear, precise and narrow. They focus on:</para><quote><para>Matters arising from the public statements made by former ministerial staffer, Mr Mike Scrafton ...</para></quote><para>`Why?' might you ask. It is fortunate that in my individual comments in this report of the inquiry into a certain maritime incident I set out precisely why it is relevant that we look at these issues. Senator Ferguson at the time, if I recall correctly, interjected, `Why are you putting down your own report? Why are you making additional comments?' This is why: that was my opportunity at the time to highlight what I thought remained the significant issues. On page 469 of the report, in the fourth paragraph, after my introductory remarks, I say:</para><quote><para>What is ... significant is that many trails lead directly to the Prime Minister's Department, his Office and to the Prime Minister himself. Whilst it has not been claimed, nor proven, that the Prime Minister knew the truth and lied, many reports question his claims that “I never received any written contradiction of that (children thrown overboard), nor did I receive any verbal contradiction of that” and, regarding his office, “No”.</para></quote><para>This is the significant issue that this new material from Mr Scrafton highlights. It highlights quite clearly that there is alternative material in relation to what the Prime Minister was actually told. It is a duty for the Senate to look at the details of those claims, to assess the merit of those claims. It is unfortunate that those claims were not available at the time of the original inquiry, but they are now.</para><para>Before I move on to some of the detail of that, there is one other aspect of Senator Hill's evidence that I think I need to touch upon. Nobody questions, Senator Hill, that there was an erroneous report from the <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide</inline>. Nobody questions that. For you to hark back to that as being the critical issue here is just a joke. Everyone today knows that the critical issue is that after an erroneous report no correction was made—no correction was made at all.</para><para>Moving on to today's circumstances, when Senator Hill was making his contribution I interjected, `Why are we here?' The Prime Minister says that we are here to have that scrutiny that Labor has been talking about—but only a little bit of scrutiny. The Senate cannot, if you listen to coalition senators, have the audacity to establish an inquiry—a pretty standard routine—to look at the detail of these allegations. `That would be outrageous,' they say. The arrogance of that position is outstanding. The Prime Minister has set up this circumstance so that the Senate can sit and address this new material which is quite critical to the issue on which he has claimed this election will be conducted: trust. He said, after this material which fundamentally questions his integrity came out, that trust is the critical issue. Now coalition senators claim that we should only have a little bit of scrutiny. They say, `We don't want a detailed inquiry.' That circumstance is ludicrous. </para><para>This brings me to Senator Harradine's point about having a legislation committee inquiry. I think we all know that, were this reference to go to a legislation committee, no genuine inquiry would occur. I think that there is little doubt of that. I want to remind Senator Harradine of some of the contortions that this government has had to conduct in the past to deal with these critical issues. Senator Ferguson is here at the moment, so I will use a case in point which involves him. Senator Ferguson was conveniently swapped as the chair of an inquiry. The Democrats indicated that they had no confidence in Senator Tierney chairing the inquiry, and so in desperation the government swapped its chairs so that they could satisfy those concerns.</para><para>I do not intend to reflect poorly on Senator Sandy Macdonald, who is the chair of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee; let me put that clearly on the record. I have no basis to reflect poorly on his conduct as the chair, but I have been involved in several other incidents where government chairs of committees have conducted themselves in very poor fashion. In this case, if you look at what else has occurred around this incident and the certain maritime incident, I would not want to put Senator Macdonald under that type of pressure. Let me go back to what that pressure involves. The pressure involves a man, Mr Scrafton, who was directed by cabinet not to appear before our inquiry. Our committee made several attempts to get Mr Scrafton to appear. In the first instance the Minister for Defence argued in a letter that he sent to the committee:</para><quote><para>Your committee is fully aware of the government's position that the longstanding convention that public servants employed under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act not be called to appear before such committees be upheld.</para></quote><para>Senator Hill was reinforcing that point time and time again. But, in relation to Mr Scrafton, we also came across evidence that, after he had moved on from working for Minister Reith and was back within the Department of Defence, he was still in conversations conducting business in relation to this incident. The committee again said that, in relation to Mr Scrafton's conversations with Brigadier Silverstone, they would now like to talk to Mr Scrafton.</para><para>The response we got from Senator Hill's office to that request was outstanding. We got a response back, `per' Matt Brown in his office—not even signed by the minister—suggesting that Matt Brown had conducted his own investigation and Mr Scrafton had nothing to offer our committee. The sheer arrogance of a staffer in a minister's office suggesting back to the Senate committee that `we have conducted our own internal investigation: this witness that you are requesting has nothing to offer you; we have spoken to him about it and he has got nothing to offer you'! That is the sort of thing you would get from a government legislation committee. More of the same that applied to Mr Scrafton is exactly what would occur in this case. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>EP5</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator Ferguson</name></talker><para>—You're slurring the committee.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>GB6</name.id><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name></talker><para>—No, I am suggesting that the pattern of behaviour that has been conducted by Minister Hill, by the Prime Minister and by cabinet in relation to what Mr Scrafton is able now to refer to is the problem at point.

I have seen several very selective references to that to try and support the government's claim that it is inconsistent with the other material that the Prime Minister has now been forced to release. Let us go back and look at it. In relation to his statement that was included in the attachments to the Bryant report, Mr Scrafton made the situation very clear at the outset. I quote from Ms Bryant's description of her discussion with him:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>Mr Scrafton stated that he had been involved in or aware of a number of discussions between Mr Reith's office and the Prime Minister's Office and the Prime Minister, which he could not discuss.</para></quote><para>He said at the outset that there were some conversations he simply could not discuss. Going further into it, though—and this is the section that Senator Mason quoted out of context after question time today, the report says:</para><quote><para>Mr Scrafton stated that he continued to be marginally involved in events around the incident until the week before the election and never had a sense that the original advice was not correct.</para></quote><para>What Senator Mason did not do was explain that the context in which Mr Scrafton was indicating that he never had a sense that the original advice was not correct was in relation to his position up until that last week. That is made very clear on the next page, where Mr Scrafton is described as indicating:</para><quote><para>He had never been formally advised that it was not true. However, he noted that he obviously spent time talking to people from the department and got the feeling that the claims may not have been correct.</para></quote><para>It was exactly those issues that he now claims he made clear to the Prime Minister during those telephone conversations.</para><para>As this matter progresses, what I look forward to seeing is some of the evidence that the Prime Minister has not come forward with. Senator Brandis used an interesting argument earlier when he said that, because the Prime Minister releases some things, he must be bona fide. My concern is what he does not release—what he withholds. That is the issue. Just because he puts forward some things which might be seen to be partially damaging to his case does not mean we have the full facts. And in relation to having the full facts, I am reminded of a press statement that I read recently in relation to Mr Scrafton's evidence where the Prime Minister was asked whether he would now make available the telephone records. Let us see exactly how many telephone conversations occurred. Mr Scrafton says three; the Prime Minister says two; the statements from the Prime Minister's staff say different things. But the core issue in my mind is this: how many conversations about the video can you actually have? If Mr Scrafton's evidence is accurate, he spoke to the Prime Minister, as I recall, after he had viewed the video. Why is there reason for two or three conversations for him to indicate what he claims or what the Prime Minister claims is all that was transferred? </para><para>In terms of understanding what happens in telephone conversations, Mr Scrafton's description is far more credible. Why would the Prime Minister ring back two or three times to ask, `Are you still sure now that it was inconclusive?' Why would he do that? There is just no sense to the way the Prime Minister describes it. If the Prime Minister brought forward the telephone records so that we could see clearly how many phone conversations occurred then we might be able to get some more clarity on this point. It is not as if we are asking for material that has not been before the CMI inquiry. The CMI inquiry was able to access telephone logs, email logs, ship logs and all sorts of details in an attempt to get to the facts. That is where I disagree with Senator Brandis that Senate committees are no good at getting to the facts of the matter. Senator Brandis may not like the conclusions that some people reach but there have been many occasions when I would dispute his ability to get to the objective facts—let alone his manner of dealing with witnesses. The only formal complaint about the process and conduct of the CMI inquiry that I can recall was from Vice-Admiral Sir Richard Peek, who took exception to Senator Brandis's manner of dealing with witnesses—as did, informally, several Defence officers.</para><para>In terms of actually getting to the facts, the report of Senator Brandis, Senator Ferguson and Senator Mason raises several questions. But we need to go back to the fundamental point. Since the CMI inquiry was closed there has been further evidence. The Senate is now sitting and able to determine how we should deal with that material. We are able to determine that we take a closer look at it. It might not be convenient for the Prime Minister that we do so, but he does not control this chamber. He may not have had the forethought to see that we might go down this path but that is essentially his problem. He can conduct as many internal investigations as he likes but the issues of trust, credibility and integrity will never be met until we can have an open and transparent process. Complaints of process were not raised in relation to the Senate select committee inquiry in the first instance and there is no reason that the same process, maybe on a smaller scale, should not occur on this occasion. A legislation committee simply will not be able to get to the truth. I encourage Senator Harradine to listen to the nature of the debate here today to understand why that would be the case. Senator Hill in his contribution talked about witch-hunts, costs and such. If you listened to Senator Hill you would think that he is a likely adherent of the view of Admiral Barrie and Mr Max Moore-Wilton that children may well have been thrown overboard.</para><para>In relation to SIEV4 it became very clear early on that the incident described by the Prime Minister and by the minister for immigration had not occurred. But that was never corrected. That is the issue of trust. When Senator Hill and the Prime Minister say, `Oh, everyone out there is just bored with this; it does not really relate to the contemporary issues and the election before us,' I encourage people to think about the sheer arrogance of that statement—`We will let the Senate sit for two days, we will let them rabbit on about it for a couple of days, but Australians out there do not really care. They are bored with all of this.' I do not think Australians are bored with all of this. I think they do see broader issues of trust and integrity here, and it is finally cutting through. </para><para>Senator Bartlett referred to the weekend reports coming from those people who, despite the Prime Minister's assertions at the last election, have made it to our soil. The most heartening thing about those people is that they say, `We love Australians; they are generous people; they are open.' It is important for everyday issues that we deal with this issue of integrity. It is important because the public cannot have confidence in the core or non-core promises of this government—or indeed, as shown by several leaked documents over the last weeks, that what they say is what they will do. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>26691</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator FERGUSON</name><name.id>EP5</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—What a farce we are seeing here today—an absolute farce. We have seen Senator Collins clutching at straws over an issue that was raised some three years ago when, as my colleague Senator Brandis so ably said only a few minutes ago, findings of fact by the Labor Party are in fact arguable cases which we on this side of the chamber did not agree with in the committee inquiry and are unlikely to ever agree with in the future. I say that it is a farce because we came in here today to see Senator Faulkner attempt in this motion to reconstitute the certain maritime incident inquiry. What is the proposition we have before us? I listened very carefully to Senator Bartlett's contribution, as he claims to be the independent member of this committee. I am not quite sure how the Leader of the Australian Democrats can describe himself as independent. He said, `We ought to be having this. We will probably only have a single day's hearing.' What have we seen Senator Faulkner do today? It is now 30 August, if I remember rightly. We are going to have an election on 9 October. We are going to have one day's public hearing and Senator Faulkner proposes that we have a reporting date of 24 November. On 30 August we propose a newly constituted committee to look into new issues in this certain maritime incident, we will have one day's public hearing and three months later the committee will report.

As Senator Brandis so eloquently said much earlier, we have already been through the whole process. The Labor Party and the Democrats made their findings without Mr Scrafton. They did not need him there. They called him the missing link. The missing link was not required, because they made their findings without the missing link. They did not care, because this inquiry was set up with a predetermined outcome, which was then put into this voluminous report. We held hearings over some 15 days and then, as Senator Brandis said, we had these findings of fact.</para><para>Senator Faulkner made a comment in his speech. He said that the Prime Minister had questioned Mr Scrafton's integrity. At no stage has the Prime Minister questioned his integrity. The only thing the Prime Minister has questioned is Mr Scrafton's recollection of the conversations that were had prior to the last election against his own recollection. I suppose we will have a one-day show trial and after that conclusions will be drawn.

One of the findings is:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>It is not possible to make a finding on what the Prime Minister or other ministers had communicated to them about this incident due to the limitations placed on this inquiry by the order of the Cabinet for ministerial staff not to give evidence.</para></quote><para>Senator Bartlett gave them the let-out for that. Senator Bartlett said, `I move that we subpoena them.' Government senators said, `We won't stand in your way. If the Labor Party support you, you can subpoena these witnesses and you can get them to give evidence.' But what did Senator Faulkner, Senator Cook and Senator Collins do? They voted against subpoenaing those witnesses because they did not want the facts to be brought forward. Why didn't they subpoena them? They did not subpoena them and they could have subpoenaed anybody they wanted to. They voted against Senator Bartlett's motion. They talk about being unable to get those people to give evidence at the inquiry but it was simply not the fact. They did not go to all of the means available to them to get people there.

There was simply no reason for any member of the government to correct the evidence because any doubts that they may have had were not transmitted to the Prime Minister. At no stage was the evidence conclusive—they were only doubts. Where there was inconclusive evidence, what did the Prime Minister do? The Prime Minister said, `We'll release the video and let the population—the voters—see for themselves what I have seen or what Mr Scrafton has seen. Let them see it for themselves and they can make their own judgment.'</para><para>The people of Australia did make that judgment. They made that judgment having seen the video and they re-elected the Howard government with an increased majority. So today, for purely political purposes, on the eve of an election—after the election has been called—we are sitting in this chamber reconstituting a committee which has already made findings which are highly critical of the government. Now the Labor Party want to have another inquiry. I wonder which facts will change in their report—all the so-called facts that they had already made a finding on—if they have another inquiry with Mr Scrafton, the so-called missing link, there.</para><para>They disregarded any evidence that might have been given by the so-called missing link when they wrote this report because they made their minds up at that time regardless of what evidence was before them.

He especially made the point, and I agree with him, that it is not appropriate to compel MOPS Act staffers to come during an election campaign. They have other duties. Think of the potential misuse that that could be put to in other circumstances! That cannot be contemplated.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I only want to address a few issues in reply. Firstly, whilst I have a high admiration for Senator Brandis's legal skills, I do not think he has understood the proroguing of parliament argument very well. I do not think he believes it but he seems to imply that the House of Representatives is prorogued and the Senate is not. Neither is prorogued. Parliament is not yet prorogued. The reason this chamber is sitting and the other chamber is not relies on different standing orders. There is a power within the Speaker's office that has allowed the cancellation of the House of Representatives sitting today, and that is what has happened. Speaker Neil Andrew cancelled the sitting of his own volition or maybe on advice from the Prime Minister—it is irrelevant. No such power exists within the Senate President's office; hence, we have to sit. I believe what happened yesterday—and there has been no clarification of this by Senator Hill—was that it was simply assumed that the Senate President had that power, that you could prorogue parliament on Tuesday but that neither house would sit. The argument that developed afterwards, that the Prime Minister has been generous in allowing the Senate to determine these matters, is absolute nonsense. We know that PM&amp;C gave advice to the government that under standing order 55 an absolute majority of senators represented by their leaders could cancel a sitting of the Senate. That happens to be wrong advice. I can understand why the advice was given, but I have read standing order 55 and I do not believe that advice is right. But I can understand why someone may have interpreted it in that particular way.</para><para>In essence, parliament is not prorogued. The Senate is sitting because it had no power to cancel its sittings, at least until after 12.30 today, and the House of Representatives did have that power. It is not the first time that the House of Representatives dominated thinking in executive government has entirely overlooked what could be happening in the Senate. Senator Hill said that he has this advice. I invite him to table his advice that parliament and the Senate did not have to sit—we have not seen it. Before we see it, we cannot evaluate it; we can only assume what is in it. Both Senator Brandis and Senator Hill have said today that it is very bad form to set up a committee after an election has been called. I have some sympathy with that, except we announced—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>008W7</name.id><name role="metadata">Brandis, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator Brandis</name></talker><para>—I didn't say that.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>—Yes, you did. We announced last week that we were going to set up this committee, so I might equally say that it is bad form to call an election when we announced we were going to set up the committee. That is one all—let us forget it. But the fact is that our bone fides were established at least last week. This is not a last-minute gambit, once an election has been called, to set up a committee. We were always going to set up a committee once the Scrafton evidence came out. It came out after the last sitting of the parliament, so there was no prior opportunity. Senator Brandis went on today to say—I am going to shock him; I am going to agree with him—that any Senate report coming down on matters of fact that affect politicians will have some bias and partisanship. Of course they will—it was ever thus—and they have to be discounted because of that. It does not mean you discount the evidence that you receive, but you do not put the conclusions themselves up on pedestals as Holy Writ. I accept that. If you go through the record, Mr Acting Deputy President, you will see that I have put that on the record many times in the past, so I cannot contest that. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Then, of course, we get the attack on the Democrats by Senator Hill about how they are virtually part of the Labor team and that they will not approach this in an independent way. Oh my, oh my! Aren't they forgetful of past favours? They did not bag the Democrats when they were booting the GST through. They did not rubbish the Democrats when they were putting through the `dash for cash' bill that allows—talking about Kremlin show trials—`Kremlin Central' at Robert Menzies House to dictate to state branches of the Liberal Party. They did not complain then. They did not complain when the Democrats conspired with the Liberals to set up a political inquiry into Centenary House. But what have the Democrats done for them recently? Absolutely nothing, apparently. So the Democrats get rubbished in this particular process. Senator Hill made the point—very poorly, I thought—that we did not subpoena Mr Scrafton during the last inquiry, and that point has also been made by Senator Ferguson today. Their argument would be strong if they could point to one case in the past where Labor members have voted to subpoena MOPS staff before committees.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>008W7</name.id><name role="metadata">Brandis, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator Brandis</name></talker><para>—What about Mr Reith?

That is your form. You chased Mr Hawke. You chased Mr Dawkins and others and forced them to come before committees. You got Mr Hawke there and he dazzled everyone, so you thought that maybe it was not such a good idea to bring them before committees anymore. It is not a case of political cowardice or anything else. On a matter of principle we have said that you do not subpoena MOPS staff. Subsequent to that, we have had the finance and public administration committee look at this issue. They came down with some interesting conclusions. To summarise, one was that if the MOPS staffers actually have an executive role to play—not just an advice-giving role but an executive role—in a minister's office then they should lose that protection. The difficulty in the case of Mr Scrafton or anybody else is: can we take that protection away from them retrospectively? We may in future, as a parliament and as a Senate, decide to subpoena MOPS staff, but should we do it in retrospect when they thought they were protected by the norms of this place? That is an interesting question and one that I cannot answer at this stage. But I do not think we failed to subpoena Mr Scrafton in the past because we doubted what evidence we had. We did it on the principle that generally MOPS staffers should not be held accountable in this parliament because they are the personal staff of ministers or members of parliament.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Hill went on to give his defence of the `children overboard' affair, saying it was based on reports. That part is true. The real crime in the `children overboard' affair was the haste for publicity. You only have to follow the sequence of events to see this—when the committee was told, when Mr Ruddock was told and how quickly they rushed this into press without checking any of it. No checking was done. We know that from all the evidence, and I am sure no-one opposite will get up and say that there was. There was no checking done whatsoever. It was a case of getting this out there. There was political gain in this. Of course, once it is out there there is some downside to admitting you are wrong. That is where the real crime was: the lack of intellectual rigour and the lack of ministers and ministers' staff checking the story, getting in contact with the <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide </inline>and making sure it was true. The main priority was to get out there and politicise this issue in an emotive way. We heard statements like: `We don't want these people in our country if they throw their kids overboard.' If they were doing that, neither did I. I did not want them in this country if they were doing that. But talk about demonising a group of people who were not able to defend themselves. It is a national tragedy. </para><para>Senator Hill went on to say that, in some way, we are personalising the campaign against Mr Howard. I do not believe that is true. Mr Howard said yesterday that the key plank in this election campaign will be trust. Obviously that particular statement was poll driven. Therefore the veracity of the Prime Minister's statements becomes very important. Now we have a conflict. We have Mr Scrafton saying that he discussed not only the video but also the photos, the ONA report and the fact that no-one in Defence believed the claims that kids were thrown overboard on 7 November, before the 8 November National Press Club appearance in which the ONA report was used. Some people in this place may say, `Oh, that's all in the past. We shouldn't really worry about it.' But I believe we have a right to know the truth on these particular matters and how truthful the Prime Minister is going to be. It is all very well to get the odd statement from Mr O'Leary, Mr Nutt and Mr Sinodinos, but even those are pretty wishy-washy statements because they were not directly involved in the conversation—nowhere nearly as directly as Major General Powell, the Navy commander, and Ms McKenry, who then worked for Defence PR. They were all told about this conversation. You really have to ask yourself why you would have lied three years ago at that particular stage. So we are not personalising this; we are seeking the truth.</para><para>Of course, Senator Hill then went on to make a fairly outrageous comment. He said that the Prime Minister believed the public had a right to know and that is why he put the video out. Well, good on him. But that sort of generosity did not extend to having Mr Jordana or Mr Hampton appear before the committee. The government could have asked them to appear—we did not have to subpoena them—but, of course, then the real truth may have come out. So it is nothing to do with the public having a right to know. Even when we do get a witness there, like the head of the task force, what do we get? On 57 occasions we got the answer: `I don't remember.' The Anastasia of the Public Service is then promoted to a big department and given a Public Service Medal because she did not remember. Rather gratuitously, Senator Hill says that the Senate could ignore this issue and pass some valuable legislation. This raises two issues. Firstly, why did he try to get the parliamentary sittings cancelled yesterday? Secondly, if we do have important legislation but we happen to put forward one amendment to it then we have nowhere to send it. The House of Representatives has been dissolved and will be prorogued tomorrow. If we do amend any legislation, that is the last we are going to hear of it until it has to be reintroduced and the whole process started again. </para><para>We have heard about the expense of having a Senate inquiry. We all know how cheap Senate inquiries can be. This one would not cost too much money—probably about one-tenth of the cost of flying people all over the country yesterday, airline cancellations et cetera. One of the key aspects here is something Senator Hill did not say and has not addressed today. When we asked him in the debate on the suspension motion why he had a Loans Council inquiry meet all through the 1993 election, there was absolute silence. The cone of amnesia came down over the chamber. Nothing was said. If this committee is established and we do have hearings, we are not going to go to the absolute crass stupidity of those 1993 hearings—meetings chaired by the grand wizard himself, Senator Coulter, in airport lounges and other farcical activities. Who was the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate at the time? Senator Hill. He led all of that. He engineered it. He authored it. Yet he will not take responsibility for this or even explain himself today on this particular matter.</para><para>There are a couple of other comments to make. I must pay tribute to my colleague opposite Senator Brandis. He uttered the ultimate dirty word in all of this—he mentioned Mr Reith's name, something Senator Hill and Senator Ferguson studiously avoided. Ultimately he was the one dumped on over this. Everyone knows that Mr Reith did not do his duty in that period—he did not properly inform people. We presume, still, that he did not properly inform the Prime Minister. That is an absolute tragedy. Of course, he has been rewarded.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>008W7</name.id><name role="metadata">Brandis, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator Brandis</name></talker><para>—He was acting on the advice of the Chief of the Defence Force—as you know, Senator Hill, as a former minister.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>—I am not Senator Hill for a start, Senator Brandis—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President.

He basically knew the truth of what had happened and made sure, for political and manipulative reasons, that it was never passed on. Most of his colleagues have ignored him and dumped on him. As the ultimate reward, he was given the biggest sinecure in the world: going to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development with a large untaxed salary, so he has been paid off to get out of the road. It is interesting that Mr Reith is not an issue anymore. Everyone has made the judgment that in fact he failed to tell the truth.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Just one of the substantive issues that does still concern me in all this is the use by the Prime Minister of the ONA report on 8 November 2001. I have maintained throughout that it is not right for a Prime Minister to quote from an intelligence report for his own political benefit. I do not believe he should have done so then. If Mr Scrafton is right—Mr Scrafton, on the night before, told Mr Howard that this was based only on ministerial information and not on intelligence—then the fraud that would have been perpetrated on the Australian public the next day is a matter for serious long-term concern. It is hard to believe, and I do not necessarily draw a judgment yet, but if the Prime Minister, addressing the Press Club, quoted the ONA report knowing it to have no substance it was a pretty low-rent act. It also probably set a very bad example. It probably prompted the leaking of the Wilkie ONA document to Mr Andrew Bolt—the top-secret AUSTEO document that was published in part. The fact is that that was one of the greatest blights on this government ever known. </para><para>I believe that this committee will not be a witch-hunt, as is accused. It would always have the potential to be so unless it were properly controlled. I do believe that we have a need to pursue the truth. I understand the comments made by Senator Ferguson here today, which are made out of loyalty to the Prime Minister. I understand Senator Brandis's comments today, which are made out of duty to the Prime Minister. Senator Brandis, I am extremely impressed by your loyalty and devotion to the Prime Minister, and I am sure he will reciprocate that by giving you absolutely nothing.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>26698</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move amendments to Senator Faulkner's motion:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Omit paragraph (1), substitute:</para><para>	(1)	That the following matter be referred to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 8 September 2004:</para><para>Matters arising from the public statements made by former ministerial staffer, Mr Mike Scrafton, about the conversations he had with the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, about the `children overboard' affair on 7 November 2001 and the implications of these statements for the findings of the Select Committee on a Certain Maritime Incident and for policy.</para><para>Omit paragraphs (2) to (9) and (11) to (14).</para></quote><para>I will explain the reasons for these amendments.

The paragraphs to be deleted by the second amendment—2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13 and 14—are procedural matters which are relevant to select committees. Because I have moved that the reference go to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee, I believe they are not needed.

In doing so, it will encourage the creation of jobs in the small business sector and improve employment prospects for people seeking work.</para><para>Many small businesses have serious concerns about the financial and administrative costs imposed by unfair dismissal laws. These concerns have prevented many small businesses from taking on additional employees. This bill will permit small business to create the jobs that are currently being lost because of these laws. </para><para>The Government is introducing this bill because it recognises the substantial benefits that will come from the new jobs it creates. They will provide employment for many people who are currently out of work and they will open up opportunities for many people who are looking for different jobs. The wealth generated will flow through to everyone in Australia. </para><para>The Government has made a commitment to the people of Australia to free up these jobs and it intends to follow through. </para><para>Members will be familiar with the content of this bill. It reaffirms the Government's position as advanced in the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002, which was laid aside for the second time on 25 March 2003 after members of this House again rejected Senate amendments that would have destroyed its employment creating potential. </para><para>This bill will require the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to order that an unfair dismissal application is not valid if it involves a small business employer. This provision will only apply to the new employees of a small business, not to existing employees. </para><para>The bill will not exclude employees of small businesses from the unlawful termination provisions of the Workplace Relations Act. It will remain unlawful for any business in Australia, regardless of its size, to dismiss any employee for a discriminatory reason, for example, because of their age, gender or religion. In addition, all businesses in Australia will continue to be required to give employees appropriate notice of termination.</para><para>This Government has produced an environment of sustained jobs growth through sound economic policies, good fiscal management and workplace relations reforms. Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show that over 1.3 million jobs have been created since the Government came to office in March 1996. The unemployment rate has fallen from 8.2 per cent to 5.6 per cent, which is as low as it has been for 23 years.</para><para>Over 96 per cent of Australian businesses are small businesses and around half of Australia's private sector workforce is employed by small businesses. To ensure that the small business sector continues to contribute strongly, our workplace relations system must be responsive to its needs. </para><para>The current unfair dismissal laws place a disproportionate burden on small businesses. They do not have human resource specialists to deal with unfair dismissal regulation. Attending a Commission hearing alone can require a small business owner to close for the day. </para><para>The time and cost of defending a claim, even one without merit, can be substantial. In evidence to the Senate committee inquiring into the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002, the restaurant and catering industry indicated that it costs, on average, $3600 and around 63 hours of management time to defend an unfair dismissal claim—money and time most small businesses can ill afford. In fact, according to a study by the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research, the cost to small and medium sized businesses of complying with unfair dismissal laws is at least $1.3 billion a year.</para><para>Research has found that many small businesses do not understand unfair dismissal laws. For instance, a survey by CPA Australia found that 27 per cent of small business owners thought that they were unable to dismiss an employee even if the employee was stealing from them, and 30 per cent of small business owners thought that employers always lost unfair dismissal cases. </para><para>A growing body of evidence shows that small businesses are reacting to the complexity and cost of these laws by not taking on additional employees. A report by the Centre for Independent Studies, for example, indicates that, if only five per cent of small businesses employed just one extra person, 50 000 jobs would be created, and concludes that `employment in small business would rise significantly in the absence of the unfair dismissal laws.'  </para><para>Similarly, the Melbourne Institute study found that unfair dismissal laws had played a part in the loss of over 77 000 jobs. According to the report, unfair dismissal laws particularly disadvantage those most in need of protection—the long-term unemployed, young people and the less well-educated.</para><para>It has even been reported that the Opposition members have admitted that the existing unfair dismissal laws act as a disincentive for small businesses to employ more staff.</para><para>The burden of unfair dismissal regulation is unnecessarily impeding the entrepreneurship and dynamism of our small businesses. This bill will remove the impediments and help the small business sector create more jobs for Australian workers. </para></quote><para>—————</para><para><inline ref="R2101">AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 2004</inline></para><quote><para>In October 2003 the Government commissioned a broad-ranging review of Australia's livestock export industry, with particular reference to the circumstances surrounding the MV <inline font-style="italic">Cormo Express </inline>incident. The Report on the Keniry Review recommended that industry should be responsible for research and development and management of quality assurance systems to support its members translate current practice into outcomes consistent with best practice; and that these activities should be funded by a compulsory customs charge.</para><para>The Government concurs with this view and believes the livestock export industry should also receive funding raised under the new statutory arrangements to help maintain its capability and continued viability.</para><para>The Government supports the livestock export industry submission that channelling the funds directly to its service delivery body would enable the industry to carry out marketing and R&amp;D activities and improvements to animal welfare practices in a clearly accountable and transparent manner. </para><para>However, the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act 1997 currently limits the red meat industry to a single industry marketing body and a single industry research body for purposes of levy or charge funding flows. Meat and Livestock Australia Ltd is the body so determined. This arrangement does not allow disbursement of compulsory levies and charges to any other body.</para><para>The Bill amends the Act to allow the Minister to determine more than one red meat industry organisation to be a marketing body and a research body and to receive revenue derived from compulsory levies and charges. This will allow for a livestock export marketing body and a livestock export research body to be so determined.</para><para>The intention of the Act, whereby Meat and Livestock Australia Ltd (MLA) is the industry research body and the industry marketing body for the whole of the red meat industry, remains.</para><para>The Government will continue its dollar for dollar matching of payments to the industry research body, that is, to MLA ,in respect of industry research expenditure. This way, as was envisaged by the Government under the restructuring arrangements introduced in 1998, the change preserves the incentive for the provision of research services to be provided by the industry research body, while allowing for the live export industry sector to have ownership and control over its own R&amp;D funds.</para><para>The Bill does not change the Act's broader intentions of viewing the red meat industry as one industry while providing for autonomy and self-determination for the sectors within and for revenue disbursement arrangements. </para><para>Rather it responds to the specific needs of the livestock export industry and the criticisms that have raised concerns about the continued viability of the industry.</para><para>The Bill is aligned with other amendments to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act 1997 and the Export Control Act 1982 (as put to this house in this sitting as the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment (Export Control) Bill 2004), which relate to licensing issues that will introduce tighter regulation across all aspects of the livestock export trade. </para><para>Together these two Bills represent an important step in the Government's reform of the livestock export industry.

This, nonetheless, does not justify the argument for making a prosecution of the proposed offence entirely dependent on whether a particular individual—thick-skinned or the complete opposite—feels menaced, harassed or offended by the offending conduct. The question of a reasonable person using that as a yardstick is, as I say, nothing unusual in the law. We believe that to depart from that would be to depart from principles behind the offences in the Criminal Code. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>26707</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Some of you may have been in the chamber when I gave my speech in the second reading debate in relation to this amendment.

As I said in my second reading contribution, we Democrats acknowledge that this has been a difficult issue for the Attorney-General's office and we do understand that the government's intention in requiring ministerial approval of research is to prevent an abuse of this defence and a plethora of people suddenly claiming that they are conducting research into child pornography.</para><para>However, we Democrats do maintain our real concern that independent research should never be subject to ministerial vetting. We are concerned that the minister, whoever they may be now or in future, may have a tendency to approve research conducted by some organisations but might be reluctant to do so if it is conducted by other organisations. The bill contains no specific criteria that the minister is to take into account in determining whether or not to approve proposed research other than, presumably, whether or not that research will be of public benefit. The Democrats consider it is much more appropriate for a court to determine whether research is genuine and of public benefit than to leave that decision to a minister, which perhaps brings with it the tainting of political influence and interference. The amendment goes to the heart of that and removes the requirement for research to be approved by the minister. Rather, it places it in the hands of courts, where we feel it is better located.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>26707</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government opposes this amendment. We believe that it seeks to remove an important safeguard. We believe that if you did not have this you could have the general public benefit defence available, but that would be uncertain and of benefit to no-one. It would certainly be open to abuse. Again, it would depend on the courts as to how they interpreted that. The proposed defence for approved research would remove that uncertainty which researchers may have concerning their ability to lawfully access certain material. For those who might think that it would be impossible to have a lawful or sound reason for accessing this sort of material, certainly law enforcement and criminologists and the like might well need to access material in order not only to gain intelligence but to do research on the issue. That is why we have this provision which allows for the minister to approve scientific, medical or educational research. </para></talk.start><para>By having ministerial control over it we believe that it does bring certainty. The minister is accountable and can be questioned in the parliament. This is something which would have to be exercised very carefully by any minister. But to leave it open and to say that you can have the public benefit defence could, we believe, really leave the position unclear and be of no benefit to anyone, and the interpretation of the courts for that might vary over time. Leaving it to someone who is subject to public scrutiny, the scrutiny of parliament, we believe is more appropriate. I would envisage that it would be a discretion which would be exercised in circumstances which would be in accordance with what we are spelling out here. It could only be allowed for the purposes of scientific, educational or medical research and you could have psychologists or psychiatrists who might need to access this for legitimate reasons. I say again that we do not want to see this sort of material see the light of day. But there are situations—I know from my own experience practising in the law—where in studying criminal behaviour you do need to have that necessary research in relation to deviant behaviour. This could well assist in that research, but only in strictly limited situations, as we have spelled out. For that reason we believe that this provides a check, and not to have that check would be bad public policy.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>26708</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This was a matter that I included in my speech in the second reading debate on this bill. I cannot now recall whether you were in the chamber at that particular time but I can at least summarise part of the reason for us not supporting your amendment. It was a matter that was examined in detail during the relatively short Senate inquiry. The Attorney-General's Department gave evidence, you might recall, about the drafting of this aspect of the bill because it similarly demonstrated to us that there might be a potential for a problem to exist. If you looked at drafting this aspect of the bill to craft a general defence related to research into paedophilia and child abuse, the difficulty would be that you could end up having it misused as a general defence, which would really run counter to the whole idea of what the bill aimed to do because it would provide the ability for a defence based on more general grounds to be used.</para></talk.start><para>The short answer then was that the Attorney-General's Department gave evidence that it was an issue that also came up during the exposure draft. They had consulted with the Australian Institute of Criminology on the prevalence of genuine research of this kind because, firstly, it begs the question whether there is genuine research into this area. It was determined that a mechanism involving approval of the minister was workable in those rare cases where it is demonstrated that genuine research is being sought to be done in this area. Just saying it is usually workable is not always enough, at least from our perspective. But the department also drew the committee's attention to comparable approval processes in other legislation for research into prohibited drugs. Although not comparable in a sense it is still a prohibited substance that you would want tight or at least very restrictive controls on regarding the sort of research done. On that basis the explanation by the Attorney-General's Department was sufficient to satisfy the opposition that the approval mechanism is not inappropriate in this circumstance for this limited purpose. Therefore we will not be supporting the Democrat amendment. We think the alternative would leave it too open to abuse. </para><para>Question negatived. </para><para>Bill agreed to.</para><para>Bill reported without amendment; report adopted.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>26709</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Senator ELLISON (Western Australia—Minister for Justice and Customs) (7.53 p.m.)—I move:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2004 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>26709</page.no><id.no>R2114</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>26709</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 4 August, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Abetz</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>26709</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R2114">Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2004 Budget Measures) Bill 2004</inline> implements two key 2004 budget measures in the Family and Community Services portfolio. Schedule 1 amends the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 to exempt the fee waived and fee paying scholarships for the income test for income support payments. Schedule 2 amends the Social Security Act 1991 to expand the eligibility criteria for the carer allowance by allowing a new group of carers to qualify for carer allowance if they provide certain care for an adult with a disability even if they do not live with that adult. Labor will support this bill as it is largely beneficial in nature. However, I would encourage carers and students to be wary of this government should it be re-elected. It always has an agenda to find some way to claw back the benefits.</para></talk.start><para>This is certainly the case with the carers measure in this bill. Carers need only to look at the debacle last year where the Howard government set out to remove 35,000 families from carer allowance—a disgraceful act. And earlier this year, before the budget, Labor obtained leaked budget cuts to carers outlined in a 62-page cabinet-in-confidence letter from the minister to the Prime Minister. Page 7 of the letter said:</para><quote><para>The proposals in the package are linked and most require changes to legislation. The fourth proposal is a savings proposal which would reduce the period for backdating payment of carer allowance to 12 weeks for both adults and children from the current 26 weeks for adults and 52 weeks for children and would substantially offset over four years the cost of the additional assistance proposal.</para></quote><para>It is clear that the minister had a plan to pay for the measure we are debating today by cutting payments to those who apply for carer allowance in the future. This cold-hearted measure proposed cutting $30 million from the carer allowance by restricting backdating provisions. Families waiting for the diagnosis of serious conditions would no longer be allowed to backdate claims to when loved ones first fell ill. Despite the minister's efforts to disown her own measure we can only conclude that it is still sitting in the bottom drawer should the coalition be returned for another term. The simple fact of the matter is that you cannot trust this government. Before the last election John Howard promised not to cut anyone's social security benefits, but then after the election we saw the proposal to cut $70 a fortnight from disability pensioners and the cuts to 35,000 carer allowance recipients. These were cuts to social security benefits that the Prime Minister had promised us we would not see.</para><para>The small carer allowance initiative in this bill is an initiative well overdue. The Social Security Act currently requires a carer to live with the person for whom they are providing care to qualify for the carer allowance. This co-residency requirement departed from the practice under the former domiciliary nursing care benefit, which the carer allowance replaced from July 1999 under this government. The old benefit allowed some discretion for the payment in situations where there was no co-residence. So this measure rectifies that problem. The measure today includes a new requirement that care must be provided for at least 20 hours per week. There has been some concern about the operation of this measure and the requirement for at least 20 hours of care. Labor do have concerns about this new test, but are more or less satisfied with the government's explanation of how it will be administered and that it will be essentially the current eligibility for co-resident carers. Labor will monitor the operation of the 20-hour test and, if it is found to be deficient, we will pursue measures to ensure that it operates more fairly. This matter goes to one of the Democrat amendments. Whilst Labor share similar concerns, we are not inclined to support the amendment today as it will hold up the implementation of the measures in this bill. If the House were sitting and the bill could be dealt with in that place subsequent to the amendment it might be a different story but, for now, it is important that the bill pass the Senate. </para><para>The other measure in this bill deals with student scholarships. Currently they are required to be taken into account as income unless specifically exempted from the income test for income support payments. As announced in the 2004 budget all fee waived and fee paying scholarships will no longer be included as income under the social security test for income support payments under the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. The exemptions will apply to scholarships offered in the secondary, vocational education and training and higher education sectors. The government has estimated that the exemption will benefit approximately 1,550 students at the present time, increasing to 2,220 students. This, of course, is a drop in the ocean when it comes to the burden presently placed on students. This government has ratcheted up HECS fees to unbearable levels. Students are now leaving their education with debts that put them behind the eight ball when it comes to buying a home and starting a family.</para><para>We also have the full fee-paying places—the $100,000 degrees that the Prime Minister promised us would not occur but which we now find have occurred. In the last 12 months we have also seen the government axe the financial supplement loan scheme, which, whilst not perfect, provided much needed help to students struggling to afford their education, particularly disabled students. The measures today are pretty meagre compared to this government's record in heaping financial burdens on students.</para><para>This brings me to the other Democrat amendment today, which seeks to broaden the scholarship exemption to those that provide direct financial assistance. Labor is not disposed to agree to this amendment, as it will treat income received from scholarships differently from income received from employment. Labor does not support treating income earned by students less favourably than that of those receiving a university scholarship. The amendment would result in students who sacrifice study time to work three or four nights a week receiving less youth allowance than students who receive the same money from cash scholarships. This is not a fair approach to address the financial pressures on students. Labor believes that a fair approach is to strengthen Commonwealth income support and to take off the long-term pressure in relation to HECS fees. Labor has already outlined reducing the age of independence for youth allowance and extending rent assistance to Austudy recipients, two desperately overdue policies which would have significant impact. There is more to be done, and it will take some time, but quick fixes that will treat students of similar means differently, whether they are receiving a scholarship or working, is not the fair approach. </para><para>To sum up, I would urge carers and students to be very sceptical about this government and these measures. The government promises one thing before an election only to claw it back afterwards. Labor will be supporting this bill today, but carers and students can be assured that the measures will be clawed back if the coalition is re-elected.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>26711</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I also rise to speak to the <inline ref="R2114">Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2004 Budget Measures) Bill 2004</inline>. The bill makes two unrelated changes to family and community services legislation, as announced in the recent budget. It extends the eligibility criteria for carer allowance by removing the requirement that the carer live with the person for whom they are providing care. Carers provide by far the major proportion of both health and community care for people with special needs. Most do so willingly, as members of the family or friends, for love or duty at substantial sacrifice to their own lives. Governments do have an obligation to recognise the care that a carer is providing, to listen to the views of the carer in deciding what their requirements are and not to take the carer's contribution for granted.</para></talk.start><para>It is a fact that carers do not always live with the person for whom they provide care. Indeed, for many people requiring care, their ability to live in their own home represents a degree of independence they do not want compromised. However, it does not diminish the amount of care required. This change recognises the rights of people with disabilities to preserve their independence and, hopefully, stay out of residential care for longer. It has been a long time coming, and the Democrats have called for it for many years. It is again typical of the government's abuse of the Senate process that they should seek to hurriedly deal with this bill, less than three weeks prior to its implementation. We do not want to hold up the beneficial elements for carers, but it does not offer sufficient time for full consideration or even amendment to further improve the lot of carers.</para><para>The changes in this bill are not overly complex and could easily have been introduced in the last sitting. Ironically, it was only about eight weeks ago that the government decided to overlook the needs of elderly carers by similarly rushing through the carer bonus legislation, effectively failing to ensure that many carers would receive the full carer bonus. For too long now, carers of elderly Australians or those with disabilities have been often overlooked. Carers are known as the silent army. There are some 2.5 million carers in Australia, and governments do have an obligation to try and meet their unique needs. We Democrats know that it is no exaggeration to say that carers are the backbone of our whole community care system—we simply could not manage without the vital and voluntary care they give.</para><para>There was, however, a glaring and extraordinary oversight in the payment of the $1,000 up-front bonus to carers that was quickly pushed through by the government in May this year. This is because there are many carers who have a primary entitlement to another social security income support—such as the age pension or the disability support pension—or who are parenting payment singles, who are providing the same level of care as any other person on carer payment. Because the carer payment is paid at the same rate and has the same income test, there has been no advantage to them in swapping to the carer payment, and Centrelink have advised people of that. To make it even worse, social security income support recipients who were on carer payments were automatically transferred over to the age pension when they reached the age of 65. Because the bonus of $1,000 is only paid to people on carer payments, not other pensions, notwithstanding that they may be providing equal amounts of care, many carers have missed out. </para><para>The Australia Democrats did warn the government that they had created an anomaly in that the many carers who receive income support payments other than the carer payment from Centrelink will miss out on the $1,000 bonus. They may have identical caring responsibilities but, because Centrelink moved them from carer payment to the age pension, they have a child and therefore receive parenting payment or they have a disability and receive a disability support pension, they will not receive the $1,000 bonus. The carers who miss out on the bonus of $1,000 are the ones who we would argue can least afford not to receive it. We Democrats attempted to redress the situation by amending the one-off payment bill. However, disappointingly, we were not supported on that by either the government or the opposition. However, the minister cannot hide behind the legislation to avoid responsibility for denying carers the full bonus.</para><para>We would have liked to use this legislation before us today to again make our amendments but, given that the government has decided to bring it on in this way, and given the way in which it announced its implementation, we certainly do not want to delay any assistance for carers. Provision exists for the minister to make special payments. Again, we call on the minister to use these provisions to pay the full $1,000 bonus to carers who were not on carer payments at the time. They will not be double-dipping and will not receive two payments, but they will rightly qualify for the bonus. Recognition for carers, and the government's responsibility towards them, does not end with the extension of eligibility criteria for carer allowance or indeed the payment of a bonus. For many carers the lack of respite care available to them means they will struggle to find the time to spend it. Carer allowance of $90 a fortnight is fairly paltry in terms of the dedication of carers. We call on the government to address the ongoing social, economic, health, education and employment problems and needs experienced by carers.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>26712</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The subject of the <inline ref="R2114">Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2004 Budget Measures) Bill 2004</inline> has already been addressed by my colleague Senator Collins, and so Labor's position needs no repetition. It is largely a technical bill, implementing two minor budget measures. It is opportune, however, in the dying days of this parliament to record the appalling record of the Howard government in respect of veterans affairs—the subject matter of this bill. In coming months, we will be engaged on the hustings with veterans' issues, which will be important to a large number of people. It is important to note, though, that for veterans this is no ordinary election. Many veterans are very angry indeed at the way they have been so contemptuously treated. That is the prime motive for the formation of the Ex-service, Service and Veterans Party.</para></talk.start><para>In my political memory I cannot recall circumstances where the veterans community have been so prompted to organise politically to take this step to form their own political organisation. It is unprecedented. It is even more dramatic when it is considered that this is generally thought to be an area of government removed from the political ruck or contest. It is generally accepted that veterans affairs are non-political, and certainly that has been our approach in the Australian Labor Party. It is also instructive to note that the new Ex-service, Service and Veterans Party has chosen as its first target the minister's seat of Hughes in New South Wales. Next it has chosen every government marginal seat in which to field a candidate. This is therefore deliberately focused on the Howard government. This is, I think it fair to say, a voice of protest. It is a protest organised in recognition of the fact that in every electorate around Australia there are at least 2,000 veterans. Add to that ex-service people, their own families and their extended families and this is indeed a sizeable constituency. </para><para>The intent of the ESVP may be dressed up as an attack on the whole political process, but the facts are otherwise. This is a direct reaction to the policies and attitudes of the Howard government. Let us look at the reasons for this. On the surface it is very simple: veterans and war widows believe they have been treated with contempt by the Howard government. This is remarkable given that the ex-service community is generally conservative by nature and has been more likely than other communities to support a conservative government. I think it is fair to say that that is no longer true. Perhaps the Howard government is just too conservative. Perhaps it is because dishonesty and deceit are not conservative values. I suggest, though, that it is more to do with being perceived as a little bit disingenuous—a little bit mean and tricky—and that is certainly the Howard government's record in veterans affairs.</para><para>Veterans and war widows believe that they have been duped. Their hopes and aspirations for a better deal have been held out like a carrot since the last election. The last time around the Howard government promised a total review of all of the issues on which veterans have been writing and lobbying for many decades. That promise was honoured: a review by Justice Clarke was commissioned. Three thousand veterans and war widows made submissions to that lengthy inquiry. Public hearings were held all over the country as Justice Clarke and his colleagues addressed the very wide terms of reference. The report was released in February 2002 and then the real stalling began. The Clarke review was portrayed as a democratic hearing of everybody's concerns, but of course it turned out to be nothing of the kind. As the months dragged by it became clear that there was never the slightest intention to deal with veterans' concerns.</para><para>In fact, 14 months passed and it became obvious that any government response would be kept until the eve of the next scheduled election. But when it did come it was rejected out of hand by the government's own backbench. Their expectations had been built up as well. After all, their excuse for the government's total inactivity was that the Clarke report would answer everybody's prayers. It was too late, though. Most veterans were disappointed and many remain disappointed. Given that the majority of submissions to the Clarke review were about extending gold card eligibility, this, of course, was inevitable.</para><para>The other key theme concerning the restructuring of the TPI special rate was dismissed by the veterans community and hence by the government as well. That left very little, and now Clarke has been consigned to history. Veterans know they were conned. The government could have made any of the decisions it made at any time in the previous seven years—in the time since it was first elected to office in 1996. That probably does sum up the Howard government's record in this area. Yet we can expect that in the coming campaign the government will run on its record. But the only record it keeps is the number of dollars spent. Again, though, veterans should not be duped. Let me say this plainly: most of the increase in veterans funding has come from indexation of pensions and through the massive growth in health costs. Health cost increases, driven by increasing demands of age and through rapidly increasing health care costs in general, are currently running at around 15 per cent per year. In fact, it is now clear that the financial choke is being applied. The cuts most noticeable are to the Homecare program and to allied health care services. </para><para>Homecare this year has been cut by $4 million already. That is despite the program's justification, which is that the money is saved by keeping people at home, out of institutional care. That is humbug, and it will happen again because the Homecare budget is linked to the number of cardholders, which, in an ageing population, is falling. For allied health care, the calls and letters of complaint are rolling in, about cuts to hydrotherapy, aids and appliances and new provisions for transport. Can we forget the cruel attempt to limit amputees' access to artificial limbs? What help are those living in remote areas getting with respect to transport costs?</para><para>Then, of course, there is the saga of the gold card. Having inconvenienced thousands of veterans and widows in 2002-03 by failing to retain GPs accepting the gold card, the government chose to procrastinate for 12 months. The problem of accessing medical specialists remains. The solution was deferred until January of next year, just to save some money. That saving is at the cost of veterans and there is no guarantee that the higher fees will make the slightest bit of difference. In fact, I understand that in Tasmania there are almost no specialists who will accept the gold card, and they are unlikely to in the future. This is a serious and fundamental breach of our undertaking as a community to fully care for those who were injured as a result of their service. From the very first days of World War I, we as a nation have had an obligation to provide health care and compensation for those who suffered from war caused disability. We still do, but it is much harder. It is particularly hard where a veteran, especially in a rural area, finds that their long-term treating specialist will no longer see them. Specialists say they respect the veteran but that they should not be expected to subsidise the government by providing treatment at low cost or below cost. The bottom line is the same: veterans are not receiving the care they were promised.</para><para>Lo and behold, in more recent days the problem of GPs is back. It seems that their deal was not as good as the bulk-billing deal for Medicare, so they want more. Preferably, they want the $7.50 available under Medicare to GPs in rural Australia, but $5 would probably do. An AMA survey of GPs in Australia has revealed that 60 per cent of GPs believe that the gold card fee is not sustainable and henceforth they may well abandon the gold card again. We assume they will take the Medicare card only as it pays better. This is a problem of the Howard government's making. Once a status symbol recognising veterans' contributions, the gold card is now just another card in the wallet. Sadly, veterans and war widows are again being used as hostages to lever a better commercial outcome. This is an untenable set of circumstances; were it not for the political opportunism being displayed, veterans would be calling the government to account.</para><para>Moving on through this litany, comment must also be made on the cheap and shallow exploitation of veterans for the political promotion of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. These people have no shame when it comes to photo opportunities. Under the cover of new memorials, farewelling troops and welcoming them on their return, these people bask without shame in the reflected glory of veterans. Veterans are nothing but stage props for this massive public relations exercise. Veterans are sick of this tawdry, exploitative self-promotion. They will not be bought off with certificates and weasel words. This litany of mismanagement and neglect goes on. </para><para>I also mention in this context the denial of the military compensation scheme practice of hiring large legal firms. At the cost of millions of dollars, these firms are employed to defeat the compensation claims of ex-service people struggling to get their compensation claims properly assessed. It is grossly unfair, but is typical of the combative attitude of the MCRS. Ex-service people deserve better than this, but the minister is impervious to any approaches. The minister prefers to blindly accept the advice of her department, which rarely—if ever—confesses to errors, yet is in the top 10 in the Commonwealth when it comes to defective administrative payouts.</para><para>There is the notorious case of Mrs Palmer in Brisbane who was falsely denied a war widow's pension year after year because of what can only be described as negligence. After the confession it still took over 12 months to settle the case. I have never come across a more deserving case or one so badly handled. Yet every week in my office, complaints are received of equally dismissive behaviour where the traditional focus of client service fails to penetrate the MCRS. Why is it that, so many years after the event, those now suffering severe health problems from their employment to deseal and reseal the tanks of F111s, so little has been done? I could go on.</para><para>There is of course some credit to be allocated. The Department of Veterans' Affairs in general has an outstanding record of service to veterans. The fault does not rest there entirely. It rests with its masters, the Howard government. The best example, as I have said, rests with the commissioning of the Clarke report. But then we had legislation to implement it. We have also had very complex legislation to introduce the new Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Scheme. Throughout that legislative process we were caught between additional benefits and poor policy. Inevitably, poor policy prevailed. The prime instance of this is the payment of the Defence Force income support allowance for those ex-service people receiving benefits from Centrelink. Our criticism of this disaster is already in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. I will not repeat it except to say that it entails the complete waste of $18 million being paid to DVA and Centrelink to administer the allowance. This was totally unnecessary as the effects of the policy could have been achieved with a one-line amendment to the Social Security Act. Once again, this was money wasted which could have been better directed to veterans and their families who remain in need. In anybody's language, $18 million is a lot of money.</para><para>I daresay that during the next few weeks or months we will see more phoney posturing by the Howard government on its largesse to veterans. Veterans know it is not true, and I hope this evening that this brief record and litany of mistakes will remind them. As outlined by Senator Collins, the Labor Party supports the bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>26716</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to respond to a couple of statements made by various speakers.

That review meant that about 37,000 people retained their carer allowance. The cases of about 30,000 parents who had a child with a disability were reviewed. I will enunciate the figures clearly and put them on the public record. I want Senator Collins to listen to this, because we are talking about truth and honesty in government.

There were three attempts on the part of Centrelink—two letters and a phone call—to ask people to return their forms and 8,305 people did not return their forms. Under Labor many people were getting onto a carer allowance because their children had asthma and they wanted a health care card. Senator Newman went out and talked to people in Centrelink, which was something that Labor had never done with the old DSS. I was with her one day when she asked an officer behind the counter, `What would you do if you could change things?' The officer said, `Senator, there are people getting a carer allowance basically to get a health care card because their children have asthma, and the costs of their puffers and other medications are high. I would change that because these children don't have a disability that requires a carer allowance.' And what happened? Of the 30,000 people in the review I think about 7,000 retained their health care cards.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We had 7,000 people who kept their health care cards, 8,305 who did not respond and 6,465 people who said they were not eligible.

Senator Greig talked about carers. He said that people missed out on the carer bonus. They only got a carer bonus because we ran the economy efficiently. We actually saved money; we have a surplus. We have paid back $70 billion of Labor's $96 billion of debt, which we inherited. Labor racked up, in their last year of government, $10 billion of debt. There are kids in the gallery—who Senator Bishop was performing to—whose money we were borrowing. We were borrowing money from the next generation. The Labor government borrowed $10 billion in their last year of government. They left us with $96 billion of debt that those young people in the gallery tonight would have had to pay back. We were living off the future to pay for our needs. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The government said we should run our budgets in surplus. Because we have done that and because we have paid back $70 billion of debt, we are saving nearly $6 billion in interest. So we can give the backbone of our community, the carers, a bonus. Most people on carer payment would otherwise be in employment. There are about 2,500 who did not transfer to the age pension, but people were advised to transfer to the age pension before anybody knew about a carer bonus because those people do not have to have a review every two years of the case of the person for whom they care. Many people would find that review onerous. The age pension is more portable for those people who come from overseas and might want to go back to Calathumpia—I will not use the name of a country, because I do not want to discriminate. If people want to go back to their home country for a period of time their age pension is portable. There is always a cut-off point and we believed that we could give a bonus to those people on a carer payment who would otherwise probably have had the opportunity to work. Many people on the age pension who get carer allowance got a $600 bonus. This is something that was never, ever achieved under Labor because they never ran surplus budgets. They were always spending more than they received in revenue and borrowing from the next generation.</para><para>It is always difficult when you have these sorts of payments because you do have to have cut-off points regarding when a payment starts and who gets it. When Senator Greig talked about the carers, he failed to mention that within the last budget I was able to achieve half a billion dollars for carers. This very bill is part of that, to extend carer allowance. Of course, it does not pay on an hourly basis for the enormous amount of work that carers do in our community. Every day in this portfolio I go out and see parents caring for children with a disability. I see older people who have been caring for their children for 30, 40, 50 and 60 years—80-year-olds with people they have been caring for. I have been to the disability ministers' meeting and said to them that we need to do something about succession planning for these people. I could not get them to agree, in the first instance, to an advisory committee. They had to have a committee of bureaucrats to discuss it first before I could engage carers, but I thought I may as well take the first step with the eight Labor state and territory ministers. I think I have got a reasonable reputation for working with my colleagues from the opposite side at the state level in health, in this area and for women.</para><para>We have agreed that we will look at issues that affect people, including older carers. For example, as I said, an 82-year-old may look after a 60-year-old son or daughter with down syndrome who has grand mal seizures. They are the people we should be concerned about. I have instigated a committee of all state and territory ministers to engage in a discussion about how together we can provide for these people: how we can look at accommodation and how we can assist them in making plans as they get older and for when they die. The thing that concerns them most is: when they die who will look after their children? That most probably was not an issue 30 years ago. When I was at university doing child development and human development, it was not the case that a person with down syndrome lived to 70. A member of my family has a sister with down syndrome who is 70. It was not heard of 30 years ago. </para><para>We have to move—as we talk about the ageing of the population—on the ageing of our population with disability and the effect on their parents. I have moved some way with the ministers, though not as fast as I would have liked, and I have indicated that we will address some of the issues of succession planning for them. We gave $72½ million to get the states to do what they should have been doing: providing accommodation and respite for older people who care for people with a disability. We took up a 1981 agreement from when Labor was in government federally that the states would look after accommodation and respite care and the Commonwealth would look after employment in what were once called sheltered workshops but what we now call business services—supported employment. We agreed that we would address those issues. We have seen increased spending in disability services. There was $99 million in the last budget to address the issue of assisting business services to be more viable and to make sure that nobody in a business service loses their job. But the states need to come on board and carry out their responsibility. They have got increased GST to provide accommodation and respite for people who have sons and daughters with disabilities. We have given them an additional $72½ million to assist them in giving respite to people over 70. Senator Greig can come in here and talk about issues to do with carers but let me say that in the last budget I managed to achieve half a billion dollars for carers.</para><para>Another issue for me is young carers. Last week at the first young carers summit, which the Commonwealth government funded, I met young carers. The youngest there was 13 years of age. There were carers of 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19 caring for a parent with a disability—sometimes a mental illness, sometimes a degenerative disease—and often looking after a sibling—sometimes one with a disability. In this last budget we have given them five hours respite a week during term time and two weeks respite a year to enable them to continue with their education. This was particularly for young people at risk who have no extended family to assist them. You only had to sit with those young carers, as I did last week when we opened their conference and then again in the evening, to find out about the challenges they face. There was half a billion dollars for carers in this budget alone. It is all very well for the Democrats to come in here and say what they would do; they never have to be fiscally responsible. But to give credit where credit is due is appropriate. In the last budget we had a program for young carers, who have never featured on the landscape before and who are high in my priorities. I have some other ideas that I think could assist them. For older carers I am pushing the states into discussing a feasible approach for giving them some hope and some security about what might happen to their sons or daughters, if they are under 65, in terms of accommodation and, if they are over 65, in terms of accommodation and the Commonwealth's responsibility.</para><para>They are important issues that I believe need to be pursued. I am very pleased I have been able to start those discussions with the states and territories. This bill is not about paying people for caring; this bill is about recognising that there is an army of people out there caring for loved ones, for people for whom they have a responsibility out of friendship—whether it be a neighbour or an in-law—and for people who do not live with the person for whom they care. It is an issue which has been raised and to which we have responded. It has huge budgetary implications but I think it is appropriate in recognition of the work that the army of carers does out there. We can never, ever pay them in monetary terms. It is about recognising the army of people who care either for people in their homes and for those with whom they do not live. I commend the bill to the house. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>26719</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Before we move to the committee stage of this bill, I seek leave to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard </inline>the speech of my colleague Senator Natasha Stott Despoja on the second reading.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Ross (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Lightfoot)</inline>—Is leave granted?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator Patterson</name></talker><para>—Mr Acting Deputy President, the normal procedure is to see such a speech before granting leave.

I would not have progressed with that if I had known the appropriate protocols had not been followed. I will undertake to do that hopefully before we close. </para><para>These amendments aim to broaden the exemption of scholarships from the social security income test to include a new class of scholarship called university equity scholarships. The government exempted its Commonwealth learning scholarships in the new higher education legislation last year and in this bill is broadening the exemption to full and partial fee-waiver and fee-pay scholarships. Until now, discretionary scholarships provided by universities have been ignored—that is, any scholarship provided by a university that is not a Commonwealth learning scholarship and that gives students a payment to be used at the student's discretion would be counted as income for the purposes of the social security income test.</para><para>The Democrats support the changes to the treatment of scholarships in this bill but believe they do need to be broadened. For universities to gain funding through the Higher Education Equity Program they must, along with various other measures, offer university equity scholarships out of their own funds. However, under current policy these scholarships will not be exempt from the social security income test. This means, therefore, that students receiving Austudy, youth allowance, Abstudy, a service pension or other payments under the SSA or VEA who receive a discretionary university scholarship will have their scholarship counted as income, but students receiving one of those payments under the SSA or VEA and a Commonwealth learning scholarship will not have their scholarship counted as income. This situation is quite absurd and unfair for the many students who will receive discretionary university scholarships. </para><para>Equity scholarships would be provided to students meeting the low socioeconomic status requirements of the Commonwealth Scholarships Guidelines established under section 238.10 of the Higher Education Support Act 2003. The equity scholarships would be established under a new chapter of the Commonwealth Scholarship Guidelines. Disadvantaged students in need of income support are being severely compromised by the current arrangements, which prevent them from receiving the full benefit of their scholarships. We Democrats have received strong support from vice-chancellors, students and university staff for these amendments. I commend them to the chamber.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>26720</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We will not be supporting the amendments. From 2005, to receive funding under the Higher Education Equity Program higher education providers must offer their own scholarships to complement the new Commonwealth learning scholarships, which are targeted to students in financial hardship. While guidelines for the Higher Education Equity Program have not been finalised, higher education providers will have the flexibility to determine how to deliver these equity scholarships. This means that equity scholarships can be delivered in a manner that would make them exempt under legislation currently before us—that is, by offering scholarships as non-discretionary payments that pay or waive a student's fees or student contribution amounts. The government recognises that students cannot use their non-discretionary fee-pay or waiver scholarships to meet their current needs. That is why the government has put forward legislation to exempt these types of scholarships from the social security and veterans' entitlements income test.</para></talk.start><para>The social security system aims to treat people equitably—that is, people with similar means should receive the same level of support. Higher education providers could decide to offer equity scholarships as discretionary cash payments. That is a matter for them to decide. If equity scholarships paid as cash were exempted from the income test, this would mean that students receiving these scholarships would be better off than students who receive cash from other sources, such as work. In a needs based social security system we do not believe this would be fair. </para><para>In addition, youth allowance and Austudy recipient have access to a generous free area before their payments are affected. A single student can have income of $236 per fortnight or $6,136 a year before the payment is reduced. Income over this amount gradually reduces a student's payment at a tapered rate. Youth allowance and Austudy recipients have access to an income bank of up to $6,000. The combination of the income free area and the income bank means that in most situations a student receiving additional income, such as a cash scholarship, will not be affected under the income test. In situations where a cash scholarship does reduce a student's payment, they will always be better off than a student without extra assistance. It is for these reasons that we will not be supporting the Democrats' amendments.</para><para>Question negatived. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>26721</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Schedule 2, item 1, page 6 (line 34) to page 7 (line 21), omit subsection 954A(2).</para><para>(2)	Schedule 2, item 1, page 7 (lines 22 to 24), omit subsection 954A(3).</para></quote><para>The first of these amendments goes to the eligibility criteria for carer allowance by removing the requirement that the carer live with the person for whom they are providing care. The Democrats have been calling for this outcome for some time. Most carers willingly provide care to another person—to family or friends—in that person's home and do it, as I have said, out of love or duty and at substantial sacrifice to themselves. Providing care to another person in that person's home enables the person requiring care to maintain a degree of independence that they do not want to have compromised. However, it does not diminish the amount of care required.</para><para>The bill before us recognises that a person providing care for another person in that person's home is entitled to carer allowance. There is no need to qualify it further as the bill is attempting to do. There is no need to specify 20 hours a week or `for care of bodily functions'. That is already in the adult disability assessment tool, the ADAT. There is no reason for this additional criterion to be added to the legislation where care is provided outside the home. It does not exist in the legislation where care is provided in the home, and I seriously doubt the intentions of the government in attempting to put it into this bill. It seems to me that this is a case of the government on the one hand giving help to carers but on the other hand putting in the means to take it away again.</para><para>Democrat amendment (1) means that the legislation for carers who do not live with the person they are caring for mirrors the legislation for carers who live in the same home—no extra bits, no more and no less. If we allow these additional qualifications—which, as I have emphasised, already exist in the ADAT—the next thing we know the government will be amending the legislation for carers who live with the person, just to make it consistent. It is already consistent and it does not need further specification. Carer allowance requires that the person being cared for has passed the rigorous adult disability assessment tool. That does not change, and our amendments do not seek to water it down.</para><para>The ADAT test was imposed some years ago to take away the subjectivity of determining a person's need for care or the amount of care needed. It contains a number of requirements, such as that the care must be largely for bodily functions to preserve the life of the person and must be for a minimum of 20 hours a week. There has been no need to enshrine these provisions in law because, as I said earlier, the ADAT is already in the social security and veterans' acts. Simply, our amendments provide that, if it is not specified for carer allowance where the care is provided in the same home, it should not be specified for carer allowance where the care is provided outside the home. Our amendment (1) makes it fair for everyone.</para><para>Our second amendment goes to the heart of what we find a more concerning element of the bill. Proposed section 954A(3) gives the minister a disallowable instrument which can be used to specify that certain types of care or disabilities can be exempted from the carer allowance, even if they have passed the ADAT. As I said earlier, carers in Australia should be very concerned. This is quite a tricky provision which will allow the minister or the delegate to, at a whim, simply put in a class of disability or care to override the ADAT and reject or cancel carer allowance. For example, the minister could determine that showering a person is no longer a type of care which qualifies for carer allowance. It enables the minister now or in the future to determine that the preparation of a person's food, for example, no longer qualifies as care. The minister will be able to make that determination regardless of the adult disability assessment tool. </para><para>Not many of us here today, I think, would willingly go to another person's home every day of the week for 20 hours in total to shower, bathe, dress and feed an elderly or disabled person. Carers do just this and they often spend many hours travelling, which are not counted in the 20 hours criterion. Yet here we have the minister giving the authority for that care to be discounted. One can only imagine how this might be used. The ADAT was instituted to take the subjectivity out of determining care needs. It was introduced so that public servants, including Centrelink officers, could make decisions based on clear medical determinations by medical practitioners. The introduction of a disallowable instrument allows public servants and the minister to override the findings of a medical practitioner. That a medical practitioner might have treated a person for years and have an intimate knowledge of their care needs no longer matters; the disallowable instrument allows the minister to decide that certain types of care or certain conditions just do not count.</para><para>Our amendment (2) simply takes that power away from the minister and away from public servants and leaves it in the hands of the medical practitioner to decide whether the person's disability or age means that they need care for bodily functions. It is a sad day when carers who selflessly devote hours of care every day to assist another person or sometimes several people with basic bodily care, all for the grand sum of $45.05 a week, might now be used by the government as a target for money savings. The Australian Democrats do not want to see the minister using carers in an unreasonable way to implement that kind of policy outcome. Our amendment (2) means that there can be no such disallowable instrument and that the minister cannot decide to exclude, for example, showering, bathing or feeding as types of care.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>26722</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We will not be agreeing to the Democrat amendments. For me, when I was contemplating it as a minister, one of the issues with this extension of the carer allowance—and again, with all due respect to the Democrats, they do not have to have the fiscal responsibility—was that there had to be some definition of what we meant by care. Carers who live with the person they care for are available to provide personal care on a daily basis, including overnight. The 20-hour a week requirement for carers who are not co-resident places them in a similar position as to the intensity of care that they provide.</para></talk.start><para>I believe that the bill before the Senate is a reasonable extension of the current carer allowance requirements and recognises the need to support flexible care arrangements in the community. But it also makes some stipulation about what sort of care we expect and assists us in putting some sort of ring fence around the allowance to ensure that there is an expectation as to the level of care provided by people who genuinely care for another person—whether it be a relative who lives two doors down the street, a friend who somebody is looking after in the same neighbourhood, or whatever. That is why we have included a level of care that is a requirement to obtain the carer allowance. We believe that this extension is valuable to those people who care for others but we also believe that there should be some requirements for it. For those reasons we will not be supporting the Democrat amendments. </para><para>Question negatived.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>26723</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Temporary Chairman, having now observed the protocol and distributed Senator Stott Despoja's speech on the second reading, I seek leave to now have that incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Ross (The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN)</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Lightfoot)</inline>—Is leave granted?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator Patterson</name></talker><para>—With all due respect, Mr Temporary Chairman, I have not had time to see it as I have been on my feet.

However, it does not yet bring in a tax which is based on the volume, rather than the selling price, of wine. That is something that we would like to see the government move to. This legislation will be a benefit in general to smaller wine producers in Tasmania and, I am sure, other parts of the country and therefore has to be welcomed, but we will be pursuing further improvements to make the taxation system fairer for small producers producing high-quality wines as against those that are producing large volumes. Many people would not know, for example, that cask wines are not produced in Tasmania. Its production is all high-quality bottled wines. While this legislation is a good move, one that will help many wine producers, we would like to see it go further.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>26724</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I understand—and the chamber can advise me if this is incorrect—that there is an agreement tonight that speeches can be incorporated.

However, there has been a clear downward trend in winery profits over recent years, according to the Deloitte 2002 Annual Benchmarking Survey.</para><para>Prior to this year's Budget announcement of the proposed wine producer rebates, Econtech had forecast that winery profitability will continue to decline over the 5 years to 2006-07. Econtech had also forecast that employment growth will suffer, and that employment may even decline due to exits from the industry.</para><para>The Democrats recognise the role that the wine producer rebates contained in this Bill will play in further encouraging growth and sustainability in small and medium sized regional Australian wineries.</para><para>Wine tourism is a vibrant and growing economic activity in many key regions. The Democrats support the vital role that wine tourism plays in strengthening regional economies.</para><para>The local spirits industry is growing. Despite being handicapped by the Coalition, which gives cognac and foreign brandy an excise tax advantage over our own rum products, Bundaberg Rum asserts they are now the biggest selling spirit in Australia. </para><para>Most RTDs are manufactured in Australia.</para><para>Good social and health outcomes are a key objective of a coherent alcohol tax policy. This means that Australia's alcohol policy should regulate the price and availability of alcohol in a manner that minimises harm and encourages responsible consumption.</para><para>Drinking alcohol responsibly and moderately has health, social and economic benefits for individuals, communities, industry and governments, which collect over $4b in alcohol revenue. The abuse of alcohol has a huge cost however.</para><para>People who drink in moderation have better health and social outcomes than abstainers. Abstainers have better health outcomes than people drinking at risky or high-risk levels.</para><para>Alcohol abuse affects certain indigenous communities, and specific age groups, such as underage drinkers.</para><para>Good alcohol tax policy can make a positive contribution to beneficial social and health outcomes.</para><para>A balanced alcohol taxation regime requires policy integrity. Alcohol tax should ideally conform to the principles of simplicity, efficiency and equity. Equity in a tax system requires that `like be taxed as like'.</para><para>Alcohol taxation should not discriminate between different forms of alcohol on such arbitrary bases as how the alcohol was created, whether by fermentation, distillation or any other method. A standard drink is a standard drink. Alcohol taxation should reflect this truth.</para><para>A key feature of any alcohol policy should be the promotion of low-alcohol products. </para><para>In concert with credible and authoritative health campaigners who are experts in the alcohol field, the Democrats have long campaigned for changes to alcohol excise to encourage the production and consumption of low-alcohol products, whatever their form.</para><para>All beer products currently enjoy an excise-free threshold of 1.15% alcohol content. This means that no excise duty is paid on the first 1.15% of the alcohol content in the beer product. The lower the alcohol content of the beer, the greater the value of this concession.</para><para>However, the failure to provide an excise free-threshold for RTDs means there is no incentive for producers to make lower-strength RTD products.</para><para>The Democrats have consistently recommended that low alcohol packaged RTD products be subject to the same tiered excise regime that has successfully encouraged the production and consumption of low-alcohol packaged beer. There is no revenue cost in doing this, and no plausible policy rationale for not doing it. </para><para>Some believe that RTDs target young people and are the cause of a growing youth alcohol abuse problem. On this basis many claim that RTDs should be taxed at a higher rate in order to price them out of the youth market.</para><para>Competitors emphasise this argument in the hopes that it boosts their own products. The only way to deal with competing claims is to use credible genuinely independent empirically based research.</para><para>Data from the spirits industry indicates that two thirds of the RTD market is made up of dark-spirit based products, based on bourbon, scotch and dark rum. They argue that these RTDs compete in the same market to beer and are comparable in terms of alcohol strength.</para><para>The spirits industry argues that these products are neither overly sweet, nor colourful, and are in fact targeted at 18 to 30 year olds.</para><para>Spirits industry data shows that the share of the RTD market made up by white-spirit based RTDs is falling. Sales of white-spirit based RTDs fell approximately 8 per cent during 2003, compared with an increase in sales of over 25 per cent for dark-spirit based RTDs.</para><para>The NDS Household Survey commenced in 1985 and I am advised that it is arguably the most sophisticated national empirical data available relating to the use of alcohol (and other drugs) in Australia.</para><para>The findings of the AIHW after the 2001 NDS Household Survey indicated that RTDs are the most commonly consumed alcoholic beverages for 14 to 19 year old females drinking at low risk levels. (Although I would have thought anyone drinking at 14 is high risk.)</para><para>14 to 19 year old males drinking at low, risky and high risk levels all preferred regular strength beer, whilst risky and high risk females in that age group preferred bottled spirits and liqueurs.</para><para>A report in the West Australia Sunday Times recently (11 July) said that the Australian Secondary School Students Alcohol and Drug Survey shows a reduction in the number of underage school students consuming alcohol.</para><para>Importantly, the Survey found that excessive drinking among males aged 16 to 17 dropped from 29 per cent in 1999 to 19 per cent in 2002.</para><para>The Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy has requested that a taskforce be established to prepare a report by November 2004 recommending interventions to reduce underage drinking.</para><para>That report will outline mechanisms to inform parents of the need to monitor alcohol consumption levels by their adolescents. This is a sound initiative.</para><para>Unlike wine, beer alcohol taxation now probably looks about right overall.</para><para>WET provides wine producers with an incentive to produce low-value wine. The low-priced alcohol cask market is at the recorded centre of alcohol abuse.</para><para>Research in the Northern Territory demonstrates that increasing the price of cask wine substantially reduced alcohol abuse. In my own state of Western Australia the green suitcase, cask wine, is notorious in street and parks drinking.</para><para>Contrary to the myth, wine is at the heart of alcohol abuse, not at its periphery.</para><para>This is one reason I maintain my campaign for the volumetric taxation of wine. </para><para>Beyond increasing the price of cask wine, a volumetric wine tax would also lower the price of higher value wines, which are over-priced by virtue of the WET. This, in turn, would stimulate that sector of the industry, and create jobs.</para></quote></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>26730</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name

winemakers from the wine equalisation tax since the WET was introduced by the Howard government as part of the GST package. </para><para>That was 5 years ago.</para><para>Labor was the first to propose a rebate from the WET for cellar door sales.</para><para>It was proposed by Joel Fitzgibbon who, as both the Member for Hunter and Shadow Minister for Tourism, was concerned about the effect of the WET on tourism in wine regions.</para><para>At the time—1999—the wine industry was in uproar because they had been promised an `equalisation' tax but found that the tax burden on premium wines had been significantly increased.</para><para>What the government had actually promised was to equalise the effect of the new and old tax regimes at the value end of the market.</para><para>With ad valorem taxation that increased the burden on premium wines significantly.</para><para>Labor established a wine tax committee, to examine the problem and develop an appropriate response.</para><para>The other members of the committee were the Member for Kingston David Cox, the Member for Hunter Joel Fitzgibbon, the Member for Bass Michelle O'Byrne, and the Member for Cowan Graham Edwards.</para><para>We consulted widely, visiting small and medium size winemakers in the Hunter, Swan, Tamar and Yarra Valleys and Margaret River.</para><para>From these consultations, what became clear was that the large wineries need to maintain ad valorem taxation for the overwhelming majority of the industry's sales—and this is critical to the irrigation areas that supply grapes for value wines—while a vocal group of small winemakers, particularly in Western Australia and Tasmania, wanted volumetric taxation because it would provide them with the tax relief that many desperately needed.</para><para>What was needed was an appropriate exemption from the WET that could resolve this dilemma for the wine industry.</para><para>Collectively the industry needed ad valorem taxation.</para><para>An exemption set at an appropriate level would remove the extra burden the WET placed on small premium wineries and they would therefore be able to survive within the existing ad valorem tax regime.</para><para>It would be preferable for a number of design reasons, that I will go into later, to determine the exemption as a WET free threshold set at an appropriate number of litres of production—not alcohol content.</para><para>That was the proposition the committee consulted on in the Hunter, Swan, Tamar and Yarra Valleys, in Margaret River and with the major wine companies.</para><para>Over the year that we consulted, the wine industry adopted four different tax policy positions of its own.</para><para>These included cutting the WET rate and later only paying the GST.</para><para>Both of these options would have been expensive to the revenue and made value wines even cheaper—neither of which we were prepared to contemplate.</para><para>The Prime Minister eventually was forced to promise the Australian Democrats an exemption to get the GST through the Senate.</para><para>The Treasurer tried to ignore that commitment for many months and the Democrats—but not the Labor Party—had all but given up on it ever being delivered when the Treasurer was instructed by the Prime Minister to negotiate an arrangement.</para><para>The result, having been negotiated by a reluctant Treasurer and a pair of Democrats was an inconceivably complex beast.</para><para>The cost of the rebate was shared with the States and the Commonwealth's contribution phased out above a threshold.</para><para>That is a difficult arrangement in terms of tax administration and compliance.</para><para>The Labor Party never thought it was adequate and never gave up on providing something better.</para><para>When the wine industry was able to unite around a policy position that would see the WET rate of 29% maintained with an appropriate number of litres as a WET free threshold, it was clear that a solution was within reach.</para><para>They had originally wanted a one million litre exemption but had settled on 600,000 litres. </para><para>At the 2001 federal election Labor offered an exemption from the WET for wineries producing up to 50,000 litres.</para><para>The industry would have preferred more.</para><para>However the government did not match it and instead offered a review.</para><para>After the election when the terms of reference for the review were released they did not include the issue of taxation—the industry had been led up the garden path.</para><para>David Trebbeck from ACIL Tasman conducted the review.</para><para>He found that all anybody in the industry wanted to do was talk about tax so he wrote a very good chapter on that but felt constrained by his terms of reference not to make any recommendations.</para><para>The industry continued to campaign for a 600,000 litre exemption. Two budgets went by with the government refusing to respond. Small wineries profitability continued to be low.</para><para>It was not until an election year budget, with nine marginal seats with significant wine industry interests spread on either side of the electoral pendulum that the Howard government reluctantly decided to act.</para><para>The only thing that has changed the government's mind is that Labor has made it an issue and some of the Coalition's regional seats are vulnerable.</para><para>The proposition that they have brought forward is for a rebate on the WET for the first $1 million of wholesale value.</para><para>At a 29% WET rate that has a value of up to $290,000 for each winery.</para><para>How that relates to the value of a WET exemption expressed in litres depends on the average value of a winery's production.</para><para>For small winemakers producing premium product that is the equivalent of a WET free threshold of less than 100,000 litres.</para><para>For large wineries producing a preponderance of value wines it is the equivalent of a WET free threshold of over 250,000 litres.</para><para>So the government has not delivered to the industry the industry's policy, either in terms of tax design or quantum.</para><para>The government's rebate provides an effective exemption for a majority of small wineries producing below the rebate limit.</para><para>For the major wineries the value of either an exemption threshold expressed in litres or a rebate expressed in dollars is insignificant to their overall tax position but they will view the concession relative to the cost of running their cellar door operations.</para><para>The value and design of the exemption or rebate is most sensitive for small and medium wineries whose production exceeds the threshold or rebate.</para><para>There are three good reasons for sticking to an exemption set as a litre threshold:</para><para>First, an exemption set as a litre threshold will not require indexation to maintain its value.</para><para>It must be remembered that the Howard government has given no commitment to index the rebate—so its value will be eroded over time.</para><para>Second, a WET free threshold set in litres allows small wineries to move their wines up in value either by improving the quality of their product or its marketing and so get more out of the exemption, which they couldn't once they reach the level of the rebate.</para><para>Third, for a given cost to revenue an exemption set in litres will give more value to small and medium sized wineries than it will give to the major wineries producing predominantly value wines.</para><para>It needs to be remembered that the exemption is primarily for small wineries.</para><para>The large wineries already receive their primary benefit—having an ad valorem tax regime.</para><para>For these reasons Labor will be sticking to its own policy of providing an exemption set at an appropriate number of litres.</para><para>However, because small wineries need WET relief now, Labor will not be opposing this bill.</para><para>We believe we can provide the wine industry with a better tax regime than this rebate.</para><para>Indeed it is not entirely clear why the Howard government has decided on a rebate.</para><para>We expect it is partly to do with wanting to differentiate itself from the Labor Party policy. </para><para>It may also be because it is simpler for the ATO to deal with a value based rebate on a value based Business Activity Statement.</para><para>Unfortunately it means that the value of the rebate will be eroded significantly over time unless it is indexed periodically.</para><para>The rebate is intended to replace current Commonwealth and State rebate arrangements for the first $1 million of wholesale value.</para><para>The Treasurer has written to the States requesting that the value of the State rebates be returned to the Commonwealth to offset part of the net cost.</para><para>The States all agreed to do this when they wrote in support of the WFA's policy that would have provided the exemption for the first 600,000 litres of production.</para><para>While that 600,000 litre exemption has not been provided and detailed arrangements for return of the State rebates below the first $1 million of wholesale value have not been agreed I assume the States will be cooperative on this issue.</para><para>The wine industry position is that the State rebates should be retained in some form to ensure that no wineries are worse off under the new arrangements.</para><para>The Howard government has given no explicit or implicit acceptance of that principle.</para><para>The States are currently working cooperatively with the industry on developing arrangements to provide rebates above the Commonwealth arrangements and the South Australian Treasury is taking the lead in that process.</para><para>It will be a complex procedure because some wineries—or related entities—have cellar door operations in more than one state so the states will want to come up with some rules for allocating their rebates.</para><para>During the Senate Economics Legislation Committee Hearing on this Bill on Monday, Treasury officials were able to clarify a number of issues. The costing of this measure in the budget papers is the net figure, after the removal of the current Commonwealth rebate arrangement.</para><para>However, it does not represent the net cost after the removal of the state rebates—which should be returned to the Commonwealth.</para><para>Late amendments to the Bill extend the rebate to producers of cider, mead, perry and sake.</para><para>The bill also contains three integrity measures:</para><para>First, the bill provides associated entity rules to prevent wineries claiming multiple rebates or a winery splitting its operation when it reaches the limit of the rebate.</para><para>This is critical to containing the cost to the revenue of a rebate or exemption arrangement.</para><para>Second, the bill closes off a loophole in the present Act that would allow a winery to avoid the WET by exporting and then re-importing wine.</para><para>There is no evidence that this has occurred and indeed in most cases given Australia's geography relative to even our nearest neighbours this would be prohibitively expensive except for small quantities of very high value wine.</para><para>The third requires all packaging costs to be included in the WET cost base.</para><para>Obviously if the wholesale value of the wine is held down by excluding the packaging costs then the value of the rebate can be artificially extended to cover more product.</para><para>Labor supports these three integrity measures.</para><para>The bill also contains a measure to remove the concession of accelerated depreciation for vineyard plantings.</para><para>This concession has existed since 1993 when it was part of an agreement between the then Labor government and the industry on future tax arrangements.</para><para>There is a view in the industry that this concession has contributed to oversupply of wine grapes and there has been some consensus about getting rid of it.</para><para>Labor supports removal of this concession.</para></quote><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>26733</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2004 BUDGET MEASURES) LEGISLATION</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>26733</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Ross (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Lightfoot)</inline>—I understand it is the wish of the Senate that Senator Stott Despoja's speech on the <inline ref="R2114">Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2004 Budget Measures) Bill 2004</inline> be incorporated.

Well if the economy is supposedly strong now, as Mr Howard keeps telling us, why are thousands of students living well below the poverty line; 70% of students are working around two days a week during the semester, existing student income support arrangements seriously inadequate; and, Government changes to the higher education sector 2005 will shift around $1.2 billion of university costs to students through increased fees over the next four years?</para><para>Why did the Prime Minister and the Treasurer also decide to spend $15 billion on tax cuts for high income earners (over 4 years) in the Budget just before ceasing funding for the Educational Textbook Subsidy Scheme, meaning textbook costs have increased by up to 10% since the first of July?</para><para>And, even worse, the Opposition who will be campaigning on health and education issues, supported those tax cuts.</para><para>I believe the Government, despite its rhetoric, fails to recognise the vital role higher education plays in providing people with the choice to pursue their dreams and make a valuable contribution to society.</para><para>The 2004 Budget, and this Bill which proposes the Budget measures, were both prime opportunities for the Government to invest in education. They have failed to take these opportunities and it will be yet another black mark against: the Howard Government's record on higher education.</para><para>Apart from providing an opportunity to talk about the Government's appalling record on student income support, this Bill actually gives us a chance to do something about it by expanding the scholarship provisions in the Bill.</para><para>As part of the changes to higher education passed last year, full fee-waiver scholarships were no longer counted as income under social security income tests, as were the new Commonwealth Learning Scholarships (CLSs).</para><para>As part of the 2004 Budget, Dr Nelson announced that he would exempt all scholarships that partly or fully waive or pay tuition fees from social security income tests. Fee-waiver scholarships are those where course fees are waived by university and Fee-pay scholarships are those where fees are paid on behalf of a student by a third party.</para><para>Schedule 1 of this Bill proposes to amend the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veteran's Affairs Act 1986 to this end, costing an estimated $2.7 million in 2004-05, increasing to $8.8 million in 2007-08.</para><para>These figures pale into comparison with the tax cuts in the Budget.</para><para>It is clear from these policy decisions that Dr Nelson understands the negative effects of supplementary income on student income support payments. By exempting the fee-waiver, fee-pay and Commonwealth Learning Scholarships from the social security income tests, he has removed any effect these scholarships may have on students income support payments.</para><para>Dr Nelson's budget media release about exempting the partial fee-waiver and fee-pay scholarships stated, “The Government wants to encourage this support for students. This initiative will ensure that ... these students will receive the full benefit of that support”. </para><para>But students will not be encouraged by seeing other students receiving a scholarship and maintaining full income support payments while their own income support is reduced by their non-Government cash scholarship and any attempt to earn more money legitimately results in further reductions in their income support.</para><para>The Democrats support the changes to the treatment of scholarships in this Bill, but believe they need to go further. The real funding burden in providing these fee-pay and fee-waiver scholarships will be borne by the universities who have to either fund these scholarships themselves or find someone willing to do so for them. Not only this, but for universities to be eligible for funding through the Higher Education Equity Programme they must, amongst other measures, offer University Equity Scholarships out of their own funds.</para><para>Many of the universities which have announced increased HECS fees for 2005, have indicated poor Federal Government funding as the main reason they had to reluctantly increase fees. Through the HECS increases however, many universities have committed to funding numerous scholarships for equity group students, over and above those provided by the Federal Government.</para><para>Why should universities be forced—through the possibility of reduced funding—to fund scholarships for students that will in turn reduce the student's reliance on Government income support payments? In effect, this is another backdoor cost-shifting exercise by Mr Howard that, like so many of his other decisions is detrimental for education.</para><para>The AVCC in their response to the Higher Education Equity Program review stated, “The AVCC is also concerned that the Government reduces students' income support payments where students receive scholarships from universities. Since the Government is to require universities to offer such scholarships from 2005, it should not be financially advantaged by universities doing so.”</para><para>The AVCC also state, “some institutions may prefer ways to provide financial support to students that extend beyond the traditional concept of scholarships.” The tight restrictions on scholarships are discouraging universities from offering scholarships for fear of not sufficiently enhancing the student's life or education.</para><para>The AVCC's recommendation on this matter was `... universities' scholarships that provide students with financial support should not be treated as income for the receipt of Government income support benefits”.</para><para>The Democrats support the AVCC's view and we will ask the Government to expand the scholarship provisions in this Bill to ease the financial strain on students receiving Austudy who are living 35% below the Henderson poverty line and are not eligible for Rent Assistance.</para><para>The Democrats have discussed this proposal with the higher education sector and have received strong support from Vice-Chancellors, students and university staff for our amendments to exempt university equity scholarships from the social security income test.</para><para>Both Backing Australia's Future and this year's Budget have failed students from poorer backgrounds. A recent report from The Age newspaper detailed the worsening equity situation over the past eight years of the Howard Government, where there has been a decline in the proportion of poorer students admitted to the `Group of Eight' universities, as well as those participating in `high-end' courses.</para><para>Earlier in the year, it was revealed that the participation rates of students from low socioeconomic status backgrounds has remained around 15% for the past decade when we know adequate student income support is one of the best ways of improving this participation rate. These figures show the failure of the Coalition's higher education policy to provide affordable and accessible higher education to all Australians. I think we are fortunate that the figures are not worse considering the Government's record.</para><para>The Prime Minister increased the age of independence and tightened the parental income test for income support, pushing students off income support. He closed the Student Financial Supplement Scheme placing an additional burden on those students who were relying on the Scheme to complete their studies. He discontinued the Educational Textbook Subsidy Scheme causing the price of textbooks to increase by up to 10%. </para><para>To make things worse, there has been no thorough examination of student income support measures for over ten years. An inquiry into these matters is both crucial and long overdue.</para><para>After several years of trying, I am proud that earlier this year I was able to initiate the first Senate inquiry to look solely at the issue of student income support. Evidence submitted to the inquiry so far raises two long standing issues—the impact of students working to support themselves while studying and the impact of those earnings on income support payments from the government.</para><para>Many students who work to support themselves at university also qualify for income support from the Government. Estimates of students' living expenses, from the University of Melbourne, show that students on Youth Allowance or Austudy cannot survive without supplementing this income, through paid employment, a loan, a scholarship or other means. However, income support payments are reduced or withdrawn completely when the student, their partner or parents earn over certain amounts of income whether that is income from university discretionary scholarships or employment. For example, students can only earn $118 per week before their Austudy or Youth Allowance is affected.</para><para>In general, scholarships are given to talented people to enable them to commit to their studies and develop their talents. While this benefits the individual, it also has a broader purpose which contributes directly to our community. So why then does the Government recognise this benefit by exempting some scholarships from the social security income tests but not all? This situation needs to be addressed urgently and this Bill offers a great opportunity to do this.</para><para>I have been working for accessible and equitable education ever since I entered Parliament and I will use the Senate inquiry into student income support measures to uncover more evidence about why the Government continued to avoid the long-standing issue of student income support, after they had clearly identified the problem and push for meaningful reform.</para><para>Unlike the Government, the Democrats have long acknowledged the importance of student income support measures in increasing the participation of students from low socioeconomic status backgrounds. Exempting university scholarships from social security income tests would help ease the burden on the many students living below the poverty line.</para><para>The Government has not been willing to increase student income support payments, so the very least they can do is allow universities to support disadvantaged students without their income support payments being reduced. The Government and the Opposition (from their preliminary indications that they will not support the Democrats' amendments) have missed a great opportunity to show their commitment to students.</para><para>Students should not have to wait until the ALP is in power for delivery on a promise of improved student income support. If the ALP decide today to support the passage of this Bill it will mean that even if they win Government, thousands of students will have to spend at least another year living below the poverty line and losing income support payments when they are granted a university equity scholarship. That is not good enough and I'm sure students won't be happy with this outcome.</para><para>I have said repeatedly that education should be based on a student's brains not their bank balance. Excluding students from education because of their socio-economic status is wrong. It is time to do something about it.</para><para>Australians looking to attend university in the coming years can not trust Dr Nelson or Mr Howard to keep fees down and bring back education that is accessible for all.

Victoria is only around 1/3 of the way to mandatory NLIS. They currently only record movements of store cattle through sale yards, prime cattle are not recorded and no inter property movements are recorded.</para><para>There is no single figure for every producer ABA has never said otherwise there are however substantial costs that will occur on an industry level not just on farm. It is imperative that producers are given all the facts to calculate their own cost and then be able to add on costs that will be incurred by the entire industry because these costs always migrate back to the last link in the chain, the producer.</para><para>The exemptions or pathways are of little comfort to producers. A substantial percentage of producers do not qualify and their long term survival is doubtful. AMIC. The National Agents Assoc and the southern states have stated they do not support them and the chairman of QNIC, Peter Milne has a direct conflict of interest as he is on the board of Animal Health Australia. AHA's performance standards that underpin NLIS state that “there will be a transition period during which the capacity of each jurisdiction is less than absolute. This transition stage will not end until the requirement for all livestock to be tagged.” This gives us little confidence in the pathways system and I believe it is a smoke screen to lull producers into a false sense of security. </para><para>To refute CCA's claims</para></quote><para>1.	Weight loss due to extra handling—fact. They state “NLIS devices only need to be fitted as cattle leave the property.” You have to restrain an animal in a head bail to tag it and any producer knows that you cannot restrain a prime animal in a head bail immediately prior to slaughter. The bruising and dark cutting costs on each carcass would alone blow $37 out of the water. The same goes for store stock if you tried to load cattle up a race immediately after tagging them up a race it would be a very difficult task to load them onto a truck. This has been proven by a producer at Clermont who tagged weaners immediately prior to leaving, they had so much trouble loading that the truck driver walked of the job. This lady rang John Roberts of QDPI and was given an earful for her trouble and told anyone knows you should tag at branding. To say that ear tagging of cattle will not require any more time in the yard is fantasy. They also claim “NLIS tags will replace an existing application of tail tags- you only have to look as far as Victoria to see that they are still having to tail tag as well as NLIS tag. If producers did not tail tag cattle would need to be read twice in the sale yard and as one agent stated if two mobs got mistakenly boxed it would require the cattle to be read, the file taken to a computer, access the database to line up the 16 digit numbers with a PIC and then get the cattle back into a race read them one at a time and look down the list to see which pen they belong in. The other point that belongs with weight loss is that in a sale yard like Roma on a big sale day it takes them until 3am just to pen the cattle if all of those cattle had to be read into the yard as well it would take much longer leading to weight loss and dollars.</para><para>2.	Government enforcement and administration. NLIS is regulation and like any regulation will need to be enforced. There is already a large culture of “avoidance” within the EU market. Avoidance of regulation in England turned into one of the larger accelerants in the spread of FMD. Over regulating producers movement of livestock will lead to people taking steps to avoid the cost and could potentially decrease traceability as producers are forced to “cover their tracks”. The expensive enforcement will not be government but market enforcement. For a start there will be the orange tags. Any beast that has a tag applied whilst not on its property of birth must be tagged with an orange tag. Processors have already stated there will be a discount for orange tags for if they were allowed to put meat from orange tagged cattle into the same box as that of white tagged cattle it would make the entire system a farce. This is potentially more than half the cattle in Queensland that are up for a discount and the uncertainty created will discount these cattle at a store level as well. If you were faced with the choice of buying an orange tagged or white tagged beast which one would you buy? There will be discounts for non-compliance if I don't tag three bullocks in this consignment and they are not discounted why would I tag the three that lose tags before I send the next load.</para><para>3.	Reading charges. Only the CCA seem to believe that agents should work for free. To say that the agents should buy equipment and spend substantial time and labour for no charge is ridiculous. These are real costs and in the long term will passed back by not only agents and sale yards but by meat works as well.</para><para>4.	It does cost labour and time to tag, read cattle and transfer data. For a large percentage of producers that own more than one property this will not only need to happen at sale time but also throughout that animal's life as it moves from property to property. At present due to the unreliability of the equipment and the inconsistencies occurring on the database this time factor is incalculable. I spoke to an agent in NSW who had just spent 3/4 hour trying to transfer three bulls. Producers like agents must calculate their time and labour as a cost.</para><para>5.	Tag and tag replacement. Refer to point one livestock cannot be tagged immediately prior to sale so if we are meant to tag at branding as stated by John Roberts then that would be at least 10% of tags lost on an average slaughter age of 5 years even if industry standards are met. One tag manufacturer has quoted the life expectancy of tags to be 6 years. The cost of tags has been steadily rising we have had two price increases since Victoria became mandatory and if Governments were to subsidize tags I believe this would be exacerbated. Government mandating one product should require some price fixing of that product to stop anti-competitive behaviour. </para><para>6.	Management tags. NLIS is difficult to use because it is not visual. There are several occasions on which I have had to refer to our cattle's visual ID when we have had trucks ready to load and the reading equipment failed. Any cattle in a sale yard situation will require some sort of visual identifier to stop occurrences like that in point 1.</para><para>7.	NLIS database costs. The girls at the database currently field a large volume of calls for help with a small portion of producers performing transfers (only EU producers.) Remember no-one in Victoria currently records property to property movements. This staffing requirement will rise dramatically and at least CCA were honest enough in their last sentence to allude to the fact that there will probably be a charge on the database after national rollout.</para><para>8.	Yard modifications and scanners. You not only need to read cattle on property (80% of the producers we spoke to in Qld will need to read cattle on property due to owning more than one property sending cattle on agistment or selling cattle privately) but you also need to tag cattle. We own three substantial cattle properties and we needed to upgrade two sets of yards to cope with tagging all cattle as they exit and our new yards would require modification to enable a panel reader to work. Many small producers do not even have head bails there will be substantial set up costs for them and many large cattle stations have portable yards that are also not designed for tagging large mobs of cattle. Even those with existing setups must count the cost of additional wear on head bails caused by restraining grown cattle.</para><quote><para>The costs are substantial and until Victoria begins a trial of NLIS there will be no estimate that can be close to the truth.</para><para>At the end of the day a cost whatever the size must be justifiable. Who benefits from this cost?</para><para>Traceability of livestock? Ask Sandy McConnochie president of ALFA and Elders how effective NLIS was in tracing the NLIS identified cattle he bought that were stolen from a Victorian sale yard.</para><para>Traceability for Consumers? No consumer will see benefit from increased traceability because the traceability ends the moment the hide is removed and the carcass moves to the boning room. Meat works have made no commitment to identify meat from individual carcasses.</para><para>There can be no recovery of cost from consumers because they gain nothing.</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">MLA</inline><inline font-weight="bold">—</inline><inline font-weight="bold">WHOSE INTERESTS DO YOU HAVE AT HEART?</inline></para><quote><para>The attempts by the MLA and some multinational processors to force a new LPA system onto beef producers need to be closely examined.</para><para>As a producer of disease and chemical free cattle, I was incensed that a U.S owned processor attempted to discount stock I offered for sale at Roma on July 15th under the 9th edition NVD. A bull in the pen of cattle I had for sale was originally knocked down to the multinational at 165 cents per kilo but the buyer then questioned whether the cattle were covered by a new NVD/LPA document. The agent advised the cattle were being offered under the rules of the sale—i.e. unless otherwise stated cattle are covered by an NVD 9th edition. The multinational's buyer then twice advised to the auctioneer that `We can't handle these cattle' and effectively called for the bull to be resubmitted for auction. The same buyer then proceeded to bid again for the bull and purchased it at 150 cents per kilo, a discount of 15 cents! The multinational also bought three of my bullocks from the pen covered by the 9th edition NVD at 165 cents a kilo.</para><para>PRODUCERS, PLEASE DO NOT RUSH OUT AND SIGN UP MINDLESSLY FOR FEAR OF BEING SIMILARLY PENALISED. </para><para>After much deliberation and fact searching I chose to not sell under the new paperwork because it represents compulsory introduction of a quality assurance system which will force unnecessary costs and unrealistic requirements onto producers without altering the health and safety of our product one iota. I firmly believe, and so do many buyers from independently Australian owned companies, that the 9th edition NVD provides all the necessary and comprehensive information for any and every purchaser regarding the health and history of my livestock at point of sale. (The balance of my stock at the Roma sale on 15th July was purchased for excellent prices by these buyers, at no risk to their customers.)</para><para>It is time to carefully consider what is happening in our industry. Why are the MLA and some processors trying to forcibly introduce this system?</para><para>THE STATED JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS MULTINATIONAL ACTION WAS, AS I UNDERSTAND IT, TO APPEASE THE “FOOD SAFETY” DEMANDS OF ANOTHER US MULTINATIONAL, NAMELY MCDONALDS. A CLAIM, WHICH I UNDERSTAND, CANNOT BE SUBSTANTIATED.</para><para>If our producer funded MLA was accountable and responsive to the interests of their shareholders, the MLA would champion that fact that Aussie beef produced under the 9th edition is the safest product traded globally and safer than the product produced in the US. Instead the MLA is behaving like a puppet for the multinational arm twisters. Our industry needs rational leadership, not “bouncers” for the LPA scheme.</para><para>The annual paperwork from the MLA for voting registrations is currently appearing in the mail. Now is the time to take action—if you are not already registered with the MLA, register! Secure your proper voting entitlements (two and a half votes per beast sold). Ensure that you vote to help force the MLA to represent us, the Australian Beef Producers who fund the MLA, and not the interest of multinational companies whose agenda is forcing these unnecessary requirements upon us!</para><para>Stick with the 9th edition NVD when selling cattle. Support and encourage the processors and producers who are making a stand against the multinationals. Do not be bullied and intimidated, and if you are assured by your selling agent or any other person that the new paperwork is “no problem—it's inevitable—just fill it in!” PLEASE READ THE TERMS AND CON-DITIONS ATTACHED TO THE NEW PAPERWORK. MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION FOR YOURSELF!</para><para>Leigh Griffin</para><para>“Kewpie”</para><para>Yuleba 4427</para></quote></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (WINE

This means that the Norfolk Island Government has primary responsibility for developing and managing programmes to address domestic violence concerns within the Norfolk Island community. </para><para>Despite this, and as with the States and the other Self-Governing Territories, the Australian Government has a “national interest” in domestic violence issues. It is committed to preventing, reducing and responding to domestic and family violence and sexual assault through Partnerships Against Domestic Violence and the National Initiative to Combat Sexual Assault. These initiatives focus on gathering knowledge and finding better ways of preventing and addressing violence against women. </para><para>The Australian Government has recently launched its national campaign for the elimination of violence against women. The campaign provides practical help 24 hours a day for those experiencing violence, or who are at risk of violence, and advice and information for anyone concerned with this important issue. The Office of the Status of Women has taken action to ensure that the Norfolk Island community is able to access information and advice as part of that campaign. </para><para>Should anyone on Norfolk Island need legal aid services for domestic-violence related problems, funds are available. </para><para>(b) Any statistical information concerning reported violence against women on Norfolk Island would be held by the Norfolk Island Government. Such information would be based on reports from the Australian Federal Police (AFP), which provides policing services on Norfolk Island under a contract agreement between the AFP and the Norfolk Island Government. </para><para>(2)	(a) The September 1995 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Norfolk Island and Australian Governments concerning the provision of legal aid provides that the Legal Aid Revenue Fund may accumulate up to $250,000. If it contains more than this amount at the beginning of a financial year, either party may waive its payment obligations. By 1 July 2000, the Fund was in excess of $250,000.  </para><para>In 2000-2001 the Australian Government's contribution to the Legal Aid Revenue Fund was $15,000. In 2001-2002 the Department made an additional payment of $75,000 (Clause 9 of the MOU allows either party to make a unilateral payment at any time). This was intended to cover any demand for legal aid services as a result of possible criminal proceedings related to the murder of Janelle Patton in March 2002.</para><para>The balance of the Legal Aid Revenue Fund as at 31 December 2003 was $430,838. (The unaudited balance as at 30 June 2004 was $440,316.)</para><para>(b) Because of the level of accumulated funds (and as allowed under the MOU), the Department made no contribution in 2003-04 and has not allocated funding for 2004-05. Funding for 2005-06 will be dependent on the outcome of the current review of the Norfolk Island Legal Aid Scheme. Of course, if there is an urgent need for additional legal aid services and that need cannot be met from available funds, the Department can seek approval for a “one-off” payment.</para><para>(3)	In February 2000 the Australian and Norfolk Island Governments agreed to review the operation of the Legal Aid Scheme in response to low usage numbers. The Chief Executive Officer of the ACT Legal Aid Commission, Mr Chris Staniforth, was commissioned to undertake the review. </para><para>Under the agreed terms of reference, the review was required to look at the appropriateness and effectiveness of the current arrangements, including administrative and operational procedures and requirements (such as the eligibility guidelines and criteria), the funding formula, reporting mechanisms, whether the MOU should be amended and so on. There was also a requirement to consider whether the scope of the legal aid scheme (and access to funding) should be expanded to include practical measures such as community education programmes, alternative dispute resolution methods (arbitration/mediation) etc.</para><para>The August 2000 review report was forwarded to the Norfolk Island Government in September 2000 for comment. In its 28 October 2003 response, the Norfolk Island Government emphasised that Norfolk Island “must be in control of the provision of legal aid and associated legal education to the people residing there”. </para><para>(4)	Although not publicly available, the August 2000 review and the original October 1994 report on the options for developing a legal aid scheme were provided to the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories in July 2002. This was to inform its review of the Australian Government's involvement in Norfolk Island's Legal Aid Scheme. Copies of both reports have been provided to Senator O'Brien and are available from the Table Office.</para><para>(5)	(a) The Staniforth Review pointed to “a deeply worrying lack of application [of the Legal Aid Scheme] to persons suffering family violence”. The review makes a number of recommendations designed to make the Scheme more accessible and to expand the services which may be funded by the Scheme (such as for community legal education, the introduction of a duty lawyer scheme to give priority to, among others, “persons seeking urgent relief in domestic violence situations”, access to an off-Island telephone service and so on). </para><para>(b) The Norfolk Island Government has provided its comments on the review's recommendations and drafted a revised MOU and amendments to the Legal Aid 1995 (NI) as part of the consultation process. The Australian Government's response to the review will take into account the Norfolk Island Government's proposed approach, Australian Government policy in relation to access to legal aid (itself under review) and the recommendations of the June 2004 report on legal aid by the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. The Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories has also commented on the provision of legal aid services to Norfolk Island in the context of its July 2004 review of the Department's Annual Report.  </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Foreign Affairs: Sudan</title><page.no>26764</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2952)</subtitle><id.no>2952</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>26764</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 3 June:</para></talk.start><quote><para>With reference to the bloodshed in Darfur, Sudan:</para></quote><para>(1)	What action has or will the Government take through the United Nations (UN) or otherwise to stop the violence.</para><para>(2)	Will the Government support UN military intervention or a UN authorised no-fly zone to at least halt the bombardment of Darfur civilians, for example, from the French airbases in adjacent Chad.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>26764</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The following answer has been provided by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>During Question Time on 17 June 2004, Senator Hill took on notice a similar question to this one.

In some individuals, though, complications can arise and increased death rates are seen in neonates and immunocompromised people.2,3</para><para>Some studies identify predisposing factors for severe chickenpox infection as use of intermittent or long-term steroid treatment, women who are pregnant or postpartum, children with cancer or bone marrow transplants, HIV infection or other immune-suppression.3,4</para><para>(b)	One study published in 1997 from Japan4 indicated that since vaccine licensure for healthy children in 1989, chickenpox vaccine has shifted the age distribution of chickenpox cases from children into adulthood, with an increase in the social costs to society. This study was referenced in a later edition of the <inline font-style="italic">New England Journal of Medicine</inline>.5 Whilst chickenpox vaccine was first licensed in Japan, vaccine coverage in the population has been quite limited.4 </para><para>(c)	Current data from countries with chickenpox vaccination programs have shown no evidence that chickenpox vaccination programs increase childhood shingles rates. However, full evaluation of these programs is continuing. Most cases of shingles are in individuals over 50 years of age.6</para><para>(d)	The website address to which you refer indicates the uses for the antibiotic product neomycin, which is manufactured by Merck, Sharpe and Dohme. Neomycin is given to people who have specific bacterial infections, and should only be given by mouth (oral) or onto the skin (topical), depending on the product's formulation. </para><para>Vaccine manufacturers use trace amounts of neomycin in varicella vaccines to prevent bacterial contamination of the product as it is being manufactured. The GlaxoSmithKline product, Varilrix, contains 25 g of neomycin per dose of vaccine, while the CSL sponsored product, Varivax Refrigerated, contains only a trace amount of neomycin (less than 5 g). </para><para>There have been many clinical trials conducted on both varicella vaccine products available in Australia. All clinical trials have concluded that both vaccines are safe, and effective against chickenpox.</para><para>(2)	On the advice of the Chief Medical Officer for Australia, Professor John Horvath, the Minister for Health and Ageing has asked the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) to review the most recent evidence about chickenpox vaccine, and to update its advice about the benefits and costs of introducing the vaccine into the National Immunisation Program.</para><para>The Minister for Health and Ageing has been advised that at its July meeting ATAGI formulated a process for reviewing the evidence, and is expected to provide advice to the Minister late in 2004 or early in 2005.</para><para>1	Meyer PA, Seward JF, Jumaan AO, Wharton M.
