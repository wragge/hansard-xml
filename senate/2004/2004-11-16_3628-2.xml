With renewed energy and purpose, the government rededicates itself to the great ideals of the Australian nation and to the service of the Australian people.</para><para>The government was re-elected on a platform that emphasised strong economic management, a determined role in world affairs, and faith in the capacity of Australians to exercise choice in their daily lives.</para><para>The government will take early steps to implement the policy commitments it made during the election campaign—commitments that reflect a fundamentally optimistic view of the character of the Australian people and of this nation's capacity to seize the opportunities and meet the challenges of the future. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Maintaining a strong economy</inline></para><para>The government has an ambitious fourth term agenda based on its overriding commitment to ensuring the Australian economy remains strong, productivity growth remains high, and future prosperity is spread throughout the community.</para><para>Australia has one of the strongest performing economies in the world. This is no accident. The government's economic reforms have contributed to significant increases in productivity. As a result, Australians have enjoyed solid growth, more jobs, falling unemployment, real wage increases, low inflation and interest rates and increasing wealth and incomes.</para><para>Careful management of the Australian economy over recent years has increased its resilience. But we are not immune to world events. Sustained higher oil prices will have consequences of uncertain severity, and terrorism remains an ever-present risk.</para><para>At home, continuing low rainfall is a concern for many parts of both rural and metropolitan Australia.</para><para>The ageing of Australia's population means increasing pressure on the health and welfare sectors. The government has said that action to prepare for some of these costs must occur now. The government is committed to establishing a dedicated financial asset, the Future Fund, with the aim of fully funding Commonwealth superannuation liabilities by 2020. The Fund will also increase national savings, and enhance the net worth of the public sector.</para><para>Increasing productivity and workforce participation are keys to our future economic success and to meeting the challenge of demographic change. The government is committed to the task of improving the efficiency and competitiveness of the Australian economy and to lifting workforce engagement.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Getting more people into work</inline></para><para>Unemployment is at a 27 year low and a record number of Australians are in work. However, too many people of working age remain on welfare. The government aims to break the tragic cycle of welfare dependency for these income support recipients, and lift labour force participation and employment rates through an appropriate balance of obligations, incentives and assistance. It aims to give all Australians the opportunity to participate in our prosperity. And the best means of tackling poverty is to help Australians find a job.</para><para>Through the Mature Age Worker Tax Offset, the government will make it more financially attractive for older Australians to remain in employment on a full-time, part-time or casual basis. The government will also work with industry to counter the misplaced prejudices against the employment of mature age workers.</para><para>The government is committed to encouraging hard work and self-reliance by reducing tax as fiscal circumstances permit, providing incentives for small business and helping families with the cost of raising children. Under the government's announced tax cuts, 80 per cent of taxpayers will face a marginal tax rate of no more than 30 per cent.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Labour market reforms</inline></para><para>In its fourth term, the government will accelerate the reform of workplace relations as a means of raising productivity and Australian living standards. A strategic package of measures will be pursued in this Parliament to promote that objective.</para><para>Particular attention will be paid to ensuring that small businesses, the engine-room of our economic success, are encouraged by greater workplace flexibility to employ more staff. Legislation will also be introduced to give formal recognition and protection to independent contractors.  </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Education and skills development</inline></para><para>The links between educational achievement and robust economic growth have never been more apparent. Meeting the skills needs of our economy will drive our national prosperity and help deliver a better quality of life for all Australians.</para><para>In this term, the government will boost training in areas of existing and looming skill shortages through an integrated package of measures designed to encourage more young people to take up trades. This will provide more pathways for students to enter traditional trades while in school, as well as improving the rewards for going into an apprenticeship and removing barriers that prevent people from beginning or continuing with an apprenticeship. No young Australian should feel less valued for choosing an apprenticeship over university.</para><para>A key driver of these measures will be the establishment of 24 Australian Technical Colleges, catering for Years 11 and 12 students, which will provide students with industry-endorsed training to equip them for a career in the traditional trades. </para><para>Over the coming term the government will continue its commitment to parental choice in education. Working with parents, the government will invest directly in school infrastructure through an additional $1 billion commitment over the next four years. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Building an enterprise culture</inline></para><para>The government is committed to fostering a spirit of enterprise in Australia. To help build this enterprise culture, the government will introduce an Entrepreneurs Tax Discount for small enterprises. It will also establish a new Regulation Reduction Incentive Fund specifically designed to reduce the regulatory burden on home-based businesses.</para><para>It will further remove legislative burdens on small business and improve access to resources so small businesses in Australia can continue to innovate and grow. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Modernising industry regulation and infrastructure</inline></para><para>Better planning and increased investment in national transport infrastructure is critical to the long-term economic performance of Australia. The $12.5 billion land transport plan, AusLink, will be implemented. </para><para>The transport security net will be extended. Jointly with the states and territories, a new intergovernmental agreement on land transport security will be established and the national transport security regime extended to cover dangerous goods and mass urban transit.</para><para>The government maintains its commitment to reform Australia's media ownership laws. New arrangements will provide enhanced diversity and increased investment, enabling Australians to have greater access to high quality media services. The government is also committed to ensuring that its regulatory framework for communications and broadcasting remains responsive to the challenges brought about by new technologies.</para><para>The government will pursue its longstanding policy for the full privatisation of Telstra. Its future sale will be contingent on adequate telecommunications service levels and appropriate market conditions.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Comprehensive trade policy agenda</inline></para><para>With expectations of strong global demand in 2004-2005, prospects are bright for Australian exporters. </para><para>The government is committed to the multilateral trading system and driving forward the Doha Round of trade negotiations, which promises enormous gains for Australia. </para><para>At the same time, the government will continue to pursue other opportunities for trade liberalisation, including through free trade agreements. Ensuring timely entry into force of the Australia-US free trade agreement is of the highest priority, as is implementation of the Thai-Australia Free Trade Agreement. The government will also continue to consider possible FTAs with China, Malaysia and ASEAN, the latter in conjunction with New Zealand. </para><para>To further assist and support Australia's export trade activities, the government will invest an additional $30 million over three years in the Export Market Development Grants Program. It will also appoint 30 new export facilitators to maximise Australian export opportunities in the United States market and reinforce the government's extensive support for Australian exporters by creating `export hubs' in regional Australia through co-location of the services of Austrade and AusIndustry.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">National security and Australia's place in the world</inline></para><para>There is no more important responsibility of government than the security of Australia and Australians.</para><para>Australia continues to face a challenging international and regional security environment. The government will maintain a strong stand against international terrorism and the threat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. It will also respond to the adverse impact that failing states have on our national security. While vigilance is needed in current circumstances, Australians should not feel threatened, nor be deterred from leading normal lives, enjoying the freedom for which others before us have so bravely fought.</para><para>To take account of new security threats, the government will bring forward legislation that will facilitate expeditious access to stored communications, such as email messages, establish a comprehensive surveillance devices regime for the investigation of serious Commonwealth offences, and protect sensitive national security information in criminal proceedings.</para><para>In addition, the government will continue working closely with states and territories to maintain our world class counter-terrorism capability. Business will be a key partner in advancing arrangements for the protection of the nation's critical infrastructure and ensuring smooth implementation of new anti-money laundering laws.</para><para>I acknowledge the enduring commitment and unflinching courage of the service personnel who protect Australia's interests.</para><para>The government will provide the Australian Defence Force with the major new equipment it needs to carry out its vital role of defending Australians at home and Australian interests abroad.</para><para>The ADF will be provided with new Abrams tanks, additional troop lift helicopters, new Tiger Armed Reconnaissance Helicopters and a new fleet of Armidale Class Patrol Boats.</para><para>New contracts worth up to $8 billion will be signed for the construction of Air Warfare Destroyers and Amphibious Ships and the government will maximise Australian industry involvement in all major defence projects.</para><para>To further strengthen our ability to protect key infrastructure, the government will permanently base two new Patrol Boats at either Port Hedland or Dampier to protect the vital assets in Australia's north west.</para><para>Over the next decade, the government will provide $50 billion of funding to further develop and sustain an ADF capable of deterring threats to Australia and deploying at short notice in support of our national interests. To this end, the government will maintain our forces in Iraq, East Timor and the Solomon Islands until their jobs are done. </para><para>Sustaining Australia's high standing and strong alliance with the United States is a key priority. The alliance reflects the strength of our historical relationship and our shared values. </para><para>Strong relations with the countries of Asia are vital to Australia's security and prosperity. The government is committed to deepening ties with North Asia—building on mature links with Japan, expanding ties with China and continuing support for peaceful outcomes on the Korean Peninsula.</para><para>The government will work to strengthen our cooperation with the new administration in Indonesia, including our vital partnership on counter-terrorism. The government will further build relations across South-East Asia through a range of initiatives. The government is committed to expanding Australia's relationship with India and strengthening ties with the other countries of South Asia.</para><para>The Australian government places a high priority on strengthening cooperation with our regional neighbours and offering assistance in capacity building in the fight against terrorism. To this end, the government will establish six new Australian Federal Police counter-terrorist teams to work with regional neighbours to enhance surveillance and investigative capability and for rapid deployment to disrupt terrorist networks. A Centre for Counter-Terrorism Cooperation and Joint Intelligence Training for Australia, South East Asia and the Pacific will also be established.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Supporting families, carers and women</inline></para><para>Policies that provide Australian families with opportunities and choices are the hallmark of this government. </para><para>The government will introduce a 30 per cent child care tax rebate to reduce the out of pocket costs paid by parents and increase by $300 a year the rate of Family Tax Benefit Part B.</para><para>The government is delivering on its election commitment to provide grandparents who are primary carers for their grandchildren with better access to affordable child care. Effective from 1 November, the work, training and study test for access to Child Care Benefit has been waived for eligible grandparent carers and new legislation will provide additional support in recognition of the important role these Australians play in our society.</para><para>The government will continue to work with parents and local communities to develop the potential of our youngest Australians through early childhood development. </para><para>It will also build on its strong record of support for people caring for others by implementing initiatives to provide more flexibility to combine caring with work, training or study and to help parents of adult children with a disability plan for the future.</para><para>The government is committed to providing opportunity and choice for Australian women and will continue to build on its strong record in promoting women's employment and participation in the work force.</para><para>The government will implement major changes to Australia's family law system, focusing on resolving disputes outside the courts through a network of Family Relationship Centres. The government also proposes changes to the Family Law Act 1975 to put much more focus on sharing parental responsibility after separation. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Choice and peace of mind in health care</inline></para><para>The government is committed to giving all Australians peace of mind and real choice in health care. It will continue to strengthen Medicare, the nation's world-class health system. GP services will be more affordable for all Australians through legislation to increase the GP rebate from 85 per cent to 100 per cent of the Medicare fee for all consultations. The government is also fully committed to maintaining the Medicare safety net. In addition, Australians will receive greater access to mental health care, particularly to address the burden of depression.</para><para>The government will make private health insurance even more affordable for older Australians—increasing the private health insurance rebate from 30 per cent to 35 per cent for people aged from 65 to 69 years and to 40 per cent for people older than 70 years. Lifetime Health Cover arrangements will continue to keep private health insurance attractive to younger people.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Human services </inline></para><para>The government is determined to improve the development and delivery of government services to the Australian public. A new Department of Human Services will bring together into one department six key Commonwealth agencies. It will ensure better governance, clearer accountability and coordinated implementation of government policy.</para><para>The Department will also advise the government on the most efficient and effective way to deliver new and existing payments to Australian families and individuals. It will focus on the provision of better services in a timely and sympathetic fashion.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Regional Australia</inline></para><para>The government will press on with providing better services in regional Australia. It will establish two additional sustainable regions for special government assistance, and will provide banking services at an extra 266 licensed post offices.</para><para>The government will provide increased support to cultural activity in regional and remote Australia as a means of strengthening community cohesion, well-being and development. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Indigenous affairs </inline></para><para>In these sittings, legislation will be reintroduced to further reform the delivery of indigenous programmes and services. Indigenous Australians are relying on a better relationship with all governments to improve their circumstances. The issues they face are some of the most important for our nation. </para><para>The government is determined that its approach, focusing on shared responsibility arrangements negotiated with indigenous communities at the local level, will lead to better outcomes for indigenous Australians. The government will ensure that the Australian Public Service works closely with the new National Indigenous Council to focus on practical issues—addressing family violence, reducing substance abuse, increasing opportunities for education and employment and improving health.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Veterans</inline></para><para>Australia has a proud military heritage and members of the ADF continue to serve with distinction across the globe. </para><para>2005 will be a time to look back at the contribution of more than 420,000 Australians who served in World War I and some one million in World War II. The government will mark the 90th anniversary of the first landings at Gallipoli and the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II with special tributes. The sacrifices of those who went before will be recognised with pride and gratitude.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Environment </inline></para><para>Water is the most important conservation issue facing Australia. The Prime Minister has written to the Premiers and Chief Ministers urging them to join with the Australian government in implementing the National Water Initiative as they agreed at the June 2004 COAG meeting. </para><para>The National Water Commission will be established as an independent statutory authority in the Prime Minister's portfolio to advise on reform progress under the National Water Initiative and on projects, supported by the $2 billion Australian Water Fund. The Fund will contribute to major projects for more innovative use and re-use of our water, better understanding and accounting of our water resources, and wiser stewardship of our water by communities around the country.</para><para>Sustainable development requires a careful balance between environmental goals and meeting the needs of local communities. The government will uphold environmental values by protecting an additional 170,000 hectares of old growth forest in Tasmania—but it will also preserve timber workers' jobs and support the communities that depend on them.</para><para>The government is committed to developing a robust and comprehensive global response to climate change. Australia is on track to meet its Kyoto emission reduction target and new initiatives, such as the creation of the low emissions technology fund and solar cities trials, will position Australia for the challenges ahead.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Conclusion</inline></para><para>The government begins its fourth term mindful of its responsibility to use its new mandate wisely—to further advance Australia's prosperity and security, to govern in the interests of all Australians, and to uphold those values that bind us together. </para><para>The government is determined to fulfil the trust placed in it by the Australian people. It will do so by implementing a wide-ranging set of policy commitments which, in turn, places trust in the common sense and good judgement of the Australian people. </para><para>Our nation is a leading example of democratic freedom, institutional stability and economic well-being. May I conclude by expressing my appreciation of the degree to which this is due in no small measure to the integrity, hard work and fair thinking of our parliamentary representatives.

That review found that ensuring that pilots and trainee pilots are subject to security checking will reduce the likelihood of persons who might pose a threat to aviation gaining access to aircraft through legitimate means, such as undergoing training and progressing through other licensing requirements. Background checking of pilots is therefore an essential part of Australia's response to the terrorist threat. While many pilots are already background checked as part of the Australian Security Identification Card (ASIC) process, currently there are legislative impediments to the background checking of those pilots who are not required to hold ASICs, most notably in the Civil Aviation Act. These impediments need to be removed to allow background checking to go ahead.</para><para>In addition, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) has been moving towards the development of a new pilot licensing system which is due to commence on 1 April 2005. It is appropriate to synthesise the commencement of the system of full background checking for pilots with the commencement of the new licensing system being developed by CASA.</para><para>The transitional provision in Item 3 of Schedule 2 of the bill ensures that advice provided by ASIO for the purposes of the Air Navigation (Aviation Security Status Checking) Regulations 2004 will be taken to be security assessments under the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979. Given that the Regulations commenced on 9 July 2004, it is important that this bill is passed to address the flaw in the Regulations from the earliest time possible.</para><para>Schedule 2 of the bill also enables airport, ASIC and international cargo security programmes approved under the old Air Navigation Act 1920 to continue for a transitional period as transport security programmes under the new Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 when those parts of the old Act dealing with aviation security are repealed on 10 March 2005.</para><para>If the bill is not dealt with in the Spring Sittings, there is a significant chance that the legislation will not be in place by 1 April 2005. This will cause considerable inconvenience for pilots and may lead to significant cost implications for CASA. In addition, it will mean that the security outcome which is sought, namely that all pilots be subject to background checking, is delayed, therefore increasing the level of risk.</para><para>(Circulated by authority of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services)</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">CLASSIFICATION (PUBLICATIONS, FILMS AND COMPUTER GAMES) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2)</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Purpose of the Bill</inline><inline font-weight="bold"></inline></para><quote><para>The bill amends the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 to remove any doubt as to the validity of classification decisions made in response to deficient or defective applications by enforcement agencies and authorities in the past and the future.</para><para>This bill is pre-emptive and designed to ensure there is no scope for important prosecutions, including prosecutions for `child pornography' related offences such as those currently being pursued as part of `Operation Auxin' to fail on technical grounds related to the requirements for applications for classification.

The Act will continue to prohibit the “live” or “real-time” interception of communications without a warrant.

Practically all the Asian countries, including participants from Mauritius, were represented, together with principal speakers from the OECD and the United States of America.</para></talk.start><para>One of the most pressing problems facing Asia is the dramatic change in population from status of high birth and death rates to low rates. Populations are therefore ageing. The impact of this demographic change will be felt far into the future. The United Nations has reported that one out of every 10 persons is now 60 years or older. But by 2050 one out of every five persons will be 60 years or older. With ever greater improvements in medical science, human longevity has also risen. Over the last half of the 20th century, 20 years have been added to the average lifespan, bringing global life expectancy up to 66 years. </para><para>Japan has the oldest aged society in the world. The difference between Japan and the rest of the world is that the Japanese have been great savers. The Japanese place greater preference on protecting their household assets than on increasing returns. These significant assets will supplement shortfalls in pension coverage. All Japanese adults are compulsory members of a national pension, and payout generally begins at age 65. </para><para>Singapore, on the other hand, has one of the fastest ageing populations in Asia. The increase in life expectancy and improved quality of life is not unwelcome. However, as it is a relatively new phenomenon, there may be implications that are not yet fully appreciated. Financial service providers, consumers and governments will have to prepare for the reality of an ageing population. As well as an ageing population, other demographic changes include smaller families, a move towards individualisation and increased wealth. Increased affluence leads to higher retirement lifestyle expectations.</para><para>The changing market will present both risks and new opportunities for the financial services sector. While there will be benefits for this sector, there will be challenges in managing the risks to consumers and the industry itself while at the same time producing and selling innovative retirement products. Consumers will also need to adapt and be better equipped to make informed decisions about their retirement.</para><para>There are a number of issues, as highlighted during the conference, that now need to be acknowledged and addressed. These issues include the inadequacy of retirement planning; the need for younger folk to be more self-reliant; exposure to investment risk; consumer education; and security of funds under investment. The issue of inadequacy of retirement planning is one which faces consumers of all ages. Most people put this off and do not allow themselves adequate time. However, if the younger people do not plan early, they will find they end up with a level of retirement income far below their expectations.</para><para>Another issue is consumers not having enough for their retirement and being unaware of the increased exposure to investment risk and the probability of living longer. Younger consumers will need to adjust their savings behaviour as they will have to be more self-reliant than the previous generation and will have to provide for their own retirement. Also, an area of concern is that consumers do not understand their investment choices. The complexity and expanding range of products does not help the situation. Both products and taxation implications need to be simplified.</para><para>In the past larger families provided parents with their retirement security. Nowadays, whether by government duress through one-child policies, such as exist in China, or changing world patterns and greater work force mobility, couples are having fewer children. Countries such as China will grow old before they grow rich and this will have a profound impact on their future.</para><para>Nations are focusing more closely on demographics and the ageing of the baby boomer population. They must act to provide and strengthen private pension plans to meet these challenges. Countries in Asia, the Western Hemisphere, Europe and to some extent Africa are starting to move away from pay-as-you-go government social safety nets that have threatened to bankrupt them. Globally the issues on pensions are similar. PAYG pensions funded by the government are no longer affordable. In some countries pensions given to civil servants are far too generous. In relation to occupational pension plans, many are unfunded or underfunded, and defined benefit arrangements are under financial pressure. The low retirement age in many countries places additional financial pressures on government. There is often no portability of vested rights. As for personal pensions, there is a lack of tax incentives and they are not affordable for large segments of the population in many countries. </para><para>One of the main goals of a pension system should be poverty relief to ensure a minimum standard of living in old age. It should also be a savings vehicle which will allow people to redistribute income across their lifetime. A pension system should also provide insurance in the form of a social safety net. It should provide a stimulus for economic growth. Worldwide government reforms are under way. Italy and Sweden have enacted pension reform by way of defined contribution schemes and Chile is also considering this type of scheme. A pensions bill has been enacted in the United Kingdom which envisages a new regulator. India's new government is continuing with reforms introduced by its predecessor in the form of a new independent pension regulatory body. Mexico and Lithuania are also introducing pension reforms. The European Union has an occupational pension directive which aims for a single market of $2.5 billion of pension assets in 2005.</para><para>Hong Kong's MPF and Singapore's Central Provident Fund are amongst the world's most successful. Singaporean employers and employees make compulsory contributions and tax deductions are available in respect of such contributions. Interest is pegged to the short-term interest rate in the market and on reaching the age of 55 savings can be withdrawn tax-free. However there are criticisms of the scheme, such as that it has become rather complex and that many members have inadequate savings for retirement. There are also insufficient tax incentives for supplementary savings. Another criticism is that too much was invested in property. While the problems surrounding pension systems around the world are similar, there cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach for all countries and all circumstances. What works in Hong Kong may not work in India, Chile or Sweden. There will continue to be a diversity of pension arrangements due to differing cultures, differing demographics, differing economies and the myriad of other differences between countries. I wish them well in their endeavours for reform.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>O'Byrne, Ms Michelle</title><page.no>40</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>40</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In the adjournment debate in the Senate on the first sitting day of the 41st Parliament I want to briefly acknowledge the service of my good friend and former parliamentary colleague Michelle O'Byrne as the Labor member for Bass between 1998 and 2004. When members of the other place announce their retirement, their colleagues are afforded an opportunity to recognise the contribution they have made to their electorates and to the life of the parliament. When their electorates choose another representative, the opportunity to acknowledge that contribution is denied.</para></talk.start><para>Today in the other place the Prime Minister said he has found that most people who come into the parliament do so with a desire to improve things. He also observed that some make a mark and some do not. Michelle O'Byrne certainly had a desire to change things for the better—and she still has—and she made her mark as the member for Bass. The first mark she made was in fact to end the political career of a senior Howard government minister. As honourable senators will recall—and certainly Senator McGauran will recall—the lead-up to the 1998 election was characterised by quite a few of Mr Howard's ministerial colleagues finishing their own careers, without the assistance of the electorate. But Warwick Smith was not among them. Michelle was elected to represent Bass at the 1998 federal election, receiving a 4.7 per cent swing. She won by just 78 votes and claimed the seat from Warwick Smith, who was then the Minister for Family Services. </para><para>It is not every federal election candidate who achieves victory at their first attempt. Fewer still are able to defeat a cabinet minister in the process. One of Michelle's first contributions in the other place was a passionate plea for proper recognition of the service of Australian naval personnel involved in the Malayan Emergency. Her subsequent contributions in the parliament were equally passionate and covered the full gamut of issues that concerned the people of her electorate—affordable and accessible health care, education, training and child services, action on family violence, provision of employment opportunities and maintenance of decent maritime regulation, amongst others.</para><para>At the 2001 election Michelle increased her majority despite the disgraceful scare campaign conducted by the coalition over the circumstances of asylum seekers who found themselves aboard the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa </inline>off the north-west coast of Western Australia. Subsequent to the election, Michelle's talent was recognised with her appointment as a shadow parliamentary secretary after just one term in the parliament. She used her role as shadow parliamentary secretary for communications to highlight regional communications issues relevant to her electorate and others around the country. Michelle was a fierce and effective advocate for the retention of Telstra in majority public ownership and supported Australia Post maintaining its capacity to provide affordable and reliable postal services.</para><para>Michelle was not the only Tasmanian Labor MP to face defeat at the 2004 poll, and I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the service of Sid Sidebottom as the member for Braddon between 1998 and 2004. Sid gave good service to the people of Braddon, and he too served as a shadow parliamentary secretary. In fact, I had the good fortune to work closely with Sid on agricultural matters when I held the shadow portfolio. Sid was an active and effective shadow parliamentary secretary for primary industries. As with the loss of Michelle, his loss is felt deeply within the federal parliamentary Labor Party.</para><para>Returning to Michelle O'Byrne's career, in her inaugural speech in the other place, on Remembrance Day 1998, Michelle said:</para><quote><para>I am honoured to be here representing the people of Bass. My commitment is to be a representative of the calibre of Lance Barnard and Justin O'Byrne. If I do only half as well as they did then I will be serving my electorate well.</para></quote><para>Each day that Michelle represented the people of Bass in the federal parliament she honoured the legacy of the two great representatives she named in her inaugural speech. On behalf of the people of Bass, whom she served for six years without regard for their political persuasion, life circumstances or personal choices, I want to express my appreciation and thanks for her service. I also want to express my appreciation of and thanks to her hardworking staff, who gave her great service and, probably more importantly, gave her constituents great service. On behalf of the 24,491 voters in Bass who gave their first vote to Michelle at the election and the 47.37 per cent of her electorate that ultimately directed their vote to Michelle, I express regret at her failure to win at the election. Her qualities as a member have been reflected in the dignified manner in which she has responded to the election result, including her sensational performance at the Tasmanian Country Music Festival the day after the poll. In the words of Matthew Denholm in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 11 November:</para><quote><para>Labor was collectively singing the blues in Tasmania yesterday, but no one did it quite as well as Michelle O'Byrne. </para></quote><para>Life goes on, and of course Michelle's long-suffering family have welcomed her newfound presence at home.

Although some of the images are apparently home grown, the children used to produce this vile material are reported to be largely from countries where poverty and exploitation flourish. On the other hand, those First World Australians charged as users of child pornography include tradesmen, teachers, public servants, businessmen, scout leaders, child-care workers, policemen and the clergy. The latter deserve special comment. Members of the clergy that sexually assault and abuse children are notorious because of the huge moral gulf between what they say and what they do. Not surprisingly, this evil has featured heavily in the media, but the media's concentration on just the offenders concerns me. What efforts are the Australian authorities making to stop the continuing exploitation of these children in the child pornography scandal?</para></talk.start><para>There has been little, if any, reporting of the victims—the children corruptly and criminally used—and the damaging long-term effects of their being exploited in this way. There is now extensive research and a number of reports that document the lifelong consequences for victims of child sexual assault—not least being the two Senate reports, <inline font-style="italic">Lost</inline> innocen<inline font-style="italic">ts: righting the record,</inline> in 2001, and <inline font-style="italic">Forgotten</inline><inline font-style="italic">Australians</inline>, in 2004—but this material has not been drawn on by the media. Sadly, this tends to be the general proclivity of reporters when writing of the sexual assaults perpetrated on children or child abuse in general. The reporters often focus on the criminal and the crime, rather than on the many victims that a single child abuser creates. When charges are laid, they seldom cover all the offences. The reporting is far from the reality.</para><para>While no meaningful attempt has yet been made to quantify the numbers of victims, child abusers and paedophiles in Australia, we could be talking—and I hope we are not—about hundreds of thousands of victims. I base this guesstimate on a trilogy of inquiries that reveal that more than 500,000 people were raised in care last century. Those three inquiries are the two Senate inquiries I referred to earlier and the Aboriginal stolen generation inquiry. The evidence provided includes many descriptions of extremely graphic and disturbing sexual assaults and molestations of girls and boys by a wide range of perpetrators, across government and non-government institutions and between religious care and foster care. Organised violence against children was systemic and sexual assault far too common. Also far too common—all over the world, including Australia—has been the concealment of these crimes, and the conspiratorial accomplices go all the way to the top of the church hierarchies—something for strong Christians in the political world to bear in mind. Christian values are one thing; Clayton's Christians are another.</para><para>If we add to the number of those in care those legions assaulted within the private sphere of families, it can be reasonably argued that the number of victims in Australia could reach into the hundreds of thousands. Again, I hope not, but sufficient work has not been done to work out the numbers concerned. It is the case that many of these victims—or survivors—do not recover. One female respondent to the children in institutional care inquiry wrote: </para><quote><para>The incident left me with a real fear of men and problems having sex, even with my husband ... This barrier is still with me to this day.</para></quote><para>One male victim wrote:</para><quote><para>I have undergone counselling for much of my adult life just so I could cope ... I cannot hold a job for long; I cannot form friendships and have been unable to complete several educational courses I have started ... I am currently in such a state that I rarely leave the house ...</para></quote><para>These quotes typify the suffering victims endure as adults. They all too often live marginal lives characterised by antisocial behaviour. For instance, documented studies show that prisons are full of men and women sexually assaulted as children. Also, problems of substance abuse, unemployment, welfare dependency, homelessness, mental health problems and suicide are all too common. Another respondent to the inquiry wrote:</para><quote><para>No person can come out of these experiences unscathed ... many ... have had horrible lives. I saw more than one as street walkers and was told about attempts at suicide and destructive relationships. Others have learned to rely on alcohol and more recently other drugs. None have had `normal' relationships where they realised their potential both emotionally and intellectually.</para></quote><para>Unfortunately, it is also the case that if these survivors have their own families they in turn can have a series of consequential problems with their own children because of the way in which they have experienced problems and the way in which they transfer those problems onto their children and adopt what would be known as inappropriate parenting models.</para><para>One has only to read chapter 6 of <inline font-style="italic">Forgotten Australians</inline>, the first report of the Community Affairs References Committee inquiry into children in institutional care tabled on 30 August this year—and what an emotional tabling that was. Another sobering read is the recently released Child Wise report<inline font-style="italic">, S</inline><inline font-style="italic">peaking for themselves</inline>. This report documents the life experiences of a sample of young people involved in prostitution in inner-city Melbourne—right as we speak. Almost without exception, all the participants came from difficult backgrounds, with over half entering state care due to domestic violence, including being sexually assaulted as children.</para><para>I cannot stress enough that it is absolutely crucial that those of us who can make a difference—and I am talking about those of us who are politicians who can make a difference—recognise that the long-term problems of the sexual assault of children or of child abuse are not only individual or family ones. They do impact on society at large and they do comprise an enormous economic cost. This is revealed in a historic national report released earlier this year that has—I think conservatively—estimated that child abuse and neglect costs Australian taxpayers almost $5 billion a year. That report was commissioned by the Kids First Foundation and the Abused Child Trust. They thought that the greatest single impost was the cost of the long-term social and human problems. For instance, they said that about $1 billion annually was associated with the human cost of those abused, including outlays associated with suicide, medical treatments and psychological trauma, and that a further $2 billion was associated with the long-term social cost, which included the costs of crime committed by juveniles and adults whose childhood abuse was considered a significant factor in their offending.</para><para>I strongly believe, as do many others, that the maltreatment and abuse of children—of which sexual assault, although it is certainly the most appalling, is part but not all of it—is a very significant public health problem in Australia. I cannot think of a better investment for the future of Australia than to do something about these problems. The knowledge we now have of current and past child sexual assault and abuse does reveal a problem of significant proportions, one that the Commonwealth has to concern itself with and not just leave to the states. </para><para>Currently there are eight different and mostly crisis-ridden child protection systems that are facing a disturbing escalation in child abuse notifications and substantiations. There are over 200 pieces of legislation dealing with children's interests across the states and territories, many of which are narrowly framed and outdated. For instance, in Victoria, the Child Wise report notes that a major overhaul of the care system is required for there to be:</para><quote><para>... long term effective change to enhance the positive, holistic development of young people in government care.</para></quote><para>Additionally, there is little in the way of services for those leaving care. Arguably, they comprise one of the most vulnerable and underprivileged groups in society. Sadly, though, most past governments regard leaving care in economic and budgetary terms rather than as a broader social and human rights concern. This reality is poignantly explained by Cherie, one of the participants in the Child Wise report. Having suffered sexual assaults by a number of social workers while in state care, she stated: </para><quote><para>When I was 18 they gave me the flick. I had nowhere to go. I went out [sex working] because I thought I had to get used to it. Thought I may as well get paid for it.</para></quote><para>The best interests of the child must be the primary consideration in all decisions that affect them. This is a basic principle of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which Australia became a signatory in 1990. If the Commonwealth were to give legislative effect to this convention using the external affairs power under section 51 of the Constitution, it would be able to take a far stronger role in children's matters than it presently does. Australia's children deserve nothing less than to live in a protected environment, free from violence, abuse and exploitation.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Media: Content</title><page.no>44</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>44</page.no><name role="metadata">Humphries, Sen Gary</name><name role="display">Senator HUMPHRIES</name><name.id>KO6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Over the last sitting weeks of the 40th Parliament I presented a number of petitions to the Senate regarding the concerns of the Polish community in Australia about things that have been said of Poland, Polish history and the Polish community. The petitions asked:</para></talk.start><quote><para>... “That slanderous, defamatory and offensive statements, oral or in writing, made about a community or a Nation or its Armed Forces, which are untrue and unsubstantiated are unacceptable, offensive and must not be made.”</para></quote><para>The petitions go on to ask that the Senate request and empower the federal Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to exercise its power to stop mass media publications, orally or in writing or in electronic media, which convey those so-called slanderous, defamatory and offensive statements. The petitions arise out of concerns within the Polish community in Australia and elsewhere that some in the general community and the media misrepresent the relationship, particularly between the Poles, the Nazis and the Jews. </para><para>The invasion of Poland in 1939, of course, was the incident which triggered the Second World War. Poland was occupied by Nazi Germany from September 1939 until 1944-45. Poles fought against the Germans not only in Poland, where the Polish resistance numbered some 350,000 people, but also in Great Britain, Norway, France, Belgium, Holland, North Africa, Italy and Germany itself. It is also worth noting that 200,000 Polish soldiers were attached to the British Army. </para><para>After the occupation of Poland at the beginning of the war, more than 2.4 million Jews fell under Nazi rule. It was in Poland, not Greater Germany, that the harshest restrictions were placed on local Jewish populations. The Jews of Poland were subjected to summary massacre by the regular army and by the SS. Captured Jewish soldiers were executed as a matter of course.</para><para>Moreover, the Greater German occupation regime forced Poland's Jews to move into urban ghettos in the major cities of Poland. These ghettos, surrounded by walls and barbed wire, functioned as autonomous captive city-states, governed by a Jewish council that was responsible for housing, sanitation and economic production for the Greater German war efforts. As purely urban areas, these areas depended heavily upon imports of food and coal, but Greater Germany consistently supplied insufficient food and coal to keep the inhabitants of the various ghettos fed and warm. As a result, massive epidemics and endemic malnutrition vastly increased the prewar death rate. By 1942, Poland's Jews were little more than disposable slaves.</para><para>The infamous Auschwitz concentration camp was initially established by the Germans in 1940 to eliminate Polish leadership and kill off opposition to the German occupation of Poland. The first Jews were brought to Auschwitz in 1942 and many hundreds of thousands lost their lives there, but some 75,000 to 100,000 Poles were also killed in Auschwitz. There were many Poles among those in the whole of Nazi occupied Europe who were willing, at grave risk to their families and their own lives, to help Jews escape or hide from the Nazis. Up to January 2002, 5,632 Poles had been honoured by the Yad Vashem institute in Jerusalem for saving Jews during World War II. As Dr Nahum Goldmann, an honorary president of the World Jewish Congress, stated:</para><quote><para>Poles suffered no less than we did ... We suffered greater losses proportion wise, but the Poles also suffered enormously ...</para></quote><para>However, not all commentators focus on this aspect of Polish altruism. Dr Janusz Rygielski, the President of the Federal Council of Polish Associations in Australia, has drawn attention to the publication, in Polish, of a book in 2000 by a Polish author Jan Tomasz Gross entitled <inline font-style="italic">Neighbours</inline>. The book has received much publicity and has been widely promoted throughout the world. It has already been translated into English and is being translated into other languages. A screenplay has already been written. The book deals with the extermination of Jews in a small township called Jedwabne, in north-eastern Poland, by, as the title suggests, their Polish neighbours.</para><para>While the book caused considerable controversy in Poland, it appears that it has been accepted as an indisputable historical document, particularly in the English-speaking West. Many Polish historians dispute the author's methodology and selectivity in the use of source material, most of which has been available for the past 50 years from the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw. The views of those historians, however, in contrast to Gross, have not received any mention in the Western media. Such a lack of balance could lead one to believe that Gross's allegations are unchallengeable and therefore true.</para><para>This episode draws specifically on the recent experience of the Polish community but highlights the reaction of any other community, national, religious or ethnic group in Australia to what could be described as misrepresentations about them or their history. The language used by journalists contributes to this problem. Just recently, I noticed this very issue in an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> that focused on a woman who had fled from the Nazis as a toddler. The article goes on to say that she discovered that her mother had perished in `a Polish concentration camp'. This is a perfect example of the journalistic misconceptions tormenting people of Polish origin. From the way the journalist has worded this sentence one could be forgiven for thinking that the Poles were running the concentration camps. Bearing these facts in mind, I can see how distressing it must be to Polish people all over the world when such terms as `Nazi Poland', `Polish concentration camps' and `Polish ghettos' are used by newspaper columnists and TV commentators writing or reporting for the press. Sadly, such terminology is repeatedly used by journalists in this country. </para><para>The Polish government recently established a National Institute of Remembrance, whose role inter alia is to promote education and understanding about the events of the Second World War and since, which are as much misrepresented and misunderstood in Australia as in other parts of the world. I recently had the pleasure of meeting the director of the institute, Dr Leon Kieres, during his visit to Australia. </para><para>I hope the presentation of these petitions will stimulate thoughtful reflection on our collective use of language which may be offensive to some in our modern multicultural community. I do not advocate that Australia import into our political discourse the political or historical controversies which dog some other nations or communities. However, the insensitive use of language does just that, since language can carry judgments or assumptions in even apparently straightforward or innocent terms. I particularly urge the media to consider these issues. They are certainly of great significance to many Australians of overseas birth and, in particular in the context I have explained today, to the Polish community in Australia.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Endangered Species</title><page.no>46</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>46</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to make a plea for the 1,695 plants and animals recognised under Australian environment laws as facing the threat of extinction. Many more than this are in fact either in decline or understood to be in decline but have not yet been adequately assessed. The 2003 red list of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources documents the shocking reality for species that are on the brink of extinction around the globe. The number of animals and plants listed as critically endangered, endangered or vulnerable by global experts has again increased by a frightening degree and now exceeds 12,000. </para></talk.start><para>It is a statement of the obvious of course to say that, once a species is lost, it is irretrievable. It is also obvious that governments, including ours, are not paying enough attention to the problem. As one of the few developed countries with comparatively large and biodiverse reserves, Australia has a responsibility to play a much more decisive role in the conservation of global biodiversity. As a wealthy country we have the resources, the technology and the potential to arrest the loss of species and to work to improve the prospects for species' recovery in the long term, both in Australia and elsewhere. All it takes is political will and a lesser attachment to a big budget surplus.</para><para>The Democrats tonight call on the Minister for the Environment and Heritage to make threatened species protection and recovery a top priority for his ministry in the new government. I note today that the minister is still apparently the Manager of Government Business in the Senate and I hope that this is not some indication that there are low expectations of what the environment minister will do in this new government. </para><para>We call on the government to give biodiversity conservation and critical habitat protection a much higher budgetary priority. The Australian Terrestrial Biodiversity Audit, released in April last year, identified almost 3,000 ecological communities to be under threat of extinction. These are all vital habitats for the survival of our plants, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and insects. Australia has one of the longest lists of extinct endemic mammals in the world.</para><para>The overview of Australia's threatened bird species is not much better, with 23 species already extinct and 99 federally listed as threatened. The Action Plan for Australian Birds identifies many more birds whose survival is precarious. It is critical that work continues to identify and protect Australian biodiversity hotspots, and to develop a national biodiversity action plan and a national biodiversity initiative. We must have in place effective management for invasive species and measures to address the threat of broadscale land clearing.</para><para>We need on the ground results in the shortest possible time frame. In planning the recovery of our threatened species we have to be thorough and effective if we are going to avoid further extinctions in the near future. Questions I put to the minister for the environment asking just how effective recovery efforts have been for critically endangered species, such as the east coast's grey nurse shark, went unanswered prior to the election, but I will be putting them up again. We need to know that the money that is spent on recovery plans is money well spent—spent on evidence based programs with demonstrable outcomes. A recent federal government report from the biodiversity advisory committee shows clear evidence of the emerging threat to Australian iconic species through climate change. The mountain pygmy possum, the numbat and the tree kangaroo are among some of Australia's most well-known animals in danger of extinction in a drastically warming world.</para><para>Australia is most at risk with even small changes in temperature. A 0.7 degree of global warming has resulted in our worst drought on record. Australia's wet tropical mountain rainforests will decrease by 50 per cent with only a one-degree rise in global temperature. The Democrats urge the government to give full support to global initiatives to address climate change, and to move swiftly to ensure that Australia achieves a 60 per cent cut in our greenhouse emissions by 2050. We must do this to protect our biodiversity and to ensure a survivable environment for Australians in the future. Our own Productivity Commission has expressed concerns about the effects of climate change on biodiversity. It says 23 per cent of mammals, 16 per cent of amphibians, nine per cent of fish, nine per cent of birds, seven per cent of reptiles and five per cent of plants are listed either as extinct or at risk of becoming so.</para><para>Despite overwhelming evidence that Australia's biodiversity is deeply in danger of the risk of irreversible extinction from a range of threats, Senator Ian Campbell on taking on his new ministry claimed the Howard government has:</para><quote><para>... implemented an Australia-wide approach to biodiversity conservation, tracking our biodiversity, measuring it, understanding it, saving it.</para></quote><para>This is clearly nonsense. To claim that Australia's biodiversity has been saved shows a dangerous and very sad misunderstanding of the state of our threatened species and ecological communities and the key threats which continue to diminish their chances of survival.</para><para>The Democrats warn the new government most strongly against complacency on this complex and increasingly worrying problem. Investigations by the World Wide Fund for Nature show that more than half of the national conservation targets agreed to by federal, state and territory governments have not been met. In their report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Small steps for nature</inline>, the group found that Australian governments are failing to address the fundamental drivers of biodiversity loss in Australia and that we are still falling far short of what it will take to avert the wave of extinctions into the foreseeable future. They estimate that up to 20 per cent of Australia's half a million or so plants and animals could be threatened with extinction as a result of the failure to act in the immediate future. </para><para>We need a quantum leap in our nation's efforts to deal with key threats, such as declining water quality and wetland health, weeds and pest animals, broadscale land clearing and climate change. Australian governments have failed to put in place recovery plans for the vast majority of Australia's native vegetation types, which have less than 10 per cent of their original extant left. The target to complete implementation of environmental flows for Australia's most heavily impacted river systems by 2001 has not been met by any Australian government. Australia still permits the legal importation of more than 120,000 plant species, of which 4,000 are known weeds not yet present in Australia, with no weed risk assessment. To put this in a fiscal context, weed abatement already costs the Australian economy $4 billion every year. The target to prevent and manage introduced marine pests by 2003 has not been met. As indicated by the Australian Terrestrial Biodiversity Assessment 2002, there are 2,859 threatened ecosystems in Australia, all of which contain many unique species. The report noted that protection for endangered ecosystems and ecological communities under the Commonwealth EPBC Act is much too slow.</para><para>I remind the government of its failure to establish an adequate, representative and well-funded national reserve system, which as a signatory to the Convention on Biological Diversity we have an international commitment to establish. The Democrats will continue to call for adequate reserve representation of ecological communities in both marine and terrestrial environments. Biodiversity management must be a key issue within natural resource management throughout the landscape. Too little, too late is being done to halt Australia's accelerating extinction wave that was set in train from the time of European settlement. Tonight the Democrats call on the parliament and the government to ensure that much more is done in the shortest possible time frame.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Andrew, Hon.

Neil Andrew as Speaker of the House of Representatives ceased. I take this opportunity to briefly but warmly acknowledge the contribution to the Australian parliament of Speaker Andrew. Neil Andrew was Speaker from 1996 and, since becoming President in August 2002, I have been privileged to work with a most honourable and decent colleague in the range of matters which relate to the administration of the parliament. Together we oversaw the first major structural reform of parliamentary departments in over 100 years, with the creation of the Department of Parliamentary Services in February this year. I have been very fortunate to serve as a fellow presiding officer with a Speaker who has high standards, who is genuinely respected by all sides of politics and who has a real love of parliamentary democracy.</para></talk.start><para>The most important thing to Neil has been encouraging an understanding of our democracy, and it was a delight to see him with a group of students of any age, whether from Australia or another country, because his enthusiasm for our democratic system is so infectious. It would be wrong for me to say that Neil Andrew has simply retired, because that would imply that he will not continue his busy involvement in public life. I wish Neil and his wife, Carolyn, all the very best for the future. Neil leaves the Australian parliament as a most significant parliamentarian. I am confident that the new Speaker, the Hon. David Hawker, will continue the high standards his immediate predecessor brought to the office, and I warmly congratulate him on his election this morning.

These programs are not separate funding sources for discrete natural resource management outcomes.

Such pensions are not means tested, but are subject to periodic review which may, depending on the health and ongoing incapacity of the person, result in variation or cessation of the pension. The pension classification of a person may increase, but may not reduce, after the age of 55. </para><para>Members who are medically discharged as a result of a service-related injury or disease may also be entitled to incapacity payments under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 if they are incapacitated for civilian employment. The weekly rate of compensation payable is 100 per cent of the member's ADF earnings for the first 45 weeks of incapacity and 75 per cent thereafter. Incapacity payments are offset dollar for dollar against the Commonwealth funded portion of the member's superannuation. Compensation entitlements are periodically reviewed and may be reduced or ceased in the event that the member is able to work in civilian employment. Payments cease at age 65.</para><para>Where a service-related injury or disease is assessed at impairment of 50 or more impairment points and the member is unable to undertake paid work for more that 10 hours a week and is unlikely to be assisted by rehabilitation to undertake such work, the member has the choice of either continuing to be paid incapacity payments or to be paid a life time, tax free, Special Rate Disability Pension (SRDP). The SRDP is the equivalent of the Special Rate (Totally and Permanently Incapacitated) pension payable under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, but is reduced by all other compensation already paid for permanent impairment and by the Commonwealth funded portion of the member's superannuation payments. </para><para>(5)	(a)	Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme (MSBS) Rule 22 explains who is eligible for each of the MSBS Class A, B and C invalidity pensions. The MSBS Rules are available at: www.scaleplus.law.gov.au.</para><para>	(b)	The difference between each of the MSBS classifications is as follows:</para><para>		Class A - A Class A pension is based on the person's actual and prospective service multiplied by their final average salary and divided by a conversion factor of 12 to produce an annual pension amount.</para><para>		Class B - A Class B pension is based on 50 per cent of a Class A pension, as described above, unless the person's actual service calculation is greater than that of 50 per cent of a Class A pension. In that case, the higher amount is the Class B pension payable.</para><para>		Class C - A Class C classification is not pensionable and the person's employer benefit is based on their actual period of service multiplied by their final average salary. This `lump sum amount' is compulsorily preserved until the person:</para><para>		(i) attains the age of 55 where he or she can access it as an indexed pension or rollover into another complying fund; or</para><para>		(ii) attains preservation age (if greater than 55) where the benefit can be accessed by way of a pension, lump sum or combination of both.</para><para>The member's benefit component, comprising contributions and interest, is either refunded or, in the case of service occurring after 1 July 1999, preserved.</para><para>(6)	(a)	The MSBS classification process does not automatically apply a `classification' based on a particular medical condition.</para><para>	(b)	Members of the MSBS who may have the same retiring impairment may qualify for different classification levels (A, B or C) as each case is assessed on its own merits. There will usually be differences in each case, for example:</para><para>		(i) the members will have different vocational, trade and professional skills, qualifications and experience;</para><para>		(ii) by reason of (i) above, the members will have different kinds of civil employment which they might reasonably undertake; and</para><para>		(iii) the degree to which the physical or mental impairment of the member is assessed as having diminished his or her capacity to undertake the kinds of civil employments referred in (ii) above.</para><para>ComSuper records show that, while the majority of former ADF members who have retired on the ground of invalidity because of sleep disorders have been classified as Class C, some have, for the reasons shown above, been classified as Class B or Class A.</para><para>(7)	See response to (6) above. </para><para>(8)	(a)	Rules 32, 33 and 34 of the MSB rules outline circumstances in which a person retired on the ground of invalidity is not entitled to be classified for invalidity benefits, where:</para><para>		(i) the person has less than two years service and has a pre-existing condition that was not substantially contributed to, or materially aggravated, by their military service (Rule 32);</para><para>		(ii) the invalidity was due to an intentional act (Rule 33); or</para><para>		(iii) the invalidity arose during a period of absence without leave exceeding 21 days (Rule 34).</para><para>		Sections 27, 28 and 29 of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits (DFRDB) Act 1973 contain similar but not identically worded exclusion provisions.</para><para>	(b)	As at January 2004, available ComSuper records show six former ADF personnel have been discharged with a retirement impairment specified as including, but not necessarily limited to, a sleep disorder but who have not received a medical classification under either the MSB or DFRDB schemes. </para><para>(9)	This is currently being considered by Defence and its legal advisers in the context of a claim for damages that Mr Warren Le Plastrier has made against the Commonwealth arising out of the circumstances of his discharge from the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Under those circumstances it would not be appropriate to comment any further on the circumstances relating to that former RAN member, particularly as the former RAN member has foreshadowed litigation against the Commonwealth in respect of the claim for damages.</para><para>(10)	If a former ADF member is able to demonstrate to Defence's satisfaction, that he or she was discharged for a reason that later appears unsound or incorrect, there is no statutory obligation to notify ComSuper. As a matter of administrative practice, the ADF does notify ComSuper of any change in the reason for discharge when the change may be relevant to that former ADF member's entitlement to receive benefits under applicable Commonwealth military superannuation legislation.  </para><para>(11)	On 31 July 2003, ComSuper was provided with the same advice that had been given to Mr Warren Le Plastrier on 30 July, that there was sufficient doubt in the medical evidence surrounding Mr Le Plastrier's discharge to change the reason for termination to “administrative/normal”.</para><para>(12)	ComSuper was advised in writing on 31 July 2003 and it has been confirmed that ComSuper received this correspondence on 1 August 2003.</para><para>(13)	See response to questions (9) to (12) above.</para><para>(14)	Not directly. ComSuper considers that action taken under regulation 99 of the Defence (Personnel) Regulations 2002 does not result in a retrospective change to a member's actual ground of termination from the ADF. In the case of a MSBS member, such action might, however, either prompt the MSB Board to reconsider on its own motion the initial invalidity classification decision made under rule 22 by its delegate or to review the member's current classification under rule 23. In the case of a DFRDB member, review of the member's current classification under section 34 of the DFRDB Act could result.</para><para>(15)	Yes. On 26 February 2004, a letter was sent to Mr Le Plastrier's father advising that his son remained entitled to the superannuation entitlements payable to a person who had been discharged medically. </para><para>(16)	(a)	Yes.</para><para>	(b)	No.</para><para>(17)	(a)	Since 1 December 2002, eight cases have been considered by the Director General Navy Personnel and Training for change of reason for termination under regulation 99 of the Defence (Personnel) Regulations 2002. The Army does not keep this information and the Air Force has made no determinations under regulation 99.</para><para>	(b)	With regard to the Navy, ComSuper was advised of the decision in the two cases where the decision changed the member's circumstances and hence potentially affected their benefits.

Of the 988 Kurdish migrant arrivals nationally, only 196 settled in Victoria. In 2004-05 under the Humanitarian Program it is expected that 25 per cent of entrants will be from the Middle East; while the proportion of Kurdish arrivals in 2004-05 is unknown, the number of arrivals nationally has declined from 247 in 2000-01 to 152 in 2003-04.</para><para>(4)	The GIA scheme ceased in 1996 and was replaced in 1997 by the CSSS. CSSS funding is limited and aims to address the most pressing settlement needs. Funding is not recurrent or guaranteed. The application process every year is very competitive. There was keen interest in the 2004-05 CSSS round, with the Department receiving 328 applications Australia-wide. Each application is assessed on its merits against advertised eligibility and assessment criteria and against the relative priorities of the needs applicants proposed to address. In 2004-05 the Department was able to fund 229 applications. Funding was offered to a broad range of community organisations across different regions to provide maximum benefit and access to settlement services for migrants, refugee and humanitarian entrants.</para><para>Given the increasing numbers of small and diverse immigrant groups in Australia, it is necessary for some small groups to be served by more generalist settlement service providers such as MRCs/MSAs, which are able to cater for a wider range of communities. The Northern and North West MRCs have established outposts in the local government areas of Moreland and Hume, where the Victorian Kurdish community has predominantly settled, and members of the Kurdish community are accessing their services. Some settlement services are also provided to the Kurdish women in Victoria by Dianella Community Health, a CSSS funded organisation. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Defence: Legal Services</title><page.no>90</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 3025)</subtitle><id.no>3025</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>90</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 18 June 2004:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	How much was spent on internal and external legal services for the 2002-03 financial year.</para><para>(2)	What is the proposed expenditure on internal and external legal services for the 2003-04 financial year.</para><para>(3)	How does this compare to expenditure in the past 4 financial years.</para><para>(4)	What is the reason for the differential in the figures provided to the Australian Labor Party under a freedom of information (FOI) request, showing that the department's expenditure reported to the Government's review of legal expenditure (the Tongue Report) was much lower than stated in the FOI request. </para><para>(5)	Has the Minister acted to correct the record of figures provided to the Attorney-General's Department for the purpose of the government review.</para><para>(6)	How did this mistake occur.</para><para>(7)	(a) When did the department become aware of the massive discrepancy in its reporting to the Attorney-General's Department for the purposes of the Tongue Report; and (b) what actions, if any, were taken to remedy this discrepancy, and when.</para><para>(8)	What guidelines does the department follow in the contracting out of legal services.</para><para>(9)	What reporting arrangements are in place to account for this expenditure.</para><para>(10)	How is legal expenditure estimated for the forward years.</para><para>(11)	Why is this not publicly reported anywhere in the department's annual report or portfolio budget statements.</para><para>(12)	Can a list be provided of the five external legal firms to whom the most money was paid, and how much was paid to each, in the 2001-02 financial year.</para><para>(13)	What amount was allocated to each of these firms in the past 5 years.</para><para>(14)	With reference to the review process being conducted by the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO): (a) has the department contacted ANAO with any reform ideas or other proposals; and (b) has ANAO raised any concerns with the department about its legal spending, or accounting of legal spending; if so, what concerns were raised.</para><para>(15)	Is it correct, as reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> on 11 June 2004, that the department: (a) spent $61 million on legal services in the 2002-03 financial year, up from $44 million the previous year; (b) is conducting a reform of its in-house legal services; and (c) predicts that its legal costs overall will fall in the 2003-04 financial year by 13 per cent, including a 4 per cent drop in the cost of in-house legal services.</para><para>(16)	(a) What are the terms and scope of the review and reform of in-house legal services; and (b) what reform is regarded to be desirable.</para><para>(17)	(a) When will this review be complete; and (b) will it be publicly available.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>91</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1), (2) and (3)</para><para>2003-04 $61.0m ($22.3m internal and $38.7m external).</para><para>2002-03 $61.3m ($22.5m internal and $38.8m external). </para><para>2001-02 $41.8m ($18m internal and $23.8m external).</para><para>2000-01 $19.1m (external only.

The kindergarten leases a small portion of the Defence land at Ingleburn under a concessional lease arrangement. </para><para>(2)	The Defence land at Ingleburn was declared surplus to requirements in 1997 and vacated by Defence in December 2000. The Defence site is an integral part of the Edmondson Park Release Area which, as announced by the NSW Government on 25 September 2003, is to be rezoned to include approximately 8,500 homes and a town centre. Defence, as a stakeholder, is working with both Liverpool and Campbelltown Councils towards the Edmondson Park rezoning, with planning documentation to be exhibited by both councils shortly.  </para><para>(3)	Disposal of the site is due to commence this financial year, but the timing for the disposal of portions of the site has not yet been finalised. </para><para>(4)	Approximately 0.2 hectares.</para><para>(5)	Approximately 311 hectares.</para><para>(6)	Valuations for surplus Defence sites prior to the sale of the property are considered commercial-in-confidence and not made available to the public.</para><para>(7)	Defence understands the kindergarten was established in 1952, but it was initially established in another location on the Ingleburn site. </para><para>(8)	The kindergarten's concessional lease is due to expire on 28 February 2005. However, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence has recently offered the kindergarten a further and final 12-month extension to its lease term. Should the kindergarten accept the lease extension offer, this will enable the kindergarten to remain in its current location until 28 February 2006, at which time the kindergarten will need to secure alternative accommodation. </para><para>(9)	Defence has advised the kindergarten, on a number of occasions since 1997, of the intention to dispose of the site in accordance with the Commonwealth Property Disposals Policy. Defence has suggested the kindergarten contact the local councils and relevant state agencies regarding future pre-school and kindergarten services for Edmondson Park, noting Defence will not be involved in the future redevelopment of the area. </para><para>(10)	and (11) Yes. A heritage analysis of the site, completed in 2001 by Godden Mackay Logan, identified the Bambi Kindergarten is one of the few features on the site that represents the Korean period. However, the analysis concluded that the significance rested in the use and activity rather than the buildings themselves, which need not be retained, and that future decisions about the Bambi Kindergarten as an activity and community facility would be subject to the commercial viability of the activity. The heritage analysis also concluded that the Korean War Memorial should be conserved in its present location or relocated in association with other memorials. Defence has offered to relocate and preserve the memorial within the Ingleburn Military Heritage Precinct, which houses a number of other memorials and conserved heritage buildings, and which was recently added to the new Commonwealth Heritage List. </para><para>(12)	The kindergarten has been assessed as not eligible for concessional priority sale status under the Commonwealth Property Disposals Policy (a concessional sale being a priority sale concluded at a purchase price below market value).

Certain actions which have or are likely to have a significant impact on the National Heritage values of a National Heritage place are prohibited by the Act, subject to a number of exclusions. The exclusions include Regional Forest Agreement (RFA) forestry operations. RFA forestry operations undertaken in accordance with an RFA are excluded (s38 of the Act) from the Act's protective provisions - unless they are included in section 42. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Spotted Handfish</title><page.no>131</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 3181)</subtitle><id.no>3181</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>131</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 30 August 2004:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	What is the current conservation status of the spotted handfish.</para><para>(2)	What is its habitat range.</para><para>(3)	When was it recognized as an endangered species.</para><para>(4)	Given the Government's responsibility for endangered species, why has the Government failed to ratify a recovery plan for the period 2002 to 2006.</para><para>(5)	Was the recovery plan for 1996 to 2001 fully implemented; if not, why not.</para><para>(6)	What funding was expended in the recovery effort for 1996 to 2001.</para><para>(7)	(a) What funding is required to fully implement the draft recovery plan for 2002 to 2006; and (b) how much has been allocated and expended to date.</para><para>(8)	When will the Government ratify and publicly release the recovery plan for 2002 to 2006.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>131</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	It is listed as endangered under Commonwealth and Tasmanian State legislation namely, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) and the Threatened Species Protection Act 1995, respectively.</para><para>(2)	Spotted Handfish are only found in Tasmanian State waters.</para><para>(3)	1996 (Australian Government). </para><para>1995 (Tasmanian Government).</para><para>(4)	The Recovery Plan for the species was made on 2 February 2000.
