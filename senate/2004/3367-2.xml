I apologise for the delay in responding.</para><para>The amendments contained in Schedules 1 and 3 of the Excise Amendment Regulations are consequential to the imposition of excise duty on biodiesel announced in the 2003-2004 Federal Budget and implemented by Excise Tariff Proposal (No. 4) 2003, tabled in the House of Representatives on 17 September 2003, to take effect on and from the 18 September 2003. Schedule 1 extends exemption provisions in Excise Regulations 1925 applying to diesel blends to include biodiesel blends. Schedule 3 extends the definition of petrol, which includes diesel, to biodiesel. Please note that the amendments contained in Schedule 3 are to commence on gazettal.</para><para>An effect of the imposition of excise duty on biodiesel was to bring biodiesel manufacture within the excise regime and in particular in the licensing system central to the Excise Act 1901 by requiring biodiesel manufacturers to be licensed. Excise duty on biodiesel and consequential alignment of the treatment of biodiesel with comparable fuels are introduced for reasons of equity. The Australian biodiesel industry is at present in the early stages of development. There is only limited commercial biodiesel production in Australia with a small number of large scale commercial manufacturers of biodiesel. Although size of this relatively infant market is difficult to establish with certainty, advice from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is that there are currently no producers of biodiesel blends who are paying excise on those blends that would fall within the proposed exemption provision.</para><para>The ATO holds details of the identities and production levels of licensed biodiesel manufacturers and Treasury has advised the ATO to particularly identify those manufacturers that would potentially benefit from the proposed exemptions in order that the administration of excise collection occurs in the proper manner.</para><para>I trust this information will be of assistance to you.</para><para>Yours sincerely</para><para>HELEN COONAN</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>23195</page.no><name role="metadata">Tchen, Sen Tsebin</name><name role="display">Senator TCHEN</name><name.id>86Y</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I give notice that, at the giving of notices on the next day of sitting, I shall withdraw business of the Senate notice of motion No. 2 standing in my name for 13 sitting days after today for the disallowance of Temporary Order No. 4 of 2003, made under subsection 43(8) of the Fisheries Management Act 1991.

It might be one that the Standing Committee on Procedure could look at enshrining more formally, as we have done in relation to dealing with the budget speech itself. We need to acknowledge, in saying that, that obviously there are opportunities for the government to deliver its budget in the House of Representatives and for the Leader of the Opposition, on behalf of the opposition, to deliver formally a budget speech in reply.

We received over 3,000 submissions, then again asked for veterans' feedback on the report's recommendations before we gave our government response. I am proud that the government's response to the Clarke Review delivers even more for veterans and war widows across Australia.</para><para>The Clarke Committee made 109 recommendations, more than half of which called for no change to current arrangements, and the Government has accepted these.</para><para>This Bill implements the changes announced on 2 March 2004 including addressing benefits for disability pension recipients; making an ex gratia payment to former prisoners of the Korean War; increasing assistance for war widows and widowers and extending operational service to minesweeping personnel.</para><para>Importantly, the Bill implements two significant measures to address key issues for veterans in receipt of the disability pension. </para><para>First, new indexation arrangements will mean that our most disabled veterans will have that portion of their disability pension paid above 100 per cent of the General Rate indexed by the same proportion as the service pension and the war widow's and widower's pension—that is, with reference to movements in the Consumer Price Index and Male Total Average Weekly Earnings.</para><para>Swift passage of these amendments will allow an early back-payment of the increased indexation to 20 March 2004, benefiting more than 45,000 disability pensioners.</para><para>Second, from September 2004 the Government will introduce the Defence Force Income Support Allowance (DFISA). This measure addresses a key issue of concern regarding the inclusion of the disability pension as income for pensions and benefits paid to recipients and their partners under social security law.</para><para>The amount of DFISA will be equal to the difference between the amount of income support a person receives under social security law, and the amount the person would receive if the disability pension was not counted as income in the assessment of their social security payment, and a disability pension income test for rent assistance was applicable. </para><para>The new allowance will be paid to eligible persons receiving a range of Centrelink payments including the age pension, disability support pension, carer payment, Newstart allowance and parenting payment.</para><para>As recommended by the Clarke Committee, the Government will make an ex gratia payment of $25,000 to former Australian prisoners of war held during the Korean War, or their surviving widows, who were alive on 1 July 2003. </para><para>The payment will be made in the same way as the payment to former prisoners of war held by Japan during World War II, in recognition of the extremely inhumane conditions endured by Australian PoWs during the Korean War.</para><para>This is a beneficial measure which is aimed to ensure that the largest possible number of former prisoners of the Korean War, or their surviving spouse, will be able to receive the payment.</para><para>In relation to war widows and widowers, the Government will pay rent assistance, in addition to the ceiling rate of the income support supplement, to some 11,000 war widows and widowers who are renting private accommodation. Currently rent assistance is paid within the ceiling rate of the income support supplement.</para><para>A small number of war widows who are also veterans in their own right, receiving the ceiling rate of service pension and renting privately, will also benefit from increased rent assistance under this measure.</para><para>This initiative reflects the finding of the Clarke Report that war widows and widowers renting in the private market are in need of additional assistance. Rent assistance is not available to those renting Government-owned properties, as their rent is already subsidised. </para><para>War widows and widowers receiving their income support payment from Centrelink will continue to have their rent assistance counted towards the income support ceiling rate. However they will be able to transfer to DVA for payment of their income support, thereby benefiting from this initiative, and I would encourage them to do so.</para><para>The increase in war widow and widower's rent assistance will require significant administrative changes by my Department. However, I have directed that the changes be accelerated and the increases will take effect from 1 January 2005, several months earlier than originally thought possible, at an additional cost of $5 million.</para><para>In line with another recommendation of the Clarke Report, the maximum funeral benefit will be increased from $572 to $1000. </para><para>The funeral benefit is intended to reduce the funeral expenses for eligible veterans and certain dependants, including former prisoners of war and recipients of the Totally and Permanently Incapacitated pension and the Extreme Disablement Adjustment rate. The increase in the maximum funeral benefit will take effect from 1 July 2004.</para><para>Finally, this Bill will extend operational service to personnel involved in minesweeping and bomb clearance operations after World War II who have qualifying service. This addresses an anomaly where a small number of personnel received the medal necessary to be eligible for qualifying service, but are not veterans because their service fell outside the operational service periods specified in the Veterans' Entitlements Act. </para><para>The Government's response to the Clarke Committee delivers a generous and responsible package of measures to enhance the benefits and support available to veterans and war widows. </para><para>Again, I thank the members the veteran community who participated in this important Review process. I would also like to acknowledge our defence and veterans' affairs committee, chaired ably by the member for Gilmore, and members of that committee, notably the members for Blair, McPherson, McEwen, Cowper, Deakin, Riverina, Hinkler and Herbert, who are all passionate advocates for veterans in their electorates. The Government's response to the Clarke Report will deliver significant and enduring benefits to veterans and war widows across Australia. It is this government that has increased spending on veterans' issues by a massive $4 billion since 1996. This financial year we allocated over a massive $10 billion to the needs of war widows and veterans. This government has a strong track record and our response to Clarke and the new Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Bill 2003 continues that strong commitment to our veterans and war widows.</para><para>—————</para><para><inline ref="R2004">BANKRUPTCY (ESTATE CHARGES) AMENDMENT BILL 2004</inline></para><para>The Bankruptcy (Estate Charges) Amendment Bill 2004 (the Bill) will make a number of minor changes to the Bankruptcy (Estate Charges) Act 1997. </para><para>These changes are necessary only to reflect the repeal of the three types of administrations and the proposed introduction of personal insolvency agreements under Part X of the Bankruptcy Act 1966. </para><para>The amendments to Part X are contained in the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 2004.</para><para>The amendments proposed by this Bill will ensure that the interest charge and realisations charge apply to amounts received by trustees of personal insolvency agreements and represent no change in policy.</para><para>—————</para><para><inline ref="R2018">HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PODIATRIC SURGERY AND OTHER MATTERS) BILL 2004</inline></para><para>This Bill amends the Health Insurance Act 1973 regarding podiatric surgeons and Hospital Casemix Protocol data provision arrangements. It also amends the National Health Act 1953 regarding deceased pharmacists and makes minor technical amendments to two other pieces of legislation within the Health portfolio. </para><para>Amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973 will enable private health insurance funds to pay accommodation and nursing costs from their hospital tables associated with foot surgery performed on admitted patients by accredited podiatric surgeons.</para><para>The aim of this amendment is to enhance the value of private health insurance and increase choice for consumers. Currently private patients can only receive rebates for foot surgery from health funds' hospital tables performed by medical practitioners. Only limited benefits are available from funds' ancillary tables for surgery performed by podiatric surgeons and members can incur considerable out-of-pocket costs. </para><para>While this Bill enables funds to pay for hospital costs, it does not extend to enabling funds to pay benefits for the accredited podiatric surgeon's or associated anaesthetist's fees. There is no Medicare Benefits Schedule item for these fees and this Bill will not change this situation.</para><para>The amendment will not change clinical practice in any way. It will permit funds to pay benefits for accommodation and nursing costs associated with foot surgery performed on admitted patients by accredited podiatric surgeons. This will alleviate some of the cost burden for privately insured consumers.</para><para>The Bill also clarifies existing Hospital Casemix Protocol data provision arrangements under the Health Insurance Act 1973. </para><para>Currently the Health Insurance Act 1973 requires private hospitals to supply patient de-identified data to a data bureau. The data bureau was disbanded in 2002 and the data is now collected and analysed from within the Department of Health and Ageing. The amendment reflects this change in arrangements. </para><para>While private hospitals have been required to provide Hospital Casemix Protocol data to the Department of Health and Ageing and private health insurance funds under the Health Insurance Act 1973, an equivalent obligation has never been imposed on day hospital facilities. This creates a potential gap in the range of data that is supplied to health funds and the Department of Health and Ageing. An amendment to the National Health Act 1953 will correct this anomaly.</para><para>This Bill also amends the National Health Act 1953 to ensure that the community will continue to have access to pharmaceutical benefits in the event of the death of a pharmacist who had been approved under this Act to supply pharmaceutical benefits</para><para>Currently, under the National Health Act 1953, pharmaceutical benefits can only be supplied by a pharmacist approved to supply such benefits. Once approved, a pharmacist is entitled to be paid by the Commonwealth for the supply of pharmaceutical benefits.</para><para>The National Health Act 1953 currently provides for legal personal representatives of deceased approved pharmacists to apply for approval to supply pharmaceutical benefits. However, this provision has been found to be deficient in a number of respects. In some cases, the time period involved in obtaining an approval to supply pharmaceutical benefits is lengthy. This is particularly so in situations where it is only viable for a legal personal representative to apply for approval after probate or letters of administration are granted.</para><para>In some instances, the legal personal representative requests an act of grace payment be made to the estate of the deceased approved pharmacist. This payment is for pharmaceutical benefits supplied during the period following the death of the pharmacist and before the grant of a new approval. In some cases the amount claimed is large, and the ongoing viability of a pharmacy has been jeopardised by having to carry this financial burden. </para><para>The amendments will enable a person who is, or is likely to become, an executor or administrator of a deceased approved pharmacist's estate, to be granted permission to supply pharmaceutical benefits to the community, and to receive payment for that supply.</para><para>Finally, the Bill makes minor amendments to the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995 and the Health Insurance Amendment (Diagnostic Imaging, Radiation Oncology and Other Measures) Act 2003 to correct drafting errors.</para><para>—————</para><para><inline ref="R2007">AGRICULTURAL AND VETERINARY CHEMICALS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (NAME CHANGE) BILL 2004</inline></para><para>The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment (Name Change) Bill 2004 (the bill) amends a suite of legislation:</para><para>	to change the name of the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals to the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority; and </para><para>	to introduce measures to protect the logo of the APVMA and its name from inappropriate use. </para><para>The National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals, or NRA, is the authority responsible for the national system of approvals and registrations underpinning the national agricultural and veterinary chemicals regime.</para><para>For some time, the NRA has expressed views that the title of the organisation does not adequately reflect its purpose, nor is it consistent with international nomenclature practised by other international chemical regulators and within the OECD, which sets the international standards and benchmarks for chemicals management.</para><para>In addition, a survey in 1998/99 demonstrated that the name of the organisation was not well known beyond chemical manufacturers and was often confused with the National Rifleman's Association in the USA.</para><para>Finally, the proposed amendments include provisions in the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994 for the protection of the name of the APVMA, its initials, and its symbol (that is, the APVMA logo).  </para><para>The APVMA may give consent in writing to the use of its name, its initials or its symbol. </para><para>The proposal mirrors the protection given under the Trade Marks Act 1995 suitably adapted to the APVMA circumstances. </para><para>This is a very simple bill that will assist in this Government's multiple-pronged approach to generating greater awareness of responsible chemical use amongst not only the user community but also the manufacturing industry.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mackay</inline>) adjourned.</para><para>Ordered that the bills be listed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> as separate orders of the day.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PARLIAMENTARY SUPERANNUATION BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>23204</page.no><id.no>R2028</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>PARLIAMENTARY SUPERANNUATION AND OTHER ENTITLEMENTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R2027</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>23204</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bills received from the House of Representatives.</para><para>Senator IAN CAMPBELL (Western Australia—Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads) (9.46 a.m.)—I move:</para><motion><para>That these bills may proceed without formalities, may be taken together and be now read a first time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bills read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>23204</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>23204</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That these bills be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>I seek leave to have the second reading speeches incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speeches read as follows—</inline></para><para><inline ref="R2028">PARLIAMENTARY SUPERANNUATION BILL 2004</inline></para><para>The Parliamentary Superannuation Bill 2004 is part of a package of two Bills.

We have seen the abuse of prisoners in Iraq, and now we have on the Internet an obscene and disgusting response with the decapitation of an American overnight—appalling behaviour—in the misguided name of some higher authority, totally abandoning human precepts and human principles and with no excuse whatsoever. Such conduct can never be accommodated and no reasoning goes any way towards allowing for it. It is of international concern. What sort of world do we have? What sort of world are we handing on to our kids if, very often in the name of the religion which guides many of the principles that we have in our global civilisation, we have this unseemly humiliation, torture and death of people held in custody—very often people who are entirely innocent.</para><para>For our part, the detention and the humiliating and degrading treatment—including, we are led to believe, outright torture—of some prisoners in Iraq and, I believe, also in Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay demand a national response. In particular they demand a response from Prime Minister Howard. It is under his government that our involvement in Afghanistan—and therefore the holding of prisoners in Guantanamo Bay—and now our involvement in Iraq has taken place. All these things have been on the authority of this government—not this parliament, I might add, but this government. It is extraordinarily important that this parliament have from the Prime Minister an explanation of the action he has undertaken to try to prevent the abuse of prisoners in these several places and the action that he is planning to undertake to circumvent further abuse, humiliation or torture of prisoners—whoever they might be, guilty or not guilty, whatever they might have allegedly done—because these acts are not acceptable in Australian society and by extension are not acceptable in conflicts in which Australia is involved. It is just simply not on.</para><para>The question is to our Prime Minister and our government: when did you know about these abuses taking place? What action did you take? And what action are you now going to take through the Prime Minister's special relationship with both Prime Minister Blair and President George W. Bush? From where I sit, the Prime Minister's reaction has been far short of that required. Certainly he has expressed disgust and he has answered questions from journalists. But where is the statement from the Prime Minister on behalf of this nation, the special dedicated statement of abhorrence of what is happening, an explanation to our nation of the actions taken by this Prime Minister to prevent these acts in the past and now to ensure that they do not happen in the future? Where is the assurance that he has spoken to George W. Bush or to Tony Blair, the Prime Minister of Great Britain, about these matters? We have not heard that from the Prime Minister of Australia. This nation deserves that from its leadership, and it is not getting it.</para><para>There is clear evidence that the government knew that prisoners were being held in appalling conditions in Baghdad and elsewhere as far back as the middle of last year from Amnesty International and that from the International Committee of the Red Cross came repeated reports to the governments of the coalition of the willing. Let us have from the government information about when it got these reports, to whom they went and what consideration and reaction was given about people left out in blistering heat, about people being burnt because of the surfaces on which they were left, about prisoners being deprived and, of course, about the emerging pictures of the appalling misconduct of the keepers of these prisoners that has now become a worldwide scandal. </para><para>These are not matters of small moment or just matters of some moral judgment on what has happened in these prisons. They go directly to the safety of our own Defence Force personnel and of Australian civilians in Iraq, in Afghanistan and elsewhere around the world. They require greater action than we have seen from the Prime Minister, from the Minister for Foreign Affairs or from the Minister for Defence. I believe it is incumbent upon the Senate, in the absence of an explanation from the government, that we investigate these matters, that we find out from the government what the truth of the matter is. When did the government become acquainted with the mistreatment of prisoners and what action did it take? On the record at the moment it appears that no action was taken by the government until the matter surfaced in the public arena. That is totally unacceptable. That is neither in the interests of this country nor in the interests of our Defence Force personnel acting on behalf of this country, and on the authority of the Prime Minister, in Iraq and elsewhere. I want to see action and I believe that the Senate and this committee is the right place for us to get at the facts from which action can flow.</para><para>I believe this government has not acted sufficiently or adequately or directly or appropriately on these matters of abuse of prisoners in Afghanistan, in Iraq or in Guantanamo Bay. How can we have had leaders of the three countries—Australia, Britain and the United States—not comment on that very public exhibition of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay with hoods over their heads, with chains on their ankles and feet, kneeling in the sun, and the accompanying news of the 24-hour lights-on lockdown prison conditions to which they were subject in Guantanamo Bay? There was not one squeak out of our Prime Minister—nothing. Indeed, quite the reverse. There were words of inherent approval that this was happening in Guantanamo Bay not just to 600 prisoners from around the world—many of whom we know, most of whom we must presume, are not guilty of a crime because they have not been charged and many have since been released—but also to two Australians, Mr Hicks and Mr Habib. They are held there in breach of the Geneva conventions by the President of the United States. They are being held without contact with their relatives and loved ones, without access to legal advice. We know they are being held in conditions of sensory deprivation. We do not know about physical abuse—hoods on heads, manacles, the sorts of breaches that would never be allowed in Australia. The public would never allow that for prisoners in Australian detention.</para><para>But our Prime Minister allowed to be fully published before the whole world Australian prisoners being held by the United States in Guantanamo Bay. When that breach of international rules was allowed, where did our Prime Minister then draw the line? Having left the jailers at Guantanamo Bay with no new line of civilised behaviour towards prisoners, particularly prisoners who had not been charged and therefore must be assumed to be innocent, when the rules were withdrawn where did our Prime Minister draw a new line? He did not. Where did President George W. Bush draw a new line? He did not. Where was the inherent new line drawn for those people running prisoners in Afghanistan or in Iraq? It was not. There was a monumental responsibility on Prime Minister Howard, if he was going to allow the flouting of the Geneva conventions for Australians held in captivity, to draw a new line, to instruct the jailers inherently if not directly on where the Australian government would draw this new line. But none was drawn. The Prime Minister was derelict in not drawing new rules if he believed the Geneva convention rules should be flouted in the way that they were being flouted. </para><para>So we now have in Iraq—and I believe it will flow on to Guantanamo Bay—investigations of an absolute failure to treat prisoners in a way civilisation would demand. Whatever else inquiries in the US or elsewhere may find, this is abundantly clear: President George W. Bush authorised the breach of international rules for treating prisoners and left no new line, no new set of rules. He lifted the rules and must, in that sense, bear his share of responsibility for what has happened. I say right here and now: this government should immediately demand that the Geneva conventions be applied in any conflict in which Australia is involved. Those rules must also apply as a minimum to civilians caught up in those conflicts and apprehended, whether by Australians or whether by people of other nationalities; otherwise, no law applies. The matter will test us for a long time to come.</para><para>But the Senate has a high responsibility to ensure we get at the truth of the matter, and we have not got at the truth of the matter as to what the government and the Prime Minister knew and as to the action that they should or could have taken or did or did not take as the information came in. I do not accept that because information was on the public record somehow or other, it was okay for the government not to take action—that everybody new about it in some way or other so the government did not have to take action. That is what the government has elected to do, and that is the responsibility of leadership. Nor do I accept the argument that the other side is worse, therefore we can abandon the rules. That is entirely what we are not about. We are about liberty, democracy and the rule of law. As we apply it at home, we should apply it in our actions elsewhere around the world.</para><para>Finally, as I brought out in question time yesterday, what a remarkable situation that there are 20,000 prisoners in Iraq—and we are told that up to 90 per cent of them are innocent: they have been civilians caught up in the wrong place at the wrong time, and they include many women—who do not have the Geneva conventions protecting them, except for one, and a few of his associates, and that is Saddam Hussein. This extraordinary situation has arisen because our leaders did not stick by the international rules and ensure that they were abided by. Saddam Hussein is being treated better than innocent civilians kept in Iraqi jails under the authority of the coalition of the willing. What an extraordinary situation for our Prime Minister, the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of Great Britain to allow to develop.</para><para>We must act swiftly, strongly, diligently and with great responsibility to take the action that our Prime Minister has not taken. That begins with getting at the facts of the matter as best we can. I cannot see a better way of doing that than through the authority of this Senate and the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee. The time to do it is now—not in a month's time, not after the elections, not some time next year and not at the end of 2005, which is when, we are told, the commitment so far for the United States to keep its forces in Iraq is paid up till. The time to act on this is now. This is a very, very important motion, and I appeal to the Senate to support it. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>23209</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Brown is right: this is an absolutely critical matter. The proposed issues to be canvassed, as outlined by Senator Brown early in his speech, are—to use his words—`absolutely critical'. I do not wish to repeat comments I made at some length in this chamber on Tuesday afternoon, but it is true that the situation in relation to the treatment of certain Iraqi prisoners is utterly horrific, and this Senate has passed a very strong motion in relation to those matters.</para></talk.start><para>What the Senate is now dealing with is the question, in terms of Senate processes, of how we deal with the Australian government response to those issues: when information was received, how it came to the attention of ministers, what assurances we have received that there would be no Australian involvement in these matters, the question of Australia's response when these matters became known to government, and a range of other associated important issues. They are important; they are significant. As far as the opposition is concerned, as this Senate chamber and the Australian people know, we do not underplay them at all.</para><para>Senator Brown said in the conclusion to his speech that he cannot see a better way of getting to the truth of these matters than referring these issues to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee for inquiry and report. I can; I think there is a significantly better way. I would commend to the Senate that the Senate use the best accountability mechanism it has available to it, the best accountability mechanism in this Australian parliament, in fact the best accountability mechanism of any Australian parliament—the Senate estimates process—to thoroughly investigate these matters. There would be times when I would not say that, because we have only three rounds of Senate estimates committees in each year. But the truth is that in just a few days the Senate will be examining the budget estimates. We will be back here the week after next for two full weeks of examination of government departments and agencies. There is not a better mechanism available for us to thoroughly scrutinise the government and its agencies on these issues.</para><para>Senator Brown says, not unreasonably, that parliament must have an explanation from Prime Minister Howard. That is not an unreasonable thing for Senator Brown to say. But Senator Brown knows—and, if he does not, he should know—that you will not get an explanation from Prime Minister Howard on these issues. That is why in this chamber we use other mechanisms to try to get to the truth, the facts, that relate to these sorts of issues—and the best mechanism we have is the Senate estimates committees. They are meeting the week after next for two full weeks, when not only responsible ministers but also responsible heads of agencies and other officers of the Commonwealth will be present and will be required to answer questions from senators about these issues. That is the sensible way of dealing with this particular matter. That is not to say, of course, that further examination of these issues will not be warranted. It may well be. I do not necessarily say that a Senate references committee is the best place to do it—I do not know. I want to see what information is gleaned through an exhaustive examination of agencies during the Senate estimates committees budget round. </para><para>I am also not sure that there are not other matters, if the Senate so decides, that need to be examined, but I think we will be in a much stronger position in literally a matter of days to make those sorts of assessments. When you have a very good accountability mechanism, the best accountability mechanism in the parliament, isn't it smart for senators to use that mechanism in the first instance? Isn't that a clever thing to do? I would have thought so. I would say that the Senate has proved capable of doing just that. Take, for example, the issue in this parliament that I think received the greatest focus in the Senate committee system, and that is the issue of children overboard. Remember what happened. There was extensive examination of government agencies in the estimates committees on matters relating to that incident, and following that the Senate Select Committee on A Certain Maritime Incident set about its work. I think that is a pretty reasonable model to adopt on a matter of such significance as the extraordinarily serious matter of children overboard.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator Bartlett</name></talker><para>—It was so good they made a play about it.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—Yes, they did make a play about it, Senator Bartlett.

The point is that the CMI committee did an exhaustive, thorough job, but it followed very significant attention to this issue at Senate estimates. That is a good model to adopt. I think the right thing for us to do here is to use the budget estimates round—two solid weeks of questioning of government agencies—to further examine these issues and then make an assessment of what further action the Senate should take and what the issues that should be examined might be.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The way to do this is to adjourn this particular matter and determine it on the next day of sitting. There are all sorts of procedural devices that can be used at times to achieve this. The only way it can be done in a reasonable fashion so that there can be a full debate in the chamber on this important matter that Senator Brown has raised is for an adjournment motion to be moved. I have asked Senator Mackay, as the Opposition Whip, to do that at the conclusion of the debate so that any senator who wishes to make a contribution to this can. The impact of that would be that this matter would come on for discussion in the Senate on the next day of sitting—in other words, the first day of sitting after the Senate estimates round. I hope I have got that right. If I were wrong about that, no doubt the clerk would advise me; but I am confident. The clerk has nodded his head—it is a pity that was not on television—so I am reinforced. I am thankful that I have not misled the Senate in relation to that procedural advice. That is the only way to do this sensibly, and that is what Senator Mackay will do on behalf of the opposition. I think that is a perfectly proper, sensible and intelligent way of dealing with these issues which do have the utmost significance. </para><para>While I agree with much of what Senator Brown has said, my conclusions are different in a process sense—on how to deal with them. I think the approach of the opposition is a sensible one. I think it is the proper one. I would be disappointed if we were to bypass our best accountability mechanism on this occasion. With the benefit of a great deal more information we can make a proper assessment on the next day of sitting about how to progress this matter in relation to any future inquiry. That is the approach I commend to the Senate. I think it makes sense and ensures, as is always the opposition's objective, maximum accountability—maximum opportunity to hold the Howard government accountable on these important matters.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>23211</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This is a very crucial matter of fundamental importance. It is of such fundamental importance that I moved on behalf of the Democrats at the first available opportunity a motion of urgency condemning the mistreatment of prisoners in Iraq and calling for action. I am pleased that the Senate shared our views and stated a shared position that this was utterly unacceptable, that action must be taken to ensure that it does not happen again and that it must be fully and properly investigated. The Democrats are totally of the view that the mistreatment of prisoners by coalition forces in Iraq must be fully investigated in every way. That includes, of course, what the Australian government knew, when they knew it and what they did about it. That must happen, and the Democrats support every mechanism being pursued to ensure that it happens.</para></talk.start><para>The motion before us at the moment is specifically to establish a distinct inquiry by a Senate committee to examine some of those questions. I want to make it quite clear that the Democrats support Senate committees inquiring into these matters. Our view is the same as Senator Faulkner's: that a Senate committee will be inquiring into these matters within the next fortnight. The matter is already referred, in effect, to a Senate committee and will be examined extensively by a Senate committee through the budget estimates process. Senator Faulkner is right in saying that that will provide the best way to explore not just the questions that are put forward in these terms of reference but also a whole range of other questions and at the conclusion of that process we will be much better placed to determine what the next necessary step is. If the government's performance in the parliament this week is anything to go by, there will continue to be dodging of questions, misleading and dishonest answers and a general attempt to refuse to accept any responsibility for the behaviour of coalition forces in Iraq.</para><para>I think that is an indictment of this government—one of the biggest indictments amongst many in relation to their dishonesty on so many issues and their refusal to accept responsibility for issues that are their responsibility. I believe this needs to be done not just to hold the government accountable—that is of course essential; it is a key part of what the Senate must do always—but also because I believe that, more than anybody, our troops in Iraq deserve this to be properly investigated. These actions by coalition forces are done in our name—in the name of Australia, which is part of the coalition forces—and our defence personnel in particular are implicated by association through being part of those coalition forces. </para><para>I want to make it absolutely clear that that in no way implies that our troops have been involved in any mistreatment. I make that point pre-emptively to prevent any total misrepresentation by any government speakers now or later about my views on that. In fact, I am not aware of any evidence at all that suggests Australian troops or personnel of any sort have been involved in any of the mistreatment that has come to light. What I am saying is that, because we are part of those coalition forces and part of the governing authority, and obviously part of the invading forces, we are clearly seen to be associated with the activities of the coalition forces and it is done in effect in our name. I think our troops in particular deserve to have this matter properly investigated so that their good reputation can be maintained and so that the damage done to Australia's reputation and to the reputation of the coalition forces and, I might say, to those that seek to promote the rule of law can be minimised. That is my concern. I think it is essential that we examine it in the estimates committee. That is the best way to do it. Once that is done, then we can look at where to go next.

The legislation was only introduced in the House of Representatives yesterday and was guillotined through the House of Representatives yesterday against the wishes of the Labor opposition in the House of Representatives. </para></talk.start><para>I recognise that the one-off payments bill seeks to enable, as the name suggests, a one-off payment to be made to people before 30 June. No doubt the government will use that as a reason for the absolute urgency to consider and pass this bill. The Democrats are very concerned about this process of legislation being introduced one day and rushed through the next. It is not simple, straightforward, one-line legislation. It is very significant, complex legislation. The government would be well aware—even more importantly, many, many Australian families are well aware—that there are significant flaws in the existing legislation dealing with family payments because it is very complex and was put through at the time without, in my view, adequate scrutiny. A lot of people have been paying the price ever since.</para><para>To repeat that performance and rush through something without any scrutiny at all—and let us be honest here: there will be no serious opportunity for scrutiny of the complexity of this legislation if it is rushed through today—is of concern to the Democrats. That is what this cut-off motion is about. As I understand it, looking a little more closely at the standing orders, the session this week is actually a single session in its own right as a budget session and when we come back in June it is a new session. So the only impact of this motion is to enable it to be debated today. The Democrats are not seeking to hold this up. We are seeking to ensure that it actually gets some respect and is properly examined and that the Australian people, quite frankly, get some respect and have these proposals properly examined. </para><para>There are two bills which seek to exempt the cut-off. I would ask that the question for those two bills be put separately. We will very reluctantly but nonetheless accede to allowing the one-off payment bill to be debated straightaway. We will agree to that. But the other legislation that deals with the broader range of payments and changes to family arrangements should, at a minimum, be examined by the Senate committee process.</para><para>Senator Faulkner has just said, in relation to the previous question we were talking about, that we will be examining the budget estimates in just a few days. As we all know, the budget estimates can be used to cover a range of issues. We have just been talking about using them to examine the behaviour of coalition forces in Iraq. But the primary, absolutely fundamental first purpose of estimates is to examine budget proposals: how they are going to work, what the costs are going to be and who is going to be affected. </para><para>Whether what the government says the legislation does is what will actually happen is debatable. We have had problems with family payments legislation to date. The legislation was introduced and it was said that it would work a certain way and be wonderful. Then we found out that it has not worked that way. A lot of people have had difficulties. It is our job—forget about the politics of it—to have a look at this to make sure that, at a minimum, it will do what it says it is going to do and there are not going to be unintended consequences. It is almost inevitable that in an area we all know is complex you will get unintended consequences if you just rush it through solely to suit the Prime Minister's election timetable and the political timetable of the major parties.</para><para>I know the Labor Party objected in the House of Representatives yesterday to it being rushed through. I have just seen a press release from the member for Lyons, Mr Dick Adams, complaining about being gagged before he even got through a couple of paragraphs of his speech on this legislation and saying that the government obviously do not want criticism of their bill because it is getting too close to the truth. At least in the Senate we get a chance to talk about these things. That is one advantage we have over the House of Representatives. But let us not sell ourselves shorter than we need to. We have budget estimates. Senator Collins in particular has quite a good record of forensically examining all these sorts of things. I do not want her to miss out on that opportunity by having this pushed through. All the questions will still be asked, but there is hardly any point if the legislation has already gone through.</para><para>I do not think it is acceptable to say, `We will put it all through now and then we will see how it is going to work and fix it up later.' I could go on for many hours about the number of pieces of flawed law that currently exist that have been pushed through and about which it has been said, `We will sort it out later if it does not work.' There is no rewind button on legislation and it is very hard to fix up later. It wastes time and public money and the Australian public have to suffer in the meantime with any flaws.</para><para>We are not supportive of rushing this through at all. I know that some of the one-off payments are meant to be paid by 30 June. The government will say that we need to have all the systems in place to enable this money to be doled out. Frankly, I think that is a poor excuse as well. Everybody knows when budget day is. To try to basically defy reality and force through payments overnight purely to suit an election timetable, and for no other reason, is not a terribly good reason to rush through legislation. I am not going to let the government get away with misrepresenting our position by saying that we are trying to deny people getting an immediate assistance payment. So we will not oppose the cut-off and we will enable the immediate debate on the one-off payment bill. We will contribute to that debate of course; we believe there are some changes and improvements that can be made. The broader bill to do with family assistance should be examined by Senate estimates to make sure that the very significant amount of taxpayers' money that is going to be committed as part of that legislation will be spent effectively. </para><para>I do not think any of us can pretend that we will be able to make that judgment properly without, at the minimum, having gone through the budget estimates process. Otherwise we may as well not have scrutiny of these sorts of things. Normally, legislation of this significance would go to a legislation committee charged specifically with examining that bill and nothing else. However, the Democrats, as always, are willing to be constructive and flexible. We are not simply trying to get in the way; in fact we are trying to facilitate even better legislation. So we would like the question on the two bills to be put and voted on separately. Let me be clear: we are not seeking to hold up the second piece of legislation, the so-called more help for families—increased payments bill, but we want to ensure that it is not rushed through the Senate before the budget estimates process. We simply seek to adjourn the question on the second bill until the first day of sittings after the budget estimates committee hearings—which, as I understand it, would be 15 June. I do not know whether procedurally that is something we can do now or when the question is put.</para><para>To make our position crystal clear, the Democrats are willing, with some reluctance, to support the motion for the immediate debate on the one-off payments bill but wish to amend the motion in relation to the second bill, to do with the broader changes to family assistance, in order to have that motion enabling the cut-off to be deferred or adjourned until the first day of sittings after the budget estimates committee hearings, which is 15 June. That is the next day of sittings anyway, so we are putting it off for one sitting day to enable the budget estimates committees to do their job, to enable the Senate to do its job and to at least give the legislation some degree of examination. I think that is the absolute minimum that the Senate should insist on to enable us to exercise the responsibilities we are elected by the people to carry out.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Steve (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Hutchins)</inline>—We will divide the question on the bills.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>23215</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Acting Deputy President, I was about to commence my comments, before you indicated what we would do with respect to the question, by saying that it would be in the hands of the Senate, but Labor's position is that we will support the cut-off with respect to both bills—the <inline ref="R2043">Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (More Help for Families—One-off Payments) Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2044">Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (More Help for Families—Increased Payments) Bill 2004</inline>. If we end up doing that through a process of splitting the question and then opposing a move to adjourn the debate on the second bill, so be it. Labor's position is clearly that we will be supporting the cut-off with respect to both bills. However, following Senator Bartlett's comments, there are a few comments that I should make. We, too, are doing this somewhat reluctantly. We acknowledge all of the concerns that Senator Bartlett has just highlighted—and, indeed, his compliments as well; thank you, Senator Bartlett. </para></talk.start><para>However, no matter how much questioning I do in Senate estimates or how much time the opposition has with respect to this bill, we will find the same problems that we have found with the family benefits system under this government time and time again. Unfortunately, no amount of time or Senate scrutiny will change some of the basic facts. These basic facts were best highlighted in an opinion piece in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian </inline>today by Neil Warren. I bring to the attention of the Senate chamber the opening comments in that piece:</para><quote><para>The Government has squandered the chance to use its sizeable surplus to fund substantive tax and welfare reforms ... </para></quote><para>This budget does not include those substantive reforms that the government itself has paraded it would achieve in this term—and in fact in the last term. All we have are short-term fixes and election bribes. No amount of Senate estimates questioning and no amount of discussion in this chamber, unfortunately, are going to change that.</para><para>What we do have, though, is the opportunity to change some other things. We have the opportunity to change today the financial pressures that many Australian families have been suffering under this government. This budget does—albeit in a fairly clumsy, short-term-fix type way—offer some support for which families have been desperate for many, many years. Whilst Senator Bartlett referred to one Senate sitting day, most of us realise that that actually equates to a period of time of four weeks. I know that Centrelink have given some assurances that, even were we to delay some of this process until the first week of our sittings in June, they could still effect the 1 July time frame. I am a little more sceptical about Centrelink's administration processes and guarantees that they might be able to give to that effect. Labor will do nothing which will delay desperately needed financial support for Australian families.</para><para>I highlighted in the chamber yesterday that the last time we had any improvement in maternity benefits for Australian families was in 1995—when I first came into the Senate—when Labor introduced the maternity allowance. Australian families have waited since 1995, almost nine years, for any improvement in their maternity benefits. We will not delay that. Unfortunately, these bills do not include the child-care measures provided for in the budget, because this government has allowed 40,000 child-care places to build up without providing for them over the last several years. That is why it can now say, `We will give 40,000 outside school hours care places.' Families have been waiting for those places for several years. Many of us know families who have been sitting on child-care waiting lists for several years. Labor will have no role in holding up, for any period of time at all, any desperately needed, albeit clumsy, measures by this government—measures made in an attempt to bribe voters in the lead-up to an election. I have a little more confidence in the Australian public—because they will remember what the government did at the last election. They will remember the $1,000 election bribe that was offered in the lead-up to the last election and they will see that the $600 offered this time is just a slightly different version of what the government ran last time. A $1,000 bribe in the lead-up to the election is now a $600 bribe and then another $600 afterwards; so that is $1,200.</para><para>The only thing they have learnt this time is that people are a little more cynical and they know that the system continues to roll family tax debts year after year. So the variation the government have come up with this time is that, rather than giving people no dollars in a non-election year, they are giving them $600 in a non-election year. But they still have not fixed the system. The average debt is $900 and the payment will be $600, so families will still have family tax debts of $300. No scrutiny of these bills will change that fact. No amount of questioning in Senate estimates and no amount of debate in this chamber will change that fact but we can at least ensure that that money will go into the pockets of Australian families. That is why Labor will support the cut-off motion with respect to both bills to effect those changes as soon as possible. </para><para>I certainly empathise with Senator Bartlett's comments, though, about the process. I think Mr Swan has made the same points in the other place. This process is absolutely atrocious. Again, we have a bit more confidence in the Australian public's political literacy. They will see what this is. They know that the Treasurer is seeking to buy their votes. I hope the Australian public get this support and I hope they get it in a very timely way but, as some of the press reports have indicated over the last couple of days, they know what this government has delivered—the hardship that has been delivered over several years for Australian families. So let us get them the support they need as quickly as possible. I think they can see through this approach—and let us hope that the government feels that as well.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Steve (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Hutchins)</inline>—The question is that the motion be agreed to in relation to the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (More Help for Families—One-off Payments) Bill 2004.</para></talk.start><para>Question agreed to.</para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—The question is that the motion be agreed to in relation to the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (More Help for Families—Increased Payments) Bill 2004.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>23217</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Rather than vote against that I would like to move that the question be adjourned.

The introduction of A New Tax System saw these effective marginal tax rates reduced significantly. The measures in this bill will reduce them further.</para><para>The specific measures contained in the bill are:</para><para>	An ongoing increase in the maximum and base rates of family tax benefit Part A of $600 per child, payable as a lump sum when families lodge their tax returns for the 2003-04 income year and later years. </para><para>-	As well as providing extra assistance to families, this lump sum will be available, if required, to offset any family assistance overpayment that may have occurred during a previous income year.</para><para>	A reduction in the rate at which family tax benefit Part A is withdrawn from the maximum rate to the base rate, from 30 cents in the dollar to 20 cents in the dollar. </para><para>-	The lower taper rate will apply from 1 July 2004.</para><para>	An increase in the amount of income a secondary earner in a partnered relationship can earn before entitlement to family tax benefit Part B is affected, from $1825 to $4000.

The new payment of $3000 will be payable as a lump sum to all mothers, regardless of income, from 1 July 2004.

The Government has taken significant steps to improve rewards for working families since coming to office. The measures contained in this bill add to this in a major way. Since 1996, the amount of assistance through family tax benefit Part A and its predecessors will have increased by over 100% in real terms with the inclusion of the additional $600 per child per year provided for in this bill. The measures are also a concrete expression of this Government's commitment to assisting families with their work and family responsibilities. They provide greater choice for families in balancing their work and family responsibilities, through the new universal maternity payment, which will provide extra support for families with a new baby. In addition, the substantial increase in the level of tax-free assistance for families with dependent children in receipt of family tax benefit Part A and the changes to the income threshold and withdrawal rates for family tax benefit Part B will mean that couple families can increase their level of paid work without losing entitlement to benefits.</para><para>—————</para><para><inline ref="R2043">FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MORE HELP FOR FAMILIES—ONE-OFF PAYMENTS) BILL 2004</inline></para><para>The measures contained in this bill and the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (More Help for Families—Increased Payments) Bill 2004 represent the largest package of assistance for families ever.

For the government to come forward in this way and seek to progress legislation as we have just discussed, with the pace and process that it has, can only alarm many people. I stressed earlier, though, that we support any support getting into the pockets of Australian families as soon as possible but there are going to be countless questions—some of which I will refer to if I get the time in this second reading contribution—and concerns about the application of these bills. That is beyond the broader question, which is: what do the bills really do to solve the problems in the system itself? We know the bills do a minimal amount.</para></talk.start><para>Let me start by concentrating on what the bills involve. The Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (More Help for Families—One-off Payments) Bill 2004 contains five elements. Firstly, there is an ongoing payment of $600 annually for each family tax benefit child, to be paid as a lump sum on income reconciliation for the 2003-04 income years and later years. That is the lesson the government learnt from their last election bribe of the $1,000 waiver—people understand that the system rolls on regardless of whether it is an election year or not—and now the government have proposed to pay $600 in the later years as well.</para><para>Secondly, the bill involves a reduction in the rate at which family tax benefit part A reduces from the maximum rate to the base rate—from 30c in the dollar to 20c in the dollar. This is a good measure. It is desperately needed by families because the work disincentives involved in women returning to work and the amount of family support they lose in the process has been a significant and growing problem for some time. It is a problem that the Prime Minister has been promising to address for some time but we waited and waited and, as everybody knows, the family benefits barbecue went cold. It is good to see we have a little bit of warmth through this measure. </para><para>The next element is a new maternity payment of $3,000 and the phasing out of the baby bonus. Of course everybody knows now, and finally the government cannot pretend not to understand, that the baby bonus was an enormous flop and did not work. This new measure is going to provide significant support for Australian women having children but again I highlight, as I said before, that the last time there was any support for women having children was when Labor introduced the maternity allowance in 1995. The changes that were meant to occur after that to improve that level of support have stagnated under the Howard government until today. Of course we welcome the fact that this measure is now here but highlight that, gee, it has been a long time coming—certainly much longer than the gestation period for a baby.</para><para>The fourth element of the first bill is a reduction in the rate at which the family tax benefit part B is withdrawn, from 30c in the dollar to 20c in the dollar—again a good measure, particularly for women returning to work. The fifth element is an increase in the amount of income a secondary earner in a partnered relationship can earn before entitlement to family tax benefit part B is affected, from $1,825 to $4,000 annually. This recognises that many people—because it is men as well as women who are the primary carers of children—do and can earn some small amounts of income to support their family's wellbeing. The punishment that those families have suffered for many years any time they have earned some small amounts of money is finally being loosened just that little bit.</para><para>The second of these bills makes provision for the three one-off payments that will be generally paid in June 2004. There will be a one-off payment of $600 per child to families receiving family tax benefit part A, a one-off payment of $1,000 to recipients of carer payments on budget night 2004 and a one-off payment to recipients of carer allowance on budget night, generally payable as an amount of $600 for each person who attracts carer allowance. In all of this there is very little good policy to show for three years of almost endless boasting about how work and family would be a priority. The government's commitment to match Labor's baby care payment is of course welcome. Its limited reforms to the tapers for family tax benefit parts A and B will also benefit some families, and we would never oppose measures, however limited, that put money in the pockets of struggling families. But it must be said again that the bulk of what the government has produced here is just a short-term political fix.</para><para>In its eight years in office, the Howard government has failed to protect the financial interests of Australian families. Before the last election the Prime Minister promised his third term would rectify this neglect but those three years have been wasted, as Neil Warren highlighted in the<inline font-style="italic"> Australian</inline> today. Since the introduction of the GST Australian families have wrestled with a family payment system that is deeply flawed and will continue to be deeply flawed. In the three years in which the scheme has operated 1,639,378 overpayments have been issued. Around 600,000—one in three receiving payments—have received a debt each year since the scheme began. Fancy a scheme that manages, year by year, 600,000 debts! Why can't the government fix that? The government in this process has screwed $1.5 billion out of these families, and no advertising campaign is going to fix that. That is an average of $900 per family per year which this system continues to claw back. </para><para>It is no wonder the government's backbench have been concerned about this issue, and I am surprised not to hear more grumbling from their backbench about how this fundamental problem has not been fixed. Families will continue to accrue more and more debts. They may get $600 reductions to their debts but they will still accrue debts. The cause of the problem in this system is the requirement that families estimate their income a year in advance. This has not changed. The government has recognised in some areas that this is the fundamental problem in the system but it has not fixed the problem. So families whose incomes fluctuate—and that is most families, a growing number of Australian families—will still run the risk of underestimating their income and they will still accrue a debt.</para><para>Think of the example I raised in question time yesterday. A family estimates its income; it has three kids, one of whom is an older teenager at school who decides to take up a job. Whack! And it is not fixed. Whack goes the family budget simply because its child decided to make the transition from school to work. How ludicrous! The reason John Howard is offering families two $600 payments before the election and only one after is that he knows that in the run-up to the election families are going to get debts averaging $900. After the election of course the government will not care that the annual payment will not cover the size of the debts that families accrue. So we have, as I have said, this short-term political fix—a cynical ploy aimed at winning an election that does not meet the long-term financial needs of Australian families.</para><para>We know from leaked cabinet documents that the government was provided with a series of work and family policy options almost two years ago. This included the need for a baby care payment, extra child-care places and family payment reforms. We know that the policy work is being done within the department, but John Howard and his government have sat on these proposals. He did not want to spend any money on families until two minutes before he asked them for their vote. Is it any wonder that this sort of material is being leaked? Those public servants who have been concerned about genuine policy interests all this time cannot help but be concerned about the cynicism of a government that sits on the needs of Australian families until two minutes before an election.</para><para>Australian families have been left to fend for themselves for three years. The government's refusal to act has prevented serious reform to the family payments system. Having failed to address the cause of the problem, the government must then put a bandaid on the wound in the face of an election. It is important to note that this new payment, contrary to the government tables published in the last day or so, will not be paid as an additional fortnightly entitlement to families. It is a new payment, a tack on, and it is not paid week to week when families need it. The misrepresentation that has occurred in the cameos about families that have been put out by the government is atrocious. To me, the most obvious flaw in them is that, 12 months in advance, they have been trying to convince people that they will get tax relief that simply will not be there. It is one argument that a pro rata $600 payment is added into the yearly rate when most people will end up losing much of it in debt, but to then count forward tax relief that simply will not occur for another 12 months is outrageous.</para><para>After eight years, the Howard government has still failed to address the tax and benefit traps that rob families of the reward for their hard work. The changes announced by the government fail to make sufficient inroads into incentives and, disturbingly, effective marginal tax rates will actually increase for families moving from welfare to work. Secondary earners in dual low-income families attempting to move into work will see their effective marginal tax rates increase from 87 per cent to 93 per cent—a six per cent increase due to the stacking of family tax B and the partnered parenting payment tapers. Who did the background work here? The Prime Minister promised to deal with effective marginal tax rates and, in this particular case, they will increase—so much for welfare reform. </para><para>Secondary income earners in middle-income families will still not have sufficient reductions. For those with children in child care, marginal tax rates may fall to 100 or 110 per cent from the existing spike of 120 per cent—big deal. To make matters worse, the government's changes are extraordinarily complex. For example, family tax benefit A will now have two withdrawal rates of 20 per cent and 30 per cent. Under the Howard government, almost one million Australians lose more than 60c in each additional dollar they earn. This figure has doubled since 1997 under the Howard government. Three-quarters of those paying high effective marginal tax rates are middle-income families with dependent children. Parents returning to work face effective marginal tax rates of up to 120 per cent after child-care costs are taken into account.</para><para>You do not just need to listen to the opposition highlighting these points, many of which get lost in the complexity. A recent study of 30 OECD countries found Australia had some of the worst work incentives in the Western world. Let me repeat that: Australia had some of the worst work incentives in the Western world. I will cite some. Australia has the third worst performance when examining the work incentives for a couple on average earnings with two children. They lost 61.5c in each additional dollar earned—22.4c more than the OECD median. For a single parent on two-thirds average earnings with two children, Australia was dead last. Single parents lose 70c of each additional dollar earned—32.8c more than the OECD median. The Howard government has yet to come to grips with the failure of its tax and transfer payment reform—its announcements last night were a bandaid.</para><para>I move to carers. The one-off payment for carers is also a pretty obvious election bribe. We have 2.3 million carers in Australia who provide care for those they love. They make sacrifices to improve the quality of life and to care for another person. Clearly, we as a society should value human life. Carers need a long-term national strategy to help them with the problems faced by taking carer responsibilities and this problem will only grow. Unfortunately, the government's budget only delivers, again, short-term fixes. There is nothing in the budget to help carers combine work and carer responsibilities. There is nothing in the package to help carers' education, training and skills development. There is no extra funding for counselling for carers. Carers, through their efforts, save the community more than $20 billion per year. They deserved that bit more.</para><para>Carers contribute to social capital; they build family relationships and help include many disabled and older Australians in the community. They deserve better from this government than an election bribe. John Howard has done nothing for carers in the last three years except leave them prone to savings strategies that his government has finally accepted it should not apply. It has left them at risk wondering where their support was going to go and now, on election eve, they get a bribe. John Howard has saddled thousands of carer payments recipients with large Centrelink debts, which have arisen because of the government's administrative mistakes over the last seven years. He has stripped 30,000 parents caring for children with disabilities of their fortnightly carer allowances. A leaked budget submission showed his minister, Kay Patterson, was planning to cut backdating provisions for carers until Labor exposed what she was up to. </para><para>Carers should expect that a re-elected Howard government will revisit these nasty proposals. They should expect work force age payment reforms to involve a reduction in the generosity of their entitlements. I am glad that carers will get this $1,000, but I fear that the Howard government will go about clawing that money back if they are re-elected.</para><para>In conclusion, the Howard government has failed to meet the challenge posed by changing family life. The scrapping of its unfair baby bonus and its tinkering with the family tax benefit B show that the government knows that its approach to family policy is deeply flawed and out of step with modern families, who are juggling their jobs and their caring of children and others they love. But the real killer—the government's jarring family payments system—has been left unamended. Families will continue to face the pain of a system that asks the impossible of them—to estimate income a year in advance and then be delivered with a large debt at tax time. We know that $600 will not be enough to sponge up these overpayments. Families who know the system will not buy an election year bribe that cannot deliver what they need most—a stable, accurate payment system when they need it and regular payments when they are caring for a child, not a bandaid that withholds the support they desperately need until the end of the financial year. These families will see the government's budget for what it is—an attempt to buy another term of government.</para><para>While we are supporting the bills today, I want to add one caveat. These bills have been brought into the parliament very quickly, and we have had very little time to examine them in detail. To the extent that we are taking the government on trust that there are no hidden clawbacks or tricks in either piece, we reserve our rights in that matter. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>23224</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I also rise to speak on the <inline ref="R2043">Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (More Help for Families—One-off Payments) Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2044">Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (More Help for Families—Increased Payments) Bill 2004</inline>. With remarkable rapidity, these bills were introduced into the other place yesterday afternoon, giving the Senate less than 24 hours to consider their content. This is yet another example of the government rushing legislation through, as Senator Collins has indicated, with insufficient time for the Senate, in its proper role as the house of review, to accord to this bill the deliberate and reasoned consideration that all legislation deserves.</para></talk.start><para>I contrast the unreasonable haste of this bill with the treatment of the <inline ref="R2020">Veterans' Entitlements (Clarke Review) Bill 2004</inline>, which corrects a longstanding lack of parity in the treatment of war disability pensions by Centrelink and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. That bill arose from a promise by the government in 1996 that it would fix the anomaly. The bill has taken eight years to come to the Senate and regrettably has dropped off the list yet again. However, we have before us now a bill which was only announced to the Australian people 36 hours ago and which is now being rushed through the parliament, giving us little chance to really consider it.</para><para>That we are told that the bill contains one-off bonuses for Australians in the very appealing form of a lump sum payment does not automatically make it infallible, as we will demonstrate later. Nor does it justify the bill being railroaded through to reduce its proper scrutiny by the Senate. The Democrats strongly assert that the government's action in gagging the debate on this bill in the House of Representatives yesterday, followed by the insistence that it be given less than cursory attention by the Senate, is a sheer abuse of the parliamentary process. You cannot get a more important issue to the Australian people than help for families. There is an opportunity for us to get better results for the Australian people. If that can be done, the Democrats will do that and will not be bullied by the government into abrogating the role of the Senate. </para><para>The Democrats certainly welcome the one-off payment to families of $600 per child and the increase in family payment. At the same time, it is disappointing that the budget offers family assistance to those who need it but offers tax cuts to those who do not. While most families will get around $600 a year, or roughly $11.50 per week, from the passage of the bill, high-income earners get on average an extra $42 per week in tax cuts. At the same time as the government purports to assist families, its failure to introduce paid maternity leave and to adequately fund child care in the budget will override the benefits and incentives the budget delivers to working families through any improvements to the family benefit payments and these one-off bonuses.</para><para>What Australian families win today, they risk losing tomorrow. Families with young kids will no doubt find many uses for the one-off payment but the tax cuts mean that in the future they will be hard pressed to pay for the health and education of their children. Of course, not all families will be able to spend the bonus, as they will have to put it towards repaying Centrelink debts they incurred in the problem-fraught family tax benefit income estimate system. We welcome the $600 to be paid to families as a one-off payment. However, it remains that paying the $600 increase next year, only after families have reconciled their family tax benefit, thinly disguises the reality that the unnecessary complexity of the FTB total income estimate system creates an overpayment and the government has done nothing to rectify that complexity. It is, in essence, compulsory deferring of a statutory entitlement, thereby denying families the opportunity to receive the increase when they need it on a weekly basis from 1 July 2004.</para><para>The average family tax payment debt is now $900. These are not families who rort the system. For many, the overpayment could not have been prevented, because the change in their circumstances came to them late in the financial year and could never have been anticipated. The fact remains that most of the $1,200 for families provided by these bills will simply be eaten away by the FTB debts. This very much suggests that more fundamental reform of the income test is what is really needed. Regrettably, we were unable to achieve the major legislative amendment that these bills required for that reform in less than 24 hours, as the government is asking us to do today. Nor is it true that all families will benefit to the same degree from the changes announced in the bill. Children get more expensive as they get older, especially in teenage years. The bill does not significantly improve payments for struggling families with older children. A family with a main breadwinner on, say, $30,000 to $40,000 a year with one child under 16 and a 16-year-old on youth allowance loses 68c for every extra dollar when their partner starts work, even with the improved income taper of family tax benefit proposed in this bill. They receive nothing from tax cuts. </para><para>Furthermore, in relation to poverty traps, the fact that this government has amended family payments but not youth allowance is also significant, particularly given that youth allowance has a cumulative income test. The Democrats note that the changes to family tax benefit A are positive in bringing in more low- to middle-income earners and families and also providing women who are the secondary earners in a family with greater incentive to choose to take on more paid work. However, we do have concerns that FTB part B is not income tested and can be paid where the primary income is very high. The Democrats are therefore less enthused about the changes to FTB part B than those to FTB part A in these bills and, whilst supporting them today, would suggest that the funding from FTB part B be reallocated in part.</para><para>We can further improve taper rates and income tests for family tax benefit and introduce new measures for the jobless as they earn so that low-income people can keep more as they work. Again, the time limits imposed on us in railroading these bills, though, prevent us achieving the necessary amendments. However, we give notice that we will closely examine the impact of the legislation and will seek to amend the primary act at a later date to ensure better targeting.</para><para>The bill also provides for bonuses to carers. This is a positive move. For too long now, carers of elderly Australians or those with disabilities have been overlooked. Carers are known as the `silent army', if you like. There are more than 2.5 million carers in Australia, and governments have an obligation to try to meet their unique needs. Carers provide by far the major proportion of both health and community care for people with special needs. Most do so willingly as members of the family or friends and do it for love or duty at a substantial sacrifice to their own life and their own commitments. However, caring often causes stress in financial, practical and emotional terms. For too long, carers have been calling upon the government to recognise their role and to identify key areas of action such as health and social care, information support, young carers and employment. Governments have an obligation to recognise the care that a carer is providing and to listen to the views of the carer in deciding what their requirements are and not to take the carer's contribution for granted.</para><para>We Democrats know that it is no exaggeration to say that carers are the backbone of our whole community care system. We simply could not manage without the vital work that they do. The bill, however, while paying them a $1,000 bonus, does nothing to recognise the crucial role of carers as partners in providing care, nor does it give them any more rights and recognition than they have ever had in the past. The Democrats for the most part welcome the changes for carers. While these bills do not fully compensate carers for their work—in fact, they come nowhere near it—the carer bonus of $1,000 or $600, the removal of the coresidency rules for carer allowance, new initiatives for young carers and the recognition of ageing carers who are caring for their sons and daughters with disabilities are all welcome moves.</para><para>There is, however, a glaring oversight in the payment of the $1,000 up-front bonus to carers. Certainly carer payment is made to people who provide constant care in the home of the person under care—adults and children with a severe disability or medical condition which requires such care. But there are many people who have a primary entitlement to another social security income support, such as the age pension, disability support pension or parenting payment single, who are providing the same level of care. Because carer payment is paid at the same rate and income test, there has been no advantage to them swapping to carer payment before today, and Centrelink have advised people of that. To make it worse, social security income support recipients who were on carer payment would have been automatically transferred over to the age pension when they reached the age of 65. </para><para>This budget changes the `no real advantage' rule because the bonus of $1,000 is now only going to be paid to people on carer payment and not other pensions, notwithstanding that they may be providing equal amounts of care. The end result is that the number of people on carer payment is significantly less than the number of people who are actually providing full-time care to disabled and highly dependent family members or friends but who receive other social security income support. This creates the anomaly that the many carers who receive income support payments other than carer payment from Centrelink will miss out on the $1,000 bonus. They may have identical caring responsibilities but, because Centrelink moved them from carer payment onto the age pension, because they have a child and therefore receive parenting payment or because they have a disability and receive disability support pension, they will not receive the $1,000 bonus.</para><para>The carers who miss out on the bonus of $1,000 are the ones who can least afford not to receive it. While not holding up passage of the bill, we Democrats will address this anomaly in the payment system. Our amendment gives a period of about six weeks for people on income support payment to claim carer payment in lieu of their current income support from Centrelink. Provided their claim is lodged before 30 June and they satisfy the caring requirements, they can be granted carer payment, with qualification, backdated to the date of claim and be entitled to receive the bonus. They will not be double-dipping and will not receive two payments, but they will rightly qualify for the bonus.</para><para>The Australian Democrats would rather have not imposed on Centrelink these additional administration obligations over less cumbersome measures. However, this was tempered by the government's insistence that this bill be passed today and dealt with quickly. We call on the government to support this with an information program to ensure that information on qualification for carer payment and the bonus is communicated to carers.</para><para>Recognition for carers and the government's responsibility do not end with the payment of a $1,000 bonus. For many carers, the lack of respite care available to them means they will struggle to find the time to spend it. The payment of bonuses without addressing the ongoing social, economic, health, education and employment problems and needs experienced by carers is simply one-off welfare and we need to move beyond it.</para><para>The Democrats welcome other measures for carers in this bill particularly in providing extra assistance to some particular groups which have been overlooked in the past and did need extra support to carry on caring—although I note that they do not address the fundamental problems of carers that I mentioned earlier. Young people caring for their parents are at most risk of being unable to complete their schooling because of their caring responsibilities. Their eligibility for additional respite during school terms will assist them to remain in education. However, they too will not qualify for the $1,000 bonus. </para><para>Likewise, the provision for increased access to respite for carers over the age of 70 is very welcome. But they are a group that will miss out on the $1,000 bonus because they will largely be age pension recipients. My office receives many heartfelt pleas from elderly parents of children with severe disabilities who write out of sheer desperation and who are weary with fatigue but whose commitment to continue caring is resolute. Four weeks a year respite will be welcome, and we call on the government to ensure that this is available to carers in rural and remote regions of Australia. The Democrats welcome this bill and give notice that we will be moving an amendment in the committee stage. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>23228</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In rising to speak to the <inline ref="R2044">Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (More Help for Families—Increased Payments) Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2043">Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (More Help for Families—One-off Payments) Bill 2004</inline>, I want to mention the way in which they were rushed into the parliament. The government gagged debate on these bills yesterday in the House of Representatives after debate had just begun. The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs snuck these bills into the House of Representatives without notice on Tuesday night following the budget statement and the government is attempting to push them through both houses of parliament in just two days. It is very odd, given that this government has done nothing to address the enormous levels of stress it has caused families in Australia. It has lumped them with enormous debt for years and then, with the whiff of an election in the air, it is rushing to hand out lump sum payments to make up for the neglect and dismissal of Australian families. The government could have introduced this legislation at any time. It is not as if it did not know about the financial problems that its current system has caused thousands of families in this country.</para></talk.start><para>Legislation needs proper and detailed consideration. Community groups need time to scrutinise this legislation to identify whether the bills inadvertently create any new poverty traps. It is clear that the package introduced with these bills is a cynical election stunt, an insult to Australian people who the government believes will not recognise this budget for what it is: a blatant attempt to buy votes in what is set to be a tight election. Certainly the comments that I have been reading today in the letters to newspapers show that Australians are not the dummies the government is expecting them to be. Australians have identified this for the election stunt that it is and for the vote buying exercise that it is. </para><para>The government is trying to sell its measures as the `largest package of assistance for families ever', and this is true. The package costs $19.2 billion over five years. It provides three payments. The first one-off payment, of $600 per child, will be paid to families who receive family tax benefit A. The second one-off payment, of $1,000, will go to recipients of the carer payment. The third one-off payment will go to recipients of the carer allowance and will be $600 for each eligible carer. It is not surprising that this government is trying to look generous right now, given the way it has squeezed families throughout the country during its term and given the way it will be happy to continue to squeeze families if it wins the election.</para><para>The Greens are obviously not opposed to one-off payments to families and carers. However, we are cynical of the effect that one-off payments can have on struggling families and carers who have ongoing financial challenges. The Greens believe that one-off payments do not represent a genuine commitment on the part of this government to help families in need. The government could assist families by establishing a paid parental leave scheme and if it were genuine this is what it would do. The government could assist the long-term needs of Australian families by investing in public services, by funding child-care places appropriately. It could assist by reversing the neglect of our public services like health and education. It could assist by fixing up the problems in the family tax benefit payment system that result in the family tax benefit debts that families face through no fault of their own. But the government has lost this opportunity and instead is attempting to bribe families with a short-term injection of cash that will provide no lasting relief for families.  </para><para>The government has failed to deliver the much needed and much called for national paid maternity scheme. The maternity payment that is in this budget is not a maternity leave scheme; it is simply a welfare payment. The point of maternity leave is that a woman is able to maintain her attachment to the work force, receive income for the period of time she is looking after and bonding with her child, and then return to the work force. Unless a scheme ensures a continuing attachment to the work force, Australian women's rights to engage in paid work will continue to be restricted. The government's maternity payment does not ensure a mother's right to return to work, nor does it cover the 16 weeks off work that the World Health Organisation recommends. </para><para>In addition, as the federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner has said, a lump sum payment with no requirement to stay out of work means that, for some women, pressure from their employers or financial circumstances will force them to return to work less than 14 weeks after the birth of their child. It is good that the government has finally recognised that the baby bonus was a dud, but it is disappointing that it did not decide to introduce a national paid maternity leave scheme. The Australian Labor Party lowered the bar on this by announcing their own form of maternity payment, rather than a paid maternity leave scheme, some weeks ago. That allowed the government to simply come in and introduce a maternity payment rather than a leave scheme, as that was what Labor had done.</para><para>The Greens have developed a paid parental leave scheme that will deliver replacement income to 75 per cent of women for 18 weeks, with a further 34 weeks of unpaid leave, a right to return to work part time and to share the leave period with a partner. This scheme can be funded by redirecting the baby bonus, which the government itself has abandoned in this budget. Australia can afford a scheme of this kind and Australian women deserve it. Until the government provides practical assistance of this kind to families it has no credibility in claiming to support families and women wanting to return to work after the birth of their child. The Greens will be moving a second reading amendment to the increased payments bill calling on the government to introduce a national paid parental leave scheme.</para><para>Unmet demand for child care, high fees, and pay levels as low as $12 an hour for child-care workers are major problems the Howard government has failed to address. The drive for private child care will only exacerbate these problems. The Greens welcome the government's provision of more child-care places in this budget, but the places that are provided meet only a quarter of the unmet demand for child-care places.</para><para>The long overdue extension to carer allowance is welcome, but it is difficult to see how a one-off payment of either $1,000 or $600 just prior to an election is anything more than attempted election bribery. If carers are so deserving, in the Treasurer's own words, this payment should be ongoing, rather than just one-off. Sara Trad, who after a spinal injury has been confined to a wheelchair and has her daughter as her primary carer, commented in today's <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> that she believes the Prime Minister is simply trying to buy votes. </para><para>The government has belatedly recognised the design flaw in its family payments system which causes one in three families to have a debt each year. The flaw has not been addressed—a $600 payment will not remove the inherent flaw in a system that is creating these debts for families. The budget has missed an opportunity to help people genuinely in need in this country and has been criticised by welfare groups and other advocates for disadvantaged communities in Australia. High-income earners on more than $1,000 a week gain tax cuts of over $21 a week at a cost of $1.9 billion whilst those on low incomes but higher tax levels, unemployed people, gain nothing and still face paying 70c in the dollar on casual earnings through taxation.</para><para>There is little equity in this vote targeted, economically irresponsible budget. Once again the government has passed over the opportunity to use a significant surplus to invest in public services. At the same time, single people and families with no children miss out altogether. Young people in particular get nothing from this budget. Few young people earn enough to benefit from the government's tax cuts for the rich. Young people without children get absolutely nothing. The government has again missed the opportunity to extend rent assistance to Austudy recipients, a small cost for the government that would make a big difference to student poverty in this country. At the same time, the government's higher education reforms mean that students are paying more, either now or later, for their university opportunities.</para><para>The government claims to be helping families and those in need, but if it were genuine it would invest in public education—in schools and in tertiary education. It would also invest in ensuring that the bulk-billing rate stayed high so that families did not have to fork out huge sums of money when they take their children to the doctor. It would spend money on the environment so that our children would not have to pay for massive and unchecked environmental damage.</para><para>This government is not interested in these problems. It is simply interested in winning votes, and that is why we are hurriedly considering these bills today. The government has a record of giving more to the rich and failing to be generous to those who are in genuine need. This budget is no exception to that pattern. The two million eligible families who will receive the $600 lump sum payment before 30 June, at a cost of more than $2 billion, plus another $600 after they have handed in their tax return can clearly see—and they have already commented in the media today—that this is an election bribe being waved in front of them by the government. This government is trying to cover up problems that families have encountered with debt, but payments will not ease the stress that many families have endured due to the failed policy. This payment must be considered an apology as much as anything else.</para><para>The budget has been widely acknowledged as a desperate attempt by the government to buy votes. Billions of Australian taxpayer dollars are being utilised by the federal government to buy its way back into government. Whilst the Greens will not oppose more money for families and carers—in fact, we support it—we do object to the underlying strategy and the inability of the government to properly address ongoing policy failures. This pool of money being used to bribe Australians could have achieved a fully funded, free tertiary education system, more teachers and better resources for our public schools. It could have paid for the expansion of Medicare to cover dental services, a boost in bulk-billing and the establishment of new community health centres. These measures would have achieved true and lasting assistance for families. </para><para>Instead, schools are struggling, students are being slugged by higher fees, and doctors' fees are rising. Families will continue to suffer as a result of this government's policy failures. This is why the Greens see this budget as an abject failure. On behalf of the Australian Greens, I move the second reading amendment standing in my name:</para><quote><para>At the end of the motion, add:</para><para>	“but the Senate:</para></quote><para>	(a)	condemns the Commonwealth Govern-ment for ensuring that Australia is one of only two Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries that does not have a national paid maternity leave scheme; and</para><para>	(b)	calls on the Commonwealth Govern-ment to implement immediately a national system of paid maternity leave”.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>23231</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I begin, as have several colleagues—including Senator Brian Greig on behalf of the Democrats—in this debate on the <inline ref="R2043">Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (More Help for Families—One-off Payments) Bill 2004</inline> and the related bill by expressing my concern about this process. As honourable senators have indicated, there is no lack of desire among people in this place to provide urgent need to Australian workers and Australian families, and no-one seeks to hold up that process. However, it is a sad day for the Senate when we have legislation that is a couple of days old at least, has not been properly scrutinised and yet is expected to be passed by the Senate with minimal discussion and debate.</para></talk.start><para>Despite the temptation to refer generally to the budget in my contribution to this second reading debate, I will restrict my comments to that part of the bill that relates to the maternity payment, which—having looked at the legislation in some more detail for pretty much the first time, as would be the case for most of us in this place—I have discovered is not a maternity payment. I thought we were paying $3,000 to mothers upon the birth of a child, but we are not. It is a primary carer payment. So it is $3,000 when a child is born. If I am wrong, I am happy for advisers to correct me. But we are only just getting information from the Parliamentary Library and from departmental officials about this legislation before us, and these are the questions that we in this place should properly scrutinise not in the second reading, not simply in the committee stage of the bill, but in a committee—this is the kind of bill that should be referred to a committee. We are talking about billions of dollars—and this debate is expected to wrap up by 12.45.</para><para>So the primary care giver will get $3,000 on the birth of a child. I understand there is sufficient discretion in this bill so that this money can be paid to the most appropriate person. I want to know what security there is in this legislation for women who are in difficult, maybe violent, relationships. I want to know what protections there are for casual female workers. There is nothing in this bill that makes this into a maternity payment, or even a maternity leave payment; that seeks to end what we have dealt with in Australia up until now—that is, the systematic discrimination against women in the work force who decide to have a child. There is nothing to protect casual workers by saying, `You don't have to go straight back to work.' There is nothing to ensure in those cases—and I acknowledge this is an extreme—where women are in relationships that may be abusive or violent that that money goes directly to the women. These are the kinds of questions that we have every right to ask about and have solid responses to before we vote on this law. </para><para>I resent the implication—and it is not an implication, because it has been said pretty categorically in this place today to senators who dared to question the exemption from the cut-off provision—that we somehow do not want Australian families to get their money, that we do not want working women to get their money. That is offensive. It is particularly offensive to me as a senator—in fact, I believe I am the only senator in this place to have done it—who has tabled a private member's bill that would legislate for a system of national, government funded paid maternity leave for a minimum of 14 weeks, which is the ILO standard, and that would do so at the minimum wage. That would total around $6,400 per woman over 14 weeks, which would go some way to providing income replacement for most Australian working women.</para><para>This $3,000 payment does not go anywhere near that. It is not even half the minimum wage. It is not designed as income replacement—and nor does the government pretend it is so; I acknowledge that—but it is not a payment that will assist those current two-thirds of Australia's working women who get zip, those women who get nothing if they decide to have a child. Indeed, they are faced with choices—confronted, more so—to give up work to look after the child or to give up time with the child after birth, in which case that ILO recommended biological time, that imperative time that women may want or need to spend with their child after the birth of a child, is not available to them. Many women have to work to earn money so that they can support their families, and that specifically includes sole parent families headed by a woman who is working.</para><para>There is also the choice as to whether or not you go back to work too early. I have put this on record before, I know, but I am going to say it again: in the Senate committee inquiry into my legislation we did hear horror stories of women who did go back to work too quickly after the birth of a child. It was two weeks after the birth in one case of a women who had a caesarean. We are talking about women who are usually at the lower end of the pay scale and working in lower skilled work environments where they do not have access to paid maternity leave.</para><para>For too long Australia has not had access to a system of paid maternity leave. We are one of only two OECD countries—and, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson, I acknowledge the second reading amendment from Senator Nettle; she knows it will appeal to me because I have been prattling on about this issue for years—that do not have a system of paid maternity leave. What is the other? The United States. As Naomi Wolf said, I think somewhat flippantly, in a forum on this issue in Australia last year, sometimes she thinks the US exists just to make all the others look good. But on this one the US and Australia are in glorious coalition—not the UK, who have 26 weeks; not our near neighbours New Zealand, who have an appropriate scheme.</para><para>This goes to the heart of another problem with the legislation before us today and the `maternity payment'—that is, how it is administered. This has been dealt with as a welfare payment, as a social security payment, as a family payment. It is not considered to be a workplace entitlement. So the challenge is now on for the Labor Party, for Mark Latham and his new beaut opposition, to come up with paid maternity leave, not baby care payments, not one-off payments—and not necessarily means tested, I might say, because that is where the government has got it right. The government has not discriminated—it has provided for universality in this payment. It is for all women who decide to have a child, and thus for all working women who decide to have a child. But the challenge is on. Why doesn't Labor bite the bullet and actually come up with paid maternity leave? What are the major political parties so scared of here? Are they scared that women are going to go back to work, that they are going to maintain their careers, that they are not going to recreate some 1950s paradise that some members of the cabinet might actually emulate and want to emulate in today's society? That is what it is about: some aspects of this budget are social conservatism at its worst. </para><para>Two-thirds of Australia's working women have no access to paid maternity leave, and this bill does not do much to fix that. While $3,000 is welcome—and no-one ever sniffs at $3,000; no-one is dismissing it as `milkshake' or `hamburger' amounts of money—for working women with a HECS debt, their increased by 25 per cent HECS debt is more than this $3,000. Because of the income forgone, the lack of assistance they will get with their superannuation—because this is administered as a social security payment, not as a workplace entitlement—and the fact that women still have no real choices in relation to children and work, this is not good enough.</para><para>It is a token payment and the government know it. In the lead-up to an election campaign, it is about short-term effort, short-term gain, short-term votes. It is not about long-term sustainability. It is not about keeping up with the rest of the world. It is not about providing real opportunities for women or real opportunities for families. To say that workers will be able to better balance their work and family responsibilities is rhetoric. This has not been sufficiently addressed in this budget and the government know it. They have done the best that they thought they could get away with in order to win votes. They have done the best that they thought they could get away with with child care in order to get votes. And I suppose Australians are cynical enough to expect nothing less.</para><para>We had a great opportunity. You have had the longest policy gestation period in the history of Australia with paid maternity leave. You have had one of the most comprehensive fully costed reports from the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Pru Goward. You have costings that tell you you could do it for around $215 million a year or $352 million a year, depending on what you do with your baby bonus—and I do welcome the government's decision to scrap that ill-targeted, regressive scheme. It is not going to break the bank and it will make a real impact on people's lives. It will make a real impact on women's lives and on the choices that they have.</para><para>Economically speaking, why do you think groups like the AIG or the Hotels Association are willing to consider the notion of government funded national paid maternity leave? It is because economically it has benefits, because increasingly women are employees and because increasingly people want to retain those more productive employees. They do not want to have to retrain others, to take new workers on. That is why it makes sense to maintain your work force, particularly in female dominated industries. That is why organisations like Esprit have such modern and progressive paid maternity leave systems. But they are the exception. Qantas, Westpac, Pacific Brands—they are the exceptions to the rule. They are the bigger ones that can afford it. They are also the more enlightened ones.</para><para>It is the two-thirds of working women who get zip whom I have been concerned about. In 2001 I took an idea to the campaign. In 2002 I tabled legislation. It is 2004, and we have not really progressed much in this debate at all. The government will get its benefits through today. Its legislation will pass. It will do so with minimal scrutiny because the Senate has exempted it from the cut-off provision. There is no time for analysis in the broader community. It will not go to a Senate committee, as legislation both this complex and this expensive should. It will be passed by the Senate, probably with minimal debate in the committee stage today except for the efforts of my colleague Senator Brian Greig, who has moved amendments. </para><para>Once again, this is not paid maternity leave. It is not even a maternity payment. It is not going to meet the objectives of paid maternity leave—that is, to financially support a new mother prior to and post the birth for at least 14 weeks to deal with the recovery period from childbirth, to bond with the child and to establish breastfeeding patterns. Paid maternity leave is, and should be, a workplace entitlement. It seeks to address disadvantage and inequality in the work force, and it is likely to actually encourage work force attachment—as much by the legitimacy it gives working women as by the financial incentive it offers.</para><para>The Democrats have long argued in the context of this debate—and I am sure all senators in this place and members of the community would agree—that motherhood is a valuable and important role. We believe that women who choose to stay at home and have a child should have that work recognised. It should be acknowledged. They should be able to do it in a way that is well resourced. Similarly, Australia's working women should be able to choose to have a child and not feel forced to give up income or their employment. A form of systematic discrimination exists in our society against women in the work force who choose to have a child. We all know the stories. Many of them may not tell their employers that they are of child-rearing age, that they are pregnant, that they are going to get married or that they are going to have kids. Many of them when they do have a child feel that they cannot take time off work. We know all these stories and yet we are not doing anything realistically or meaningfully to address those issues.</para><para>I await responses from the minister in relation to the payment going to the primary carer. Does the legislation offer any protection to women who are forced to go back to work? The payment, as I understand the legislation today, can be split between parents. I talked about the degree of discretion. I wonder what guidelines are going to be provided in relation to that payment. It is up to the secretary—is that the case? Are we not going to put any more specifics in law? Are we going to get a chance to debate it any further before we pass this law? Are casual employees being forced to return to work to keep their jobs? What protections are there? I understand that there are workplace protections in industrial relations law but, given that this has not been considered a workplace entitlement, I wonder how that will interact. I have mentioned my concerns about households where the payment is not going to the woman but perhaps should be.</para><para>While we welcome this token attempt to address the issue of work and family—that barbecue stopper we have been hearing about since 2001 that was the priority of John Howard's third term of office—I am not sure why it has taken this long to get it onto the agenda properly and I am not sure why the legislation is to be dealt with within 48 hours through a guillotine process in the House of Representatives and now what amounts to an implicit guillotine in this place too. I welcome the scrapping of the baby bonus but I am sad that this is the best that working men and women are being dealt. I am sad that we are expected to feel grateful because it is better than nothing when every other OECD country bar us and the US has got it right and has understood the needs of working women. I can only argue that there is a social and a conservative agenda there that is much more sinister. </para><para>In the interim I have to take at face value the legislation hastily presented. It will not be analysed properly and it will not be scrutinised in the way we expect the Senate to scrutinise legislation, and I record my and my party's disappointment at that fact. I look forward to the coming campaign. I am sure that there will be cynical members of the community out there but also desperate members of the community who will have to take this payment and accept it as the best thing to alleviate some of their financial and other difficulties. But please remember that this is not paid maternity leave and it is not even a maternity payment in the context in which I think it was initially presented.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>23235</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>APA</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The two bills that we are rushing through this chamber today, the <inline ref="R2044">Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (More Help for Families—Increased Payments) Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2043">Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (More Help for Families—One-off Payments) Bill 2004</inline>, are an integral part of the government's work and family package. They have the worthy aim of helping to ease the burden on struggling Australian families. They mean that most families with children will get an immediate one-off payment of $600 for each child and as well the basic family tax benefit will be increased by $600, paid at the end of each financial year. Obviously, these are measures that this chamber is not going to stand in the way of, nor will it stand in the way of new mothers getting a $3,000 maternity payment that rises to $5,000 in 2008.</para></talk.start><para>This package should be supported but there are better ways, I would argue very strongly, of supporting parents, particularly mothers and women who want to remain in the work force or to maintain their links with the work force particularly for promotional purposes. There are better ways: through paid maternity leave and by looking again at child care to assess how long day care is structured and how it is actually planned. We have a system at the moment of basically leaving it to the market and we have some areas in which there are several centres, none of them really viable, and other areas crying out for some planned approach to long day care. We should have been looking at how the actual payments are made, because it is very difficult for many parents who are working shiftwork out of hours to find long day care at all. But, this is the package that we have before us.</para><para>It is a package primarily targeted at a family on average wages: two young children and a wife working part time. But when we move to some other parts of the budget and we tip the tax cuts into the mix and look at who benefits we see that those who benefit most are very much families in the middle- to high-income range, particularly those around the $60,000 mark who typically live in certain electorates that are going to be highly contested in the coming federal election. As we look at the budget more broadly we see that many Australians miss out altogether. Students get nothing. There is a long list, and that simply is not fair. This package as a whole—in total—is not fair. There is a yawning gap and that is the government's neglect of those individuals and families who are on low wages or indeed do not have a job and are struggling to get back into, or indeed into, the work force. I would argue that this is not just unfair but also short-sighted. </para><para>Those who miss out on this spending spree are really those who most need support and some assistance. Those on less than $52,000 gain very little, particularly if they are unmarried or without children, despite some positives such as further encouragement to increase savings through superannuation. But the budget does very little, if anything, for the unemployed and it does nothing for the homeless. Where are the funds for public housing? Where are the funds for public transport? Why is the desperately needed money for public schools tied up? So, along with the generosity which we may see in this package, some would argue we have inequity.</para><para>This budget is a missed opportunity to use the growth dividend from a strong economy to build a fairer and more equal Australia. Health in the budget is just a matter of changing a few details with a couple of announcements. The new medical school for the University of Western Sydney is certainly welcome but there was so much more that could and should have been done. The budget could have been so different. The financial opportunity was certainly there, and I remember the Treasurer talking about the need to address the intergenerational inequities of the ageing population. I do not want to suggest here that we should simply be putting more money in to pay off public debt but I had hoped to see some really major steps towards restructuring our whole system so that it is prepared to meet the needs of an ageing population. The money for aged care is certainly a positive but there are so many bits and pieces that we are still not addressing, such as the need for dental care for all older Australians. Money allocated to carers, particularly through this measure here, is very welcome but, unfortunately, children who are carers still have the issue of the 20 hours. If they do go to school, they have all sorts of pressures on them and we have to excuse them from that limit of 20 hours of study or indeed study and part-time work before they lose their allowances.</para><para>I will quickly look at the $5.3 billion Backing Australia's Ability II package. This is welcome but the emphasis it puts on industry orientated research and commercialisation is a real weak link. We must be looking at the declining level of investment in public research—that is, research for public benefit or that may not be able to be commercialised, particularly in the short term, for example research into cleaner fuels and encouragement of our solar industry and wind generation—and we should be encouraging investment in universities' core research. Australia's investment in R&amp;D currently sits at 1.55 per cent of GDP and over the long term we need to see that moving closer to the international target of two per cent and, preferably by 2020, rising to the target of three per cent.</para><para>This weak link also means that Australia will continue to slip further behind in creating an innovative knowledge economy and further behind in new energy research and development—and that does not bode well for our future. Repairing the Murray-Darling Basin is an urgent and high priority. There is virtually nothing for that in this budget. There is a failure to address the need to repair, rebuild and renew Australia's collapsing social and economic infrastructure. Yes, there is something for roads but for rail there is very little. As we look down the list, we see nothing for public housing and we still have telecommunications with a very low basic standard. We should be working to get Australians the Internet, not as a luxury but as an absolutely basic standard. I argue this is very short-sighted. All of this will leave us in the long term with devastating consequences, particularly for the Murray-Darling Basin. </para><para>In quickly closing my remarks, given the limited time we have for this debate as the government wants this legislation through in some 47 minutes, all I will say is that if we do not do something very quickly for the Murray-Darling Basin it will be too late. There is nothing here in this budget, despite what we had hoped, to buy back overallocated water. There is no commitment and no structure as to how and where we are going to get 100 gigalitres of water a year for the next 10 years so that the river can have some chance of surviving. There is no institutional mechanism put in place to recover the water and nothing about enabling farmers to provide environmental services instead of, for example, trying to run stock on the Chowilla wetland, which is simply a dustbowl. What we need is a change in attitude by this government and state governments and no more words about upgrades that are supposed to leave the public feeling that something is happening, because upgrades actually mean less water in the river as farmers become more efficient. It is absolutely indefensible that state governments are on-selling water from upgrades to be used elsewhere while the river dies. The real blindness in this budget is the failure to move beyond short-term politics and on to the long-term good of this country. It is the lack of long-term planning and strategic thinking to ensure that all Australians benefit from what is a strong economy and what is a lucky country. But, then, the short-sightedness and the short-term planning can be explained by the fact that it is an election year.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>23237</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to close the debate on the <inline ref="R2044">Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (More Help for Families—Increased Payments) Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2043">Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (More Help for Families—One-off Payments) Bill 2004</inline> bill. I do not need to go through in detail the various measures in the bills. They are very clearly set out in the second reading speech. However, I would like to respond to a couple of things that were said.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Collins made a comment that 30,000 carers of children who were receiving a payment for a disability before were no longer receiving the allowance. Because this is a figure that keeps being bandied around, I want to put something on the public record. Yes, 30,000 carers are no longer receiving the allowance but 6,500 people contacted Centrelink and advised that they were no longer eligible for the carer allowance under the new assessment tools. They said that their children would not have qualified under the assessment tool. The assessment tool is about the level of disability. I can remember years ago having a discussion with Senator Richardson when he was the minister for social security and the government of the day was trying to find a way of objectively assessing a disability. Eight thousand and six hundred people did not respond to the review. Centrelink wrote three times to customers and telephoned those customers who had not responded to the correspondence. So half those people no longer receiving the allowance had basically self-selected out of the allowance.</para><para>Of the remainder, almost 7,000 customers are entitled to a health care card although they are not eligible for a carer allowance. That was a measure that Senator Newman brought in by going and talking to the people in the social security office. I was with her when she did this. She said, `If you were minister for a day what would you do?' One of the people at the coalface—and again I commend those people who work in Centrelink offices day in and day out facing the public and working with them—said that people were coming in to get an allowance because their child had asthma, and they were trying to get a health care card to get free puffers. They said that we would reduce the number of people on carer allowance if we gave people with children with serious asthma a health care card. So, 7,000 of those customers are eligible for a health care card. The bald facts of 30,000 people not receiving an allowance for a child with a disability needs to be outlined in that way. </para><para>Senator Stott Despoja asked about the maternity payment. It is very similar to the maternity allowance. The maternity payment goes primarily to the mother, and that is the case with the maternity allowance, but there are some cases where it can go to the primary carer. I have just been talking to the department and the sort of case where the secretary would use his or her discretion would be where a child has gone into the custody of the relevant state protection authority, for example, or—and sadly it happens—where a mother may have become permanently incapacitated because of either a car accident or something occurring during birth and is unable to make a decision or is not of sound mind in the sense that she can make decisions. They would be extreme examples. If you made it a law that it was payable to the mother you could not deal with that. There would be some situations where you would say that the allowance could be paid to the father. I know a case exactly like this where the mother had a massive stroke and was totally incapacitated. The child was delivered and the mother was not even capable of knowing the baby had been born. They are the extreme circumstances where you would expect that the secretary would have the discretion to make the payment to the primary carer. I believe that that is what happens with maternity allowance now: it goes to the mother but there are some extreme cases. I hope that answers Senator Stott Despoja's question.</para><para>Senator Nettle said that there was nothing in this budget for young people. Senator Nettle is very young; she does not remember when interest rates were 17 per cent or when inflation was running at some astronomical number and the unemployment percentage was a double-digit figure. The best thing this government has done for young people—and this is one of the reasons I got into politics; to make sure that kids had the sorts of opportunities I had when I left school under a Liberal government—was to relieve them of $96 billion in debt. We are now saving almost $6 billion on interest that we were paying on Labor's debt. That was the legacy we were leaving the young people of Australia under Labor. I know Senator Nettle is young; she has not experienced what it is like to try to buy a house under Labor with high interest rates, high inflation and high unemployment. We have done a lot for young people and the most important thing we have done is to ensure that when they have a family they will get significant increases in assistance through child care, family allowance and other benefits like the Medicare safety net. I commend the bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>23238</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I want to make some brief comments in relation to the second reading amendment. Whilst Labor have some empathy with what is expressed in relation to this amendment, there are some aspects in relation to the national paid maternity leave scheme that I think deserve some comment from the Labor Party. Professor Peter McDonald, in a letter to the editor in today's <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>,<inline font-style="italic"></inline>highlighted that some of the criticism about the baby care payment or the maternity payment, as it is now proposed, is not actually getting a number of the points. For instance, earlier today Senator Stott Despoja raised a number of issues—and I think Senator Nettle did also—about access to leave. </para></talk.start><para>Historically in Australia, leave arrangements have generally been determined through the industrial relations system and, indeed, through the award system. I can recall a time, for instance, when awards provided or imposed periods of leave on women who had had children. I can recall a debate over whether it was appropriate for an award to require that women not work for the period six weeks before birth and six weeks after birth—and certainly I agree that women should be encouraged to take what time they can to bond with, care for and establish breastfeeding with a child—but there were a number of problems with how that might work in application. Ultimately the issue is that it should be the choice of the parents. For instance, I returned to work in this place well before six weeks after my children's birth—and I think there are many things we could do to the way this place functions to make it a bit more family friendly as well. But a blanket requirement that, during a 16-week or 14-week period, women should not work is not necessarily going to solve the issues or the problems for many women.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator Stott Despoja</name></talker><para>—Who is saying that?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>GB6</name.id><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name></talker><para>—What was said in the debate, Senator Stott Despoja, was that the bill itself did not introduce leave requirements—did not deal with the leave that women should take.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator Stott Despoja</name></talker><para>—I was not talking about that.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>GB6</name.id><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name></talker><para>—You may not have, but Senator Nettle referred to this issue. There was a suggestion that the deficiency in the proposal for the baby care payment was that it did not deal with leave and ensuring that leave was taken. I am just trying to bring to the attention of the chamber that the issue of leave is fraught with a number of other issues that have been dealt with historically and need to be taken into account. I do not see this bill or this payment as the mechanism that should deal with the leave issue. Pru Goward has also raised the leave issue. I think that there are more adequate ways to deal with empowering women in the choices they make about the care of young children.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The other issue raised that concerned me was the suggestion that Labor's proposals here—and, indeed, the government's proposals here—do not meet the appropriate objectives. I want to quash that reference as well. When Labor introduced the maternity allowance in 1995, we researched very carefully what would be required for Australia to meet our international obligations. What was required at that point in time was 14 weeks of minimum income support. We introduced seven weeks and promised in the next term in government to introduce the next seven. This would have brought us up to meeting the ILO maternity protection requirements. Fortunately these proposals are far more generous. In addition, they reflect the fact that, unlike many other OECD countries, our social security system has been different for many years.</para><para>Our proposals also reflect the fact that for many women it is artificial to say that they are women in the work force. Working patterns of Australian women are such that they move in and out of the work force. This is what the baby care payment or the maternity payment deals with. There will not be artificial divisions about mothers. They will get access to support if they are caring for a newborn, and that is what should occur. Any suggestion that that is not going to meet our international obligations or the international standards in this area is simply false. This is the main reason that I have concerns with this second reading amendment. This payment will meet our international obligations and Labor's baby care payment ahead of it—for which, I am glad, there is now bipartisan support—will also do so. For that reason, we cannot support the second reading amendment. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>23240</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek leave to make a short statement on the comments made on the second reading amendment.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator Patterson</name></talker><para>—I am prepared to give leave if it is a very short statement.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted. </para></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AOR</name.id><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name></talker><para>—I want to respond to the comments that Senator Collins made. The Greens' concern with the maternity payment, both from the government and from the ALP, is that it is not a leave scheme that has an entitlement to return to work. That is what our concern is about. In the United Kingdom, for example, the onus is on the employer to say why the woman cannot return to part-time work. That return to work component is not a part of the welfare payment that has been proposed, either the baby care payment or the maternity payment in this budget. So our concern is that it is not a leave scheme with a return to work entitlement component to it. In terms of the international standards that Senator Collins referred to, I made reference in my contribution to the second reading debate to the 16 weeks recommended by the World Health Organisation, which relates to breastfeeding for women. Neither of these payments meet that World Health Organisation standard.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the amendment (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nettle's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>12:17:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.</para></division.header><para>(The Acting Deputy President—Senator J.O.W.

They do not receive carer payment because they have an entitlement to a Centrelink income support payment in their own right, such as an age pension, a disability support pension or a parenting payment. When they took on their carer duties they would have been rightly advised by Centrelink not to claim the carer payment because there was an advantage to not doing so and because when they reached age pension age they would have been transferred off carer payment to an age pension. But the degree of care they provide is no less than those receiving a carer payment.</para><para>The legislation before us changed the no-advantage rule because the bonus of $1,000 is now only going to be paid to people on the carer payment, not to people on other pensions, notwithstanding that they may be providing equal amounts of care. This bill creates the anomaly that the many carers who receive income support payment other than carer payments from Centrelink will miss out on the $1,000 bonus. The carers who miss out on the bonus of $1,000 are the ones who can least afford to not receive it. It is simply not fair that to qualify for the $1,000 carer bonus, a carer has to receive carer payment; nor are we satisfied that this group can be guaranteed to be encompassed under the administrative scheme in schedule 3 of the bill by discretion of the minister.</para><para>The Democrat amendment before us gives people in receipt of income support payment until 30 June 2004 to claim carer payment in lieu of their current income support from Centrelink. Provided their claim is lodged before 30 June and they satisfy the caring requirements, they can be granted carer payment, with qualification backdated to the date of the claim, and be entitled to receive the bonus. They will not be double dipping and will not receive two payments, but they will rightly qualify for the bonus. It will be open to them to revert to their original income support payment at any later time.</para><para>We regret that this will cause significant impost on carers in having to go through the claim process and also that it will cause an administrative impost on Centrelink; however the blame for that rests solely with the government in not thinking the consequences of this bill through, together with the speed with which they have insisted it proceed through the parliament. Put simply, our amendments will ensure that all people with the same caring obligations and whose act of caring significantly relieves the government from funding institutionalised care equally receive the $1,000 bonus.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>23241</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I take this opportunity to add my own comments to the consideration of this bill. I had anticipated doing this in the second reading debate but I will take the opportunity to speak at the committee stage of this bill. Really it goes to the heart of the inequity of the proposals before us—the fact that anyone earning under $52,000 a year effectively misses out. I noted with great interest, as I am sure every Australian woman did this morning, that the Prime Minister had been using the wrong figures with respect to the average weekly earnings of women working full time, saying that the figure was $49,000. That in fact is not the case; that is the average figure for all working people. The average full-time figure for women in Australia is $43,550. That is a long way from $52,000, and the fact that it is so far from $52,000 destroys completely the implication by the Prime Minister and others in the coalition that somehow more women would access the benefits of some of these packages than actually will be the case. </para></talk.start><para>What it does do and what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Jenny Macklin, has been very quick and smart to point out is that this just underlines the fundamental inequity. If we go further and look at the average weekly earnings of all working women, the figure is down to $30,305 per annum—a very long way from $52,000. So what we have here is not only a budget designed specifically to put some money in the mail in the lead-up to the next election—as far from a plan for the future as you could possibly imagine—but also the government trying very hard to give the misleading impression that this budget will support women in a way that it actually will not.</para><para>One of the most offensive parts of this is that, whilst promoting this budget as a budget for families, it is a budget that promotes greater inequity in our society. It has been the Labor Party that has put families back on the agenda, after months and even years of shallow rhetoric from the coalition government and a thin promise of focus on family to come. We have ended up at this point in time, in the lead-up to the next election, with nothing more than a big bribe, a throwing of money that will not solve the fundamental problems that the Labor Party knows exist in our communities. These problems relate to access to Medicare, to bulk-billing and to those weekly bills that come in every time you have a sick child or are sick yourself. It is about public education and the need for greater investment in public education and putting a priority back on public education in Australia. That is what parents are looking for. They are looking for community and government services that really address their day-to-day lives.</para><para>I know my own portfolio areas of sport, arts and culture provide that social glue that people look for. Was there anything in the budget to do with community development in these areas? No. What about the rhetoric associated with participation in physical activity and the focus on childhood obesity? We have heard a lot from the government about that, and the Sports Commission has stuck their head above the parapet finally and said a few words about the issue. Was there anything in the budget about that? No. There is nothing about the social infrastructure of Australia. What we have are inequities that will be further entrenched. I will leave my comments there because I am conscious of the time. Obviously I will have a lot more to say about these issues as the other budget bills proceed through the Senate at a later time.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>23242</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We are sympathetic to the intention behind the Democrat amendment. Clearly, there are long-term carers who are still caring but who are on other payments, such as the age pension, who will miss out on the $1,000. However, we think that the government should offer these families this payment. They should not recognise only some carers and not others. But they could do this administratively—indeed, if the government were prepared to support this amendment, we would not have an issue. However, we think that the Democrat amendment is not the best way to achieve this, despite its noble aim.</para></talk.start><para>On that point, I would also highlight that this is not the only issue of people missing out that has been raised with me. It is not only a carer allowance issue. I have correspondence in relation to maternity allowance and adopted children highlighting some of the problems there as well. There are probably a whole series of these issues that could be addressed and fit more into the gamut of my earlier contribution about why we were supporting the cut-off. We will not be supporting this amendment because, whilst it is worthy in itself, it addresses one issue and there are probably thousands. We think that in future the government might be convinced to act on them, as they can, administratively. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>23243</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Firstly, I want to thank Senator Collins for her contribution to the debate about maternity leave and the maternity payment. I want to add that the maternity payment is non-taxable and it is not included in income for social security purposes. That should be on the record. The amendment that the Democrats have put forward has the effect of extending the opportunity for anybody to apply for carer payment who may not have previously been in receipt of carer payment. If the Democrat amendment is intended to cover those people who have lodged a claim prior to the budget announcement of 11 May or who have advised Centrelink of their intention to claim, then they are covered by the existing legislation and therefore would be eligible for the budget measures.</para></talk.start><para>If the intention of the Democrat amendment is to allow people to think about their eligibility after the budget night, then this sets a precedent that is not really desirable for any legislation where we have a set start date. There will always be the issue of cut-off points—it has been the case with other bonuses. Not to have it because there are problems and not to share with carers the dividends of having run the economy well would be unfair. Whenever you have a payment of any sort where you have a cut-off point, whether phased or not, there will always be some people who are on one side of the cut-off point or on the other. We will not be supporting the Democrat amendment. I would, however, like to say that I know that there are a lot of people who would have liked to speak and also people who would have liked to speak for longer.

Secondly—and I accept that this may become a question on notice, given the timing—has the government done any investigative work on or looked into the issue of casual workers who may be forced to return to work: that is, women who are casual workers who, as you know, would not have access to unpaid leave in relation to the birth of a child? Has the government looked at the implications for those casual workers who are forced to return to work? That is an issue that I ask the government to take on notice.

It is about working with the states to give those people over 70 the guarantee of four weeks respite. I would like to see the states—because we are giving them such a huge injection—taking on their responsibility. I was quite disturbed when I went to Western Australia and saw a 76-year-old woman caring for her daughter at home and also caring for a person who was in accommodation but still seeing the daughter on a very regular basis.</para></talk.start><para>We made a decision with the Commonwealth-state agreement that the states would look after accommodation and we would look after employment services. We injected $131 million into employment services in the last budget and we have injected about $99 million in this budget and now, I think, another $73 million in an area where we do not take responsibility. We are saying to the states, `We'll give you a leg-up; now give these carers a break.' They will be eligible. It is about older carers with profoundly disabled young people whom they have looked after for a long time. We need to put pressure on the states. As Senator Greig is a senator from Western Australia, he could hopefully make a bit of noise over there about what Western Australia needs to do about the accommodation of older disabled people who are currently being cared for by older carers. They are eligible for that respite.</para><para>With respect to the other question about casual work and whether women are being forced back into casual work, I do not have that information to hand. I do not know whether the department has. If it has, I will make sure that Senator Stott Despoja has it. The only thing I would say is that Senator Collins made the point that to require people to have leave could equally be a disincentive to give people jobs. I will find out whether we have any research on that area.</para><para>I think I have answered the questions I was asked. With regard to the issue about the secretary, the secretary has the discretion now. One of the problems is that, if you start defining the situations in which the secretary can use that discretion, you cannot always imagine the various things that could happen. Sometimes what can happen to families and babies is beyond our comprehension. I think this would occur very rarely, but I think it is appropriate to give the discretion to the secretary to use their judgment—secretaries are usually very objective people; I have never found one who was not—when there is a situation which we might not have even forecast.

It has to be said again that this is a massive amount of public money that is being rushed through both houses of parliament in absolutely record time, and that is not something the Democrats support. Yesterday this legislation was gagged through the House of Representatives, with no debate. The Senate does not gag bills, thankfully. On very rare occasions we guillotine bills: senators have only a set amount of time, and when the clock is stopped the vote has to be put. I guess you could call this process a civilised guillotine. We do not actually move a motion; we just have people frowning at us a lot and generally muttering and being very unhappy if we do not have the bill passed in the time frame that the government desires.</para></talk.start><para>It is clearly the will of the majority of the Senate that this legislation pass today. Everybody here knows that it would be quite simple for me to just keep speaking for another three minutes, and we would not have a vote on it. I trust that there is an acknowledgment of our cooperation in our not requiring this to be put to guillotine. I would not want that to be interpreted as anything other than our being very cooperative, but it should not disguise the fact that we are extremely dissatisfied and unhappy that this is happening. </para><para>The one amendment the Democrats moved went to a core issue of one of these bills—a one-off payment to people on carer payments. Although obviously welcome and obviously supported, it is not a payment that goes to all people who provide care at the level that would qualify them for a carer payment. Many people who provide the same level of care as carers are on other payments. Indeed, they are encouraged to be on other payments, such as age or disability pensions. They provide just as much care, and they have exactly the same social and personal needs and financial pressures, yet currently they only get the same payment. They miss out. It is not just a matter of saying, `We can't share the dividend with everybody.' There is a qualifying criterion. It is being said that people who provide this level of care get the one-off payment, but that is not accurate. Our amendment was an attempt to address that inaccuracy, that dishonesty. It was obviously not supported and barely acknowledged.</para><para>That is one anomaly and, as Senator Collins said, there are probably thousands. The Senate is engaged in a dereliction of duty by allowing this legislation to go through without proper scrutiny. I do not know if there would be thousands of anomalies, but there certainly would be a lot more than one. There is gross dishonesty in how the various components of these bills are being represented to the public. That is not satisfactory. It is the Senate falling short of what we were elected to do. It is of concern that, because there is an election possibly coming up and people are looking to clear the decks, a whole range of legislation could be ignored as the government goes back to a small target strategy. It can pick its electoral strategy, but we have to do the job in the Senate that we were elected to do. We have not done it in this case, and the Democrats are very dissatisfied with that.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bills read a third time.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUSINESS</title><type>Business</type><page.no>23246</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Rearrangement</title><page.no>23246</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Senator PATTERSON (Victoria—Minister for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women) (12.45 p.m.)—I move:</para><motion><para>That the intervening business be postponed until after consideration of government business order of the day no. 5 (Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 2004).</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>23246</page.no><id.no>R2006</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>23246</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 1 April, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Macdonald</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>23246</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R2006">Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline> is an essentially non-controversial bill which makes minor amendments to some 22 different pieces of legislation. The Democrats do not oppose these amendments. However, there is one amendment which I would like to comment briefly on this afternoon, and that is the proposed amendment to the Evidence Act. The Evidence Act currently provides that evidence may be given outside of Australia by an Australian diplomatic officer. The bill extends this to include locally engaged consular officers. While this amendment is not contentious in itself, it reminds me of a recent issue involving an Australian citizen who is currently imprisoned in the United States, namely Mr Kirk Pinner. I have spoken about this case previously in this place. In fact, in the course of a debate on a previous bill, I asked the Minister for Justice and Customs a series of questions about that particular case. Although he undertook to provide answers to my questions, the minister has not yet responded. </para></talk.start><para>Mr Pinner's case involved an issue about Australian consular personnel providing evidence regarding Australian citizens. Mr Pinner was charged with a criminal offence, a charge which he denied. He remained in the United States on bail for a considerable time after being charged. Mr Pinner claims he was subsequently advised by Australian consular personnel that he would not receive a fair trial within the US justice system and that he should return to Australia. That allegation is denied by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. However, an Australian consular office in the US did issue a new passport to Mr Pinner and he returned home to Tasmania, breaching his bail. The minister for justice subsequently authorised Mr Pinner's extradition to the US to face trial. The Attorney-General's Department informs me that more Australians are extradited to the United States each year than to any other nation in the world. In the lead-up to Mr Pinner's case, the prosecution indicated that it wished to subpoena a consular officer, Mr Brian Brook, to testify against Mr Pinner during the trial. The Democrats expressed our concern that this would be contrary to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, which protects consular officers from being compelled to provide evidence.</para><para>Quite apart from the legalities of the issue, the Democrats' primary concern relates to the interests of Australians travelling abroad. The whole purpose of Australian consular offices in other countries is to provide assistance and to protect the interests of Australian citizens. If Australian consular officers are permitted to provide evidence against Australian citizens, how can that purpose be properly fulfilled? How can Australian citizens have any confidence that, when they seek assistance from an Australian consular office, their interests will not subsequently be compromised by the very people who are supposed to assist them? We Democrats believe this is an issue of some serious concern and one that needs to be clarified and, if necessary, addressed for the benefit of all Australians who travel overseas.</para><para>I note that Mr Pinner, following his recent trial in the US, has been convicted and sentenced to a period of imprisonment. We Democrats understand that there is some uncertainty as to whether Mr Pinner will be transferred back to Australia to serve out that prison sentence here and, indeed, whether his sentence of imprisonment will take into account the time he spent in custody in Tasmania prior to his extradition to the United States. I take this opportunity on behalf of the Democrats to call on the government to ensure that Mr Pinner is brought home to Australia to serve out his sentence close to his family—including his parents; his partner, Tracey; and his son—in Tasmania.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>23247</page.no><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name><name.id>GX5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank senators for their comments on the <inline ref="R2006">Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline>.

Firstly, it will require computer games to be classified in the same way as films according to the same classification categories that apply to films. The Democrats welcome this change but we do not believe it goes quite far enough. We support the move towards a more uniform classification regime. It makes sense to have the same classification names for different genres. This will simplify the classification regime and make it more easily understood by the general public.</para></talk.start><para>While there are some mandatory age restrictions that apply to classifications such as MA, R and X, the other classifications are advisory only. The whole purpose of those classifications is to enable people to make informed choices about what they or their children watch, so it is vital that the community is familiar with the names of each of the classifications and what they mean. I believe that the Australian community is now fairly familiar with the classifications which apply to film and television. But why restrict these classifications to film and television only? This bill goes some way to addressing this issue by extending film classifications to computer games. The Democrats support this extension of the classification regime.</para><para>The constant advances in computer technology mean that we now have games that are essentially interactive films. It makes sense to subject this genre to the same classification as television and film. When choosing computer games people should be able to take the classification of those games into account. This is, of course, particularly important for parents and guardians concerned about their young children. </para><para>But the point that the Democrats would particularly like to make is this: why stop at computer games? Why hasn't this extension of the classification regime been applied to publications as well? If people can make informed decisions about what films or television programs they choose to watch or what computer games they choose to buy and play, why shouldn't they also be given the opportunity to make informed choices about what books they choose to read? Perhaps the minister or the parliamentary secretary can indicate whether the government has perhaps considered moving towards a uniform classification regime for all genres including books and, if not, why not? Why is this bill restricted to computer games only?</para><para>The second aspect of this bill is to make some minor amendments to the names of classification types. These changes are intended to highlight the distinction between advisory classifications which are advisory and those such as MA, R and X which incorporate mandatory age restrictions. The bill seeks to change the names of these mandatory classifications to MA 15+, R 18+ and X 18+ respectively. Other classifications, namely, G, PG and M, will remain unchanged. The Democrats do not oppose this change. We note that it does not involve any change to the scope of these classifications. The classifications which will have their names changed already involved mandatory age restrictions and they will continue to have them after the enactment of this bill. What the bill does is simply change the names of those classifications so that they reflect these age restrictions. Again, this change will help individuals make informed decisions about what they choose to watch. Notwithstanding our concerns, as indicated by the questions I have raised with the secretary, the Democrats will support this legislation. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>23249</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I note that the main effect of the <inline ref="R2009">Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill 2004</inline> will be to ensure common classification types for films and computer games to assist people to have a deeper and more understandable system of classification. This will be achieved by adopting the film classifications. On the surface that seems to be a good idea and pretty well accepted round the traps. There have been questions asked about these matters of the department over a period of time. But, upon examination, it turns out to be a turn for the worse if certain things do not occur. This would be both because the film classification system is flawed and because the nature of computer games is such that they allow repetitive and reinforcing actions. The repetitive nature of computer games can reinforce violent images and actions. There is enough violence in the place without more. This means that computer games should have stronger classification standards and not weaker ones. There cannot be such a thing as an R+ computer game, and as for the other classifications I will deal with those at the committee stage.</para></talk.start><para>Senators may be aware that late last year state, territory and Commonwealth ministers changed the 1996 film classification guidelines to what the Attorney-General told me, as a result of estimates questions, is `simplified and streamlined' so they can be `more workable and transparent' about the tests the board must apply. In short, there is a plain English set of guidelines, which I have in my hand. I first started to worry about the new guidelines last year when my plain English reading of them told me that the substance and meaning of the guidelines had in fact changed. But I was told that if I interpreted these supposedly plain English guidelines correctly that was not the case.</para><para>Later in November of last year the state, territory and Commonwealth censorship ministers issued a communique in which they stated their agreement to change classification laws to `better inform the community about strong material in films and computer games'. Unfortunately, that commitment has already been brought into question. Rather than better informing the community about film content, changes in classification laws have led to a liberalisation in the censorship and a great deal of confusion about what the standards are. </para><para>Early last year the Attorney-General's Department informed me that the R classification, amongst others, had recently been changed to the new streamlined format. I was assured:</para><quote><para>The general rule will ensure that there is no change in classification standards in the R category.</para></quote><para>In explanation of one of the `more workable and transparent' tests the department told me:</para><quote><para>Sexual activity may be realistically simulated. The general rule is: simulated, yes; the real thing, no.</para></quote><para>You would think that that would be a fairly easy test to apply. The 1996 guidelines state:</para><quote><para>Sexual violence may only be implied and should not be detailed.</para></quote><para>The new streamlined 2003 guidelines state:</para><quote><para>Sexual violence may be implied, if justified by context.</para></quote><para>A significant change, I would have thought, in allowing violent content, but I was assured that there was no practical change. Last year the Classification Board approved the screening of a film called <inline font-style="italic">Irreversible</inline>. The Classification Board notes: </para><quote><para>This film includes a brief depiction of actual fellatio.</para></quote><para>But the rule `simulation, yes; the real thing, no' was not applied and the film was allowed a classification of R. The Classification Board also noted the impact of an anal rape scene in the film, stating:</para><quote><para>The impact of this anal rape scene is high due to the lengthy real-time depiction, with a considerable amount of verbal and visual detail.</para></quote><para>Again, an effective change has been made to the classification guidelines, despite the assurances of the department, to allow a film with a horribly violent, lengthy and detailed scene into the R classification. Sexual violence depicted in the film was indeed detailed and went beyond being implied. This is very disconcerting when we are faced time and time again with violent sexual crimes. The type of material that can be allowed—given the experience with the film <inline font-style="italic">Irreversible</inline>—is material containing a substantial degree of sexual violence. The Attorney-General has assured community organisations that he was `confident that the combined guidelines do not change the classification standards that were applied under the previous film guidelines'. We now know that that is not the case.</para><para>I acknowledge that computer games will not be allowed if they have a classification higher than MA, but the value of the exercise has to be called into question when the film classification system is so discredited. Computer games are by their very nature different from films. Playing computer games is an interactive activity, while watching a film is a passive activity. Computer games can reinforce a violent message, as the player can undertake a simulated violent act multiple times in order to perfect it and succeed in the game or simply because there is the opportunity.</para><para>Computer games are constantly being made more realistic in their depiction of the virtual world. It is quite natural that undertaking repetitive simulated violence has the effect of dulling the revulsion we naturally feel towards violence. It can help to create and then to reinforce an attitude more accepting of violence. That is why computer games are very different from films and should be treated as such. I know that there are provisions in the code which talk about certain things to be taken into consideration, but this is a subjective judgment. I believe that the system is such that material which was disallowed under the 1996 guidelines in certain circumstances is obviously allowed now, even though there is great concern in the community about the level of violence in the community.</para><para>I was very interested in what some of my colleagues in the House of Representatives said. I understand their statements, and I hope that their confidence in what is occurring with this legislation and what is occurring in general is seen to be worth while. My colleagues in the House of Representatives saw fit to deal with this legislation, which is designed to ensure common classification types for films and computer games to assist people in recognising the particular classification. That is fine, and I understand why they praised the legislation, but once they see some of the problems that are emerging as a result of the decisions that have been made by the Classification Board they should take a look at them. They should look particularly at the example that I gave and ask these questions: why did this take place? Why does it appear, on the face of it, that this film would not have got through with the classification that it got under the previous guidelines? Those questions have not been answered. There are a number of other things that I want to raise, but I do not want to keep the chamber. I would require a committee stage debate to deal with those matters. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>23251</page.no><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name><name.id>GX5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank honourable senators for their contributions to the debate on the <inline ref="R2009">Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill 2004</inline>. I will deal with Senator Greig's comments in a moment, and I am happy to attempt to answer the questions that Senator Harradine has raised. This bill makes a number of amendments to the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995. The bill merely renames the existing classification types and does not affect the criteria used to classify films and computer games.</para></talk.start><para>The bill will improve the operation of the national classification scheme in two ways. First, the amendments will implement common classification types for films and computer games. Research indicates a low level of awareness of computer games classifications, at 43 per cent; and a high level of awareness of film classifications, at 97 per cent. By using the same classifications for films and computer games we will substantially increase the ability of parents in particular to chose computer games for their children. Second, the bill will create a more effective distinction between the advisory and legally restricted classifications. There is substantial difference in the material permissible between the advisory and restricted classifications. The bill creates a clear distinction between these classifications through the inclusion of age references in the names of the restricted classifications only.</para><para>The amendments will be of great assistance to consumers, particularly parents, in making informed choices about the appropriateness of film and computer games for themselves and their families. The omission of the schedule to the act does not affect the legal status of the National Classification Code, which under section 6 of the act is the code approved by ministers and published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline>. The version of the code in the act is obsolete. The removal of the schedule which contains the obsolete version of the code will enhance the readability of the legislation and remove the risk of confusion caused by the current situation. Amendments to state and territory classification enforcement legislation will closely follow the passage of this bill. Consequential changes to the National Classification Code have been agreed in principle by censorship ministers and will be formalised prior to the bill's commencement.</para><para>I will briefly deal with the matters raised by Senator Greig. His first point was that this bill does not go far enough. Under the national classification scheme all substantive policy matters are agreed by Commonwealth, state and territory censorship ministers and, in the case of legislation, by relevant parliaments. Ministers have not considered the application of the film classifications to publications, although Senator Greig's suggestion is worthy of further consideration and the government will seek to raise this issue with ministers. If ministers agree to pursue this matter, appropriate consultation will need to precede any legislative amendment.</para><para>I will move to some of the matters raised by Senator Harradine. The bill does not affect the content of the classifications in the guidelines for the classification of film and computer games. The guidelines will be reprinted prior to the commencement of the bill, as the reference to old classification categories will need to be removed. With regard to interactivity and computer games, issues of interactivity are dealt with in the guidelines themselves and include such matters as repetition. The longstanding direction from censorship ministers that computer games are to be assessed more strictly due to their interactivity is unchanged and is given effect through the guidelines. Pages 4 and 5 of the guidelines discuss the assessment of impact. Page 5 specifically states: `Impact may be higher where a scene ... encourages interactivity.' This part of the guidelines has the effect that, in classifying a computer game, the board must take into account interactivity. Because in practice interactivity most frequently arises in the context of computer games, the outcome is that games are classified more strictly. </para><para>The notion that films and computer games should have different classifications because of interactivity is misguided. Interactivity is not of itself a sufficient reason for distinguishing between the two products. Parents want a simple and more easily understood classification system. Common classifications for films and computer games address this issue. As I have already said, research indicates a low level of awareness of the computer games classification scheme and a high level of awareness of the film classification scheme. By using the same classifications for films and computer games we will substantially increase the ability of parents in particular to choose computer games for their children. We believe this greater understanding by consumers of the classifications for computer games, combined with the specific references to interactivity in the guidelines and the provision of appropriate information and protection, will enable them to make informed choices about computer games for themselves and their families.</para><para>Senator Harradine also made some specific comments about the film <inline font-style="italic">Irreversible</inline>. The Classification Board and the Classification Review Board are independent statutory bodies that classify films, computer games and certain publications under the national classification scheme. The boards are selected to be broadly representative, as far as possible, of the Australian community. When classifying films or computer games, the Classification Board uses the criteria in the National Classification Code and in the Guidelines for the Classification of Films and Computer Games.</para><para>The Classification Review Board was established under the Classification Act to provide an independent and transparent mechanism for merits based review of decisions of the classification board. In making its decision to classify <inline font-style="italic">Irreversible</inline><inline font-style="italic">,</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline>the board considered the criteria in the Classification Act, the National Classification Code and the Guidelines for the Classification of Films and Computer Games. As I said, the act requires the board to be broadly representative of the Australian community. The board noted that `the themes of rape, revenge and violence are portrayed and dealt with in such a way that they may be offensive to some sections of the adult community but were not offensive to the extent that the film warrants refused classification'.</para><para>I understand that Senator Harradine wants to take the bill to the committee stage, but at this stage I will commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>Question agreed to. </para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>23252</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill—by leave—taken as a whole.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>23252</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have a question in relation to the last matter of the board being the authority and everything being transparent.

Isn't this an example of budget paper deception?</para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>23254</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank Senator Sherry for the question. I would vouch for the correct position in the budget papers. What Senator Sherry's question has asked me to address is the entitlement of those people to the new superannuation co-contribution measure that the government announced as part of the budget. In Tuesday's budget the government announced a very significant expansion of the current super co-contribution scheme. The government will in fact provide a boost to retirement savings of $2.1 billion to the co-contribution for low- to middle-income earners over four years to enhance the already creative and imaginative co-contribution scheme that was introduced in the previous budget. The government will now contribute $1.50 for every $1 of voluntary personal contributions to a maximum of $1,500 for those on incomes up to $28,000. It does not have to be $1,000. This seems to be something that is being peddled around by the Labor Party—that, in order to get the maximum contribution, you have to put in $1,000. That is not the case. In fact, you can put in any amount that could be managed, up to $1,000—$5, if you like, spare change from the shopping. Any amount that someone can manage will be matched by $1.50 from the government—up from $1.</para></talk.start><para>So it is a contribution that has been extended. The superannuation co-contribution tapers for those on incomes from $28,000 up to an income level of $58,000, so it has also been extended, from $40,000 to $58,000. It is fairly and squarely targeted at low- to middle-income earners who will have an opportunity to get a very generous co-contribution for any voluntary amount that they can save. It is a significant expansion of the contribution, which will ensure that many more people are eligible. Of course, it depends on attitude and it depends on take-up. All of those things are subject to people seeing our wonderful ads on co-contribution which encourage people to save whatever they can for their retirement. It will provide further incentives for those on low and middle incomes to contribute to super, and it is a very real way to boost retirement savings. </para><para>There are some very interesting examples of just how successful the co-contribution could be. There is a very interesting example under the expanded super co-contribution. A young person entering the work force who earns $25,000 and makes an additional personal contribution of $1,000 will receive a maximum co-contribution of $1,500 and, whether it is $5 a week or change from the weekly shopping, someone on $25,000 will receive $1.50 from the government for every $1 they personally contribute up to the $1,500 limit. This will actually mean that if an individual continues to make the maximum personal contributions over their working life, their retirement balance is projected to increase by $106,000—that is, an 86 per cent improvement. It is very interesting because, if you look at what Labor have suggested they might do for people in this category and reduce the contributions tax, the benefit to them would be only $3,000. So it is a pretty significant difference. Labor's policy will cost over $1 billion a year and not deliver the same benefits. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>23255</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

I think the success of our budget released on Tuesday has been our ability to produce significant tax cuts and other benefits for Australian families and keep the budget in surplus, something Labor just failed to do. The benefits we are providing are responsible and they are fully funded. We welcome the opposition's support for the family package in the Senate. That means that it will become law and the benefits can start flowing to Australian families.</para></talk.start><para>I do note with some scepticism that Labor will not only support our full tax cuts and family payments but say that they are going to deliver even more tax cuts aimed at those on incomes of less than $50,000 who, of course, received tax cuts from us in the year 2000 despite the opposition of the Labor Party. So we do look forward to the opposition leader's budget reply tonight when he can tell us how big these additional tax cuts he proposes are and how he is going to pay for them. The problem for Mr Latham and the Labor Party is that they have already made a large number of unfunded spending promises before they come to explain how now they are going to pay for even more tax cuts. </para><para>As I said on Tuesday, the spending commitments already made by the Labor Party, before tonight's reply, amount to over $11 billion. As I mentioned on Tuesday also, there are conflicting and contradictory claims from Labor spokesmen on how they are going to find the savings to offset this spending which they say they will fully offset. We have had figures of $6 billion from Mr Latham, $7 billion from Mr McMullan and $8 billion from Mr Crean. They cannot agree on what the savings are, so we have had a bit of a look at what the savings are that they are claiming.</para><para>Their health policy is meant to be funded in part by opposing the reform of international tax arrangements, saving $270 million. Those savings have disappeared, because the reforms are implemented. Labor now say they are going to support our policy on that, so the saving is gone. They said they were going to fund their superannuation policy by opposing the first stage of our surcharge reduction. That policy has been implemented. Labor now say they are going to support that as well, so another $700 million has been lost from their list of savings.</para><para>They said they would oppose our policy of providing choice of superannuation to public servants, saving $780 million. In the face of opposition from the Senate, we have now abandoned that policy and taken those savings out of the forward estimates. So, again, those savings have been lost to the Labor Party. They said they would fund $160 million of their higher education policy by opposing tax concessions for foreign workers. Again, we have had to abandon that policy in the face of opposition from the Senate, so the money is no longer in the forward estimates and that saving is simply not available to the opposition to claim. They said they would save $75 million by merging the ABA and the Australian Communications Authority. We have announced that merger, and the merger does not save any money, not least because the ACA works on a cost recovery basis.

I would think, quite frankly, that Senator Sherry should be the last person to be questioning figures, given his $8 billion super blooper and his inability to even understand which index to use in Labor's announcement of super policy. However, having said that, what in fact it does show is that the government's policy in relation to superannuation is one that is going to deliver significant benefits to Australians, a further $2.7 billion over the forward estimates to not only deal with co-contribution and low- to middle-income earners but also reduce the surcharge—which is an important initiative of this government—over the forward estimates so that those who can perhaps save more for their retirement will be encouraged to do so. It is a much more targeted policy than any other policy that will not allow and encourage people to take up some of these benefits that the government wants to offer to them.

You raise the point: how can we say `family friendly' if adult men are not permitted to move out of the detention centres into those residential housing projects? But I just seek, first of all, to put on the record your endorsement of residential housing projects as being a better place for children to be in than detention centres, which is certainly the government's view. That is why we have worked so hard to reduce the number of children who are in detention centres. I think the number is now down to less than 12—it might be 11—and of those 11 I understand quite a number could move out but have refused. </para></talk.start><para>One of the reasons their parents may have refused is the very point that you raise about housing projects, namely that adult males are not permitted in them. There are two reasons for this. One, I am advised that when negotiations were undertaken with relevant communities about placing housing projects there—because they are in what would appear to be normal streets; if you look down the street you would not know necessarily that it was a residential housing project—the particular community, and I am thinking of Port Augusta here, was adamant that it would only be a reasonable proposition if the houses were available to only women and children. </para><para>The second reason is that most of the people who have come here illegally and who have been designated not to be refugees and are therefore in detention centres—as you know, Senator, the refugees are out in the community with visas—are single adult men. I ask you to consider the position of some of the women. If you are one of the few females, and even fewer females with children, you may very well prefer—and I am advised that a number do—to have a place you can go where adult men are not allowed to be. If you were, for example, the mother of a fourteen-year-old female you may well welcome being in a residential housing project where boys over 18 and other adult men would not be. I am advised that those two reasons are why we keep, for example, the Port Augusta residential housing facility as one that is only available to women and children. </para><para>I do understand that there are some children who may still be in detention centres because their mothers have refused to move out and leave the partner behind. The partner has an extensive capacity to visit. Sometimes families have provision for two forms of accommodation because they move back into a detention centre for a week or whatever to be with their partner. I am considering whether there is a capacity to modify that in one of the detention centres and have one, possibly Woomera for example, where you did allow adult males. You would still have to take into account the views of the local community and the views of women and children who were going to be in the housing project. There are good reasons for this.

Each family will get $600 family tax benefit for each child. Family tax benefit will increase from this financial year to the next financial year by $600 for each child. There is now more incentive for women to return to work, or for the primary carer to return to work, than there was before this budget. What we have done is give families $19.2 billion in increased assistance. </para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Australian Defence          Industries Site</title><page.no>23263</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>23263</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Finance and Administration, Senator Minchin.

We think that middle-income earners do deserve to benefit from the economic growth story of this country and the capacity of the country to reduce the tax burden on middle-income Australians by increasing the thresholds at which the 42c and 47c rates cut in in order to ensure that 80 per cent of Australians will face a tax threshold of no greater than 30c. In relation to the ADI site—something that Senator Nettle seems obsessed with—I make the point that the Commonwealth came to a very sensible arrangement with Lend Lease in relation to the sale of that site. As a result of the very strong representations of Jackie Kelly, the very effective member for Lindsay, the government did acknowledge that the community wanted better protection for the Cumberland Plain woodland on that site. She convinced us that there should be more parkland protected, so in 2001 we announced that we were reducing the development that had been proposed by and originally established under the Labor government when it sold ADI. We reduced the development from 8,000 houses to 5,000 houses.</para></talk.start><para>Around two-thirds of the site will now be protected as parkland to be handed over to the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service as regional open space. So there are attractive, environmentally significant parts of the site that are all being locked away, never to be developed. That is a very good outcome for Western Sydney, and Jackie Kelly can take enormous credit for persuading the government to take these measures to protect those important environmental areas. Lend Lease and ComLand have put their revised plan to the New South Wales government. In 2002 the state Labor government signed off on the 5,000-site development—not the 8,000-site development. It did that in full cooperation with our government—cooperation for which we are grateful. We believe we have gone to enormous lengths to properly preserve those parts of the site which do warrant protection whilst ensuring that Sydney, which is suffering from housing congestion, is able to find another 5,000 sites to house Australian families in the western suburbs of Sydney.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>23263</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

We have seen significant resources put into assisting people to receive the benefits of private health insurance.

This is a government that have put significant resources, significant policy emphasis and significant investment into the mental health policy area.</para><para>It is also wrong of Senator Allison, in her question, to draw a picture of $37 billion worth of spending on tax cuts and other services. We have made, amongst all of the budget measures, significant investments in helping families and helping in a range of other programs. Under the National Mental Health Strategy the Australian government are working with all jurisdictions to ensure that Australians experiencing a mental disorder receive the very best possible care. The delivery of mental health services, as Senator Allison would know better than many people in this chamber, is a responsibility of state and territory governments. As I said in my opening response to Senator Allison's question, we put significant resources into assisting states to deliver those services. And as I said, we have made a 17 per cent increase in funding over the period 2003 to 2008. Commonwealth spending on health is $30.8 billion. The states put in $14.8 billion and there is roughly $12.4 billion in out-of-pocket expenses. The Commonwealth's contribution to health care, the support for the states to help people who have a mental illness, is quite substantial. </para><para>The question—and I think this is where Senator Allison and I would be in thunderous agreement—is: can governments do more to help those people in Australia who suffer from mental illness?

This budget continues that commitment in relation to a more secure Australia. We have a budget which has committed an extra $754 million to a safer and more secure Australia. In that expenditure there is just under $128 million to further strengthen the information management and intelligence capabilities of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. As well as that, we have enhanced the offshore response capacity of the Australian Federal Police by funding it with just under $37 million. This is vital if the Australian Federal Police are to cooperate with law enforcement agencies overseas, and we saw that in particular in relation to the Bali bombings and also in relation to the Marriott bombing in Jakarta and other terrorist attacks that have occurred overseas.</para></talk.start><para>As well as that, we are funding over $21 million for the continued presence of the AFP in Melanesia. It is vital that we engage in our region. Operations such as those in the Solomon Islands, which are going very well, and our commitment to our deployment in Papua New Guinea ensure that Australia is contributing to the stability of our region. This in turn benefits the safety and security of our own nation. We have also committed over $15 million to expand the air security officer program. This is a program which is world's best practice and ensures that our skies are safe and secure. We will expand the program internationally, and we have entered into an agreement with the United States of America in relation to that vital air route between Australia and the United States.</para><para>We are also tackling the area of our surveillance of money laundering, which is vital in the crackdown on transnational crime and terrorism. We have a total of $46 million worth of funding in this budget for AUSTRAC. AUSTRAC is an anti money-laundering agency, which is perhaps the world's best. We have had overseas interest in relation to AUSTRAC. People are studying how this agency does business because it does so well in cracking down on money laundering. We are finding it accordingly to carry on the excellent work that it does. In relation to port security, we are funding Customs to increase inspection by Customs to 80 per cent of all vessels at first port of arrival. We are funding just over $3 million for the extension of the SmartGate facial recognition trial. This is world's best technology in relation to vetting those people who come through our borders.

To receive the increased $500 co-contribution, you have to contribute $1,000. I asked the Assistant Treasurer how individuals or couples in these cameos who are shown as having zero private income, as earning nothing, could find $1,000 to put into superannuation to collect the $500 in superannuation co-contribution. I did not get an answer from the Assistant Treasurer.</para><para>All these cameos, in respect of the claim made, are wrong. They are wrong and they are deceptive. I submit to the Senate, as I asked Senator Coonan: how can individuals or couples who do not earn any money, who do not receive a private income, then contribute $1,000 into superannuation to receive the increased superannuation co-contribution of $500 per year? Only Senator Coonan and the Treasurer, Mr Costello, could make the incredible claim that people earning nothing, having no private income, could find $1,000 and so collect the increased benefit of $500. This is in all the cameos. All the cameos are wrong and all the cameos are deceptive in this regard.</para><para>There is another area that is, again, wrong and, in my view, deceptive. As I have indicated, to receive the government's co-contribution on superannuation you need to contribute up to $1,000. In all the columns on all the cameos, once again, where it is shown that a person will receive the additional $500 superannuation co-contribution, in order to receive $500 you have to have made a contribution of $1,000. What the government does not show, in the disposable income per annum column, is the reduction of $1,000, which is taken out of your disposable income in order for you to receive back $500. What the cameos fail to point out—they are wrong and deceptive—is that the government illustrates a benefit gain of $500 but does not show the $1,000 reduction in your income that must occur in order for you to receive that $500. These cameos are wrong and they are clearly deceptive. What was Senator Coonan's response to my questions? She said it was an imaginative and creative contribution scheme. </para><para>You would certainly have to be imaginative and creative as an Australian on zero income, earning nothing, to be able to find $1,000 to pick up the $500 increase in benefit that the government is claiming is delivered in this document. The cameos are wrong, they should be reissued and they should be corrected. They are deceptive.

Senator Sherry knows that a lot of his colleagues in the industry superannuation funds are out there at the moment selling this proposal as hard as they can.

The scheme caught everybody in the industry by surprise because of its generosity. Predicting a change to the superannuation co-contribution, Fitzgerald suggested that it would be extremely generous if, instead of matching the contribution dollar for dollar, as was the case last time, the government dropped it to 50c in the dollar for every dollar that was put in. But no—people got a double whammy. The government lifted the level at which people became eligible so that more people became eligible for this benefit. The second leg of the trifecta was the fact that people got an extra 50c—$1.50—for every dollar they put in. So the cameos are not unrealistic. You can draw from your savings. Your partner or your relatives can contribute for you. It is such a good investment that you cannot afford not to do it.</para><para>If you read the newspapers carefully today, you will notice that people such as Ian Silk are promoting the scheme. Where does Ian Silk come from, honourable gentlemen opposite? He comes from the Australian Retirement Fund, one of the biggest industry funds out there, and a very good fund. People such as Ian Silk are out there promoting and selling this benefit as hard as they can. It is a real incentive for low- and middle-income earners to make voluntary savings through the superannuation system. It is costly to government, but the benefits are there. We have to encourage people to contribute early and frequently to superannuation. The cost is $2.1 billion over the next four years. So, to put the record straight, the figures are not wrong; they are realistic and they do provide a generous benefit. I think the problem with Senator Sherry is that he is confounded by the generosity of the offer. Because it is so generous Senator Sherry believes that the figures must be wrong. That is not really logical, but there is no other way to explain why he is so determined to pursue the allegation that the cameos are wrong. </para><para>The maximum co-contribution will be increased from $1,000 to $1,500 to match the $1,000 personal contribution that a person can make. That is the maximum. But if they cannot make that maximum they can put in $100 or $5. It does not sound like much but, if you are a young person and you contribute regularly, over the next 30 to 40 years you will build up a substantial benefit.

However, I have to comment on Senator Watson's remarks of a moment ago. He has completely missed the point. The point is that if you are a low-income family and you are not getting—as they will not—any tax cut benefits how do you find the $1,000 in the first place to put into the fund in order to get the extra $1,500 contribution from the government? It might be all right for wealthy parents who can find the money to put into the fund for their kids, but a lot of low-income families in this country cannot access that benefit, as Senator Watson well knows. That is the deception in this budget proposal.</para></talk.start><para>This is also true of the issues I raised with Senator Patterson. Once again, Senator Patterson completely ignored the question. I return to what I asked Senator Patterson. In the government's published budget cameos, it is claimed that a single-income family earning $35,000 a year with two children, one under five, would receive an increase of $43.74 a week from 1 July. The reality is that that figure is grossly inflated. The truth is that they will only get $6.24 a week. The $600 payment that is to be sent to families for the family tax benefit is not going to help in the least all those families who have accrued debts to Centrelink throughout this year and maybe last year for overpayment of family tax benefit—a system that was introduced by this government. They might get the cheque for $600—we are still trying to find out how this system will work.</para><para>Senator Bishop, in his question, referred to the fact that many families have debts of $800, $900, $1,000 or more. They have been hit with those debts at the end of the financial year. They have seen their tax returns reduced or in many cases eliminated in order to pay off that debt. If they still have a debt remaining, the $600—effectively an election bribe—will be eaten up in repaying the outstanding debt. I ask senators to recall the length of time it took this government, when Senator Vanstone was the minister, to address the problem it created with overpayments of family tax benefit by bringing in a new system where people had to estimate their income in advance.</para><para>It took over 12 months to get the government to appreciate the fact that there were hundreds of thousands of families in this country who were being hit with massive debts—low-income families trying to find the money to pay back debts to Centrelink. The government refused to take any action until they were dragged kicking and screaming to the table to effectively wipe off the debts in the first year. Those debts have continued to accrue in subsequent years. Contrast that slowness to act with the speed with which they want to send this $600 payment out to families now. It is clearly all set up as an election bribe.</para><para>It is becoming clear as we expose the inaccuracies in the budget cameos that have been published that people are being misled. As I said, they are being told that they are going to receive increases of up to $43 a week when, if you go through the figures properly, you find that those increases may be as low as $6 a week. That is the real situation and that is the sort of game—the thimble and pea trick—that this government is playing with the lives and the financial viability of low-income families in this country. They are being conned and I do not think they will cop it. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>23271</page.no><name role="metadata">Fifield, Sen Mitchell</name><name role="display">Senator FIFIELD</name><name.id>D2I</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to take up some of the points raised by Senator Forshaw and Senator Sherry. Firstly, in relation to the super co-contribution, I think we have got to come back to the facts. Let us remember that the government is going to be providing a boost to retirement savings of $2.1 billion over four years to enhance this scheme. The government will now be contributing $1.50 for every dollar of voluntary personal contribution to a maximum of $1,500 for those on incomes of up to $28,000. For example, under the expanded super co-contribution, a young person entering the work force who earns $25,000 and makes an additional personal contribution of $1,000 will now receive a maximum government co-contribution of $1,500. Whether we are talking about $5 a week or the change from the weekly shopping, someone on $25,000 a year will receive $1.50 from the government for every dollar they personally contribute up to the $1,500 limit.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Sherry talks a lot about cameos. We did not hear a lot about cameos when Labor promised to introduce their l-a-w law tax cuts, because it is hard to have cameos on things that do not really exist. It is very interesting that Labor are avoiding at all costs talking about tax at the moment. That is because there are only three types of tax cuts that Labor believe in. There are those that are l-a-w, One Nation tax cuts—in other words, those that never get delivered. There are those tax cuts that Labor just oppose outright—the tax cuts we had with the new tax system. How you could oppose them I do not know, but Labor did. We have to remember that, when Labor talk about tax cuts not being generous enough for those on low incomes, Labor opposed tax cuts to directly benefit those people. Whatever tax people on lower incomes are paying today, they would have been paying far more if not for that first round of tax cuts. The third lot of tax cuts are those that Labor reluctantly support—those in this budget and those in the last budget. It is the height of hypocrisy for Labor to talk about tax cuts not being generous when they have failed to deliver their own tax cuts and opposed our new tax system tax cuts.</para><para>I want to return to superannuation for a moment. Again, Labor on superannuation is the height of hypocrisy. The government introduced the superannuation surcharge. We are reducing the rate. The only reason the superannuation surcharge was introduced in the first place was that Labor left us a $96 billion deficit. The only reason that measure was introduced was that Labor forced it on the government. It is hypocrisy for Labor to talk about superannuation—and to talk about tax as well.</para><para>Labor just do not believe Australians deserve more money in their pockets. They do not like Australians having choice in how they spend that money. Now we hear the great deception: not only are Labor going to support our tax cuts but they are going to deliver bigger tax cuts. Remember when Mr Crean in his first incarnation as shadow Treasurer promised bigger surpluses than the coalition? Now I have heard everything—Labor then supporting bigger surpluses than the coalition and Labor now supporting bigger tax cuts than the coalition? It is a very good trick! </para><para>Senator Forshaw was speaking about family assistance. This budget delivers a $37 billion family package. There is a $600 per year increase in family tax benefit part A for each dependent child and an immediate lump sum payment of $600 before 30 June 2004 for all families receiving or eligible for family tax benefit part A. This is the most significant family benefit package in Australian history. But we did not hear anything today about what Labor's response will be tonight. The Leader of the Opposition in the other place has to say tonight what he is going to do in relation to taxation and how he is going to fund bigger tax cuts. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>23272</page.no><name role="metadata">Buckland, Sen Geoffrey</name><name role="display">Senator BUCKLAND</name><name.id>009D2</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to take note of the questions raised by Senator Sherry of Senator Coonan earlier today. I think Senator Sherry very clearly demonstrated the real error the government has made in suggesting that those with no income could contribute $1,000 to the superannuation scheme. He has exposed the government for the frauds that they are in suggesting that this could be done. Senator Watson wanted to debate that point and talk about those without income. But I think we should talk about those who have income and about those who have the minimum income—those who earn less than $28,000. These are workers in factories, they are shop workers, they work in hotels and in hospitality. They do essential work. They are bus drivers, they are people that our society cannot operate without. But they are low- income earners.</para></talk.start><para>I was absolutely amazed to hear Senator Coonan, as the minister responsible, suggesting that you do not have to put $1,000 in; you can put part of that in. She suggested—and it was echoed by Senator Fifield just a few moments ago—that you can put the change from the shopping in there. People on low incomes do not have change from shopping. If there is anything at all left over then let me assure you it goes on paying rent or on buying a new pair of shoes for the children at school or on some other essential thing to keep the household running.</para><para>Low-income earners got absolutely nothing from this `wonderful' budget—as claimed made by the government—handed down earlier this week. These people who are currently paying a reasonably low amount of taxation, I must admit—17 per cent—get nothing at all. Because their financial circumstances have not changed in relation to tax, does that mean that the government suspects or anticipates or is going to do something to ensure that those people on low incomes—the part-time workers and the casual workers—are going to move into full-time work and start earning in excess of $55,000 so that they can get some assistance? Or is the government not going to oppose wage increases for low-income workers so that they can catch up to the rest of society?</para><para>This government does not care about those without full-time employment, those who are relying on one income to try to make ends meet, those who cannot aspire to owning their own home, those who cannot aspire to owning their own car and those who cannot aspire to giving their families an annual holiday. This government does not care about those people. They cannot afford to be paying anything extra into superannuation. They are struggling to make ends meet as it is. To make it even worse, a comment made by the Treasurer today was that these low-paid workers, the ones that need help, would be better off if we had different industrial relations laws. So not only are they getting no tax incentives or tax help, not only can they not contribute to superannuation, but now he wants to rip away any protection they have from the industrial relations regime. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>23273</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Select Committee on the Free Trade Agreement Between Australia and the United States</title><page.no>23273</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Extension of Time</title><page.no>23273</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>23273</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—On behalf of the Chair of the Select Committee on the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America, Senator Peter Cook, I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Select Committee on the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and United States of America table an interim report on 21 June 2004, and a final report by 12 August 2004.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to. </para><para>I also withdraw general business notice of motion No. 866 which relates to the same matter.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Reports: Government Responses</title><page.no>23273</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>23273</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I present four government responses to committee reports as listed on today's <inline font-style="italic">Order of Business</inline>.

A key reform was the development of objective and transparent criteria for assessment of immigration risk presented by students from different countries and education sectors. These are known as Assessment Levels.

Government Objectives</inline></para><para>1.1	The Government remains strongly committed to meeting Australia's international obligations under the Refugees Convention while minimising the potential of Australia's onshore protection process to be misused by people merely seeking to prolong their stay in Australia for other reasons. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">2.	Background</inline></para><para>2.1	In 1997 the Government, concerned that increasing numbers people who did not possess genuine refugee or humanitarian reasons for remaining in Australia were making unmeritorious applications for protection visas (PVs), introduced a package of measures designed to reduce the scope for abuse of the PV process. One of these measures was the introduction of a $1,000 fee for protection visa applicants who were unsuccessful at the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT).</para><para>2.2	The fee is payable only after an adverse decision is handed down by the RRT. Successful review applicants do not become liable for the fee. Further, the fee is refunded or waived for applicants who are unsuccessful at the RRT but who are subsequently granted visas through the exercise of the Minister's discretionary public interest powers under section 417 of the Migration Act 1958. The effect of this arrangement is that genuine applicants are not deterred from seeking review at the RRT by the operation of the fee. </para><para>2.3	The regulations (Migration Regulations 4.31B and 4.31C) establishing the fee were subject to a two year sunset clause to take effect from 1 July 1999. Following reviews of the operation of the fee in both 1999 and 2001 by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration (JSCM) the sunset clause was extended to 30 June 2003.</para><para>2.4	In December 2002, the JSCM was again requested to review the impact of the fee and to report to the Parliament. The Report of the JSCM “2003 Review of Migration Regulation 4.31B” was tabled in the Parliament on 13 May 2003 with a majority of the Committee recommending an increase to the fee amount and an extension of the sunset clause to 30 June 2005.

In the last financial year (2002/03), that Tribunal's performance increased dramati-cally. It finalised 6251 cases (a 7% increase compared with the previous financial year's 5865 cases finalised), and had 3703 cases on hand at the end of the financial year (a 27% reduction compared with the number of cases on hand at the end of the previous financial year, 5077).</para><para>4.6	The median time taken to finalise a case also reduced last financial year compared to the 2001/02 financial year; from 54 weeks from lodgement to finalisation down to 49 weeks, for community cases, while detention cases remained the same as the previous financial year, at 10 weeks from lodgement to finalisation.</para><para>4.7	The improved performance was the result of increases in the numbers of tribunal members following several new member recruitment rounds in which the Government added 10 new members to the Tribunal in October 2001, and a further 7 new members in July 2002.

Once again the overwhelming evidence is that the fee does not counter abuse of the system and imposes unnecessary strain on applicants. While I agree with recommendation No 3, that the Refugee Review Tribunal be given additional resources to carry out their duties expeditiously, I don't agree with the primary recommendations of the committee. </para><para>5.4	The Government acknowledges the contribution of Senator Bartlett and accepts that his intentions are similar to those of the Government, in seeking to ensure that Australia continues to fulfil its international refugee and humanitarian obligations to a high standard, and to reduce the levels of abuse of the system.</para><para>5.5	However, the Government considers that the dissenting report's recommendation would have a significant negative effect on the outcomes for the protection visa system.</para><para>5.6	The review has clearly shown that there is still evidence of abuse of the PV process. An indicator of the level of abuse is that 34% of all RRT decisions are affirmed without the applicant availing themselves of an opportunity to attend a hearing to present their case. While the Department's submission to the Committee advanced reasons for this, no other submissions or evidence to the Committee were able to provide a plausible alternative explanation why this occurs.</para><para>5.7	The Government does not accept the conclusion in the dissenting report that the expected positive effects of the fee have not occurred. Evidence submitted to the Committee showed the fee has been a deterrent to prospective RRT applicants of `low refugee producing' nationalities, the group in which more non-genuine applications are found. </para><para>5.8	While some submissions argued that the fee had a negative effect on some applicants, the Government does not accept that any perceived adverse effect outweighs the actual positive effect the fee has had as a deterrent and a partial cost recovery measure. The analysis and research on review applications and success rates provided to the Committee in the DIMIA submission indicates that the disincentive effect of the fee focussed on those applicants who are not refugees.

The Government will, however, enhance the level of disclosure of indemnities in agency financial statements. </para><para>In the United Kingdom the process for entering and reporting indemnities involves a requirement that certain classes of indemnities be advised to the Parliament by the tabling of a minute in the House of Commons, generally for a period of 14 days before they are issued. This minute is for information purposes and does not provide Parliament with a role in approving these instruments. Minutes can be tabled after the event should circumstances dictate. </para><para>While the Australian system does not replicate this requirement, it has a more broadly based approach to managing proposals for indemnities and their reporting to Parliament. Prior to approving a proposal to enter into an indemnity, Australian Government officials are required, by regulations under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997, to consider the available appropriation to meet the costs of the indemnity. Should there not be sufficient appropriation, the official must seek the authorisation of the Minister for Finance and Administration or his or her delegate. We understand that similar statutory requirements do not exist in the United Kingdom. Further, in Australia, material indemnities and other contingent liabilities are reported in agencies' financial statements, and the Consolidated Financial Statements. Those contingent liabilities that are material to the budget are required, under the Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998, to be advised to Parliament twice a year in the Budget Papers and the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook.</para><para>However, the Government recognises the need to continually review the processes for issuing and managing indemnities, and reporting these instruments to Parliament. The Department of Finance and Administration released the `Guidelines for Issuing and Managing Indemnities, Guarantees, Warranties and Letters of Comfort' in September 2003. In terms of reporting, it is intended that the Finance Minister's Orders (FMOs) for 2003-04 will include considerably enhanced requirements to ensure that agencies' financial statements distinguish between quantifiable indemnities, and other contingencies, that have been issued during the financial year, those which have crystallised, and those that remain in force from previous financial years. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>FUEL: ETHANOL</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>23286</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Return to Order</title><page.no>23286</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>23286</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Robert (Leader of the Government in the Senate)</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Leader of the Government in the Senate</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On 1 April 2004 the government tabled a number of documents related to ethanol that had been sought through a return to order in October 2002.

That deal was made behind closed doors at a secret meeting between the Prime Minister and the chairman of the Manildra group in August 2002. In October 2002 the Senate sought full details of the government's deal through the production of relevant documents even though, at the time, we did not know about the secret meeting. Despite repeated promises for delivery of the documents to this chamber by the Manager of Government Business, Senator Ian Campbell, the government refused to comply with the order. I then initiated a complex freedom of information process to get access to some—I repeat, some—of the documents that established the truth of the government's dealings. In return, I got a range of documents, many almost completely masked, and a large schedule of documents showing which had been withheld.</para><para>One of those documents—the famous meeting minutes—revealed the Prime Minister's meeting with Mr Dick Honan, a meeting the Prime Minister denied three times in the other place as having occurred. It was a meeting at which questions at the heart of the government's subsequently announced Manildra-friendly ethanol policy were discussed. On 1 April, as outlined by Senator Hill in his comments just now, and almost 18 months after the Senate demanded the ethanol documents, a small number of documents were tabled in response to the order. And what were they? According to the unfortunate minister who was required to do the tabling, Senator Ian Macdonald, the documents were the same ones already released to me by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet under FOI 12 months earlier. He announced at that time that documents already released to me by other departments would be tabled at a later time—and I take it that that is what is now being tabled, if I understand Senator Hill's comments correctly and the undertaking given by Senator Ian Macdonald.</para><para>Frankly, the government's actions in terms of this return to order, ignoring it and simply tabling documents already released under the limited terms of the Freedom of Information Act, do not constitute compliance with the original Senate return to order. The Senate did take a stand in respect of this matter by previously deferring debate on two ethanol bills until the government complied with the order. Unfortunately, that stand was fatally undermined by yet another deal between the Howard government and none other than the Democrats, this time under Senator Bartlett's leadership. That inadequate compliance resulted in the passage of the bills. Today is the final act in that ethanol return to order, because the Democrats lack the will to join Labor in demanding accountability from this government for its private dealings with its powerful mates behind closed doors. It is an act which we will be reminding both the government and the Democrats about in the future, and I trust that we will not hear too many pious comments about returns to order from Senator Bartlett again. </para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>23287</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission</title><page.no>23287</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>23287</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I table a report of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission entitled <inline font-style="italic">A last resort? </inline><inline font-style="italic">The report of the n</inline><inline font-style="italic">ational inquiry into children in immigration detention</inline>.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>23287</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para></motion><para>I wish to take note of the report by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission <inline font-style="italic">A last resort? </inline><inline font-style="italic">The report of the n</inline><inline font-style="italic">ational inquiry into children in immigration detention</inline> which, as senators in the chamber can see, is a very sizeable document. I do not know the number of pages but it is in the hundreds, so I am not going to pretend that I have absorbed its full contents and can elaborate on it at length now. It is appropriate that it be kept on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> for speaking to at a later date. But it is also appropriate to acknowledge, firstly, that it is an historic report. It is certainly not the first report from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission into detention, but it is one of the most significant and it is the first one focusing specifically on children. It is the end product of a very extensive investigation over more than two years—getting closer to three years—and I think we should acknowledge the amount of work that has gone into this and congratulate the commission for it.</para><para>The report has been with the government for some time. It is unfortunate that it is being tabled at a time when a vast amount of media and public attention is being focused on the budget and on early election speculation. I certainly hope, and the Democrats will do everything we can to ensure, that it does not sink into obscurity and not get the attention it deserves as a result of other activities that are happening.</para><para>What I would like to say at this initial stage, before fully absorbing the report, is that even from some of the leaks and such that I have been able to see I have no doubt that the report reflects the basic fact that having children in detention is extremely damaging for their immediate wellbeing and, even more importantly, for their long-term wellbeing. We should not have a policy or a law that enables—in fact, almost requires—the damaging of children and the harming of their development.</para><para>I understand this report has involved commission officers going to every detention centre in Australia, interviewing some of the detainees and other people, hearing from departmental staff and from all sorts of people. But I want to emphasise that this report does not include the many children who have been detained on Nauru, because that is outside the jurisdiction of the commission. However, that is still detention that has occurred as a direct consequence of Australian laws and Australian government policy and, of course, it continues to occur.</para><para>There are still 70 children detained on Nauru. They have been there for over two years, apart from one or two who have been born there and are obviously younger. I was in Baxter detention centre just a couple of weeks ago and spoke with families and detainees, including the young children. One family that I saw there I had also seen there over a year ago when the wife was pregnant. This time around they had a particularly attractive 10-month-old baby who was walking around. I think all of us would acknowledge that that is far from the ideal situation for children to be brought up in. </para><para>There is a wider debate, obviously, about refugee policy, immigration policy and detention policy that this issue is contained within. I would seek not to broaden out the debate on this report but to focus on the simple fact that, regardless of what people think about the broader policy parameters, this component of it means that children are kept in detention for prolonged periods of time and that does not have a good outcome. In my view, any policy, any law, that has as one component of its functioning such damage being done to children is flawed and we need to change it.</para><para>That applies even more so to the children who are on Nauru, because they are outside any form of scrutiny, any form of accountability and any form of judicial oversight. I have met with some of the children who are on Nauru. I have seen the difference in those children between meeting them in the Nauru detention centre, separated from their fathers, in July last year and then meeting those same children living free in New Zealand six months later with the family reunited. The difference was extraordinary. It is fairly self-evident to think about it and to talk about it, but it is extraordinary to actually see those children in person, to see the difference between children in despair, separated from their father for two or three years, not knowing what their future holds, not knowing why they are in this situation. Six months later, living with the family like any other family in the community that is free to choose their own future, one six-year-old girl was just about to go to school, able to play with her friends like anybody else. To actually see that distinction, you can see how much damage is done by doing this to children. I have no doubt that there are specific incidents detailed in the report that the government will have responded to and to which they will have said, `We have done things and acted on these concerns.' That is all positive, but none of it addresses the fundamental problem, the fundamental flaw that is continuing as we speak, which is that children are in detention.</para><para>I also had the opportunity, with the cooperation of the minister's office and the department—for which I thank them—to visit the housing project in Port Augusta just a couple of weeks ago which was referred to today in question time by the minister. It is the so-called housing project where women and children are able to live in housing in the Port Augusta community. There is no doubt that it is a more pleasant physical environment for those children to be in. It is rather similar to a suburban street, as the minister said, with the fairly significant distinction that it is surrounded by a fence and nobody is allowed out and nobody is allowed in. So it is a fenced-off suburban street, and that is a very significant distinction.</para><para>The other significant distinction is that the fathers and husbands are not allowed to live with the rest of their family. They are kept in the main security detention centre at Baxter. Nobody is allowed to visit—or very few people are allowed to visit—the children in the housing. Appointments have to be made with the Baxter detention centre, and arrangements have to be made for the children to be bussed to Baxter to meet their fathers behind the wire of the detention centre. The fathers are usually allowed to go to the houses about twice a week for around four hours each time. Otherwise, the family have to make an appointment—with about a day's notice, I was told—to go to Baxter detention centre just to interact with the father or husband. So there is still a very significant flaw there, despite the undoubtedly far more pleasant living environment that the children are in—there is that lack of hope for their future, that separation from husband and father, that separation from friends. </para><para>The children are allowed out to go to school. That is great, that is welcomed, but after school they have to come back. They cannot have their friends come back to their house with them and they cannot go to their friend's house after school. They might sound like simple things, but they are very significant things. I think anyone who thinks that that is acceptable and appropriate and says that that is like living in a community is clearly not acknowledging or understanding, firstly, what a simple concept freedom is, but also what an absolutely fundamental and crucial concept freedom is and how damaging it is to deny it to anybody but particularly to children.</para><para>That is the fundamental underpinning of this report. It is a very important report. It is obviously a politically contentious issue, but I do hope that all of us here seek to engage with it constructively and attempt to alleviate the core problem that is at the centre of the community concern that generated this report—that is, that children do not belong in detention. Whilst we need to act on individual incidents and individual situations where things are wrong, the fundamental thing we need to do is get them out of detention altogether. I understand others might want to speak to this report but might not be doing so now, so I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>23289</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Membership</title><page.no>23289</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—The President has received letters from party leaders seeking variations to the membership of certain committees.</para></talk.start><para>Senator VANSTONE (South Australia—Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Reconciliation) (3.44 p.m.)—by leave—I move:</para><para>That senators be discharged from and appointed to committees as follows:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Economics Legislation Committee--</inline></para><quote><para>Appointed—Substitute member: Senator Fifield to replace Senator Chapman for the consideration of the 2004-05 Budget estimates from 31 May to 4 June 2004</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee--</inline></para><quote><para>Appointed—Substitute member: Senator Johnston to replace Senator Tierney for the committee's inquiry into the Office of the Chief Scientist</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee--</inline></para><quote><para>Appointed—Substitute member: Senator Scullion to replace Senator Tchen for the consideration of the 2004-05 Budget estimates on 25 May 2004 from 7.30 pm</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee--</inline></para><quote><para>Appointed—</para><para>Participating members:</para><para>Senator Faulkner for the committee's inquiry into the provisions of the Parliamentary Superannuation Bill 2004 and a related bill</para><para>Senator Ludwig</para><para>Substitute members: Senators Sherry and Cherry to replace Senators Faulkner and Murray for the committee's inquiry into the provisions of the Parliamentary Superannuation Bill 2004 and a related bill.</para></quote><para>Question agreed to.</para></interjection></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>SCIENCE: COOPERATIVE RESEARCH CENTRES</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>23289</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>23290</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move: </para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate—</para><para>	(a)	notes with concern the adverse effects of the Government's botched implementation of the current Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) selection round;</para><para>	(b)	calls on the Government to restore public interest research as a key selection criteria for future CRCs; and</para><para>	(c)	calls on the Minister for Science (Mr McGauran) to take responsibility for the denial of funding to nationally-significant CRCs such as the reef, rainforest and photonics CRCs, and to use his powers under the current CRC guidelines to hear appeals from such CRCs against their exclusion from the current selection round.</para></motion><para>In the week before the budget, researchers and scientists were astounded to hear not only that the budget for the Cooperative Research Centres Program, because indexation arrangements had not properly been made, had been cut by an aggregate figure of $200 million but also that 19 of the 52 applications for the current CRC Program selection round had been rejected. These included some of the most successful and important of the existing CRCs. The casualties included the world renowned, leading edge centres for rainforest, reef and coastal research, as well as the highly regarded, commercially successful CRCs for photonics and satellites. The Minister for Science has abandoned them completely, arguing that they did not offer good value for money.</para><para>How was that possible? It was possible only because the minister himself introduced new guidelines last December, even though it is now apparent that he does not understand them. When some of the trashed CRCs sought to appeal against him he rejected those appeals out of hand, and he has done so publicly in the press. He claimed that he had no direct responsibility and he flick passed the decisions to the CRC advisory committee. He was not only wrong but also inept in these actions, because he has compounded the problems that are faced by these CRCs. Section 1.4 of his own guidelines says under the heading `Role of the minister':</para><quote><para>The Minister—</para></quote><para>I emphasise that—</para><quote><para>decides which CRCs will be funded ...</para></quote><para>It says that in making those decisions:</para><quote><para>... the Minister may have regard to the advice of the CRC committee ...</para></quote><para>I emphasise `advice'. In other words, the minister has laid down the rails and released the trains, and the wreck that is on the line now is directly his responsibility.</para><para>I am sure some senators will ask why this is important. By common consent, CRCs are recognised as one of the most effective means of mobilising our research effort and promoting collaboration between the public and private sectors. CRCs were established with the twin aims of changing the research culture within this country and addressing market failure in key areas of national concern. This is particularly important in environmental and agricultural research, for they are case studies in effective public investment in research. The minister continues to have problems with CRC selection, and I think this is mainly because he has not understood the CRC Program itself. He is incorrect when he claims that the program has always been an industry support program. Industry has always been part of the equation, but within a program really designed to increase the commercial and social effectiveness of already committed research activities.</para><para>The new guidelines stem from a further review of the CRC Program undertaken by the Sydney University based engineer and consultant John (Hamilton) Howard—and I emphasise `Hamilton'. Howard Partners, which produced the report, acknowledged the original impulses that led to the creation of the CRC Program and also acknowledged the tremendous success of this program. Howard points out that one of the two outstanding areas of success has been social outcomes—that is, public benefit research, which has been an essential part of the program from the beginning—and that the CRC Program was introduced in part to address the problems of market failure and the absence of private sector engagement with major social and environmental research issues. Both of those areas are extraordinary success stories. The minister has sought to eradicate the first while ignoring the implications of the second of these great success stories. </para><para>John Howard of Howard Partners, apparently touting for customers, observed in an email in January:</para><quote><para>The CRC evaluation ... recommended that the program be more sharply focussed on economic/industry outcomes, that CRCs be industry driven and that pure “public good” related research not be part of the program in the future.</para></quote><para>In a single move—a mad move, in my judgment—Minister McGauran's insistence on the recommendations undermined one of the key strengths of the program: the fact that the selection criteria encouraged proposals from the widest range of possible CRCs. It was its very flexibility that proved its strength. The other issue that Mr John Howard referred to was market failure. In this respect it is interesting to briefly consider the sources of funding of the CRC Program. In the past 12 years, participants have contributed more than $7 billion in cash and in kind to the CRCs. Of this figure, industry has contributed about $1.3 billion. The federal government through various sources, including universities and the CSIRO, has contributed more than $4.6 billion, or about 66 per cent. It is ironic in the light of these figures that the minister now turns to industry—to the market—to rectify a program which was designed to address the question of market failure.</para><para>The Howard report has not only brought about a fundamental change but it has also highlighted a fundamental policy position of this government—that is, a very narrow and unbalanced view of commercialisation. If we accepted this government's notions of commercialisation and if this was the policy operating in the 1950s, for instance, we would be looking at ways to improve the iron lung rather than ways to invent a vaccine for polio. It is an extraordinary attitude that the government has about the concept of commercialisation—an extraordinarily narrow view of commercialisation. Of course it is not surprising that Minister McGauran accepted the recommendation that this so-called public benefit research be excluded from the CRC Program, because that was a precondition of the review. I understand that it was actually a decision of cabinet. Frankly, as the process was introduced by way of changing the guidelines for a committee selected by the minister which has little discretion in the implementation of those guidelines, it is not surprising that the results have been produced in the way they have.</para><para>Mr John (Hamilton) Howard has told us, those who have received his `open for business' email, that `the change in the nature of the program has not been well publicised'. That is a direct quote from the person that was organising these changes. The guidelines and instructions issued at the commencement of the selection process were in fact unclear. Take, for example, the issue that tipped over the photonics CRC: the apparent lack of business partners. It sounds somewhat silly to reject an application from a CRC with a track record of such successful spin-off companies producing revenues of over $500 million, but that is what this government has done. It is silly of course because photonics is one of the CRCs that this hapless minister has singled out. He has cut them to the bone; he has in fact finished them off. As for his argument about this CRC, we see there is little evaluation and no examination of the evidence. In view of the extraordinary attitude towards the guidelines, he is quite clearly wrong in the application of those guidelines. He is wrong in terms of the commercial support, but he is wrong in the way in which the guidelines have actually been applied in regard to that. That was the position of the consultant, Mr John (Hamilton) Howard—who, in addition to writing the report, has now been retained by the department as an adviser to applicants for this program—when he said in his email on 22 January this year: </para><quote><para>... a preliminary `business case' is required by 30 March. It would not be necessary at this stage to nominate all participants ...</para></quote><para>Yet that was the basis on which these CRCs were knocked over! A question has been asked about the role of the Chief Scientist with regard to the rejection of a solar CRC bid from the ANU. I would be interested to know whether or not the Chief Scientist stood down from examination of this bid. In the Senate inquiry that has been established that will be one of the questions that I will ask. If in fact he did participate, it would be inappropriate in the circumstances where he is involved with a coal company.</para><para>It strikes me that these problems boil down to one thing: the presumption on behalf of this government that if it is any good it has to be able to make a quick quid. We see that is not the position that has been taken, for instance, with regard to the fishing industry when it has raised questions about the destruction of the CRCs for rainforest, coastals and the Great Barrier Reef—the three great success stories which underpin the management of the World Heritage area. Only a stupid government would take such a short-sighted approach to undermine organisations such as these. You see that even the member for Herbert, who makes a rather mealy-mouthed defence of the government in Canberra while at the same time grandstanding in North Queensland, says:</para><quote><para>I will not stand by and see one of the best working models of a user-driven, user pays CRC dismantled at a time when it is ramping up levels of user support over a broad area and fulfilling the Government's R&amp;D agenda in tropical Australia.</para></quote><para>The tragedy is that it is not just two important CRCs that are at risk. There are others affected including the coastal zone estuary and waterway management CRC and other proposed CRCs, such as the groundwater resource management CRC, which have been knocked over by this government's decision.</para><para>I think the distressed photonics and satellite CRCs highlight one of the great flaws in the way the government has been pursuing these matters, and it is with some justification that a former Liberal minister and former national president of the Liberal Party, Mr Tony Staley, who happens to be president of both the photonics and satellite CRCs, has described the photonics CRC as `the kings of commercialisation'. In the process he has managed to slap down Minister McGauran. He has described the defunding of the photonics CRC as `indefensible'. That is a position I would agree with. The minister's actions in this regard are indefensible. If the commercial track record of the photonics CRC, combined with its current support, is inadequate, exactly what business model does the minister believe represents value for money? </para><para>The photonics bid has appealed to the minister for a review of the decision. As I say, he has already publicly rejected that appeal. He is saying it is beyond his powers. It is quite clear that he has not read his own guidelines. He does not seem to understand his own guidelines. I again point to section 1.4 of the guidelines, published under his name, that deal with the `Role of the minister'. Is it the case that the minister is bound by the `decisions' of an independent committee, as he claims? I say that the minister is not bound by a so-called independent committee. I quote the guidelines: </para><quote><para>The Minister for Science has overall responsibility for the CRC Programme. The Minister decides which CRCs will be funded and the conditions of any funding offer. The final decision by the Minister will take into account the requirements of the section guidelines—</para></quote><para>and obviously the decision has to be fully documented. Guideline 1.4.2 goes on to say this:</para><quote><para>In deciding which CRCs get funded and what terms and conditions, if any, are attached to the funding offer, the Minister may have regard to—</para></quote><para>`may have regard to'—</para><quote><para>the advice of the CRC Committee arising from the assessment process and may take into account consideration of other matters including the application and related documentation.</para></quote><para>So it is quite apparent from the guidelines that the minister does have discretion, and it is distorting the truth, to say the very least, to claim that he is bound to the decisions of some sort of committee—a committee he has established operating on his guidelines and putting advice to him. It is a complete nonsense for that defence to be presented by the government. His actions are indefensible. I ask the coalition senators who will speak after me on this to address that point. Read the guidelines and answer the question: why can't the minister fix this? There is clearly no reason why he cannot fix this. </para><para>I take the view that there is an opportunity here for these things to be fixed. The minister has denied this. He has put out press releases misrepresenting my colleague in the House of Representatives Mr Kelvin Thomson, suggesting that the Labor Party favours mates. He is quite clearly rattled. He has put out another press release today attacking me on this same question. He is under intense pressure from within the government to change his position and fix his mistakes. The minister, of course, does not have absolute powers—we know that—but he does have the capacity to address his own errors.</para><para>I take the view that there are questions of probity in the guidelines that must be observed. But what eludes the minister is not the question of picking winners; rather, it is the very guidelines that he invokes and then ignores. The photonics CRC have appealed on the grounds that the guidelines have been misapplied and, therefore, the grounds for dismissing their submission are flawed. At the very least, it should be considered rather than rejected out of hand by the minister, and that is clearly not what is happening. The crisis within the CRC movement has of course been initiated by the minister's own mistakes. He is not up to the job and, frankly, the Prime Minister ought to be intervening to fix up this mess. It is quite apparent to me that the minister's misunderstandings and misrepresentations make him unfit for the job. He is not capable of fulfilling his functions in this ministry. </para><para>The minister argues that the decisions cannot be overruled by an independent selection committee, but that did not stop him last year intervening to provide another CRC—the forestry CRC—with additional funding that had not been recommended through any selection process. This is a matter that ought to be attended to within the government itself. National investment and national research interests of this country are at risk, national icons are at risk, the selection process is in a shambles, and we can now see that there is an attempt behind the scenes to put in a political fix. </para><para>The opposition say that there is an opportunity to attend to this. A Labor government would attend to this. A Labor government would take the view that the process has been flawed, the guidelines should be rewritten, we should restore public benefit research and the whole current selection process should start again under a transparent process, applying criteria, including public benefit research. </para><para>CRCs stand as one of Australia's notable contributions to research infrastructure. A successful research effort is the driver of productivity and, through productivity, of economic growth. Research means more than just treating these things as the production of new gimmicks and new products. We are seeking to establish an opportunity to address major social problems, and the CRC Program is very much a part of that. We cannot afford to let the CRC Program become hostage to the ideological whims of the government or the science minister. Australia's gross expenditure on research, as a percentage of GDP, is falling at a time when our international competitors are spending more on research and development. We are falling behind in the race to improve productivity, on which our prosperity as a nation depends. A Labor government will squarely face up to this responsibility.</para><para>It strikes me that, when we are faced with a minister who is not able to do his job, senior ministers ought to intervene. The Prime Minister, in my view, ought to have a good look at this. At the very least, the cabinet minister responsible, Brendan Nelson, ought to be reviewing these decisions. As I said, a Labor government would review them. The government has an opportunity to fix these problems. If it fails to do so, it will be letting down hundreds of thousands of Australians who are enjoying the work of the CRCs. It will be letting down major industries in this country that directly benefit from assistance. </para><para>I say to anyone who tells me that support for the Great Barrier Reef, the rainforests of this country or the tropical coastal areas are not of immense national significance that they are wrong. Again, if the government were to tell me that an institution like the photonics CRC, which does cutting-edge research with regard to laser technology, data management and a whole range of areas—on which we are very dependent in the longer term—is not of immense importance, then frankly I think they are mistaken.</para><para>Equally, the opposition take the view that the government's failure with regard to our space program, in knocking over the satellite CRC, is extraordinarily short-sighted. We take the view that we should start again with this round, we should have another look at it, we should restore public benefit research to the criteria and this incompetent, foolish minister ought to go.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>23294</page.no><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator EGGLESTON</name><name.id>4L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think that the CRC Program has been one of Australia's great success stories. To give credit where credit is due, the Cooperative Research Centres Program was first established in 1990 by the then Labor government, with the aim of improving research and development in Australia. The CRC Program brings together researchers from universities, CSIRO, other government agencies and private industry to collaborate on R&amp;D and education and it has been a great success. While the quest for knowledge is important in itself, if it is going to improve our lives and enhance our national prosperity, it is important that it be utilised and commercialised in the interests of the people of Australia. This is a central objective of cooperative research centres. There are links with small to medium business enterprises, which are encouraged. CRCs can establish companies themselves to commercialise their intellectual property.</para></talk.start><para>There are 71 CRCs across six sectors in Australia. These cover manufacturing technology, information and communications technology, mining and energy, agriculture and rural based manufacturing, the environment and medical science and technology. There are in fact more CRCs in the environmental sector than in any other sector—that is, there are 17 environmental CRCs out of a total of 71. Over the life of the CRC Program, participants have committed more than $7 billion in cash and in kind to CRCs. This includes around $2 billion from the Australian government, and industry has contributed over $1.3 billion, with more than 400 companies involved in the CRC Program. CRCs generally have at least 30 full-time researchers and an average budget of around $7 million annually. </para><para>As I said, the CRC Program has been a great Australian success story. I think it is important to understand that CRC funding is provided for an initial period of seven years, with no guarantee of further funding beyond that time; although CRCs may apply for further funding, they are judged competitively at that time against other applicants. In the initial period of seven years, CRCs are generally expected to plan to obtain funding from alternative sources for their ongoing needs. The initial funding for the first seven years is designed to enable these research centres to establish themselves and to demonstrate that their programs do have commercial viability and can attract commercial investment. The Labor Party does not seem to understand the fundamental point that the initial funding is provided to establish the CRCs, to establish their programs and to enable them to establish and make the point that they do have commercial viability.</para><para>Australian industry has been very supportive of the CRC Program. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, quoted in a July 2003 paper entitled `Evaluation of the Cooperative Research Centres Programme', concluded that `the program is an extremely effective policy instrument which has been recognised around the world for fostering collaboration between industry and researchers'. Likewise, the global and Australasian editions of the renowned <inline font-style="italic">New Scientist</inline> magazine on 16 August 2003 described CRCs as `the role model for collaboration between business, academia and government the world over'. I think it is important to emphasise that this magazine made the point that it is a collaboration between business, academia and government. The evaluation found that the CRC Program has made substantial progress in meeting its objectives. It said:</para><quote><para>CRCs have performed a vitally important role in transforming publicly funded discoveries and inventions into products and businesses that are “investment ready”.</para></quote><para>So that commercial dimension has always been there, although it seems to be something that Senator Carr does not seem to have appreciated. The evaluation report said that CRCs had 114 Australian patents and 549 overseas patents, with more being processed. CRC start-up companies had revenue from sales of $30.4 million in 2001-02, with projected sales of almost $1 billion. There is no doubt that the CRC Program has contributed to economic growth, social wellbeing and good environmental outcomes for Australia.</para><para>The evaluation found that the main contribution of the CRC Program has been to improve the capacity to carry out partnership work in the overall science and innovation system. It noted that the Australian petroleum CRC had commissioned an independent economic analysis that demonstrated that the CRC had generated value in excess of $300 million from an investment of just $8 million. The evaluation identified the potential benefits across a range of CRCs and quotes, for example, that the CRC for sustainable production in forestry had reported a potential payoff of $194 million from research leading to the improvement of genetic potential for eucalyptus from hardwood plantations. Another example is the CRC for eye research and technology, which has developed a new type of contact lens that can be worn continuously for up to 30 days and is now worn by more than 400,000 people around the word. It reports an enormous potential market among the 95 million people around the world who wear contact lenses. The evaluation also found: </para><quote><para>... the CRC Programme has made a major contribution to the development of Australia's public sector research capacity in areas of national need and global opportunity.</para></quote><para>The report notes that environmental CRCs, for example, have carried out `important and useful research on the environmental challenges facing Australia'.</para><para>It is understandable that those applicants who were unsuccessful at the last cooperative research centre funding round are disappointed. CRC funding is highly sought after, and there is a very competitive process to obtain it. In a lot of ways we should be pleased that the funding is so hotly contested. It is a testament to the strength of ingenuity and the quest for knowledge and research and development that we have in this nation. There were 52 applications received for the 2004 selection round of the program, and 19 of these applications were unsuccessful.</para><para>Senator Carr would have the parliament believe that the selection process was botched and that it was just plain wrong. There is no way that the selection process has been botched. Just because Senator Carr believes that three of the existing CRCs who were unsuccessful in this round should have had their funding extended in no way means that this process was botched. The fact is that applications are individually assessed by an independent selection committee. The Cooperative Research Centres Committee makes its selections on the basis of merit. The committee is appointed by the Minister for Science, and its membership consists of senior representatives of industry and representatives of Australian government agencies involved in research and research funding. So this is not some mickey mouse committee; it is a committee of highly distinguished Australians who make, as I said, their decisions based on the merit of the applications and seek to ensure that the very best proposals obtain the funding on offer.</para><para>The fact that 19 applicants were unsuccessful does not necessarily mean that they were not worthy of funding or that they lacked merit. What it means is that the other applications were more meritorious, more innovative and offered greater potential in terms of benefit to the Australian community. The independent selection panel made its decision on that basis alone. Senator Carr seems to be suggesting that the government should overrule the determination of the independent selection committee. In short, it seems to me that Senator Carr wants to politicise the selection process.</para><para>One could be forgiven for thinking that Senator Carr would like to go back to the dim days of the former Labor government, when we had the somewhat unedifying spectacle of then minister for sport, Ros Kelly, writing on a whiteboard in her office and distributing grants to various areas according to where it was perceived the most political benefit would be gained. All that the Minister for Science has done in this instance—just as previous Labor ministers have done since the establishment of the program in 1990—is to accept the decision of the independent selection committee. This process is fair, transparent and merit based, and in my opinion it is fundamentally important to the integrity of the selection process that the minister not be involved. </para><para>It is crucial to note that the five unsuccessful applicants that are existing CRCs have secure funding for more than two years to come. The reef CRC will receive a total of $5.5 million in the next two financial years, and the rainforest CRC will receive $5.6 million. Since 1993-94, more than $30 million of CRC Program funding has been committed to the reef CRC. Equally, almost $30 million has gone to the rainforest CRC. CRCs typically receive funding over a period of seven years, and after this period it is not unreasonable to expect them to be self-sustaining. In fact, it is expected that they will seek to establish their own independent funding base over this time, based on their commercial viability. Senator Carr is well aware of this.</para><para>Senator Carr has particularly focused on the loss of funding by the reef, rainforest and photonics CRCs. At least one of these, the photonics CRC, has the potential to commercialise its research. Photonics uses light to increase capacity. Demand for increased bandwidth means that there is a need to increase the capacity of optical fibre networks. The implication of this is that photonics has a clear application to the telecommunications industry. Accordingly, perhaps telecommunications companies might like to step in and take up the funding of the photonics CRC. One must wonder how actively such funding has been sought. Senator Carr has proposed to allocate more than $150 million of funding to support the reef, rainforest and photonics CRCs. That begs the question: which CRCs would Senator Carr strip funding from in order to fulfil this commitment? And more to the point: why does he think that his opinion about which CRCs should receive funding is more valid than that of the independent selection committee?</para><para>Senator Carr also neglects to acknowledge that the Howard government is providing a high level of funding to other environmental projects. There are numerous sources of government funding for research other than those available under the CRC Program. If one runs through the list of environmental programs which are funded by the Howard government, one sees that it is very impressive. Research on the Great Barrier Reef is funded through the Australian Institute of Marine Science, CSIRO, the Australian Research Council and several universities. For the current financial year expenditure for research on the Great Barrier Reef is estimated to be $37.7 million.</para><para>The government is strongly committed to renewable energy, and there are a variety of government programs supporting the development of renewable energy in this country outside the CRC process. For example, there is more than $300 million for grant, equity and rebate programs to boost the uptake of renewable energy in Australia. The Howard government has also implemented the world's first mandatory renewable energy target, which will leverage an extra $2 billion in additional investment in renewable energy programs in Australia by 2010.</para><para>In conclusion, the CRC Program has been a great Australian success story in promoting innovative scientific research. The latest funding round has again resulted in the selection of the best proposals, and it is hard to believe that Senator Carr's criticisms of the outcome are sincere. The only conclusion one can draw about Senator Carr's views is that he and the ALP object to the independent nature of the CRC funding structure and would replace the independent board with a politicised alternative, where the whims of amateurs would replace the considered recommendations of a board of experts. I hardly think that is something the Senate would wish to endorse.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>23298</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Firstly, I would like to thank the ALP for bringing forward this item of general business. It has picked up on a press release that the Democrats put out in February this year on the issue, so of course we will be supporting the ALP's motion. The situation we are discussing today started with the federal government's changes to the funding guidelines for cooperative research centres. Picking up on the comments that have just been made about whether we would want to return to a different system, or a system whereby the funding structures of the CRC process would be changed, I point out that that is not the problem; the problem is actually the criteria being used for guidelines for funding of CRCs.  </para></talk.start><para>Back in February the Democrats warned about the dangers to collaborative applied research into environmental health and social issues that would result from changes to the funding guidelines for CRCs, which now favour research that could be rapidly commercialised for economic gain. Science minister Peter McGauran's comments at the time indicated that the CRC Program would be focused on research that could be rapidly converted into commercial and economic gains, and that these changes would be made at the expense of research with less market-driven objectives. At that time my colleague Senator Stott Despoja expressed grave fears over the possibility of a number of CRCs, which have done excellent research over the past few years, having their funding cut if their research did not result in short-term economic benefits. Recently we have seen those predictions come true. Five existing CRCs—researching the Great Barrier Reef, rainforests, coastal zones, satellites and photonics—will not be gaining further funding after failing to pass stage 1 of the CRC selection process. </para><para>The Democrats support the role of research in economic growth, and note that Australia's business investment in research and development as a percentage of GDP is still way below the OECD average and has historically been the weak link of our national research effort. We also support the role of research in raising living standards, improving health and solving the major environmental challenges facing Australia—in other words, research for the public good. The government appears to have ignored the fact that many Australians have serious concerns that are other than short-term economic performance of industry. I would like to read from some correspondence that was sent to us by a researcher from a CRC in response to the press release we put out in February:</para><quote><para>This government doesn't seem to fundamentally understand the role of research and the jobs of researchers.</para><para>I'm working as a senior researcher in a CRC that is currently going through a re-bid process. We're stuck in that we have to play the game that's been prescribed for us by the minister, yet I know I'm not alone within my organisation in being puzzled and frustrated by the conditions that have been placed on bids.</para><para>Much of what constitutes good research is not directly oriented towards generating short-term profit. Public good research outcomes are geared towards the kinds of longer-term benefits that make for a better and more prosperous country.</para><para>Researchers in CRCs like doing applied research and we like to see our work commercialised, but we also have a deep understanding of the value and benefit of our work and we find public good to be a clear and deeply motivating goal. We work better and produce better research outcomes when we know we are supported in making our country better.</para></quote><para>I am sure this is not an isolated case. The Australian Academy of Humanities called the axing of funding for 19 public good CRCs:</para><quote><para>... bad news for Australians and bad news for the Humanities. </para></quote><para>They continued by saying:</para><quote><para>This latest policy turn is a clear signal that public money is being diverted away from the public interest towards private benefit. The Government's argument that public good research is adequately funded through other means is utterly mistaken, particularly in the Humanities.</para></quote><para>The government has claimed that the Australian Research Council grants scheme will pick up some of the public good research, but that is very misleading. The ARC program has a totally different focus than that of the CRCs. It funds strategic research, while the CRCs are directed towards practical and applied research.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>O15</name.id><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>1M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name></talker><para>—Senator Tierney, I am sure you will have your go shortly. The changes to the CRC funding guidelines will leave a hole in Australia's research that jeopardises the future of collaborative applied research into important environmental and social issues such as climate change. The Democrats support the role of research in economic growth, but also its role in raising living standards and solving major health and environmental challenges facing Australia.</para></talk.start></continue><para>On 30 March the rainforest CRC released a report showing that climate change would wipe out the vast majority of our rainforest species and increase the prevalence of drought and the risks of bushfires and tropical diseases. Obviously the government believes there is no value in any of that knowledge because the rainforest CRC is not going to get funding. The previous withdrawal of funding to the renewable energy CRC shows the government's lack of commitment to the environment and is just part of a list of government failures on renewable energy, which include the failure to ratify the Kyoto protocol, the failure to introduce an emissions trading scheme—indeed not only not introducing it but also going so far as to dismantle the emissions trading research section of the Australian Greenhouse Office—the failure to introduce a greenhouse trigger into the EPBC Act, despite assurances that this would happen, and the failure to introduce mandatory emissions reduction targets for coal-fired power stations—just to name a few. </para><para>Senator Eggleston points to the mandated renewable energy target. That target was promised to be two per cent and it has turned out to be less than one per cent because we have used very conservative estimates of the level of consumption of electricity by 2010. Research positions in renewable energy across the board have ceased to get funding and researchers in those establishments have been made redundant. Contrast that with the fact that there are now four CRCs devoted to fossil fuel technologies—the CRC for Australian Petroleum, the CRC for Greenhouse Gas Technologies, the CRC for Coal in Sustainable Development and the CRC for Clean Power from Lignite. </para><para>While the Australian Research Council grants are provided for pure research on renewables, the grant sizes are paltry and nowhere near what is needed to provide an adequate basis for effective research and, as I have already said, they are not directed to the developmental phase. With no renewable energy CRC, we have a gaping hole in the renewable energy research strategy, which is leading to the collapse of our renewable energy research sector. We desperately need a solar energy foundation, which could be similar to the CRC structure, to encourage research, development and commercialisation of renewable energy technologies. We could do that with a mere $50 million over five years. That could be very effective and the cost would be nothing compared with the annual subsidies, mounting up to billions of dollars, that are currently provided for the fossil fuel industries. On 2 February this year the science minister said: </para><quote><para>First and foremost we want CRCs to be operating in a commercial environment and producing commercial outcomes.</para></quote><para>Does that mean the minister believes that the photonics CRC has not been operating in a commercial environment and producing commercial outcomes? The CRC's president and former federal Liberal Party president, Mr Tony Staley, certainly thinks so. The Australian Photonics CRC Chief Executive Officer, Mr Mark Sceats, said the photonics centre was `extremely commercially viable'. He said:</para><quote><para>[Our] companies have paid corporate taxes that exceed the government investment in our CRC ...</para></quote><para>He went on to say:</para><quote><para>If you look purely at this commercial focus, our CRC is one of the most commercially relevant in terms of outcomes.</para></quote><para>The <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> reported that the centre has spawned 12 start-up companies, one of which, RBN, has already turned a profit of $55 million—a figure that exceeded the total investment in the centre. It has just signed a five-year export deal, potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The agreement is with the Marconi Corporation, one of the world's largest communications technology suppliers, to resell the Australian developed technology for expanding the capacity of existing communications networks. This CRC has also developed a powerful new mobile radar system that runs on light and has a wide range of applications.</para><para>If these sorts of commercial outcomes do not satisfy the criteria, what is required of a CRC to meet the minister's demands? Under the CRC guidelines, the Minister for Science's responsibilities include overall responsibility for the CRC Program. The guidelines state:</para><quote><para>The Minister decides which CRCs will be funded and the conditions of any funding offer—.</para></quote><para>and—</para><quote><para>In deciding which CRCs get funded and what terms and conditions, if any, are attached to the funding offer, the Minister may have regard to the advice of the CRC Committee arising from the assessment process and may take into consideration other matters including the application and related documentation.</para></quote><para>That makes a nonsense of Senator Eggleston's remarks that we might go back to a whiteboard approach. We already have a whiteboard approach in that the minister has so much discretion over this funding. These guidelines clearly place responsibility for funding decisions with the science minister. The minister is still trying to distance himself from the fiasco that even members of his own party can see is a disaster. In a press release of 3 May, the minister said:</para><quote><para>Every Science Minister, Labor or Coalition, since the inception of the programme, has accepted the Selection Committee's decisions in the same way that I have. To do otherwise is to reduce the CRC programme to one of political influence and intervention. </para></quote><para>Does the minister expect us to believe that there was no political influence or intervention in the establishment of these guidelines? I do not think so. The minister made a bad decision on the direction of CRCs, and the government's own funding guidelines for CRCs do not achieve their desired goal. It is true that this government do not seem to fundamentally understand the role of research and the job of researchers. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>23300</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I support the motion and condemn the government for its failure to ensure that matters of enormous public benefit and enormous public value to the future are adequately funded and based on the merit of the research centres involved as put before the government. I might say at the outset that this is not just a matter of the Howard government's refusal to fund—and, in some cases, its decision to defund—cooperative research centres, which have produced or would produce enormously important research for the Australian and world communities. It is also a matter of the government's failure and neglect, since it came to power, of science and research funding in general. This has to be deplored and condemned. Since the Howard government has been in office Australia has dropped to the back of the field in funding compared with other countries. In the run-up to the election, the government is making, as on so many other fronts, a belated injection of funds, which in no way makes up for the neglect of the last eight years.  </para></talk.start><para>One of the first things the government did when it came to office was to abolish the Energy Research and Development Corporation. In the field of energy, it then went on to serially move funding from the sunrise energy alternatives of the future—whether based on wind power or wave power, renewable energy or direct solar power, such as solar hot water heating and heating—to the coal industry. It did this because it is enormously influenced by the coal industry, and it is indeed well funded directly by the coal industry. </para><para>I find that in itself a corrupting component. It is antidemocratic and it infests many governments and many democratic systems around the world. This is a matter that we have to take very seriously. The reality is that for every lobbyist for renewable energy, solar energy or energy saving who comes into this place, there are 10 lobbyists from the coal industry and its satellites like the aluminium industry with far greater access to the prime ministerial offices and the offices of the various ministers. So we have an entirely distorted system, which is extraordinarily unfortunate for the nation. The outcomes from new energy and in particular clean, green and efficient industries across the board are going to be those that are most lucrative for this nation in the future and most enhancing of its lifestyle, its reputation and its contribution to future generations.</para><para>I will confine myself to mining energy. You will see how much it has been skewed by the impact that the coal industry has on ministers—including the Prime Minister—who simply do not have the scientific background and the knowledge to make decisions for the long-term benefit of this country and are much more easily swayed by the powerful representatives of these industries at the dinners that ministers serially have with them. On 8 May, Mr McGauran told the ABC radio program <inline font-style="italic">Earthbeat</inline>:</para><quote><para>I freely concede that, where more CRC environmental applications would have been successful under old guidelines—</para></quote><para>that is, previous government guidelines—</para><quote><para>and not the current guidelines—</para></quote><para>that is, this government's guidelines—</para><quote><para>we will have to guard against that, fair enough. But I do not accept the argument that the decisions of the panel should be overturned, that is special treatment ...</para></quote><para>So here the Minister for Science is saying, `Well, it's fair enough that there should be complaints, and that the government should have guarded against environmental applications which were more oriented to restoring or giving public benefit,' as would have happened under the old guidelines. The complaints about that are `fair enough', but he is not going to do anything about it even though, as Senator Carr explained just a while ago, he has an enormous and final say in the matter.</para><para>I believe the minister will not have anything to say about it because he is not competent to make such decisions, let alone to understand the basis of the complaints about the decisions that have been coming out of the government's guidelines. Ultimately they are the minister's guidelines. But he is saying, `I understand that there is valid complaint about them, but I do not know what to do about it.' The Minister for Science, Mr McGauran has said, `I am not competent to know how to get myself out of this bind that I've got government policy into.' On <inline font-style="italic">Earthbeat </inline>he said: </para><quote><para>I do not accept that the government is ignoring investment in research and development in renewable energy.</para></quote><para>The government closed down the most august body for determining that matter in its first year of office, in 1996-97. With respect to renewable energy and energy efficiency, the CRC funding that was there in the past has gone to zero, but the minister says, `I don't accept that the government is ignoring investment.' He has cut it to ribbons; he has cut it to nothing.</para><para>The government will argue that they can get funding through other avenues, but so can anybody—the church choirs and the sports teams. They can look at other avenues in both government funding and private investment. But we are not talking about that; we are talking about these cooperative research centres and the money allocated for them. The Minister for Science, against world's best practice in comparable countries everywhere, is saying, `No, I'm going to give it to dirty coal to see if I can't clean that up, because I don't understand that coal is the problem, and I don't see that renewable energy coming from the sun—and, better still, recycled energy or efficiently used energy—are the answers.' What Mr McGauran is saying, inter alia, is, `I don't understand that the future of the economy in this country and around the world this century is going to depend on clean, green science, research and application, and that there are massive export dollars as well as hundreds of thousands of jobs to come out of Australia, being the sunshine country and being a leader in this field.'</para><para>This appalling inability to stand above the pressure of the coal industry is exemplified by the government and by the minister. I suppose in one way you cannot blame him, because these people have direct entree to Prime Minister Howard's office. Will the minister buck that? I think not; certainly not this minister. On <inline font-style="italic">Earthbeat </inline>on 8 May, Minister McGauran said:</para><quote><para>Coal or fossil fuels produce 95 per cent or more of Australia's energy needs.</para></quote><para>There is an indictment. He then said:</para><quote><para>We obviously, given our greenhouse gas concerns, want to apply low emission technology so of course it goes without saying that the majority of research would go towards the energy source for 95 per cent of our energy needs.</para></quote><para>Wrong, Minister McGauran—the 95 per cent should be going to replacing the use of coal, not to trying some untested technology to see whether you can make the coal and the burning of it clean. We have this phenomenal, world's best technology and we have magnificent researchers in this country—from Perth, to Hobart, to Canberra to Brisbane, all over the place—tapping into the sun's power and converting it into energy and heating, and this government is saying, `No, we want to give it to coal,' which produces 95 per cent of the energy needs of this country and is very close to 100 per cent of the greenhouse gas problem as far as energy production is concerned.</para><para>Mr McGauran is saying, `But it is quite sensible that fossil fuel research would be heavily supported but not to the exclusion of renewable energy.' But the minister has excluded renewable energy, so what is he about? He cannot explain his own policies. He has no analysis. He fundamentally cannot see what he, at his own hand, is doing by squeezing to death the cooperative research centres, which we should be proud of in this country and we should be promoting to the world. </para><para>Let us look at those figures again. Ten or 20 years ago, Japan, which is a much colder and less sunny country than this one, was producing one-fifth of the solar panels that we were producing. Now it is producing five times as many. I guess that Minister McGauran does not understand that that means Australia is slipping behind under his ministry. We are losing out, and with that we are losing enormous economic and employment benefits into the future. What could you expect, I guess, of a minister and a government that blocked in this chamber the Greens' Sun Fund Bill of a few years back? The bill would have allowed the diesel fuel rebate to be taken up by farmers and others in the bush and used not to burn diesel but to apply solar technology—including wind and photovoltaic power and hot water heating—to their isolated places in the bush to produce no greenhouse gases. It would have produced 50,000 jobs in the bush as well. And it was cost neutral; there was no extra cost to the taxpayers. This government blocked that in this house.</para><para>Mr McGauran tries to stagger on with patently wrong statements like:</para><quote><para>... it's quite sensible that fossil fuel research would be heavily supported—</para></quote><para>I would put `by the government' in parentheses there—</para><quote><para>but not to the exclusion of renewable energy.</para></quote><para>What is to be done? I think all that we can do is continue to publish the process by which this muddle-headed thinking has come about. One of the problems here, of course, is that the advice going to the Prime Minister and to the minister is not good advice. I do not think the minister and the Prime Minister are making these things up off their own bat because I do not think they are competent to do so. The advice is coming from, amongst others, the Chief Scientist, Dr Robin Batterham. Of course, he has two hats. One is as chief technologist for one of Australia's biggest coal companies, and the other is as chief adviser, on the public purse, to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Science. It is a compromise position which is simply not acceptable. Whatever the Chief Scientist might say about having a firewall in his brain, it is not acceptable that he has these two conflicting positions. It is not acceptable that he sits on the board which determines the funding for cooperative research centres as far as energy and mining are concerned. There is an absolute conflict of interest there. It is quite remarkable that not only can the minister and the Prime Minister not see that but the Chief Scientist himself cannot see that. When you go to university, you may get high distinctions for all manner of things, including science, and a mortarboard and a certificate. You can get them for almost anything but commonsense.

To take the utilitarian, market fundamentalist point of view that this government espouses, does it know that half the pharmaceuticals in the world are coming out of rainforests? I do not think so. I think Mr McGauran would believe that they are somehow mixed up out of some magic ingredients left in the back of chemist shops and that that is where it all starts. He does not understand that they come from nature and that many of them come from rainforests and indeed from the ocean. This brings me to the next thing. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Here is the remarkable Great Barrier Reef—the internationally celebrated World Heritage area, the greatest barrier reef and the greatest coral reef, in extent, in the world—which is beset by enormous problems, not least global warming coming from the coal stacks of the industry which the Prime Minister promotes, which causes bleaching and death of the coral reef, and also pollution, both land borne and coming from the oceans themselves. It is an enormously important economic asset for not just the region and Queensland but this nation. It is a hugely important natural asset for the whole world. But the government is defunding the research that is so essential to understanding it and to benefiting not just us but the coming generations.</para><para>The priorities here are absolutely unfathomable and insupportable. No argument that I have heard from the government speaker changes that, because there was no cogent argument as to why this should be happening. The Greens do support this motion.

We call on the minister to use his powers under the current CRC guidelines to hear appeals from those CRCs which have been cut out, where they apply for them. This is now becoming a matter of major public interest.</para><para>I also ask the government members who are here, and I put on the record a direct request to the Minister for Science, to produce the documents relating to the requests for funding of CRCs in this country—those that have been accepted and those that have been rejected and the appeal documents.

Let us have the fundamental information—in camera if there is commercial-in-confidence involved—upon which these maladroit decisions have been made. It is an appalling situation. It has to be rectified. There is every indication that it is simply going to get worse. The decisions this year are stonkering.

It is my belief that the current selection process put in place as a result of the recent review by John Hamilton Howard should be abandoned. Labor will start again in office by using a fully transparent process which applies criteria—including public interest research—and applies them fairly.</para></talk.start><para>My colleague Senator Carr has given a detailed explanation of how things have come to this. I do not intend to go over that ground again in detail but let me say how appalled I am to see an aggregate of $200 million axed from the CRC Program.

Australia's expenditure on R&amp;D as a percentage of GDP has fallen dramatically under the Howard government at a time when our international competitors are ramping theirs up. </para><para>I was equally shocked to learn that 19 of the 52 applications in the current round of CRC selection had been rejected by the minister. The science community has been understandably critical of the handling of both the review and this round of the selection process—and quite rightly so. However, criticisms have not been limited to the science community. The former Liberal minister and national president Tony Staley, who is also president of the photonics CRC, has had a thing or two to say. I should point out that Mr Staley is also President of the CRC Association, which represents the interests of all of Australia's CRCs. He has labelled the minister's actions as `indefensible' and clearly he is a man with some clout around the place. I understand that when the photonics CRC next discuss the matter with the government they will be doing it with Dr Nelson rather than the Minister for Science.</para><para>Other criticisms of the CRC fiasco have come from within the government's own ranks. I turn to my local community of North Queensland and consider what the Herbert MP, Mr Peter Lindsay, had to say on this issue earlier this week in the other place. On the reef CRC's commercial focus he said:</para><quote><para>Its external earnings have doubled each year since it initiated a commercialisation strategy in 2001 ...

Mr Lindsay went on to say that the significant research, education and environmental consequences of this decision were dreadful. He said:</para><quote><para>CRC Reef currently supports 17 per cent of all graduate students at JCU. It is the largest single contract for JCU in its research earnings list, about $2.5 million a year. Any threat to the ongoing work of the reef CRC would bring a major loss of external earnings for JCU and the Australian Institute of Marine Science. Each year the CRC spends more with JCU than the whole of the AIMS@JCU budget. Finally, a major reduction in spending on research on Great Barrier Reef issues, including reduced support for the Prime Minister's reef protection plan and a large reduction in research support for GBRMPA at a time when its needs are increasing, cannot be seriously contemplated. I think there is universal agreement in the parliament in relation to that.</para></quote><para>	...	...	...</para><quote><para>CRC Reef is creating a new generation of researchers who are accountable and respond to end user priorities.</para></quote><para>I do not often find myself agreeing with Mr Lindsay but I have to say he has hit the nail on the head. His bravery in speaking out on this issue is in stark contrast to his colleague the member for Leichhardt, Mr Warren Entsch, whose only contribution to the debate on Tuesday's MPI in the other place was to overstate his role in supporting the rainforest CRC. In the chamber on 11 May, his sole contribution to this important debate for our region, North Queensland, was to interject in Mr Lindsay's speech to say:</para><quote><para>We have been working closely with them.</para></quote><para>That is what Mr Entsch had to say during a debate on a matter of public importance about the retention of the rainforest and reef CRCs. That is the representation the people of Leichhardt have got from their member on the central matter of education and future scientific research in our region.</para><para>It is stretching the truth to say that Mr Entsch made a contribution because it is in contrast to what he said in Cairns. Mr Entsch was briefed by the rainforest CRC some three weeks before the decision and yet, when the decision was made public on 1 May, he waited until the middle of the following week to do anything. Then, despite waiting all that time, he had the temerity to write a letter to the editor of the local paper that was published on 5 May, which misrepresented the minister's capacity to be involved in the funding decision and slammed the <inline font-style="italic">Cairns Post </inline>for reporting the facts. In that letter, Mr Entsch claimed that the federal government values both reef and rainforest CRCs and that they stand a good chance for successful rebids in 2006. </para><para>That is a fabulous suggestion, Mr Entsch! That would leave them without any funding at all for important and ongoing research for a full 12 months—if they were to be refunded. That is not how science works. Scientists do not say: `I'll just take a bit of a holiday. I'll just put my feet up for 12 months. We'll just put the Petri dishes in the back cupboard. We'll let the rainforest crane rust for a little while and we'll come back in 12 months and maybe they'll give us the money.' That is not the way business operates and it is certainly not the way that science based CRCs operate.</para><para>Mr Entsch's claim that they will get funding under the new program is hollow indeed, because on the day after his letter was published the Prime Minister's new science package was announced. The package specifies that funding will only be provided for CRCs which will `have a stronger commercial focus'—the very reason that we are not being given funding for the reef and the rainforest CRCs. It is a hollow promise indeed. He is saying we will possibly get the funding under the new round, but the reason we did not get the funding under this round is that, ostensibly, our two CRCs are not commercial enough.</para><para>I can assure senators that Mr Entsch's insensitivity has gone down like a ton of bricks in our community, especially among those hardworking researchers and scientists, and their families, who are facing unemployment or the prospect of becoming suitcase scientists, unable to work in North Queensland as the Howard government's indefensible denial of funding is actualised.</para><para>The rainforest CRC conducts research which benefits the community and the environment. For example, it has done considerable work on feral pigs and climate change, and the reef CRC contributes greatly to the control of crown-of-thorns starfish and coral bleaching. The value of this world renowned research simply cannot be quantified commercially. The reef and the rainforest are not only important environmental assets to our region; they form the basis of our enormous tourism industry. Further, the opportunity for our young scientists to stay in the north is now greatly diminished. In fact, no new CRC will be based further north than Brisbane.</para><para>The brain drain from North Queensland is outrageous when you consider the comments made by Queensland's Chief Scientist, Professor Peter Andrews, on 19 April this year, in launching North Queensland's Innovation and Technology Week. Professor Andrews said:</para><quote><para>North Queensland has some unique advantages, its biodiversity and tropical location for example ...</para></quote><para>He went on that it has:</para><quote><para>... great potential to use its research and development strengths to make major contributions to achieve lasting competitiveness for the State's new industries like biotechnology, but also our existing industries like agriculture, mining and tourism.</para></quote><para>He understands the importance of science in developing technology based and innovative companies and in encouraging careers in knowledge based industries and organisations; the Howard government clearly does not. </para><para>Not one government MP or senator has had the decency to stand up and explain what this means for the research effort of James Cook University. It has been put to me that two-thirds of James Cook University's research effort is associated with these two CRCs. No-one has explained what will happen to the fabulous research facility of the rainforest crane, which has been completely funded by the rainforest CRC. With that asset, scientists are undertaking groundbreaking research—completely new and novel research, research that has never been contemplated before. The crane can traverse everywhere from the ground to the top of the canopy, which is impossible to do without that sort of structure. The crane is completely funded by the Rainforest CRC and it stands to be closed down if the funding to the organisation does not continue. </para><para>No-one has explained what it will mean for the establishment of the Australian Tropical Forest Institute, which was to operate, in the main, as the commercial arm of the rainforest CRC. The Queensland government has committed $7 million to this project, and I now share the anger of those members of our business, education and science communities who have worked so hard to see this institute come to fruition and have developed this innovative concept and who must now feel as though they are watching a marvellous opportunity at grave risk of going to waste.</para><para>I must point out that this is not the only recent attack on science in the north by the Howard government. CSIRO has publicly announced that it intends to relocate the National Herbarium from Atherton, on the Atherton Tablelands, to Canberra—a course of action which is completely unacceptable to me and to the great majority of people in North Queensland. For us, the decision to deny funding to our internationally significant CRCs is just one more nail in the north's knowledge coffin. I, therefore, ask senators to join me in supporting Senator Carr's motion.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>23307</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on Senator Carr's motion on the implementation of the current cooperative research centres selection round. It is interesting that out of the entire budget and area of education Senator Carr has chosen this topic. This shows how bereft the Labor Party are in finding targets for attack in what has been an absolutely outstanding budget. In my observation of politics over a period of 40 years, it is the best budget that has ever been delivered. </para></talk.start><para>The reason this government can deliver such a budget is our track record of economic success over the last eight years. The fact that we have delivered low inflation and high growth has meant that the tax revenues have boomed, and that has meant that this government can return that dividend to the people to help families, help businesses and develop innovative policies in aged care. We have the room to do it because this government produce surpluses. Let us contrast that with the last government. At my last count, the worst budget of the Keating government delivered a deficit of over $20 billion. Indeed, over his four-year term, he racked up government debt of $90 billion.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name></talker><para>—Like Mark Latham did at Liverpool council.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>O15</name.id><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name></talker><para>—You are quite right, Senator Abetz. The economic mismanagement of the Keating government was only exceeded by the economic mismanagement at the same time of Mark Latham at the Liverpool City Council. That was a little cameo perhaps: what he did for Liverpool he will do for the whole country. This would return us to the dark days of the Keating regime where there were massive deficits, there was no room for governments to move, programs were being cut and the role of government in assisting society was greatly hampered. </para></talk.start></continue><para>That brings me back to the area of education being attacked, which is the CRCs. It is remarkable that Senator Carr has picked this particular target. It shows his lack of targets because, over the last two years, under the visionary leadership of Brendan Nelson, the Minister for Education, Science and Training, this country has had a revolution in the area of universities and research. The Crossroads review has delivered a change to education in the university sector that has set up this area of education in an excellent way for the 21st century. We now have universities that will be properly funded with a mix of private and public expenditure, again giving universities room to move as they develop their mission. Part of that mission is in the area of research.</para><para>Following the university review last year, and its implementation at the start of this year, the Howard government has moved on the agenda further by reform in the area of research and delivered another $5 billion into this area. This is point that Senator Carr does not make. Where are his comments about the visionary leadership of Geoff Garrett at the CSIRO and the flagship program that he inspired, which has been funded by this government? Where are Senator Carr's comments in relation to the ARC program, which they grossly underfunded? Under Backing Australia's Ability I, we doubled the funding of that program.</para><para>This government is a great supporter of research. We realise that research will return to the economy three- to five-fold the initial investment. It is not an expense for government. It is an investment in the future of Australia, because research quite often becomes applied and has outcomes that help benefit the economy. The only Labor minister who had any vision for this was Barry Jones, who was the minister for science in the early eighties under the Hawke government. He even wrote a book about it called <inline font-style="italic">Sleepers, Wake</inline>, which was about the way in which this country should develop research and use that as a driver of economic activity. The sleepers in the Hawke-Keating government stayed asleep. Whereas Barry Jones had a vision 20 years down the track for research, his cabinet colleagues had a vision of 20 months down the track to the next election and they did not back research. The tragedy for the Jones leadership in that area at that time was that, as a percentage of GDP, research actually declined. Under the Hawke-Keating government, research got a very bad deal. But they did come up with one good reform: the CRC Program. That has been rolled over into this government. It has been expanded and developed and it is the subject of the debate this afternoon.</para><para>I chaired a Senate committee at the end of that Keating government into where research was up to. That was where we identified that the CRC Program was so good and worthy of continued funding. The sad thing we found as we looked at research at the end of the Keating era was that there were many good programs in research in the universities and in the public institutions but they were not being particularly well funded. As a matter of fact, we found that you could double the funding in most of these areas and you would still get outstanding outcomes. One example was the Australian Research Council. We found in 1995 that only 17 per cent of the projects put up were funded and that 33 per cent of the projects were absolutely outstanding. What a waste and loss to Australian research and the Australian economy that those programs were lost. They were not funded because the last Labor government did not put enough money into research.</para><para>The CRC Program that was started by Mr Dawkins was one area that they did put adequate funding into. This program started in 1990. The idea was to fill a major hole in the research landscape in Australia, particularly in research and development and partnerships between research institutions and companies that might apply that research and produce commercial outcomes. I would like to remind Senator Brown and Senator Allison particularly that that was the purpose of the CRCs. They were meant to have a commercial outcome, mainly because that is where the big gap was in the research and development landscape in Australia. We had an excellent record in agricultural research and development. We had an excellent record in the area of mining. But when it came to the secondary and tertiary industries it was extremely patchy. Many of the big companies, particularly multinationals, preferred to do their research in other countries. To a large extent this was due to economies of scale, and they took a commercial decision and did a lot of this research elsewhere. I was heartened to learn that there are a lot of SMEs, small to medium enterprises, that do not ask for government grants because they do not want to be bothered with a lot of paperwork and they do the research anyway. So probably our research effort in the industrial area is a little bit understated in terms of its reporting. </para><para>Despite that, we still have a major gap in the area of research and development in secondary industry, and the CRCs have filled that void to some extent. But the whole idea was to have a commercial outcome. I want to illustrate that with one example that Senator Carr alluded to—and in doing so showed his total misunderstanding of the whole nature and process of CRCs—that is, the photonics cooperative research centre. The photonics centre for research in Sydney was basically aimed at developing high-performance optic fibre. I went to observe the centre first in 1994. It was located in a basement under the old medical school, which was leaking. The researchers were developing the high-performance optic fibre in a little lab, and they had some minor commercial applications at the time. The next time I went back was in 1997, and by that stage they had moved to the research and development centre in Redfern. They had a very large research and development organisation, and a number of spin-off companies were starting to develop. A lot of the academics at the university became product developers and commercial appliers of research, and a lot of them went on to create successful companies and made quite a bit of money.</para><para>The next time I saw them was at a dinner here in Canberra in 1999. They reported on the success of what they were developing, and the whole thing was continuing on its commercial orientation. That is what Senator Carr does not understand. That is what the CRCs were supposed to do. They were not supposed to stay on the public teat forever. The whole idea of a CRC is that you take your research, you move it through the development phase and the product phase and then you commercialise the product. That creates room for the development of other CRCs, and that means we can keep moving research through over a whole range of areas. That is the whole objective of this very robust CRC model. It is so robust that other advanced research countries, like France and Germany, are taking a hard look at our CRC model; they think it is a template for how you should do research.</para><para>That brings me to the question that Senator Carr raised in his criticisms this afternoon. He said that the current round of cooperative research centre selection has been `botched', to use his term. To say that funding has been denied to the reef, rainforest and photonics CRCs is untrue. Government figures on CRC funding reveal the following. The reef CRC has previously been successful in three selection rounds, most recently winning $3 million in supplementary funding in the 2002 selection round. The total CRC Program funding committed to the reef CRC since 1993 has been $30.355 million, and its existing funding agreement runs until June 2006. That sounds to me like another 2½ years and another two budget cycles. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BOT</name.id><name role="metadata">Santoro, Sen Santo</name><name role="display">Senator Santoro</name></talker><para>—Pretty strong commitment, isn't it?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>O15</name.id><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name></talker><para>—I think it is a very strong commitment. I acknowledge the contribution of Senator Santo Santoro from Queensland. We are discussing the reef CRC, which is in Queensland. The other CRC mentioned by Senator Carr was the CRC for tropical rainforest ecology and management, which has also been successful in the past three budget rounds. Its total CRC Program funding since 1993 has been $29.7 million. The current funding runs to 2006, yet again through another two budget cycles. The CRC for coastal zone, estuary and waterway management has also been successful in the past two selection rounds. Its total funding since 1998 has been $17.7 million. The contract of that CRC with the Commonwealth runs, yet again, to June 2006. Let us look more broadly at the current round of applications, rather than at just the three or four CRCs we have been focusing on this afternoon in this debate. For the 2004 CRC Program, 52 applications were received and individually assessed by an independent selection panel. From listening to Senator Carr, one would have thought he wanted to go away from that process. Maybe he would like a Ros Kelly style whiteboard approach!</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BOT</name.id><name role="metadata">Santoro, Sen Santo</name><name role="display">Senator Santoro</name></talker><para>—He doesn't respect the independent umpire.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>O15</name.id><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name></talker><para>—Senator Santoro is correct. We have an independent umpire system. We have an arm's length system. There has been criticism of the minister this afternoon, but he has set up an arm's length process for the determination of the applications. The applications were determined by that panel based on the criteria for the selection of CRCs. The panel deemed 19 applications to be unsuccessful because they were not competitive against the selection criteria. Labor has said it would fund three of these unsuccessful programs but has given no reason why it would fund those and not the other 16. We are yet to hear the rationale behind its approach or what criteria it would use—but presumably it would use the whiteboard approach and fund the programs of mates, which of course is a long-held tradition within the ALP.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Under the current program, the success stories are from primary research areas as well as from cutting edge sectors such as vision technology, advanced composite structures, cochlear implants and molecular plant breeding. A focus on technology CRCs in this round is necessary, as environmental CRCs were the most successful in the 2002 round. This is something that Senator Allison and Senator Brown seemed to miss in their contributions. They just saw the CRCs as another way of funding environmental research. It does not matter how you do it or what the outcomes are; you are just funding environmental research. That is not the idea of the CRCs. The idea of the CRCs is the commercialisation of research. They must meet that criteria.</para><para>There are other avenues of research and there are other avenues of funding. There should be environmental research and there should be environmental funding. Indeed, under this government there is, but a lot of this is done through other programs. That is where Senator Brown and Senator Allison completely miss the point. This government is the most supportive government of research in the last century. We have seen its importance in terms of the development of the Australian economy. The CRC Program in the past has been a linchpin and will continue to be a linchpin of this type of research into the future. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>23311</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Carr moved a motion in the Senate this afternoon relating to CRCs, cooperative research centres, noting with concern the adverse effects of the government's botched implementation of the current cooperative research centre selection round and calling on the government to restore public interest research as a key selection criteria for future CRCs. There is a third section of his motion, which I will get to as I go through my contribution this evening.</para></talk.start><para>Cooperative research centres were established in 1991 under a Labor government. You have to rely on Labor governments to come up with new and innovative ideas, particularly when it comes to education and research and development. Nothing happens under this government. That section of portfolio development under this federal government has stagnated. Fifteen CRCs were established in 1991. There are now over 100. When CRCs were established in 1991 the minister for science said:</para><quote><para>Australia must match the technology push provided by its strong research base with the demand pull of industry and other research users.</para></quote><para>Despite Senator Tierney's contribution that CRCs are about the commercialisation of research, that was not in fact their purpose or reason for being established back in 1991. As the minister for science said at the time, it was to meet the demand of industry but also to provide research and work with other research users.</para><para>We know that research and development is used to stimulate economic growth. In this country it has been at the forefront and at the cutting edge of development, industry and science. In fact, it has been used to break through the mysteries and phenomena of different sciences. CRCs are about new ideas and solving problems. We have a number that are world class and recognised internationally. Research in our country has been front and centre of the world stage and has led new frontiers in all areas of science. Commitment to other research essentially means public interest research. When CRCs were established, as the minister, whom I have quoted, said at the time, they were to match the technology with other research users. Generally that has been meant to involve public research for public good. Commitment to other research has generally meant research that is in the public interest.</para><para>What does that mean? It means research that is currently being undertaken in relation to groundwater resource management, solar power and energy, biodiversity and hydrogen energy. It means world renowned centres that are unique to this country and the world, such as the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area CRC, the tropical rainforest ecology CRC and the coastal zone estuary and waterways management CRC. In Darwin we have the CRC for indigenous and tropical health and a CRC that has been established in Alice Springs, known as the desert knowledge CRC. These are CRCs that go to creating new ideas. They go to protecting our environment and managing our natural resources. They go to providing long-term sustainability. In the area of health and wellbeing they go to providing cures and preventative measures. They are for research in collaboration with other research users. They are for research in the public interest and for the good of the community.</para><para>But this government has walked away from the public interest research test and deserted the CRCs that provide that. We have seen that just in the last few weeks in the latest funding round. We have the farcical policy switch of the government that has left world renowned research centres out in the cold. How did this come to be? How did this happen? John Howard—an academic from New South Wales, not the actor or the Prime Minister—conducted a review and evaluation of the CRC Program in 2003 to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the CRC Program. I will provide some comments about some of the outcomes of that review. The document from that review says: </para><quote><para>The arguments for public involvement in industrial research are well rehearsed and it is not proposed to restate them in this Evaluation. </para></quote><para>It goes on to say:</para><quote><para>The point is that publicly supported collaborative research can deliver substantial benefits to the economy, industry, and the community over the longer term through the creation and application of knowledge that enhances international competitiveness ...</para></quote><para>It also goes on to say:</para><quote><para>There has been a profound change in Australia's research and innovation culture since the Programme was introduced. There has been, for example:  </para><para>A widespread recognition of the role of public-private research ...</para><para>In the context of the “knowledge economy”, an acceptance of a role for the public sector in supporting new business development ... </para><para>A greater understanding of the contribution of science to the design and implementation of public programmes ...</para></quote><para>But, as you read through this document, you gradually come to the conclusion that this document is nothing more than a set-up. This document is nothing more than a number of pages that have been predetermined and cobbled together to provide this government with the platform on which it now justifies its funding of CRCs. Let me give you a perfect example. In this evaluation, it says:</para><quote><para>Given the changes in the industrial research and innovation culture referred to earlier, there would, however, be a strong expectation that more resources would be directed towards CRCs based on new business development involving the commercialisation of university and publicly funded research. Such re-direction would necessarily have regard to the quality of the “investment” proposals submitted.</para></quote><para>Therefore, one ought not be surprised to find that in fact the recommendation is:</para><quote><para>The CRC Program should continue, but with design modifications to reflect changes in the environment for public-private sector research collaboration and the creation of new business models for the commercialisation of publicly funded research, as identified and canvassed in this Report.</para></quote><para>What does that really mean? It means that, unless your research is going to drive the dollar, unless the research is going to benefit industry, forget it; this government will not look at it and will not fund it. So the evaluation that was conducted last year had a predetermined outcome. It was a set-up in order to allow the minister to have an excuse to change the guidelines of December. The evaluation was a reason to take a knife to these CRCs, which have a public interest research base, and to not fund them and put them, as we now find, on the list of casualties. </para><para>You cannot blame the committee for the recent announcements which the minister sought to make. He deliberately made changes to the focus and the guidelines so that he could pretend there was a legitimate excuse to take the funding away from the CRCs. So we have a predetermined scenario: we decide we want to change the focus from a public interest research base to a commercial base only, we set up an evaluation where the outcome is predetermined, we use that as a reason to change the guidelines and the funding outcomes—and there you go. The deckchairs are arranged in relation to research funding, and it all looks as though it is the fault of the evaluation and the committee that made the decisions. But it has been a set-up by this government from the very beginning.  </para><para>Scientists now have to turn projects and their research into money-spinners. Research for the public good will no longer be funded as part of the CRC Program, which is worth $220 million. Researchers must now show that they can contribute substantially to this country's industrial, commercial and economic growth. So the government has narrowed the guidelines for CRC funding to ensure that there is a tighter commercial focus and that the focus of research in this country is entirely generated for a commercial outcome and is industry driven. </para><para>I believe that the decisions have been controversial and, in fact, are against the public interest and the public good test. What does that mean for the CRCs that are left—the CRCs in Aboriginal health, asthma research or research into bushfires? Will they in fact be next in the line of CRCs to be popped onto the casualty list? I add that those CRCs that have already made it onto the list are: the Australian Photonics CRC in Sydney, the CRC for satellite 2 systems, the aquifer CRC which looks at ground water resource management, the CRC solar biodiscovery, as I have said, and of course the fairly good and internationally renowned CRCs. But the CRCs for which the defunding has caused some controversy are those in Queensland related to the Great Barrier Reef, the rainforests and the coastal zones.</para><para>This government has not had a good and proud record of research funding under Prime Minister Howard-. Research funding in this country fails to maintain the government's spending, as a percentage of GDP. Since 1996 Australian expenditure on research and development has been well below the OECD average of 2.3 per cent of GDP, and Australia's share has declined while the OECD average and expectation in research funding has been rising. An example is that over the period between 2004--05 and 2010--11, Backing Australia's Ability 2 will in fact deliver $5.3 billion. Some people would believe that that is a quite extraordinary amount and it is. But if you were going to keep up with the percentage of funding on research compared to the amount that is spent according to the share of GDP, you would have to spend $5.9 billion. So the money that has gone into research under this government has not kept up with the 2.3 per cent share of GDP that has been expected internationally. Government-projected funding over the period is not likely to be sufficient to even cover the expected inflation rate and, therefore, it constitutes a real cut in government expenditure on the original research package. This simply means that this is a government that is treading water when it comes to the allocation of research funds in this country, rather than including additional funds that are needed to meet the challenges of the future and to maintain our position on the international research stage.</para><para>But wait, there is more. There has been a little bit of a hiccup in the minister's attempt to manipulate the funding outcomes of the CRC Program and its funding range. What he failed to remember was that he took the knife to the CRC that, in fact, is supported by his mates. The former federal Liberal Party President and former Fraser government minister Tony Staley went on the attack over the Howard government's termination of the world renowned photonics cooperative research centre. It is interesting to note that, on 27 May 2003 at a CRC Association dinner here at Parliament House, the Prime Minister had this to say: </para><quote><para>The CRCs success stories include ... the first all-Australian satellite in 30 years.</para></quote><para>He also said, back in 2001: </para><quote><para>An industry— </para></quote><para>that is, photonics—</para><quote><para>very much of the future as well as of the present and I know an industry that is going to bring employment and hope and excitement to the people of Australia into the future. </para></quote><para>So in 2001 and 2003 the Prime Minister understood the value of the satellite and photonics CRCs—in the recent past—but it seems that his memory has now gone a bit blank. We have even seen this government take a knife to a CRC that is supported by its mates. The current president of the photonics CRC, Mr Staley, described the defunding of the CRC as `indefensible'. An appeal has been lodged with the Minister for Science, Mr McGauran. Mr Staley said that the photonics CRC involved researchers from five states and territories and a $60 million contribution from universities and TAFEs, and he foreshadowed that more than $60 million would come from the private sector. But that is going to go; it will be gone. This government has rewritten the funding guidelines, and it has decided that this is one of the CRCs that is up for the chop and will not exist, if the government has its way. Of course, Minister McGauran said that the decision had been made by the Cooperative Research Centres Committee, and he said that he would stand by its decision. In an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on 8 May Mr McGauran said:</para><quote><para>Arrangements have been made to meet with the CRC for Photonics as soon as possible. Until then I have no comment to make, except there is no provision for appeal in the program's guidelines, and that should be known by all applicants.</para></quote><para>But the minister is very wrong, and this is an issue that members of the government have failed to understand today. We are talking about a number of CRCs that are affected. The guidelines, which I have in front of me, specifically outline the role of the minister, and they say:</para><quote><para>The Minister for Science has overall responsibility for the CRC Programme.</para></quote><para>So it is within his power to not support the recommendations of the committee and to actually fund the CRCs. The guidelines state:</para><quote><para>The Minister decides which CRCs will be funded and the conditions of any funding offer. The final decision by the Minister will take account of the requirements of these selection guidelines and will be fully documented, including reasons for the decision.</para></quote><para>The guidelines also state:</para><quote><para>In deciding which CRCs get funded and what terms and conditions, if any, are attached to the funding offer, the Minister—</para></quote><para>again, all of the responsibility for this lies at the feet of the minister—</para><quote><para>may have regard to the advice of the CRC Committee arising from the assessment process and may take into consideration other matters including the application and related documentation.</para></quote><para>So the minister does not have to take the advice of the committee at all. He can actually decide to fund those CRCs that have currently made it onto the short list, those CRCs that are likely to get the chop—and at this stage we know that there are at least 11 of them. He can decide to ignore the wishes of the committee and to go ahead and fund them, but because this government specifically orchestrated a review of CRCs, then deliberately changed the guidelines—a farcical exercise in order to skew research in this country towards commercial, industry-driven outcomes rather than towards the public interest and the public good—he is not likely to do it. He should just come clean and say that the whole process has been totally manipulated.</para><para>The third part of Senator Carr's motion today, therefore, calls on the Minister for Science to take responsibility for the denial of funding to nationally significant CRCs such as the reef, the rainforest and the photonics CRCs, and to use his powers under the current guidelines—which he has and which I have just read into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for the benefit of people in the government and for the benefit of the minister in particular—to hear appeals from the CRCs against their exclusion from the current selection round. </para><para>This process has been manipulated by this government from go to whoa. This is a minister trying to blame everyone else—blame the committee; blame Mr Howard, who conducted the review—but he is not willing to take responsibility himself for the outrageous decision made in relation to defunding world-class cooperative research centres, particularly in Queensland and in Sydney, that are undertaking vital and important research in relation to our environment, alternative energies and maintenance of the community and in relation to the provision of diverse means through which we can look at water resource management, solar energy, satellite systems and maintaining the environment, particularly in the Great Barrier Reef and the tropical rainforests. Because these things are not commercially driven, because there is no commercial outcome to this and because there are no dollars attached to this that industry can hang its hat on, this minister is going to step away and not take any responsibility for this.</para><para>These are CRCs that have put in an appeal to the minister. He is denying he has responsibility under the guidelines to take any action. The guidelines clearly specify that there is a role for the minister, and the role of the minister is front and centre not only in advocating the funding but also in saving the CRCs by turning this decision around and saying, `We've made a mistake. We will re-fund those CRCs. We will give them the funding they deserve and put them back on the stage of the international research arena so that the efforts that we contribute globally and internationally can be maintained, recognised and appreciated not just by people in Queensland, Sydney and around this country but also by scientists and environmentalists right around the world.'</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>23315</page.no><name role="metadata">Santoro, Sen Santo</name><name role="display">Senator SANTORO</name><name.id>BOT</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Listening to Senator Crossin, I have again become convinced that the Labor Party just cannot help itself. It lives by crying wolf over all manner of imagined ills and then it whinges when other people point out the flaws in the logic of its arguments—as speakers on this side of the Senate have done throughout this debate. Such is the case with the motion moved by Senator Carr that we are debating today and, indeed, the contributions of senators opposite.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Carr's motion proposes that the Minister for Science overrule the decisions made by an independent selection committee on the current round of funding for cooperative research centres. It asserts that the government has botched the implementation of the current round and calls on us to note this with concern. It also calls on the government to `restore public interest research as a key selection criteria'—I think it means criterion, Madam Acting Deputy President Kirk; and I am putting the whole thing in quotes, as befits fiction—`for future CRCs'.</para><para>Labor calls on the Minister for Science to take responsibility for the denial of funding to nationally significant CRCs such as the reef, rainforest and photonics CRCs and to use his powers under the current CRC guidelines to hear appeals from such CRCs against their exclusion from the current selection round. In short—and as other speakers and the minister have pointed out—Labor is seeking to politicise an independent process. Labor thinks it knows better than the experts—in fact, that has always been a particular and peculiar problem of the Labor Party—and because it thinks this is so it would like to trample on the independent decision making process that CRCs rely on.</para><para>In all, 52 applications were received for the 2004 selection round of the CRC Program, and the committee decided that 19 of these applications were not competitive enough against the selection criteria. This is a game of Labor bluff—political blindman's bluff, in fact, or perhaps it is another attempt by the Labor Party to pin the tail on the donkey. It missed. As I said yesterday—in the context of another Labor bluff: its policy for workplaces in this enterprising country wherein it wishes to hand them over to its preferred regulators, the unions—the sky does not fall or the earth reverse its orbit around the sun just because the Labor Party says it will if someone does something that is not to its taste. </para><para>According to Labor, the community is already bearing the brunt of the cuts in funding to cooperative research centres. Senator Carr would like us to believe that, right across the Great Barrier Reef, millions of coral polyps are ready to rise in revolt, egged on by the green lobby and Labor's obtuse political me-too-ism, because they will not be visited as often, they fear, by scientists being paid to research them. As Senator Tierney has said, that is absolute nonsense, because funding for that particular CRC does not run out until 2006.</para><para>We know this is all just politics on the part of the Labor Party. We know that this is a product of the ALP's `quick, find a platform' department. That is why Labor has done a rain dance over the minister's proper and sensible position that it is the job of the selection committee to select CRCs for funding from competing and competitive applications. That is why it has announced that it would fund three of the CRCs that were excluded by the selection process from the current round. That is why it will never say which of the successful CRC applicants in this round would be axed or how much money would be taken from the successful applicants to fund the three CRCs in the `Labor Choice' awards. I listened very carefully to the contributions from senators opposite, and not once did they display the courage to say which of the successful CRCs in the latest round they would deprive of funding. Until they start putting their money where their mouth is, honourable senators opposite cannot come into this place and insult the intelligence of senators—particularly those who are prepared to listen to them.</para><para>It is important for everyone to recognise that Australia needs more research that will lead to new and improved goods and services and additional economic activity. There are other funding opportunities—many of them—for research that is not directed towards new and improved goods and services and additional economic activity. The best public interest research is precisely that research whose objective is to produce economic gain and improve economic and social capabilities. That is in no way to decry or seek to diminish respect for the more esoteric varieties of research that Senator Carr, in his artistic motion today, apparently favours—along with his colleagues and attendant lobbyists.</para><para>But it is a question of priority. In budget week one would have thought that even the Labor Party would connect with reality—imperfectly perhaps, but nonetheless they would try—and with the fact that dollars are finite. We all know that `son of Whitlam' is playing with dodgy dollars today in the other place—no doubt his disciples in this place will be doing so, too, after the dinner break—but most sensible people are very well aware that dodgy dollars simply do not work. Those Australians who remember the first Whitlam and his three-year crash-and-burn collision with fiscal reality and responsibility have good reason to fear a prodigal return by the member for Werriwa.</para><para>In relation to the shred of reality that Senator Carr's motion attempts to cling to in this debate, it must be remembered that the majority of the 19 unsuccessful applications in this CRC round were new operations rather than CRCs that already exist. As we know, the unsuccessful solar CRC bid was in this category. The five unsuccessful applicants for 2004 round funding that were existing CRCs have secure funding for more than two years to come. Listening to Labor and others and their siren songs of distress, you would think that everyone involved had been instantly deprived of funding. That is not the case. If Labor valued honesty, it would stop seeking a shrieking headline and come back down from orbit. </para><para>I turn to the Queensland context. Obviously, as a senator for Queensland this is vitally important to me. It needs to be underlined here—again, as others have already done; in particular, Senator Tierney—that the CRC for the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage area will receive $5.5 million in the next two years, taking the total it has received from the Commonwealth to $19.4 million. It is important to re-emphasise—and I do so very emphatically—that the CRC for Tropical Rainforest Ecology and Management will receive $5.6 million over the next two years, which will mean a total of $18.95 million over the seven-year life of the centre. It is important to again re-emphasise—and I do so emphatically—that the CRC for Coastal Zone, Estuary and Waterway Management will receive $6.6 million this year, taking its total from the taxpayer to $17.72 million.</para><para>While we are talking about important things to remember in this artificial debate that the Labor Party for political reasons has kicked along, let us remember these things, too. Great Barrier Reef research is also funded through the Australian Institute of Marine Science; CSIRO; the Australian Research Council; and several universities, including James Cook University. The Howard government is committed to supporting renewable energy research. As well as funding provided through the existing CRC Program, the funding commitments of the education, science and training portfolio to renewable energy research include Australian Research Council funding for renewable energy related research of $26.3 million over 2002-04 and government funding for CSIRO renewable energy research of $14.1 million between July 1998 and November last year. The R&amp;D Start program administered by AusIndustry had funding commitments to renewable energy projects over the past two years of about $9 million. R&amp;D tax concessions relevant to renewable energy totalled about $23 million in 2002-03. Let us remember those things during this debate.</para><para>In short, the government is very well aware of the continuing importance of research work into sources and technologies of renewable energy, and of the critical importance of the Great Barrier Reef as a unique living organism of which all Australians are the custodians. There is no monopoly on any side of politics on reasonable and reasoned environmentalism. So let us have no more of the sort of desperate and cynical hand wringing that we see from those opposite when in pursuit of a vote.</para><para>Queensland is also the home of a lot of world-leading medical research. The Howard government supports that and will continue to support it. As honourable senators will be aware, Queensland leads the world in many aspects of tropical medicine, among other disciplines in the world of medical science. This leadership has been enhanced by the Howard government's strong commitment to both excellence and independence in research. We on this side of the chamber simply do not believe in guided research any more than we believe in guided democracy of the sort that Labor invariably tries on whenever it is in power. </para><para>We believe in the power of the human mind, unfettered by the constraints on freedom imposed by Labor picking winners—or not, as is generally the case—and free to go where it will in pursuit of excellence or answers or the genius of great research. That is why, for example, the Howard government is always ready to be innovative in its own policy research and development and implementation. I hear lots of feedback from the research community in Queensland, and I have to tell senators opposite I do not hear many cries of anguish from the people who run productive and, I stress, results-oriented research funded by government money.</para><para>In fact, the reverse is the case: the Howard government listens very carefully and acts accordingly. That is why, for example, the new science and innovation package—which was belittled by Senator Crossin a few minutes ago—called Backing Australia's Ability: Building Our Future through Science and Innovation, which is worth $5.35 billion over seven years, is such a great program. That package was announced by the Prime Minister last week and, like much else that comes from the Prime Minister and our government, it is a carefully coordinated multiportfolio operation that builds on past success. That is what government is about: delivery; sound policy; and sensible, properly funded outcomes. It is not about running around in circles like headless chooks shouting, `We'll all be rooned'. Senators opposite might like to note that.</para><para>I respectfully suggest to Senator Carr, and I note that he is in the chamber, that his motion is a disgrace. It does not adorn the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>, it stains it. It is simply not acquainted with fact. It derives from the poisoned well of underachievement in policy development. Labor has no ideas, so instead it makes a lot of noise. The new Backing Australia's Ability package builds on the original $3 billion policy announced by the Prime Minister in 2001. And in the context of Labor's sad little exercise here today, it is worth repeating what the package also provides in funding for important new initiatives. These are only examples; senators opposite might like to inform themselves by studying the full package.</para><para>There has been $305 million provided for CSIRO on top of its base funding in order to support large-scale collaborative research projects in areas of national importance such as preventive health, food and agriculture, water and the environment, light metals production, new energy technologies and Australia's oceans. Infrastructure support to Australia's medical research institutes—including the Queensland Institute of Medical Research—has been allocated $200 million. I pay a particular tribute to that magnificent research institute based in Queensland, and I see the Special Minister of State, Senator Abetz, nodding because I have often explained to him the value of supporting that particular institute. This funding will assist institutes to underpin research conducted with National Health and Medical Research Council grants.</para><para>There has been $38.8 million designated for new initiatives connecting schools with local industry groups and universities in order to inspire school students about science and mathematics. And $7.2 million is being provided for a new unit in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to coordinate and focus R&amp;D to support Australia's counter-terrorism needs. These are practical, forward-looking and innovative elements that support practical science and new technologies. Against that record of solid achievement, Labor's sorry effort with this motion today stands exposed for the sham and fraud that it and its authors represent.</para><para>In conclusion, I cannot let part of the contribution by Senator Crossin go by without passing further comment on it. She suggested that this government is somehow prepared or able to interfere and that somehow the program of selection of CRCs is flawed. She comes into this place and says that the CRC that is associated with Tony Staley—a very distinguished Australian and a former member of this parliament—has somehow not received funding, that the government should intervene and that even Tony Staley is criticising it. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>—That is what he says; he says it's indefensible!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BOT</name.id><name role="metadata">Santoro, Sen Santo</name><name role="display">Senator SANTORO</name></talker><para>—That proves the point that this government does not interfere with the independent umpire.

Labor believes in investing in the environment, passing on our natural assets and heritage to the next generation. Taking climate change seriously—ratifying the Kyoto Protocol and establishing an emissions trading system. New national policies to save the Murray/Darling, to protect our native forests, our beaches, our coastline.</para><para>And when it comes to national security, Labor will never, neglect the homefront. Always, Australia first we'll establish a Department of Homeland Security, upgrade our port and regional airport security and create an Australian Coastguard—maritime policing for our 37,000kms of coastline.</para><para>This is the future for our nation: services, conservation, security. Opening up new opportunities—not just now, but for the next 10 years.</para><para>When Mark Latham became Leader of the Opposition, he said that he wanted to be positive. He said that he didn't believe in Opposition for Opposition's sake. So let me outline Labor's positive alternative, our plan for Australia's future.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Economic Management</inline></para><para>Our starting point is better Budget management. The Howard-Costello Government is the highest taxing government in Australia's history. There is no shortage of funds pouring into Canberra. Our task is to make better use of this money: to cut waste and mismanagement, to reorder priorities.</para><para>While the Government has gone on a spending spree, Labor has taken a different approach. For every dollar of extra social investment, we've been making a dollar of budget savings—cutting back on government waste. So far, we have identified more than $8 billion in savings, with more to come.</para><para>In this Budget, the Government is spending more than 100 million on taxpayer-funded political advertising—spending for the Liberal Party, not the Australian people.</para><para>It also plans to sell Telstra, wasting $650 million on consultants and financial advisers. Under Labor, we'll be saving the taxpayer money. We'll be keeping Telstra where it belongs: in majority public ownership.</para><para>A Labor Government will reduce bureaucracy, abolishing seven government agencies and cutting a further 13 government programs. And as we examine this Budget, more cuts will be made.</para><para>Not all of these decisions will be popular. Some interest groups will inevitably complain.</para><para>But the decisions need to be made. Budgets are about choices. And Labor's choice is to cut bureaucracy and wasteful spending to make way for our investments in education and health.</para><para>This is also responsible economic policy. A Labor Government will produce budget surpluses in each year of the next Parliament—cutting net debt and holding down interest rates.</para><para>We also believe in limiting the size of government. Too much spending, too much bureaucracy is bad for the Australian economy. This is why we will reduce Commonwealth expenditure and Commonwealth taxation as a proportion of GDP.</para><para>This is our Budget Pledge to the Australian people. Social investment, Yes, but also an attack on waste and mismanagement. </para><para>We also want to grow the Australian economy through more assistance for small business—backing their hard work and enterprise.</para><para>We need to reduce red-tape and paperwork, starting with the Business Activity Statement. This involves huge compliance costs—small businesspeople filling out forms for the government, instead of spending time with their families or actually running their businesses.</para><para>This is why Labor will simplify the Business Activity Statement. Our Simpler BAS Option will allow small businesses to use a Tax Office ratio to calculate their quarterly GST payments, with no annual or quarterly reconciliations.</para><para>This method couldn't be simpler, with just one calculation and just two boxes on the BAS form. It is estimated that our policy will reduce compliance costs by 80 to 90 percent.</para><para>Labor will also ensure that small businesses are not smothered by the market power of big business. We want a fair trading environment—strengthening the Trade Practices Act and the ACCC to protect small business against anti competitive practices.</para><para>Labor will outlaw predatory pricing and introduce gaol terms and divestiture powers to deal with hard-core cartels. The ACCC will be authorised to issue “cease and desist” orders to provide immediate relief against market abuse. It will also be given new powers to deal with creeping acquisitions and the exploitation of franchisees.</para><para>The Trade Practices Act is now 30 years old. It urgently needs an overhaul—new powers to protect small business against the anti-competitive conduct of big business. It's time to give the small business sector a fair go in the Australian marketplace.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Ladder of Opportunity</inline></para><para>Mark Latham has always believed in governments helping people providing opportunity for all Australians. But he also knows that people should be willing to help themselves—to work hard, to exercise responsibility. There is no way out of poverty and disadvantage without having a go, without effort.</para><para>This is what Mark Latham calls the ladder of opportunity the importance of hard work, strong communities and the civilising role of government.</para><para>Mark Latham wants all Australians climbing the ladder—getting stuck in and working hard, supported by decent community services. The Howard-Costello Government has been irking the rungs out of the ladder. Mark wants to put them back in.</para><para>The first rung is education—investing the skills and ability of the Australian people. Under the current Government, this has been an area of big budget cuts. Under Labor, it will be our most important area of social investment.</para><para>Our national reading program will help parents give their infant children the greatest gift of all: reading books aloud, building literacy in the early years.</para><para>The parents of each newborn child will receive a series of storybooks. And for parents who lack the skills to read them, Labor will provide new adult literacy services to overcome this problem.</para><para>We want to invest early in education. Learning doesn't start the first day of school. It starts the first day of life.</para><para>And when our children go to school—with a love of reading and the ability to recognise numbers—their schools must be high-achieving schools.</para><para>It doesn't matter whether they are government or non-government schools. That's a tired, old debate. We want quality and opportunity for all our students.</para><para>Under Labor's new funding system, all schools will be funded on the basis of need. We will bring every school up to a high national standard of resources and achievement.</para><para>The overall funding level for non-government schools will be maintained, but with a different pattern of funding distribution. Under-resourced Catholic, Christian and Independent schools will receive more, at the expense of wealthy schools like Kings and Geelong Grammar.</para><para>We will also provide additional funds for government schools—lifting them up to our national standard of resources and results. For the most disadvantaged parts of our society, they have one great hope in life: the neighbourhood government school at the end of their street. It's their passport out of poverty. </para><para>As Prime Minister, Mark Latham won't rest until that hope is fulfilled. Until every school in this country is a good school.</para><para>A Labor Government will provide incentives for the best teachers to teach in our struggling schools.</para><para>We will also improve school discipline through mentoring, community justice and `time out' programs.

I remind the Senate that every budget is just a range of proposals presented for consideration by the Senate and the parliament. The Senate has the right and indeed the responsibility to do all it can to ensure that the budget is economically responsible, socially fair and environmentally sustainable. </para></talk.start><para>The Senate has the right and the responsibility to attempt to improve the various budget proposals wherever it can. The history of the Senate, and certainly the history of the Democrats, is full of examples of where significant improvements to original budget proposals have been made and dangerous measures have been prevented. We will be looking at the tax cuts, at the family payments and at the health, education, defence and environment budgets—indeed, every portfolio—and judging each measure on its merits.</para><para>Unfortunately, it appears that many in the Senate will be using the excuse of an imminent election to avoid the responsibilities that they were elected to this chamber to perform. We have already seen one major budget measure—the spending of an enormous $19 billion of public money—pushed through both houses of parliament in the space of 24 hours, without any genuine scrutiny. This is the Senate acting irresponsibly and unacceptably. The Democrats do not believe that is what we were elected here to do. </para><para>The Democrats call on the Labor Party not to fall into the small-target trap they made for themselves prior to the last election. It was not just they who were the victims of that; the biggest victims were the Australian people, who have had to live with so many of the bad pieces of legislation that were passed as a consequence of that approach. The Labor Party should at least stand up to the most offensive part of this budget, which is the income tax cut measures, by supporting the Democrats' proposed tax cut amendments. The Australian people are the biggest losers, as is democracy itself, when the Senate dodges its responsibility. </para><para>As our name suggests, the Democrats take democracy very seriously. We will exercise our vote on each budget proposal measure with care, regardless of the Prime Minister's election timetable. We will not be making judgments that will affect 20 million Australians for many years to come or that will have global consequences, just on the basis of whether or not the Prime Minister might call an election in a couple of months. The Democrats will work hard to ensure that government and opposition parties are held accountable for the budget and the decisions they make. We will seek to use the Senate and public processes to expose the truth. The role that the Senate plays is more important than ever, given that we have one of the most dishonest governments in our nation's history. As the Democrats' history and record show, we put in the hard work on a wide range of issues, not just on the one or two that get the headlines. </para><para>I will summarise a few key points from this budget, before I expand on some of its detail. Its central proposal of huge tax cuts only going to those on high incomes is fundamentally unjust and economically irresponsible. The tax cuts must be shared equally, and the Democrats will vote against the tax cuts in the Senate unless they are. Whilst there are many measures in the budget that will provide welcome funds to various areas of need, the tactic of saving up money until just before an election to address these areas rather than at the start of the government's term or when those needs are identified is not only cynical but also irresponsible. It is bad management, it is bad economics and it means that many areas of need are left unaddressed much longer than they should or need be. A key area in which the budget fails massively is that of the environment. The opposition is running the risk of failing massively in doing its job in the Senate. The budget makes it clear that the government has walked away from the major challenge, the important challenge, of welfare reform once and for all. It has once again failed the honesty test.</para><para>Before addressing some specific budget proposals, I want to briefly address the economic foundations which underpin this budget as a whole. The Democrats have shown since the last election that we always constructively exercise our balance of power responsibilities while sticking to our principles, and we will continue to do so in responding to this budget. The Democrats unashamedly take some of the credit for the strong economic situation which Australia finds itself in. The Democrats hold the balance of power in the Senate, and we have not succumbed to the temptation of insisting on getting 100 per cent of what we want before we pass measures. We have acted responsibly and effectively, recognising the policies must be paid for and that economic stability, fair and comprehensive revenue flows and effective expenditure on public needs are all essential. The solid financial position of Australia is not simply a result of the handiwork of the Treasurer, Mr Costello; it is also due to the sound and responsible actions and decisions of the Senate.</para><para>The Democrats have played an effective, responsible and constructive role in reforms in a range of areas, including industrial relations, tax, the welfare system, the environment and a range of other areas. We have made things fairer by preventing some of the worst initiatives of this conservative government from hurting Australians. We have stopped previous budget proposals that aimed to attack the sick and the disabled, and we have significantly improved other measures. I call on the Senate as a whole to not remove our own power to improve measures in this budget. Treasurer Costello complains about the so-called obstructionism of the Senate damaging the economy yet, whenever he gets good economic results, he claims that it is all his own work. The Senate legitimately claims a share of that credit, as do the Democrats as the balance of power party in the Senate. </para><para>The area of tax cuts is a fundamental component of this budget. I repeat the Democrats' position that we will not support or vote for the budget's income tax cuts as they stand. The Democrats' approach to tax cuts varies significantly from that of all the other parties in this chamber. The Liberals obviously want big tax cuts but only for people earning over $52,000 a year. The Labor Party have quite correctly identified that the tax cuts are unfair and need to be changed, but they will not back up their words with action and they will not, on their statements to date, make any attempt in the Senate to make this happen. The Greens say no-one should get any income tax cuts at all, including low-income earners. Only the Democrats say that all Australians should benefit from income tax relief. We say that tax cuts, if we are going to have them, must be fairly shared amongst all Australians, and we will take action in the Senate to back up our words.</para><para>Our tax position is based on a simple question: are the tax cuts in the budget fair? Quite clearly they are not. Not only are they unfair; they are offensive, they are unjust and they will significantly widen inequality in Australia. To give $42 a week to higher income earners but no tax relief at all to the average earner—to those who are genuinely on a middle income—is contemptuous and unacceptable. The egalitarian principle that is at the heart of Australia's essence, and which so many people hold so dear, will be heavily damaged by these tax cuts, which is why the Democrats call so strongly for the Senate to exercise its responsibility and seek to improve them. The Democrats will certainly do that. We will seek to amend the tax cuts so that all taxpayers get the opportunity to share in some of the money being returned to income earners.</para><para>The Democrats' proposal, which we flagged before the budget was announced, is to raise the bottom income tax threshold, not the top one. Our proposal would give each taxpayer a $5 a week tax cut in the next financial year, increasing to $10 a week the following year—that is, the same amount for everybody. Tax cuts for lower income earners—tax cuts that I emphasise the Greens do not believe should be supported—are needed to prevent poverty traps and to encourage people off welfare and into work. The Senate's recent inquiry into poverty clearly demonstrated that providing extra money in the pockets of those on the lowest income is an effective way of addressing poverty. To deny those people income tax cuts is irresponsible. Our amendments would cost about the same as the government's proposal, but they are much fairer.</para><para>I must also defend the Democrats' position against some of the false claims that the government has already made. In stating the position that I have just outlined, we are not saying that people who earn $50,000 or $60,000 a year are rich. We are not saying that individuals and families who earn this money do not deserve tax cuts; we are simply saying that people who earn less than this also deserve tax cuts and would also benefit from them. The funds should be fairly shared. Let us also not forget that higher income earners also have the benefit of a range of existing measures that have already delivered to many high-income earners significant extra income. Mechanisms such as negative gearing, capital gains tax cuts, salary packaging of company cars, personal trusts not being taxed as companies and the private health insurance rebate, just to name a few, all overwhelmingly benefit higher income earners. These areas should all be addressed, but we should make our revenue base broader and fairer, with additional revenue being used to provide services or to alleviate poverty. </para><para>I remind the Senate that last year the Democrats forced the government to change the superannuation priorities that they announced in last year's budget. We negotiated an additional $455 million, nearly half a billion dollars, for lower and middle-income Australians to encourage them to boost their superannuation savings, while reducing the proposed tax cuts for higher income earners. This doubled the number of working Australians who could access the superannuation co-contribution and laid the foundation for further assistance to those people.</para><para>About the only sweetener in the budget for many low- and moderate-income earners with no dependent children is possible access to the superannuation co-contribution scheme. This budget attempts to build on that foundation of superannuation co-contributions for middle- and lower income earners, which the Democrats established, trebling the cost of it by pushing the benefit to a higher level of income and by changing the dollar-for-dollar benefit to a $1.50 for $1 benefit. The Democrats have some sympathy with the view that the superannuation co-contribution should be extended—indeed, we did foreshadow that we wanted to explore this area—however, whether or not the model proposed by the government is the best way to achieve that needs to be tested and examined. We need to look at the likely impact on national savings and whether we are getting the best value for the money. Part of the proposal includes a reduction in the superannuation surcharge. This is another tax cut that will apply only to those earning over $100,000 a year. We will once again seek to use our balance of power in the Senate to ensure that these measures are made more equitable, more responsible and more effective.</para><para>The work and family area is one that the Democrats have spent a lot of time on, working on policy proposals and raising it in the community. This government's work and family package is, I am sure, a welcome relief for many families who have been struggling to balance work and family responsibilities, but it still falls short. The measures announced in the budget should have been implemented in the early part of this government's third term. Very early in his third term, the Prime Minister told us that the work and family issue was a barbecue stopper and promised it would be a priority. He has left this priority until possibly the very last days of his term—and, even now, it really looks like those barbecues are going to be stopped for a while yet because there is still much that needs to be done.</para><para>The maternity payment to all Australian women is much better than the regressive and ill-targeted baby bonus, but the $3,000 is still selling three-quarters of Australian women short. The government's payment does not replace the lost earnings that occur because of the physical need to take a break from the work force. It is less than half the amount of the Democrats' proposal of 14 weeks paid maternity leave at the minimum wage, which is currently $6,543 before tax. </para><para>Some of the changes to family tax benefits A and B will assist families with incentives to enter the work force and go some way to reducing the effective marginal tax rate, but they do not do enough to eliminate poverty traps. There is no doubt in my mind that a longer term, more sustainable solution can be found, and the Democrats' policies are a good place to start. The work and family package is short term and ignores the mid- and long-term pressures on family. Cash in your pocket now does not compensate for a lack of child-care places, an underfunded Medicare system or increased higher education costs. </para><para>The Treasurer has asked families to go and get procreating and will reward them for doing that but failed to adequately fund child care. Without access to affordable, flexible, quality child care, we will see pressure on parents—in particular mothers—to withdraw from the work force. The government has ignored some of the recommendations of its own child-care experts to increase the child-care benefit to pay for a wage increase to child-care workers and to counteract the 30 per cent increase in child-care fees over the past two years. </para><para>One of the forgotten groups of this budget is sole parents, but there is a measure there for them—unfortunately, it is a negative one. At the same time as the government gives tax cuts to high-income couples, it is to spend an extra $1 million unfairly chasing sole parent `relationship status' reviews. Every time a sole parent changes their address, Centrelink has the power to haul them in for an interview to discuss their circumstances. This is particularly unfair given the difficulty of finding safe, secure low-cost housing—low-cost housing being particularly necessary for many sole parents.</para><para>The area of carers is an important one. As Australia ages, a growing number of Australians provide care for family members. Let me say that I believe that, if there is one group in the community that really deserves all it can get in extra assistance, it is carers. However, whilst the $1,000 payment for carers will be welcome, and it might buy the government a vote or two, it will not ease the long-term burden of caring. Many carers will miss out on this payment because only those who are receiving the actual carer payment on 11 May will receive the one-off payment of $1,000. Many age pensioners, disability support pensioners and sole parents provide the same full-time care for elderly partners, elderly parents or children with a disability. They are part of the `silent army' of carers, and they will miss out on any assistance. The Democrats attempted to fix this problem by amending the legislation earlier today. Disgracefully, both the major parties were so desperate to rush through the legislation and ignore any flaws that they did not support our amendment. As a result, this silent army of carers will miss out.</para><para>Again, in the area of disability, there is plenty of assistance for other people—people already in the work force and earning high incomes—but nothing to assist disadvantaged Australians in the transition from welfare to work. People with a disability missed out on the $300 lump sum payment in the last pre-election budget, and again they miss out this time around. The government is offering lump sum one-off payments to families, carers and aged care facilities but nothing to the person with a disability.</para><para>There are many other sections of the community that were virtually ignored. The Indigenous budget is one key example. The Indigenous budget is the budget of the smiling assassin. It shows the government is just marking time in this absolutely crucial area. It has thrown money around in generous tax cuts and other budget bribes in other areas, but there is no real increase in Indigenous funding. Prior to the budget, the Democrats called for an extra $300 million annual investment in the key area of Indigenous primary health care and preventative programs as a top priority, just to try to bring the health of Indigenous Australians up to par with—or at least closer to—the rest of the population. This, of course, was a costed measure. Instead, we see that the Indigenous health budget has barely increased by $40 million over four years—far short of what is needed. The government could have used a small amount of the surplus to dramatically improve the life chances of Indigenous Australians instead of providing so much assistance to higher income earners. Further funding to address family violence and assistance with Aboriginal home ownership are welcome, but they should have been funded anyway, not at the expense of ATSIC. </para><para>Health and health care costs more broadly remain significant areas of concern for all Australians. This budget does little extra to alleviate those concerns. It does little more than fund existing programs, with the odd handful of responses to pandemics and terrorism. The ongoing $2.5 billion a year drain on the public purse of the grossly inefficient and inequitable private health insurance rebate continues untouched—money which could be far better spent on addressing some of the glaring needs in the community. The government has failed to deliver in a number of key critical areas such as mental health, dental health or long-range health work force planning. There is nothing in this budget to contain the spiralling costs of specialists that have so undermined the fundamentals of Medicare.</para><para>The government's aged care package only goes part of the way to addressing the needs of the aged care sector. It does not underpin the long-term structural needs of the sector. The underlying failure of the indexation system for operational grants in aged care has not been addressed. It will not provide sustainability, and so the problems will emerge again, probably around the time of the next electoral cycle.</para><para>The one-off payment to aged care residents enables them to meet accreditation. This is welcome but it should and could have been provided earlier. The 1.75 per cent annual increase to providers in line with the review of pricing arrangements is a good response but it is still less than the government's own inflation figures. The conditional adjustment payment will assist with attracting staff but is only one-tenth of what is required. The one-off payments for capital works will help providers in the immediate term but, again, do not provide any long-term sustainable solutions.</para><para>In the area of education, the budget has failed to ensure a fair school funding system. It leaves funding for public school students well below the OECD average. It is ironic that a government that has consistently undermined teachers and public education can now find $34.6 million over four years to spend on so-called values and citizenship education in Australian schools. The budget projections of declining public school enrolments over the next four years clearly expose the policy objectives and funding priorities of this government.</para><para>In the area of higher education, our universities and students continue to have their needs ignored. There is no relief for students in relation to income support despite them being slugged with HECS increases of up to 25 per cent in many universities, adding even further pressure and disincentive. In addition, we have the abolition of the Educational Textbook Subsidy Scheme that will result in textbook costs increasing by up to 10 per cent from 1 July. The meagre improvement to scholarships announced in the budget does little to ease students' financial burden nor improve income support for the 70 per cent of students who have to work at least two days a week during the semester to survive while they try to fit in studies as well.</para><para>This budget does not deliver the increases that are needed to significantly improve our national research and development investment and is likely to see Australia fall even further behind the OECD average. According to the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, the sector requires an additional $405 million a year to adequately support universities' research infrastructure. The Democrats support their calls—and those of others—for increased research infrastructure funding and a proper target of R&amp;D spending of two per cent of GDP by 2010. </para><para>In the areas of defence and security, the Democrats welcome the extra $26 million to extend our presence in East Timor, but it is a pity that our current intransigence in grabbing more than our fair share of the oil and gas in the Timor Sea is costing that impoverished country far more in lost revenue. The Democrats have already expressed our support for extra money for intelligence, although it highlights again the need for a proper investigation into our intelligence services to make sure they are functioning properly so the extra money can be properly spent. Extra money continues—$16 million this time around—to be wasted by misusing our defence forces to try to keep out refugees and asylum seekers. We remain concerned that extra money is going to Defence purchases despite little being done to address the scandalous record of money being wasted in that area. The fact is that Defence are simply very bad shoppers. They put items on lay-by and come back later to find they do not fit. If you sent them to the shop to buy the classic $5 sandwich and milkshake, they would either spend $50 or come back with half a packet of chewing gum—used chewing gum.</para><para>In the area of communications the Democrats believe that our democracy depends on the diversity of opinion and questioning of the government and all political parties that public and community broadcasters provide. We were pleased to see there was some additional funding to the ABC to continue their regional and local programming initiative and for program acquisition, but it does not come close to making up for the 30 per cent cut in real terms over the last 15 years. We are also very disappointed that SBS and community broadcasters missed out.</para><para>In the budget figures for trade, it was interesting to see confirmation that the much promoted Australia-US free trade agreement will cost Australia at least $1.5 billion in the first few years after the agreement comes into effect. The budget papers clearly spell out that allowing US goods to be imported into Australia duty-free under this agreement will reduce tariff revenue by around $1.5 billion over the next four years. This is part of the high price of a substandard trade deal that compromises critical aspects of Australia's social, cultural and environmental policy and locks us into commitments that will severely limit the sovereignty of future Australian governments. It is worth noting that in all the rush by this government to clear the decks for an election, there is still no sign of legislation that would be needed to implement key parts of the deal. This suggests to me that the government knows that the community is cottoning on to the fact that the benefits the government claims come from the free trade agreement are grossly overstated and often dishonest.</para><para>In the agricultural area the Democrats welcome the continued commitment to the Agriculture Advancing Australia suite of programs, which has delivered benefits to farmers. The commitment of $1 billion of drought assistance funding is positive. The commitment of $11 million to implement the recommendations of the Keniry inquiry into the live export trade will make only minor improvements to an industry that continues to be unjustifiable in its enormous cruelty. When our frozen carcass trade is worth about $5 billion more per year than the live export trade, we should not persist in making our animals suffer and continue to waste public money to prop up an unjustifiable trade.</para><para>The environmental area, as I have mentioned, is an absolute con in this budget. The government must address the declining environmental conditions and the important rivers and aquifers that ensure the sustainability of this country. This budget fails the sustainability test and, more importantly, the honesty test. The budget papers fudge the figures, and we have already identified and detailed more than $1 billion of broken promises. It has slashed funding from several highly effective programs at important research centres and failed to keep numerous promises on salinity and water quality. </para><para>Undoubtedly, the government's greatest failure is in relation to climate change. It made the grossly dishonest promise to spend almost $1 billion on climate change over the last four years, yet this budget shows that the spend has been less than a third of that amount. It has now scrapped the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program, which was negotiated with the Democrats and has been the government's most successful greenhouse measure. It has replaced that with a collection of voluntary programs that have little chance of achieving significant cuts in emissions.</para><para>In summary, there is unfairness and a blinkered focus on the short term in this budget. It is full of misconceptions and deceptions. It is economically irresponsible. This government has lost once and for all any credibility in its claims to be effective economic managers or strong and effective in the areas of defence and security. That is in no small part due to its ongoing dishonesty towards the Australian people and the Senate. I have pointed out just some of the dishonesty and irresponsibility in this budget tonight. The Senate must examine it for more. </para><para>There is a bigger question and it should be asked—were there other choices available to the government? Was there a fairer approach or another way? Of course, there was. There was, and is, considerable public support for more spending on services. Many Australians were prepared to put their hands up for better services instead of tax cuts. We believe that any government's first priority should be to ensure affordable quality standards of health, education and housing for all Australians, as well as an adequate standard of living and a protected and clean environment. Many Australians agreed with us, but instead the government gave priority to tax cuts for higher income earners. I guarantee that the Democrats will scrutinise carefully all budget legislation that comes before the Senate. We will seek to responsibly amend bills to achieve fairness and sustainability. We will do the job that we were elected to do. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>23333</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—After nine years in the job the Treasurer, with the budget of 2004-05, has perfected the art of the missed opportunity. After 13 of the richest years in Australia's history, the opportunity to build the nation during these times of prosperity has been squandered. Instead of investing in our common future, money has gone on waging an illegal war, on regressive tax cuts, on buying swinging votes and on divisive public policy—all this whilst presiding over the most dramatic decline in our essential public services.</para></talk.start><para>This budget has been hailed as a budget for families but it is not a family budget, because it fails families in the long term. There is a handout to family tax benefit recipients that many families will not see and there are lump sum payments for new mothers that fall well short of a national paid maternity leave scheme. But there is no action to support the overstressed public services that all of us, and families in particular, rely on. There is no real investment in public health, nothing for public schools, nothing for universities, and nothing new for sustaining our environment. The Treasurer, a man who aspires to be Prime Minister, has failed to show any vision for our common future. </para><para>The Greens have a more optimistic vision and a more responsible plan for the investment of our public tax dollars—a vision of free, high-quality public education; nation building investment in our environment and infrastructure; strengthening Medicare; boosting our overseas aid; and, at home, a fairer and more effective welfare system that guarantees an adequate income for all. These are the kinds of measures that Australians are crying out for in increasing numbers, because these are the kinds of ideas that, unlike election oriented tax cuts, people recognise as offering a concrete path to a better, brighter and healthier future for all Australians.</para><para>In the Senate last year the Greens alone rejected the irresponsible tax cuts and we will oppose these tax cuts in favour of much needed investment in high-quality public services. We do this in recognition that budgets should not be about swinging votes but rather must focus on how we build better communities and a stronger, healthier society. Services, not tax cuts—that is what people want. Both Newspoll and the Morgan poll have found that over 70 per cent of Australians are in favour of investment in services over tax cuts. Visiting ANU fellow economist Fred Argy last week warned about the social, economic and environmental consequences of favouring short-term spending in place of investing in infrastructure for the future. An ANU study found that:</para><quote><para>A clear majority thinks the standard of health and Medicare has declined over the past two years, and a near majority thinks the same of education. Voters want these services looked after—and this is not the priority they see reflected in government policy.</para></quote><para>That is because the Howard government is failing in one of the main responsibilities of government—providing essential public services. This government has shifted the spending on these services from the public sphere, in which all Australians contribute to the cost and share the benefits, to the private sphere, where those with private financial resources buy essential services based on their capacity to pay rather than their need. It is the poor and the vulnerable who are the biggest losers.</para><para>The Senate report into poverty released in March revealed the extent of need in Australia, estimating that 3.6 million people—that is almost one in five Australians—live on a weekly income of $400 or less, lower than the federal minimum wage. Some 700,000 children live in a household without a wage-earner, and a million Australians do not make enough from their paid work to live above the poverty line. These are the people who most need government investment in our public services. Their voices are some of the loudest voices calling for services, not tax cuts.</para><para>The Australian Council of Social Service identified $4.7 billion of urgent spending needed on health, education, housing and child care. Treasurer Costello says that the government has increased spending on services, including health and education. But the money has gone to private schools, to privatising higher education, to private health insurance and to privatising health services. The $2.4 billion per annum private health insurance rebate adds around seven per cent to health spending, but it does not pay for health services. It pays for insurance.</para><para>Higher education spending has fallen as a share of total government spending from 3.9 per cent to 2.5 per cent of the budget. When people call for services rather than tax cuts, public education and public health are top of their lists. This government has failed a generation of young Australians by not investing in their education and the nation's future. Australia lags behind comparable countries on its public investment in preschool care and education, public schools and tertiary institutions. This government has pursued an ideological agenda of pouring money into the private school sector at the expense of public schools. </para><para>In contrast the Greens are committed to building a high quality public education system and, in doing so, turning around the worrying growth trend in private schooling that is dividing our communities. The Greens would scrap the appallingly unfair SES model that funds non-government schools. In doing so we would redirect the $1.5 billion earmarked for the wealthiest private schools over the next four years into priority public schools funding programs. The Greens would freeze the funding of private schools at 2003-04 levels in order to direct those savings into urgently needed catch-up funds for the public sector. Through these and other measures the Greens will continue working to ensure that every child can be guaranteed that an education at the local government school continues to be the best educational, cultural and social experience on offer.</para><para>The forgotten one million Australians who are enrolled at TAFE must also be resourced. TAFE has been a world-leading provider of low-fee postsecondary education, and the Greens would build on that record by returning growth funding to TAFE. Rodney Tiffen and Ross Gittins, in their new book <inline font-style="italic">How Australia Compares</inline>,<inline font-style="italic"></inline>wrote:</para><quote><para>In real terms, the government is spending about half per university student of what it spent in 1975.</para></quote><para>A return to free university education is the best way to guarantee that all Australians who are academically qualified to study at university can do so, thereby drawing on the full potential of this nation's talent. The Greens advocate abolishing the HECS system and forgiving all HECS debt, returning Australia to a system of free public tertiary education. This measure would cost just under $2 billion, the same amount of money the Treasurer is spending next year on tax cuts for the rich.</para><para>In the area of health, the Howard government has squandered public funds and a critical opportunity to improve our public health system. Instead of strengthening Medicare, the government has moved Australia closer to a situation where the health care you obtain depends on what you can afford to pay. The government refuses to accept that people happily pay for Medicare through their taxes. They pay for a quality public health care system that provides quality care for all Australians when they need it. The Greens have proposed a number of measures to strengthen Medicare. Abolition of the $2.4 billion of public money going into the private health insurance rebate would allow the redirection of funds to public hospitals, to increasing the bulk-billing rebate for GP services, to mental health services, to preventative health care and to Indigenous health care.</para><para>The Greens would allocate additional funding to have medically necessary dentistry covered under Medicare. Currently, around half a million low-income earners are waiting for dental treatment through public schemes with waiting periods as long as four years. Millions more Australians who do not qualify for a health care card and do not have private health insurance simply miss out on dental treatment. We could fund these kinds of initiatives if we opted for services not tax cuts.</para><para>We are surrounded by the evidence of the damage that we are doing to the Earth—the planet that provides for all our needs, including spiritual nourishment. The Pentagon report on climate change, released earlier this year, should have dispelled any doubts about the threats that we face if we fail to reverse global warming. The <inline font-style="italic">Measures of Australia's progress </inline>2004 report, published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics last month, confirmed the extent of the challenge. That report painted a disturbing picture of the deterioration of our natural environment and highlighted the urgent need for us to address major problems. Surface and groundwater is being extracted at unsustainable rates. Almost 3,000 ecosystems are listed as threatened. In the decade to the year 2003 the number of terrestrial bird and mammal species listed as extinct, endangered or vulnerable rose by 40 per cent. There were 248,000 hectares cleared in 2001 alone, and 70 per cent of this was in Queensland. Almost six million hectares of land were at risk from salinity in the year 2000. </para><para>The damage we wreak on the Earth's natural systems has an economic cost. Using our natural resources wisely and protecting our precious places and wildlife is at the heart of the Australian Greens' work. Climate change is one of our biggest priorities. The Greens propose a carbon levy, as many European countries have, as the best way to encourage the switch to sustainable energy. The proceeds would finance energy conservation, renewable energy and measures to protect low-income earners from higher electricity prices. We also propose a $35 billion, 10-year investment plan to build a sustainable future. By using the government bond market to offer green bonds to green Australia's essential infrastructure we can help transform the nation bringing social, environmental and economic benefits. This scheme proposed by the Greens offers a secure investment, guaranteed return and the opportunity to invest in a greener future. Greening Australia's infrastructure is only one essential component of making it sustainable. We also need a mindset change to focus on reducing consumption of energy and materials, eliminating waste and improving the quality of services to meet people's needs.</para><para>The decision to de-fund environmentally beneficial research shows that the Howard government has no commitment to the task of addressing global warming. It has allocated $92 million to fossil fuel cooperative research centres for coal, petroleum and geosequestration, compared with $10 million for renewable energy, and it has just rejected an application for a solar CRC whilst approving a CRC for the so-called clean power coming from brown coal. The government's budget also fails to provide enough funding to restore the health of the Murray River by ensuring that the 1,500 gigalitre minimum increase in environmental flows is achieved within a decade. This is an urgent task that the government has failed to address. Eighty-five per cent of Australians want the federal government to intervene to protect Tasmania's old-growth forests and their wildlife. The Greens have an industry transition strategy that would save the forests and create 500 new jobs, but there is zero allocation in this budget towards such a win-win outcome.</para><para>In this budget the government continues its abysmal record on assisting the world's poorest people. Under the Howard government, Australia's overseas aid has fallen well short of the UN recommended level of 0.7 per cent of gross national income. This financial year, Australia gave just 0.26 per cent. Lifting Australia's official development assistance to the UN recommended level would cost approximately $5,740 million next financial year. Improving the living conditions and life opportunities for the poorest people on the planet is one of the best investments we can make to secure a safer world. Let us target the causes of terrorism—that is, global inequality, instability and imperial foreign policy—rather than go to war on the symptoms. Every bomb we drop and every war we fight creates the conditions for more terrorism, costing us in lives and money as the cycle of violence continues. We need to withdraw our troops from Iraq and instead put resources into reconstruction and humanitarian aid managed by the Iraqi people and their future government. Appallingly, Australia's civil aid to Iraq has been almost halved, going from a piddling $40 million to $27 million in this year's budget. </para><para>The Howard government is depriving the poorest nation in our region, East Timor, of billions of dollars in royalties from the exploitation of oil and gas reserves in the Timor Sea whilst cutting direct aid to the East Timorese. Australia refuses to allow independent arbitration of the sea boundary dispute that sits at the heart of this robbery. East Timor's Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri says the funds that under international law belong to the struggling nation are needed to pay for schools and health care. It is, he says, `literally a matter of life and death'. The Greens support East Timor's internationally recognised claim and call on the Howard government to meet it. Our global responsibilities include providing asylum to refugees. The Greens continue to call for an end to mandatory detention and for savings to be redirected to help asylum seekers live in the community whilst their claims for asylum are being assessed.</para><para>The cost of housing has skyrocketed in many cities in recent years, pricing many people out of buying or renting a home. The ACTU has calculated that the average house price rose by 70 per cent in the five years to 2003, compared with average full-time wage rises in the same period of 26 per cent. Housing as an investment is driving up prices. The Productivity Commission has identified negative gearing as a factor in this investment trend. The 50 per cent capital gains tax discount introduced by the Howard government has seen people pour millions of dollars into property but has not delivered affordable housing. The Greens believe that affordable housing is a right and that governments have a responsibility to facilitate it. We want the capital gains tax concession reversed and negative gearing phased out, with funds redirected to public housing—that is, to public housing with energy and water efficiency features that not only benefit the environment but also save on ongoing expenses.</para><para>The budget contains nothing to promote employment and training for workers who are unemployed. While the official unemployment rate is 5.7 per cent, the real level of unemployment is at least double and possibly higher than this. The growth in casual employment—that is, in insecure work with low pay and no standard conditions—and the increasing reliance on part-time employees are major causes of poverty. One in four workers is now employed as a casual, whilst the wages of the lowest paid workers fail to provide a decent living. This is in addition to the hundreds of thousands of Australians and their dependants who do not have paid work. The extent of poverty in Australia has risen from 8.2 per cent of the population in 1990 to 8.7 per cent in 2000.</para><para>The findings of the Senate report into poverty, released in March, support the Greens' firm view that increasing privilege at the top of the social ladder does not translate to better conditions for those at the bottom. We have now had a decade of consistent economic growth and still between two million and 3½ million of our fellow citizens struggle to provide food, shelter, clothing and health care for themselves and their families. The Greens are seeking a commitment from the Labor Party, if elected to government, to hold a poverty summit to develop a national strategy, as the Senate report recommended, to work towards ensuring that every Australian can live with dignity. </para><para>The government's maternity payment is no substitute for a proper paid maternity leave scheme. It does not ensure women's rights of return to work nor will it cover the minimum 16 weeks off work that is recommended by the World Health Organisation. Unless a scheme ensures a continuing attachment to the work force, Australian women's rights to engage in paid work will continue to be restricted. The ALP has lowered the bar on the issue of national paid maternity leave by proposing a welfare payment not a national paid maternity leave scheme. The Greens have developed a scheme to deliver replacement income to 75 per cent of women for 18 weeks, with a further 34 weeks of unpaid leave, a right to return to work part time and a right to share the leave period with a partner. This scheme can be funded by redirecting the baby bonus, which the government itself has abandoned in this budget. Australia can afford a scheme of this kind and Australian women deserve it. Until the government provides practical assistance of this kind to families it has no credibility in claiming to support families. Unmet demand for child care, high fees and pay levels as low as $12 an hour for child-care workers are major problems the Howard government has failed to address. The drive for private child care will only exacerbate these problems.</para><para>The Greens welcome the government's provision of more child-care places in this budget but the measure only meets one-quarter of the unmet demand in this area. The present federal funding regime has led to the growth in the corporate child-care sector, arguably at the expense of quality care. As of June 2000, some 67 per cent of long day care centres across Australia were privately owned and several child-care companies have now listed on the stock exchange. Taxpayers are effectively subsidising the huge profits being made by corporate operators. The measures announced in the budget will do nothing to curb this alarming trend towards the commercialisation of early childhood care. The Greens call on the government to provide funding that prioritises the local government based and community managed child-care sector. This includes a commitment to provide operational and capital grants to establish and develop community- based, not-for-profit centres—a commitment the government abandoned in 1997. Child care is fundamentally about the nurture and education of the youngest members of our society. We do not allow schools to be run for profit, so why child-care centres? A government that was fair dinkum about helping Australian families would invest in public services for families, not in tax cuts.</para><para>Taxation policy should be used to redistribute wealth and generate it for the future. Under the Howard government, taxation policy has become less progressive. This means that the greatest burden falls on those least able to pay. The Greens support progressive taxation. As part of this we call for the abolition of the GST. The company tax rate should be returned to the 33 per cent it was at before this government gave corporations a tax break before the last election. The Australian Council of Social Service, ACOSS, has identified tax loopholes worth $8.2 billion a year, which benefit only the very well off, including diverting income to a private company and executive perks such as salary sacrificing for a company car or extra superannuation. These loopholes must be closed and the savings redirected to public services.</para><para>The tax cuts the Treasurer announced on Tuesday night will cost the Commonwealth $14 billion over the life of the next parliament. Add to that the tax cuts from 2003, the tax loopholes that have not been closed and the projected surpluses, and a massive $71 billion of public money has been wasted by this government. This pool of money could have achieved a fully funded, free tertiary education system, more teachers and better resourced public schools. Together with the abolition of the private health insurance rebate, it could also have paid for the expansion of Medicare to cover such things as necessary dental care, a boost in bulk-billing rates for GPs and the establishment of new community health centres. It could do all this with money left over. Instead we have public schools that are struggling, university students who are being slugged by higher fees and doctors fees that are rising. The question that the Greens ask is: do we feel richer? The answer is no. </para><para>The public expects the government to provide quality public services. When it chooses to give tax cuts instead of providing these services the public quite rightly feels cheated. When existing services are left to degrade whilst money is poured into rival private schemes, the public feels betrayed. And when governments cry poor with regard to teaching children, saving our rivers or increasing bulk-billing and then spend billions of dollars to illegally invade and occupy another country, the public gets angry. By putting services before tax cuts, the Greens would set Australia in a much better, much fairer policy direction. We will take these progressive policies to the election and ask the Australian people to join us in supporting public services, peace, the nation's environment and a better investment for its future generations.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Macdonald</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>23339</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Community Affairs Legislation           Committee</title><page.no>23339</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Membership</title><page.no>23339</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Cherry)</inline>—The President has received a letter from a party leader seeking a variation to the membership of a committee.</para></talk.start><para>Senator IAN MACDONALD (Queensland—Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation) (8.59 p.m.)—by leave—I move:</para><motion><para>That Senator Allison replace Senator Greig on the Community Affairs Legislation Committee for the committee's inquiry into the provisions of legislation relating to tobacco and tobacco advertising, and reports from the ACCC concerning tobacco.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para></interjection></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>23339</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

This year the Howard government reported another budget surplus. This is as a result of sound economic management policy, which has reduced the $96 billion debt left by the last Labor government. Buoyed by strong economic conditions, Australia is enjoying a quality of life currently unparalleled in any other part of the world. Unemployment is at an all-time low. Regional areas, particularly in my duty area of Newcastle and the Hunter region, are benefiting from these sound economic times. Unemployment in Newcastle and the Hunter region is currently at 6.7 per cent, down from 8.7 per cent last year in Newcastle, according to the latest labour market report. Contrast this with the unemployment levels of 15.5 per cent in Newcastle under Labor in the mid-1990s. The Newcastle and Hunter area will benefit greatly from this budget. </para></talk.start><para>Among the major winners in the region are the University of Newcastle, which is set to benefit from the $5.3 billion science and innovation package. The University of Newcastle is the ninth-ranking research-intensive university out of Australia's 40 universities and is now well placed to take advantage of the flexibility provided by last year's university reforms. The science and innovation funding through Backing Australia's Ability will benefit the University of Newcastle immensely, as well as give it a chance to enter the prestigious circle of the Group of Eight. Backing Australia's Ability—Building our future through science and innovation is 75 per cent larger than the original $3 billion Backing Australia's Ability plan announced in 2001 which, at that time, was the largest ever increase in funding for science and innovation in Australia. Together, the package consists of a 10-year $8.3 billion funding commitment. </para><para>Backing Australia's Ability targets the three key areas of the innovation system: strengthening Australia's ability to generate ideas and undertake research, including an extra $1.2 billion for the Australian Research Council's national competitive grant; accelerating the commercialisation of ideas through a new $1 billion Commercial Ready Program; and, developing and retaining skills, including $200 million to continue funding an additional 2,000 university places in ICT, maths and science and $38.8 million for a new initiative to boost innovation, science and technology and mathematics teaching. These highlighted figures will benefit the University of Newcastle, as well as all universities in Australia.</para><para>The Hunter Medical Research Institute, which is affiliated with the University of Newcastle, will receive an extra $5 million towards the cost of constructing an independent building that will act as a central headquarters for research. This funding will be matched by the state government and extra funding will be provided by the University of Newcastle and also the Hunter Area Health Service. The community will then be required to contribute $3 million to complete the centre. For those people in Newcastle who are listening tonight, I urge you to contribute to this centre so that we can have a world-class medical research centre in Newcastle.</para><para>The Hunter Medical Research Institute has approximately 350 researchers who study and develop treatments for a range of illnesses and disease. The outstanding research undertaken by the HMRI has led to many breakthroughs, such as the discovery of placental clocks that determine when a baby is born, and the discovery of a particular compound found in green leafy vegetables which stops cancer cell growth. Research that is undertaken at the HMRI has benefits for everyone in key research areas, including mental health, cardiovascular health, mothers' and babies' health, vaccines and immunity.</para><para>An amount of $5 million in funding will ensure that the HMRI can continue their contribution to the communities of Newcastle and the Hunter region, as well as to the wider society. The research and subsequent technology which is brought to market touches the lives of every Australian in some way. I am sure that nobody in the Newcastle area, the Hunter region or surrounding area would take this funding for granted. The saving of lives and the enhancement to the quality of life for so many people is a really big win for the area.</para><para>Another big win is the significant changes to the current wine tax arrangements that will provide over $300 million in tax relief to the Australian wine industry over the next four years. This is very good news for the Hunter region, where winemaking is a key industry, supporting economic growth in the area. There will be a rebate of $290,000 per annum from the wine equalisation tax to every wine producer. Up to 90 per cent of wine producers will benefit from this rebate. The effect of this decision is to exempt $1 million of each producer's domestic wholesale wine sales from the WET tax on an annual basis. The new maximum rebate is $290,000 maximum each year, compared with the current maximum rebate of $42,000 under the Australian Government Wine Producer Cellar Door Rebate scheme. </para><para>This budget also spells good news for Defence, and RAAF Base Williamtown stands out as another winner. This is critical for the Hunter Valley as the RAAF not only plays a critical role in the defence of the nation but also provides a mainstay for the Hunter economy through the direct flow--on to employment. For RAAF Williamtown, the budget contains $38 million for new and redeveloped facilities and infrastructure necessary for the introduction into service of the early warning aircraft control system. An amount of $50 million will be provided for the FA18 Hornet fighter aircraft, to equip them with the capability to conduct all-weather precision bombing operations. Announcements in this budget, which will also impact on RAAF Williamtown and its personnel, include the purchase of two more early warning aircraft control systems at a cost of $323 million, an increase in the size of the order of the EWACs from four to six and $357 million to enhance accommodation arrangements for Defence Force personnel. </para><para>In recent years we have seen many developments at the base. They include the opening of new headquarters for No. 2 Squadron, which will oversee the $3.3 billion airborne early warning and control aircraft system, the $149 million redevelopment of the base itself and the $300 million upgrade of the FA18 Hornets, which will largely be undertaken at Williamtown. RAAF Williamtown is one of the major employers in the Hunter region and injects some $170 million into the local economy each year. The base also attracts defence related industries to the area, which again adds investment and local jobs.</para><para>Newcastle and the Hunter region have seen some dramatic shifts over the past 15 years. A city which was once a blue-collar steel town is growing into a very diversified economy which has already started to provide solid benefits for citizens, both economically and socially. Changes across the Newcastle skyline are indicative of changes in the city's centre and its local economy. New developments, residential as well as commercial, are material proof that Newcastle is indeed entering a new era. New buildings such as the Newcastle Cruising Yacht Club and hotels such as the Crown Plaza in the city centre are representative of the new economy which is providing jobs and opportunities for Newcastle and Hunter Residents.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>O15</name.id><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name></talker><para>—I welcome the interjection from Senator Ian Macdonald, who was instrumental in gaining that yacht facility, a 220-berth marina, for Newcastle, which is helping to drive the local economy.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name></talker><para>—It is all to your credit, Senator Tierney.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>O15</name.id><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name></talker><para>—Thank you, Senator Macdonald.

Ten years ago the greatest critic of the water regime that is now known as the water harvesting of the Culgoa, the Briarie, the Birrie, the Narran, the Ballandol and other streams and rivers was the present chair of the Community Advisory Committee of the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council. Ten years ago, Leith Boully was the most vocal person in Australia in opposing and raising legitimate and obvious concerns about the proposed interception of hundreds of thousands of megalitres of water flowing over the weir at St George by people such as the owners and managers of Cubbie Station and other river properties, to the effect that today 1,200,000 megalitres—that is, 1,200 gigalitres—of off-river on-farm storage has been built in that part of the world, which is equivalent to the mean annual flow of the river system. The Culgoa River used to deliver 26 per cent of its flow to the Murray-Darling system at Bourke. It now delivers less than five per cent.</para></talk.start><para>Today the greatest supporter in Australia of this regime, who was once its greatest opponent, which as recently as this year intercepted the flood flow of the river—589,000 megalitres went over the weir this year. Cubbie Station put something in excess of 170,000 megalitres of that water, which was used effectively to grow cotton and could be valued in excess of $1,000 a megalitre—that is, $170 million worth of water—into storage at Cubbie Station, to the extent that the flood level river above Cubbie Station was reduced to a half a river below Cubbie Station, which was allowed under a licence regime that has an annual fee of $3,700. This fee is protected by legislation.</para><para>I would like to table a series of documents that I have shown to the opposition whip and to quote from some of them. I have an online opinion by Phil Dickie, who was the editor—I do not know whether he still is—of the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane Line</inline> of the Brisbane Institute whose investigative journalism in the 1980s led to the Fitzgerald inquiry into corruption in Queensland, who said:</para><quote><para>Years of lax interpretations of lax laws has meant that in rural Queensland an outdoor dunny can need more planning permission than a 50,000 mL dam with walls no more than 4.99 metres high. Around St George and Dirranbandi, cotton growers and water hoarders now have about 40,000 hectares of dams at best four metres deep ...</para></quote><para>He goes on to say about the manager of Cubbie Station:</para><quote><para>Another former Water Resources Commission officer has done somewhat better. John Grabbe went from being an advisor 'on irrigation layouts for farmers' to being responsible for the largest privately owned irrigation layout in Australia, Cubbie Station</para></quote><para>In another article Phil Dickie said:</para><quote><para>Looking at river flows and the fine print of the Cubbie licences, water engineers estimate that in an average year Cubbie can take about 200,000 mL of water and in a good year, about 500,000 mL—</para></quote><para>that is, in a flood year—</para><quote><para>And for the privilege, the station pays just $3700 a year.</para></quote><para>That is half a billion dollars worth of water. He went on to say:</para><quote><para>For Cubbie, dealing with the government has been easier much easier than dealing with the neighbours. Initial proposals for huge dams with 10 metre high walls ended up going all the way to the Court of Appeal. </para></quote><para>He says further on in the document:</para><quote><para>The question of Cubbie's water charges generated another quick if slightly dubious fix. A departmental legal opinion suggested that Cubbie should pay an annual $74,000 rather than an annual $2900 for its 51 water harvesting licences.</para><para>The regulation on charges was amended at the next available legislative opportunity—</para></quote><para>It is great to have friends in government—</para><quote><para>to allow multiple licences to be rolled into one licence for the purpose of charging at the 'discretion' of the Director-General.</para><para>The Director-General appears to have exercised this discretion, for Cubbie in an average year now pays $3.70 a mL for the first 1000 mL of water harvested and gets the next 199,000 mL for free.</para></quote><para>In this article the defence of the owners is:</para><quote><para>We are not tied to any taxpayer funded infrastructure ...</para></quote><para>Further on in this article, which I will table, Mr Grabbe is quoted as saying:</para><quote><para>None of us want to destroy the environment. If the river is being destroyed, it is being destroyed because we are doing what we were told to do. We were given entitlements to do things and we are doing nothing but developing those entitlements ...</para></quote><para>I would also like to table an article from the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>, in which Mr Grabbe talks about this year's flood. The article says:</para><quote><para>Mr Grabbe said he did not know exactly what proportion of the Culgoa River's flow had been diverted to Cubbie. “Probably 50 per cent is not a bad figure.”</para></quote><para>So to puzzle No. 1: what happened to change the world's greatest critic of all of that to the world's greatest supporter? I had a visit from Leith Boully to discuss what I thought was a conflict of interest for her as the facilitator of the St George community reference group and the chair of the Murray-Darling Basin community advisory body. In this conversation I raised the issue that, under the community reference group's submission to the Queensland government for an A and B licence arrangement, under the bunded water principle the Boully farm would benefit in the form of a 7,000 megalitre water licence that was worth up to $7 million to them. It was also revealed in that conversation that Mrs Boully has a financial business farming agreement with Cubbie Station—her neighbours.</para><para>In a further call to Mrs Boully's mobile phone, I raised the issue of this year's flood and its consequent interception into storage in a way that intercepted not only the downstream riparian rights of graziers but also the access rights of the users. I described it as a national disgrace and said that Mrs Boully was a disgrace in condoning this regime. She replied, `I agree. It is a disgrace, and if they had listened to me 10 years ago none of this would have happened. But I am now complicit in it.' To which I responded, `You obviously decided not to die a pauper.'</para><para>Could this be the reason that a person who 10 years ago was the greatest critic of this—to the point of court action—is now its greatest supporter? I would like to table one of those court documents and also some further documents, if I do not run out of time. Does this complicity in the proposed water harvesting bunding robbery regime of the Culgoa Balonne by the facilitator of the St George community reference group and the chair of the Murray-Darling Basin community advisory committee, Leith Boully, together with her changed financial arrangements with Cubbie Station, display a level of breathtaking hypocrisy? Leith Boully, in some of her meanderings on New South Wales or the Lower Murray-Darling Basin, has said things like this quote from a Radio National <inline font-style="italic">Breakfast</inline> broadcast in February 2000:</para><quote><para>I think it's irrespective of whether I'm a Queenslander or not. The point is that four states and the Commonwealth have a responsibility to manage the Basin so that every single person in the Basin—their interests and their environment are looked after ... There's no doubt about that. The further downstream that you are, the more significant the impacts of upstream neighbours are on the health of the river in particular. </para></quote><para>It is a pity they could not learn from their own backyard. In an article for the Foundation for Australian Agricultural Women she says:</para><quote><para>In 10 to 20 years, I'd like to see that the Murray-Darling Basin has recovered significant volumes of water for environmental flow.</para></quote><para>She is condoning removing the flow in the Murray-Darling Basin from 25 per cent of the Culgoa flow at Bourke to six per cent or below five per cent, and there are a series of other interpretations, which I think lead to a very hypocritical view of life by this person.</para><para>On 6 May 2004—last week—the new look Murray-Darling Basin advisory committee was announced. I note, with some alarm, that the Queensland government, in its wisdom, has appointed none other than Mr John Grabbe of Cubbie Station, the neighbour of Leith Boully, who has a financial relationship with Leith Boully, as the Queensland state representative on the Murray-Darling Basin Community Advisory Committee. I think it is laughable. With the next-door neighbour and close business partner, Leith Boully, as chair of the Murray-Darling Basin Community Advisory Committee, has a cosy relationship with the water interceptors of the Balonne-Culgoa. While the rivers of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia have capped pressures and the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council is advised by its advisory committee, I feel there is an intolerant conflict of interest by Mrs Boully and Mr Grabbe and that they should resign if the advisory committee is not to be seen as both a political and a professional farce. The Queensland government should reconsider the appointment of Mr Grabbe and the council should rethink the appointment of the chair of the advisory committee and the obvious conflict of interest. I seek leave to table these documents.</para><para>Leave granted. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Trade: Free Trade Agreement</title><page.no>23344</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>23344</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—At the request of Senator Lundy, I seek leave to incorporate her adjournment speech this evening.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>23344</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—<inline font-style="italic">The incorporated speech read as follows—</inline></para></talk.start><para>I rise in the chamber this evening to highlight some major concerns relating to the Cultural Sector and the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement. </para><para>Labor argued strongly for an exclusion clause for the cultural/audiovisual sector in the lead up negotiations to the Free Trade Agreement, similar to that obtained by the Australian Government when it negotiated with Singapore.</para><para>In November 2003 the Labor party called for the Howard government to ensure that the cultural sector was excluded from the AUSFTA, as was obtained in the Singapore Australia FTA. </para><para>The former Labor Leader Simon Crean told delegates from the Screen Producers Association of Australia that:</para><para>Our cultural identity is unique and defines who we are as a nation. Labor is not prepared to sit by and see it used as a cheap bargaining chip. Labor demands an exclusion clause for all present and future cultural content in any Free Trade Agreement with the United States. This would be consistent with the Free Trade Agreement recently negotiated with Singapore. (Simon Crean, Melbourne 21 November 2003)</para><para>This position attracted wide spread support from the sector, and had the support from members of the Australian Coalition for Cultural Diversity (ACCD) and the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance. </para><para>We know that the ACCD had been involved in a series of consultations with the DFAT negotiators throughout the course of the negotiations, and felt quite assured by negotiators that their concerns were being taken seriously. They were assured that the Australian Government was not prepared to trade away the cultural sector.</para><para>This faith was severely rattled after it was reported during President Bush's visit in late 2003, that the Prime Minister had told the President that Australia was willing to be “flexible” on new media (which has since been defined as Interactive Audio/Video). This sent the industry into a spin, and went against everything that had been told to them by the negotiators, and indeed the reported statements from ministers Vaile and Kemp early in 2003.</para><para>The Prime Minister's intervention was the first sign that the Howard Government was either unwilling or unable to obtain an exclusion for the cultural sector, similar to that obtained under the Singapore FTA. </para><para>Over the next few months, the Howard government's ambiguity grew.</para><para>Once the announcement came that a deal had been struck, the Howard government then embarked on a shameless propaganda campaign. By implying that they had secured a broad reservation (clearly designed to keep industry on side and their important `first impressions' media statements positive), it was with dismay that the industry discovered that the Howard Government had only achieved retention of limited reservations. </para><para>Despite this misleading propaganda, as the full text of this agreement emerged in, it became clear the Howard Government had accepted a position that looked nothing like the broader exclusion the sector were led to expect. </para><para>The Australian announcement stated: </para><para>`Australia has successfully negotiated a reservation to the services chapter that ensures the Government's capacity to regulate for Australian content so that it remains available to Australian consumers.' (Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, www.dfat.gov.au )</para><para>The Americans however told a different story, stating on 9 February 2004 that the United States Government had gained `unprecedented provisions to improve market access for U.S films and television'.</para><para>After comparing the statements from the Australian Government with the statements released from the United States Government, it became apparent that you could have driven a truck through the middle of the two positions.</para><para>Under Senate Estimates questioning just over a week after the initial announcement on 17 February, Government Cultural Agencies remained unable to assess what impact Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement (AUSFTA) was likely to have on the audiovisual sector. It appeared that very little consultation between government agencies and the negotiators had occurred.</para><para>In fact three separate agencies—the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), the Australian Film Commission, and the Australia Council for the Arts—were unable to provide any detailed information about what the AUSFTA meant for their respective organisations.</para><para>The Howard Government continued to claim that it had fully retained Australia's ability to regulate for the future delivery of what it now described new media as: `interactive audio/video'. But the key concerns of the sector remain, namely retaining the right to regulate new media, and increase existing media local content quotas. </para><para>As the text of the agreement finally became available, the main areas of grave concern reside with the following:</para><para>That any bid to increase caps, particularly in the Pay TV environment must firstly involve consultations with any `affected' parties. There is much concern that these `affected' parties may include organisations such as the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), who have already stated objections to any attempts to make the Australian arrangements `more restrictive.' </para><para>That Local content in the digital Multichannel environment would be limited to a maximum of 3 channels—regardless of how many channels may exist in the future.  </para><para>While this capping may appear reasonable in the context of non-existent multichannelling in the current digital environment, it is short sighted, and does not allow for a reasonable proportion of local content in the future. </para><para>For instance, if there was ability for one network to carry up to 15 channels, then a maximum of only 3 channels would ever contain local content.</para><para>On Subscription services (Pay TV) expenditures on Australian adult drama will be set at 10% and capped at 20% (providing attempts to increase quotas from 10% to 20% has allowed for consultation with `affected' parties to occur) and children's, documentary, arts and education channels at 10%. </para><para>According to the Screen Producers Association (SPAA), at this level, the Pay TV caps on expenditure for local content, would in fact be amongst the lowest in the developed world. It is important to note that even under current quotas on Subscription services (Pay TV) which are capped at 10% only translates to about 3.8% of local content programming. So even if caps were raised to 20% this effectively only equates to around 6.4% of actual local programming seen on Drama channels.</para><para>Interactive Audio and/or Video—`New Media'. The actual text of the agreement says very little about how this will be handled. The DFAT backgrounder states:</para><para>Interactive audio and/or video services: </para><para>Measures can be imposed to ensure that Australian content on such services is not unreasonably denied to Australian consumers, upon a finding by the Australian Government that Australian content is not readily available to consumers through such services. </para><para>Any measures adopted will be implemented through a transparent process, be based on objective criteria, be the minimum necessary, be no more trade restrictive than necessary, and be applied only to enterprises carrying on a business in Australia.</para><para>Clearly this is little detail about what interactive and/or video includes and even less detail about the processes involved in getting agreement to incorporate new media. </para><para>I thought it relevant to ask the Minister and the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts how the Department defined `new media'.</para><para>Estimates Hansard from November 2003 will show, that neither the Minister for the Arts—OR the Department could answer this question—and consequently took it on notice.</para><para>Wouldn't you think that after nearly 12 months of negotiation surrounding the audiovisual sector—of which `new media' appeared to be sticking point that the Minister and his Department would have some idea about what they were prepared to simply trade away?</para><para>For the record—the response which I received to the question on notice was this:</para><para>While there is no single definition of this term, that provided by the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Film Commission, Mr Kim Dalton, in his evidence to the committee, provides a useful explanation: </para><para>`When we talk about new media we are referring to those new systems of production, distribution and delivery which are on us now or are in the process of being developed or conceptualised—those that exist in the digital domain which, for the most part, have interactive potential and at times may well look like traditional television services but have greater potential, for instance, in terms of interactivity or multichannelling and which may also exist in a broadband Internet environment, which would also allow for the possibility, increasingly these days, for the delivery of quite high-resolution moving images and also interactive potential.' (Q 225—Australian Film Commission, Answer to QON November 3&amp;4 2003.)</para><para>Labor is determined to find out exactly what the AUSFTA means for the future ability of Australia to gain access to and produce `interactive audio and/or video, and shall pursue this through the Senate Select Committee. </para><para>Finally another concerning aspect of the deal struck with the United States is the 55% cap on local content for free to air television being subject (as is the whole of Annex 1) to a `ratchet' clause, meaning any downward movement in the quotas would be irreversible regardless of the cap.</para><para>To sum up, the overall outcome of the deal struck between the Howard Government and the United States has been left with an overwhelming feeling of uncertainty about the future impact on the broadcasting and film and television sector now and in the future. </para><para>Many in the industry have commented that it is not the next couple of years that full impact of the AUSFTA will be most notable—but over the next 5-10 years as technology emerges, the gap between local content actually shown on all formats and overall broadcast time in Australia will get far wider. </para><para>It is important to note, that in the Australian Film and Television industry, production of Australian Feature Films has plunged by one-third, down from 30 to 19 in 2002-2003 and that expenditure on feature film and drama production is also down by 23% to $513 million in a period of just 12 months. </para><para>It is because of this downturn and rising unemployment in the production sector that the AUSFTA is causing even greater concern for film and television stakeholders.</para><para>Ultimately local content quotas across free-to-air and Pay TV Quotas serve to ensure investment in Australian Feature film and television production. </para><para>This continued investment is critical to ensuring that Australian voices and faces are both heard and seen on Australian screens.</para><para>The tricky spin emanating from the Howard Government has worked hard to distort any impartial analyses about exactly what AUSFTA means for the Film and Television sector and indeed the broader cultural community. </para><para>Rumours are rife about organisations getting heavied by the Government to make favourable comment or to say nothing.</para><para>Let it not be forgotten that this uncertainty is a direct result of the Howard Government's failure to obtain a broad reservation for the cultural sector and consequently, many important mechanisms which are essential to ensuring the growth of Australian film and television are to be restricted under the proposed Agreement.</para><para>The Labor Party is seeking to clarify all of these issues raised through the Senate Select Committee on the Australian United States Free Trade Agreement. </para><para>This committee provides THE ONLY opportunity for the Australian people to delve into the detail and assess its impact. </para><para>It is important to note that Labor is not opposed to Free Trade, but we have reserved making a decision on whether we will support the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement until after the Senate Select Committee reports on 12th August this year. </para><para>The recommendations arising from this report will shape Labor's position on AUSFTA and whether we will support changes to existing legislation required to implement the agreement.</para><para>The Howard Government has not yet indicated when they propose to introduce these legislative changes.</para><para>There is no doubt however about the trickiness the Howard Government has employed to get this deal signed.</para><para>What remains to be seen is just how much has been deliberately withheld from the Australian people about the perceived `benefit' to our nation.</para><para>Slightly removed from previously discussed issues but of much importance is the extension of Copyright from 50 to 70 years. While Labor has not expressed an opinion on this in terms of the cultural sector, it is important that we delve into the issues for Libraries and educational bodies. </para><para>The extension which the AUSFTA for which copyright payments must be made from 50 years after the death of the author to 70 years, in line with US law (article 17.4), is going to be costly for libraries and educational bodies, as Australia has adopted the US copyright standard without the US's more generous rules for copying for research and education purposes.</para><para>The Australian Fair Trade and Investment Network Ltd (AFTINET) had some particularly interesting comments which could be investigated further: </para><para> “Copyright law is supposed to provide a balance between fair rewards for authors and excessive protection which raises prices.

It is also important that support provided to Indigenous Australians and their employers during a New Apprenticeship is culturally sensitive and sufficient to assist them in successfully completing a New Apprenticeship.  </para><para>To assist in achieving these objectives the government has introduced a Key Performance Indicator which includes measuring the participation of Indigenous Australians in New Apprenticeships and the types of qualifications Indigenous Australians are pursuing.</para><para>(7)	There is no additional cost to the Government as the Government's actions to encourage Indigenous Australians to participate in New Apprenticeships are incorporated in the New Apprenticeships Support Services contract 2003 - 2006.</para><para>(8)	There is no additional cost to the Government as the Government's actions to encourage Indigenous Australians to participate in New Apprenticeships are incorporated in the New Apprenticeships Support Services contract 2003 - 2006. </para><quote><para>Attachment A</para><para>New Apprenticeships Commencements by Residential State of New Apprentice</para><para>Source: Brio TYIMS data as at 2/4/03

In recognition of the need to provide adequate resourcing to all elements of the native title system, in the 2001-02 Budget the Government committed an additional $86 million to the native title system as a whole, including supplementary funding to support NTRBs. The additional funding spanned four years and was designed to create better, more sustainable native title outcomes and, in particular, to meet two objectives:</para><para>	the establishment of instructive legal precedents; and</para><para>	speedier resolution of native title applications.</para><para>As part of this package and to promote the ongoing effectiveness of the native title system, the Government established the Native Title Coordination Committee (NTCC). The NTCC is chaired by the Attorney-General's Department and comprises representatives from relevant Australian Government agencies, including ATSIS. The NTCC oversees the performance and administration of the system, including those issues directly affecting NTRBs.  </para><para>Additional funding for the native title system—support to NTRBs</para><para>Twenty per cent ($17.4 million) of the additional funding was directed to ATSIC over four years for: </para><para>	NTRB capacity building (as the review process which led to the allocation of these funds identified this as the highest priority for NTRBs); and</para><para>	facilitation of a more strategic approach to the prioritisation of claims by providing funding to assist the progress of key claims.</para><para>NTRBs receive the greatest proportion of overall funding provided by the Government and, in real terms, receive more funding now than ever before. </para><para>Improving NTRB resource allocation</para><para>Apart from issues of funding, the Government is considering how to ensure that existing resources are appropriately prioritised to improve NTRB's effectiveness. To this end, the Government recently commissioned a report (the Miller Report) to examine, among other things, whether mechanisms for distributing funds to NTRBs could be improved. The report suggested a new methodology for allocating resources which should be tied to outcomes. Moves are underway to implement this outputs/outcome based funding framework for the NTRB system, in order to provide for more effective NTRB performance and better prioritisation of resources. </para><para>While the Government does not directly fund Prescribed Bodies Corporate (PBCs), PBCs are able to access limited support through NTRBs. The issue of what funding and other resources PBCs may require is being considered by Government. </para><para>(3)	NTRBs have informed the Federal Court of Australia (the Federal Court) that the combination of the sheer range and volume of activities which they are required to perform or be involved in under the NTA and insufficient resources to meet these demands is necessitating a focus only on the most urgent of matters. Such concerns have been expressed at Federal Court User Group Meetings. In specific cases the Federal Court has been provided with affidavits by NTRBs regarding funding for their native title functions in response to NTRB failure to comply with procedural orders of the Federal Court.</para><para>The Federal Court is a member of the NTCC and has brought these experiences to the NTCC's work in monitoring the native title system.</para><para>(4)	See answer to question 2.</para><para>(5)	Occasions upon which NTRBs assert that they have been forced to withdraw from participation in native title proceedings due to inadequate funding, and relevant details, are shown in Table 2 below.

In 2002-03 over 56,000 individuals participated in the program nationally. </para><para>The CDEP scheme aimed to improve the economic, social and cultural status of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. In 2003/04, approximately $400m of the total CDEP allocation of $520m will be offset against welfare entitlements. </para><para>The CDEP scheme commenced in 1977 in remote Indigenous communities, as an alternative to the payment of passive welfare benefits to individuals, and also as a means of enabling community development. Since then, CDEP has been extended to Indigenous communities and organisations in rural, regional and urban situations throughout Australia where employment and other opportunities have been limited.</para><para>CDEP is a highly diverse and devolved program, regionally administered and managed by ATSIS, delivered by approximately 240 community based service providers. </para><para>In 2001/02 the expanded outcomes of CDEP were reflected in the program reporting against three ATSIC output groups, acknowledging the broader range of social, cultural and economic outcomes of the program.</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Policy Context</inline></para><quote><para>Employment forecasts for Indigenous people predict a worsening employment rate for Indigenous people and recognise the important role and contribution that CDEP makes to employment, economic, social and community development outcomes for Indigenous people. CD&amp;EP policy therefore is a key element within the overarching ATSIC Employment Policy 2004-2006 and the program will continue to evolve.  </para><para>The existing Community Development Employment Projects (CDEP) scheme will be known as the Community Development and Employment Program (CD&amp;EP) from 2004-2005. </para><para>Nationally, CDEP currently accounts for approximately 25% of Indigenous employment and is also an important means of satisfying mutual obligation requirements, improving social cohesion and building individual and community capacity.</para><para>The recent Productivity Commission report “Overcoming Indigenous Disadvantage: Key Indicators 2003 noted that CDEP comprises a significant proportion of Indigenous employment, especially in remote and very remote areas, where it can account for the overwhelming majority of jobs. </para><para>Whilst the program promotes the transition of participants to mainstream employment, 65% of current CDEP services are delivered in remote Australia, where labour market opportunities and access to mainstream job network services and training are often limited.</para><para>75% of all CDEP participants have undertaken training within work activities, significantly contributing to the objectives of CDEP and the Indigenous Employment Policy, administered by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations. 28% of CDEP Indigenous Employment Centre participants transitioned to a recognised job outcome. </para><para>CDEP has supported business and enterprise development with over 40% of CDEP activity contributing to economic development, particularly in remote and more remote areas which often have a limited economic base. </para><para>The revised CD&amp;EP will continue to support training and employment opportunities and business and economic development opportunities.</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Policy Challenges</inline></para><quote><para>The CDEP scheme has been operating for over twenty five years. Notwithstanding several major reviews during this time, CDEP has lacked a clear national ATSIC Policy Statement. </para><para>Over recent years, ATSIC has encouraged Regional Councils to strengthen CDEP by taking a proactive role in regional planning, identifying local need, setting regional CDEP policy direction, devising regional strategies, prescribing expected outcomes, applying more tailored performance measures, building regional partnerships, developing program linkages, supporting structural change and improving management and administrative efficiency. </para><para>Of the two broad outcomes sought from CDEP, building and maintaining a strong, functional, sustainable socio-cultural-economic base for individuals and communities, and increasing individual access to and participation in the labour market and broader economy, the relative emphasis given to either or both of these is highly dependent on where CDEP has been delivered.

It is less likely that material prepared outside the local area, and distributed in a similar generic form to several licensees, will have an adequate local emphasis for this notice.</para><para>The explanatory comments provide a list of non-exhaustive examples of material that may be considered to be of local significance, including:</para><para>	material that deals with the effects in the area of an event that occurs elsewhere; </para><para>	material that deals with people, organisations, events or issues that are of particular interest to people in the area, in a way that focuses on the interests of people in the area; </para><para>	material about a sporting event that involves a team from the area;</para><para>	material about a sporting event that involves a team from a nearby area, whose principal support base includes the area, or a significant part of the area;</para><para>	material about market conditions that closely affect a major business activity in the area, such as prices of a commodity in an area where that commodity is produced on a significant scale;</para><para>	material about an individual in whom people in the area are particularly interested because of an association with the area, such as the individual's having grown up, or lived, in the area. </para><para>(b) No. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Attorney-General's: Review</title><page.no>23457</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2753)</subtitle><id.no>2753</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>23457</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator Ludwig</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 26 March 2004:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	What selection criteria were used by the team evaluating the tenders for the review.</para><para>(2)	On what basis was Phillips Fox selected to conduct the review.</para><para>(3)	(a) Who were the members of the selection team; and (b) what were their qualifications.</para><para>(4)	Can a copy of the management plan be provided.</para><para>(5)	Have the submissions to the review closed; if not, when will they close; if so, can a list be provided of all submitters.</para><para>(6)	When is the review expected to be finalised.</para><para>(7)	Will the findings of the review be made public; if so, when; if not, why not.</para><para>(8)	If a Phillips Fox client makes a submission to the review, does Phillips Fox have to notify the department; if so, can details be provided. </para><para>(9)	Is Phillips Fox permitted to assist existing clients in relation to submissions during the review period; if so, can details be provided of the circumstances under which this is permitted.</para><para>(10)	Has Phillips Fox or its subsidiaries provided any assistance to clients in relation to submissions to the review; if so, can details be provided.</para><para>(11)	(a) What mechanisms are in place for dealing with potential conflicts of interest; and (b) have any actual conflicts of interest been reported to the department since the time of tender; if so, can details be provided.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>23458</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Ellison</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	The tender evaluation was conducted in accordance with a Tender Evaluation Plan approved by the First Assistant Secretary of the Information and Security Law Division of the Attorney-General's Department. </para><para>In summary, tenders were evaluated on several levels. First, they were assessed against mandatory criteria, being the level of compliance with the requirements of the Request for Tender and Conflict of Interest. Second, they were evaluated for `technical worth' which included assessment of the proposed approach and methodology; specified personnel and expertise; management arrangements; and past performance. Reference checks were conducted as part of this evaluation. Third, consideration was given to financial assessment of tendered prices. Lastly, a comparative evaluation and assessment was conducted of overall risks and value for money to determine the tender which provided the best value for money to the Department.</para><para>(2)	The Government is conducting the review of the Digital Agenda reforms.

Mr Paul McIvor, Director of the Attorney-General's Department's Market Testing Unit was involved in the initial Invitations to Register Interest stage in which 11 out of the 14 Expressions of Interest received were selected to participate in the next phase of the procurement process. He was replaced by Mr Geoff Conn, a manager in the Financial Policy and Contracts Section who was involved in settling the Request for Tender and in Tender evaluation. Mr McIvor has a Certificate IV qualification in Government Procurement. At the relevant time Mr Conn had almost completed a Master of Business Administration. Both officers have many years of experience in high level procurement and market testing.</para><para>The Tender Evaluation Team recommended that approval be given to enter into negotiations with Phillips Fox to conduct the services proposed under the Request for Tender. This recommendation was endorsed by Mr Peter Ford, First Assistant Secretary of the Information and Security Law Division and approved by Mr Ian Carnell, (then) General Manager, Criminal Justice and Security Group, Attorney-General's Department. </para><para>(4)	It is assumed that this question relates to the answer given to Question on Notice 2203 that referred to a management plan included by tenderers in their tenders for dealing with any actual or perceived conflicts of interest in connection with provisions of the contract services. The management plan provided by Phillips Fox is at Attachment A. </para><para>(5)	Phillips Fox asked that submissions be made by 30 September 2003. Submissions made after that date up to 24 October 2003 were accepted and considered. Submissions received by Phillips Fox after 24 October 2003 were provided to the Attorney-General's Department for consideration by the Department in connection with its broader review of the Digital Agenda amendments as they were too late to be considered by Phillips Fox. In relation to the list of submitters, see below answer to question (6).</para><para>(6)	Phillips Fox has completed the research and analysis of the reforms that they were contracted to conduct. The results of their research and analysis were contained in a report made to the Attorney-General's Department, a copy of which is at Attachment B. A list of parties who made submissions to Phillips Fox is at Appendix C of that report. The Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts are considering the recommendations made in the Phillips Fox report. The timing of the completion of that review has been delayed as implementation of the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement has higher priority.</para><para>(7)	The report by Phillips Fox was released on 28 April 2004. When the Government's review of the Copyright Digital Agenda reforms is completed, the findings will be made public. </para><para>(8)	Phillips Fox specifically agreed that it would not act for any person, or provide any other assistance, in connection with any submission or possible submission to the review, without the Department's prior written consent. No such consent was sought or given. </para><para>During contract negotiations Phillips Fox specified a list of their clients with an interest in the proper and efficient operation of Australia's copyright system, and, possibly, an interest in making submissions to the review. In view of this the Department was on notice if any of these clients made a submission and their views were given any preferential status by Phillips Fox. The Department received copies of all submissions made to Phillips Fox. In the Department's view there was no evidence of any bias in the report provided to the Department by Phillips Fox. </para><para>(9)	Not permitted—see above answer.</para><para>(10)	The Department has been advised that Phillips Fox did not contribute in any way or assist with any submission.</para><para>(11)	(a) Phillips Fox complied with the conflict of interest requirements in the RTF and satisfied the Tender Evaluation Team that they could carry out the contracted services independently of stakeholder interests. The contract between Phillips Fox and the Commonwealth contained provisions to deal with any conflicts of interest that `arises or appears likely to arise' during the performance of the contract. Phillips Fox was required to notify the Department in writing if any conflict of interest arose or was likely to arise during the performance of the contract services. This obligation ceased when Phillips Fox provided their report to the Department on 4 February 2004. </para><para>(b) No actual conflicts of interest were reported to the Department by Phillips Fox. Phillips Fox notified the Department on three occasions during the term of the contract when they were instructed to provide legal services in relation to various matters concerning aspects of the Copyright Act 1968. The Department considered each of these notifications as they arose. None involved issues that were within the terms of reference for the Phillips Fox consultancy or matters concerning the Copyright Digital Agenda reforms. None of these instructing clients made submissions to Phillips Fox or the Department. In the Department's view there was no conflict of interest in relation to Phillips Fox performing that work and the performance of the contract services.  </para><quote><para>Attachment A</para><para>CONFLICT OF INTEREST CRITERIA - PHILLIPS FOX RESPONSE</para><para>Phillips Fox is not aware of any circumstances that may give rise to an actual conflict of interest with the Department.

In providing the services, Phillips Fox is undertaking research and analysis, identifying issues, receiving and considering submissions and, in the light of those submissions and extensive public consultation, making certain recommendations to the Department. Any final decision on the acceptance or otherwise of those recommendations will be by the Department, with no involvement or influence by Phillips Fox. Further, the Department will be involved in every stage of this transparent and public process, and will have approval on all aspects of the proposed methodology.</para><para>Phillips Fox will treat equally all submissions and other material received in the course of the review.</para><para>Phillips Fox believes that its involvement with these clients, and its knowledge and understanding of copyright issues as a result, will be invaluable in fulfilling the requirements of the review. Further, if the Department is to engage any contractor with the necessary, relevant experience and industry knowledge, the contractor is likely to have similar possible or perceived conflicts of interests that must be appropriately managed. The way in which Phillips Fox intends to deliver the Contract Services, and its undertaking not to provide assistance to any clients in respect of the view, adequately addresses and properly manages these issues.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Defence: Boarding Operations</title><page.no>23460</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2759)</subtitle><id.no>2759</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>23460</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator Ludwig</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 26 March 2004:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Other than Fremantle class patrol vessels, what other classes of Australian naval vessels are able to undertake boarding operations of other vessels when enforcing Australian Commonwealth law.</para><para>(2)	(a) Can a list be provided showing the class and name of each of the vessels able to undertake these boarding operations; and (b) can these vessels undertake boarding operations where the use of force or lethal force may be expected, or the crew or passengers of the vessel to be boarded are behaving in an overtly hostile manner; if not, which vessels can undertake these boarding operations. </para><para>(3)	(a) Since 1996, how many boarding operations have been undertaken by naval personnel enforcing Australian Commonwealth law where: the use of force was expected, the use of lethal force was expected, or the crew or passengers of the vessel to be boarded are behaving in an overtly hostile manner; and (b) can a breakdown be provided of each boarding operation showing; (i) the name of the naval vessel involved, (ii) when the boarding occurred, and (iii) the location of the boarding. </para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>23461</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	All commissioned Royal Australian Navy (RAN) surface ships.</para><para>(2)	(a) All commissioned RAN surface ships are required to have a properly trained and drilled boarding organisation on achieving a minimum level of capability after appropriate workup training.

Participation in such events was not required under the contract with the Department but Phillips Fox considered they provided opportunities for targeted consultation with stakeholders and could assist it in formulating its advice to the Department. None of these events were organised by Phillips Fox or the Department. Phillips Fox did not issue any invitations to those events and did not charge for their participation. As far as the Department is aware, all costs associated with these events were met by the organisers. Phillips Fox gave the Department prior notice of its involvement in all events they participated in and officers of the Department were invited by the respective organisers to attend. Details of these events are set out below. Phillips Fox also gave presentations at various conferences and met with various interested industry bodies during the consultancy to inform those present about the research and analysis it was undertaking. As these were merely for information dissemination and not consultative forums they have not been included in answer to this question. </para><para>A forum was hosted by the Australian Centre for Intellectual Property in Agriculture (ACIPA) at Griffith University, Brisbane. The forum was chaired by Matthew Hall, Partner, Phillips Fox and Professor Brad Sherman, Director of ACIPA. It was held in Phillips Fox Brisbane office on 15 August 2003. The forum was to provide an update on the progress of the review and allow interested parties to participate. While the Department was invited to attend, attendance was not considered necessary.</para><para>A symposium titled `The Digital Agenda Revisited' was held as part of the Baker &amp; McKenzie Cyberspace Law and Policy Centre of the University of NSW Cyberspace Law and Policy Series 2003. This event was co-hosted by Phillips Fox and the Baker &amp; McKenzie Cyberspace Law and Policy Centre and held in the Phillips Fox Sydney office in Sydney on 21 August 2003. Details of the symposium can be found at the following website: http://www.bakercyberlawcentre.org/ 2003/Digital_Agenda/index.htm. The symposium acted as one of Phillips Fox's Sydney based consultative workshops to assist its advice to the Department. It focussed on public interest concerns about the copyright digital agenda framework. Attendance at this symposium was by invitation determined and issued by the Centre. Attendees included intellectual property lawyers from major Sydney law firms, copyright academics from various universities and other leading copyright stakeholders. Officers from the Department were invited to attend and one officer attended at Departmental expense.  </para><para>On 28 August 2003 a meeting was convened by the Copyright in Cultural Institutions (CICI) group at the National Museum of Australia in Canberra. Phillips Fox were invited to give a presentation to the meeting and did so at no charge. The purpose of the meeting was for discussion of the issues of particular interest to cultural institutions and provided an opportunity for clarification of concerns for the preparation of stakeholder submissions to Phillips Fox. The meeting was open for attendance by CICI members; that is, representatives dealing with copyright in libraries, archives, galleries and museums from around Australia. The Department was invited to attend the meeting and one officer attended. </para><para>(2)	In addition to the information provided above, the roundtable meetings on 5 June 2003 were held in a meeting room in the Phillips Fox Sydney office.

The Sydney forum on 4 September 2003 was held in the Metcalfe Auditorium in the State Library of New South Wales.</para><para>(3)	The purpose of the roundtable meetings on 5 June 2003 was to meet with a small number of key stakeholder representatives to ensure that any major concerns were included in the issues papers that would form the basis for detailed public consultation. At each meeting those present were able to raise any issues or concerns they had on matters within the terms of reference for the Phillips Fox consultancy.</para><para>The public forums held in August and September provided any interested party with an opportunity to comment on issues raised by Phillips Fox in the four issues papers.

The forums were to assist Phillips Fox in their task of formulating its views on the matters covered by their terms of reference for reporting to the Department. This was the only outcome of the forums. </para><para>(4)	The only outcomes were the views expressed by persons participating in the forums. No written documentation was made of those views. The Melbourne and Sydney forums were recorded for the purpose of giving Phillips Fox a record of discussion to assist internal consideration of responses to the issues.

A copy of the notification published is at Attachment A. Notification of the forums was made in the June 2003 edition of e-News, the copyright newsletter of the Copyright Law Branch of the Department, which was sent electronically to over 1200 e-mail subscribers. </para><para>(7)	No. The consultative forums were planned as part of the methodology proposed by Phillips Fox in their Request for Tender and agreed by the Department in the contract with Phillips Fox.  </para><para>(8)	The only consultative forums planned by Phillips Fox and the Department that were by invitation were the stakeholder roundtable meetings held on 5 June 2003. The list of invitees was settled in consultation with the Department. No one invited to attend the roundtable meetings was a client of Phillips Fox. </para><para>(9)	The Phillips Fox regular IT and e-commerce bulletin in August 2003 focussed on the issues raised in the issues papers. This publication was sent to all regular recipients who are on the mailing list for that bulletin. This includes, but is not limited to, clients of Phillips Fox. The bulletin was also posted on the Phillips Fox website and is generally available. A copy of that bulletin is at Attachment B. Phillips Fox has advised that the only statements that have been made to clients relate to the fact that Phillips Fox had been appointed by the Department to conduct the research and analysis for the review or other information that is on the public record. </para><para>(10)	(a) and (b) It was agreed between Phillips Fox and the Department that the venue cost of the Melbourne, Sydney and online forums were included in the cost of the consultancy on the basis that they would be hosted in the respective Phillips Fox offices.
