Never again could any Australian worker feel totally safe in their job. The cherished Australian ideals of fair play and good faith in the workplace were swept away in a sea of balaclavas, armed thugs and german shepherds. Since its first day in office in 1996, the Howard government had promised that the law of the jungle would come into effect in Australian workplaces. That day had finally come. On this occasion the government's brazenness sealed its own fate. The Australian community rallied to the side of the Maritime Workers Union of Australia and its members. While the government had lost all semblance of moral responsibility, the Australian community had not. When future generations look back at the Howard government, this despicable attack on its own citizens will forever colour their view.</para></talk.start><para>But it is by no means an isolated incident: this government has always been at war with working Australians. The incidents have not always been as spectacular as the waterfront dispute, but they have been happening all the same. When Peter Reith was the minister for workplace relations, he was quite open about his desire to be an employer advocate. The current incarnation, however, doggedly clings to a ridiculously flimsy veil of falsified impartiality from behind which he attacks the conditions, rights and security of working Australian families. What are his favourite targets? They are the voice of working Australians, the trade union movement, and the cornerstone of the industrial relations system: the impartial umpire, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.</para><para>The <inline ref="R1594">Workplace Relations Amendment (Improved Remedies for Unprotected Action) Bill 2002</inline> is nothing more than another component of this antiworker campaign initiated by Peter Reith, continuedâalbeit in a haphazard, fragmented and unsuccessful mannerâby Tony Abbott and now in the hands of another rabid ideologue, Kevin Andrews. Having been unable to push the Orwellianly titled `More Jobs, Better Pay' omnibus bill through the Senate, the government thought no-one would notice if they split it up and snuck it through separately. On the surface the Workplace Relations Amendment (Improved Remedies for Unprotected Action) Bill 2002 may seem relatively benign to the casual observer. It proposes three main amendments to the Workplace Relations Act 1996. First, it seeks to introduce a provision that the commission must, as far as practicable, hear and determine an application for a section 127 order within 48 hours. Second, it proposes a new provision giving the commission explicit power to make interim orders if it cannot come to a final decision within 48 hours. Finally, it looks to introduce new considerations for the commission to take into account in considering whether to make an interim order. But, while this bill may seem nothing more than an administrative fiddle around the edges of one section in an entire act, it is in fact a serious attack on the right of working Australians to stand up for their jobs and their working conditions. </para><para>So what is this bill really all about? It is about implementing the coalition's extremist industrial relations agenda, no matter what the cost is to our community. This government wishes to remove the right of working Australians to bargain collectively, hamstring the Industrial Relations Commission to ensure that there is no fair and independent umpire to resolve disputes, and obliterate the concept of good-faith bargaining. The evidence is right here before us. First, there is no way that this bill is actually aimed at assisting the IRC to do its job, as the previous minister erroneously claimed. Let us take the attempt to introduce a strict 48-hour period in which the IRC must hear and determine section 127 matters. Is this indicative measure really necessary? The IRC already has the power to hear section 127 matters as quickly as practicable. Why amend the act to specify a 48-hour period? Why become obsessed with the process rather than look at the practicality of the issues? Currently the commission is doing its job in a very timely and efficient manner. A Senate committee report found that over half of section 127 applications were already decided within 48 hours. The previous minister himself said:</para><quote><para>The latest figures show that some 85 per cent of section 127 applications are first heard within four days of lodgement.</para></quote><para>Why is the government so keen to introduce what in fact is a redundant measure?</para><para>Putting aside for a moment the irony of a right-wing ideologue arguing in favour of greater intervention in the industrial relations process, I am assuming that it is not because this government is in favour of indicative time frames. In 2002 the government howled down a Labor proposal to introduce a time frame in which unfair dismissal claims should be heard. While the miners of the Blair Athol coalmine, who waited nearly five years for their unfair dismissal case to be heard, thought it was a very sensible idea, this government did not. Apparently such a proposal was impracticable. Obviously, in the addled minds of the Tory brains trust, things have changed.</para><para>There is only one answer. By enforcing the 48-hour time frame, the government is attempting to curtail the ability of trade unions to prepare and present evidence and argument against a section 127 order. This government is trying to shut down the right of workers to act collectively in order to ensure that they receive a fair deal at the hands of their employers. This becomes more evident when we further examine this redundant measure in the context of the bill's remaining elements. The government seeks to encourage the commission to make interim orders within 48 hours if they have not had time to hear all the evidence and submissions required to make a final ruling. The commission would not be required to hold a hearing or to form a view about whether the action would be protected under the act. Instead, the IRC would be forced to consider set factors when deciding whether to grant an interim section 127 order, again putting the focus on process rather than on the practicalities and industrial realities of the situation. These factors are heavily weighted towards the concerns of employers and include damage to industry and the undesirability of unprotected action.</para><para>The commission already makes interim orders on a regular basis. However, it only uses this power after conducting a hearing, during which it considers a wide range of evidence and argument, and after considering whether the action is protected action. Again, the government's aim becomes transparent. Removing the requirement to hold a hearing or to form a view about whether the industrial action is protected would expose unionists and employees to financial penalties without an opportunity to be heard. It would also undermine the right of employees to take protected action during an enterprise bargaining period. </para><para>This amendment is like a red rag to a bull. At the first sign of any industrial action from employees, the intimidation machineâmilitant, anti-unionist employersâwill roar into life. Lawyers will be sent into the commission to ask for interim orders to serve on employees and their union. Such an order would be enforceable in the Federal Court and backed by fines. How many times does this government have to go back to the future to find out that the full use of penalties is not the most effective way of conducting the industrial relations system? Instead of leaving the commission to make its decisions free from outside interference and in a measured and professional manner as it has always done, this bill thrusts the government's bias towards employers onto its unwilling shoulders. The end result sees the commission boxed in by an indicative and, may I say, prescriptive time frame and a set of guidelines that force the organisation to become a de facto cheer squad for employers who do not like the idea that their employees may want to stand up for themselves.</para><para>The government talks about respecting the umpire and the importance of the Industrial Relations Commission. What this bill really does is strike at the heart of the commission's discretion to make reasoned and considered judgments. The government considers the commission as nothing more than a potential weapon in its unrelenting war on the trade union movement. Looking back on the history of this bill, we see that the government has decided to escalate its campaign. A previous incarnation of this bill explicitly applied to lockouts as well as strikes. The recently departed minister removed any such mention from this legislation and made no mention of this practice in his second reading speech. This is a clear indication of the government's mind-set. Not once does it stop to consider the effects lockouts have on working Australians and their families.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>âI raise a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President.

When I was interrupted by the point of order, I was talking about the fact that what this government is seeking to do is essentially hamstring the Industrial Relations Commission in its capacity to act as an independent arbitrator, act as an honest broker in the industrial relations system and ensure in that context that both workers and employers get a fair go from the system and are able to pursue genuinely negotiated agreements between themselves without the direct interference of government in that process. What this government is seeking to do, not only by this bill but by other bills it has introduced, is de facto put its hands up the back of the commission and use the commission as a puppet to deliver its industrial relations agenda. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The government's industrial relations agenda has always had one particular aim: to destroy the trade union movement. They have made no secret of that. They said when they came to power in 1996 that four unions were their target. Those four unions were the maritime workers, whom they attacked in 1998; the building workers, who have been the subject of a royal commission and the greatest kangaroo court we have ever seen in this country, quite frankly; the metal workers, who presumably may be next on the list after they have gone through that process; and the transport workers. Why are those four unions singled out? Because historically in this country they have been the most effective unions in protecting the interests of their members and in promoting the interests of workers generally in our economy.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>âMr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order.

Before I was so rudely interrupted, I was talking about the fact that from this bill, unlike in other bills and a similar previous bill produced by this government on this issue, this government has deliberately excluded the issue of lockouts. We know how effectively lockouts are used against working Australians to deny them income in an industrial relations environment. Whilst this government considers strike action to be undesirable, it obviously does not consider lockouts by employers in the same category or as constituting strike action. At the first hint of a strike the government's attack dogs are all over the press demanding that industry take the strongest possible action to end the industrial action. However, when workers are locked out or when strike action is taken against workers or employees, it is remarkable how strangely silent this government is in its response to the actions of those employers. We have never heard previous ministers, whether Minister Andrews, Minister Abbott or Minister Reith, commenting on lockouts. Where were they when the recent lockout occurred at Geelong Wool? Where were they when the recent lockout occurred at the ACI Box Hill plant? Strangely silent, strangely not to be found. However, when there is industrial action taken by employees they cannot get into the press quickly enough to condemn it and to condemn their organisation. </para></talk.start></continue><para>It is just another clear demonstration of the blind ideological intransigence this government has when it is dealing with industrial relations issues. Every piece of legislation it brings into this parliament promotes confrontation and industrial unrest. All of its industrial relations agenda, its industrial relations approach, is predicated on conflict and destroying the other side. There has not been the slightest hint by this coalition or this government to put balance into the industrial relations system and to provide the platform upon which both parties are given a fair go. The government has never had any interest in providing for bargaining in good faith, and certainly nothing in this bill or in other bills that are currently before this chamber goes anywhere near demonstrating that it even understands what bargaining in good faith means.</para><para>If one wants to go and look for a classic example, it is the McMahon dispute in Sydney recently where women who had worked for a company for over 20 years without ever taking industrial action were locked out for something like 12 to 14 weeks. The minister eventually got himself cornered where he had to go down to the picket line and grudgingly admit that they were within their rights to do what they were doing, despite the fact that there had been consistent press statements and arguments made by speakers on behalf of this government condemning those workers in taking that industrial action.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator Ferris</name></talker><para>âWhat has happened on the waterfront?

She might actually get the meaning of balance in industrial relations if she went and observed the system and how it works. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The reality is that Labor cannot support this bill. Nor can we support this government's destructive agenda. Not only do we not support the bill but in fact we condemn the government for its failure to provide the Industrial Relations Commission, as the independent umpire, with adequate powers to settle industrial disputes and to ensure parties bargain in good faith. We condemn its inflammatory and confrontationist rhetoric during industrial disputes and its threats to withdraw car industry assistance unless employers implement its divisive industrial relations agenda. We all remember the demand it put on the auto industry: if you want the ACIS scheme you have to take a big stick to your employees. That was the proposition that it put on the table in negotiating the future support mechanisms for the auto industryâan absolute shame. It was almost as disgraceful as what Malcolm Fraser did in 1976 when he demanded that workers at Newcastle put up liabilities to get work in the shipbuilding industry so if the ship was delayed for any reason they would be directly subject to penalties for any delay. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>20516</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1594">Workplace Relations Amendment (Improved Remedies for Unprotected Action) Bill 2002</inline>. This is one of many bills currently before the Senate from this government to make significant changes to the Workplace Relations Act. Despite what the government says, all of these bills have a singular purpose. They are designed to undermine the capacity of workers and the unions to look after the legitimate needs of working Australians. Both this bill and subsequent bills should be rejected in their entirety, and the Greens intend to do that.</para></talk.start><para>This bill seeks to repeal section 127(3) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 and to replace it with a harsher and more complex regime. Section 127(3) of the act currently states in relation to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission:</para><quote><para>The Commission must hear and determine an application for an order under this section as quickly as practicable.</para></quote><para>The government seeks to replace this section with a requirement that applications must be heard within 48 hours, otherwise the employer can seek interim orders on the basis of a set of criteriaâand later I will go into the skewed nature of that criteria in favour of the employer's situation. </para><para>The Greens will not accept this legislation. We recognise that there is an imbalance, that the Howard government and some actions of the previous Labor government have skewed the industrial relations system so far in favour of the employer that a change is needed to take us back in a direction where the rights of working men and women are protected by our industrial relations system, rather than the industrial relations system continually being used to create more opportunities for employers to diminish the rights of working men and women in Australia.</para><para>The Greens do not support moves through amendments or dealsâwe saw one last night, and I am not quite sure what we are going to see todayâthat seek to find a middle ground in relation to the government's industrial relations agenda. This government has skewed the balance so far in favour of the employers that there is a non-existent middle ground that some deals and amendments seek to find to put what it perceives as some balance back into this government's industrial relations agenda. The government's agenda is unambiguous. It cannot be mitigated with minor changes and amendments; it needs to be rejected.</para><para>There is a sense of deja vu in many pieces of industrial relations legislation that come before this parliament. We have seen many of the provisions in this bill in particular before. The government tried to enact these kinds of provisions in the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs) Bill in 1999, and the Senate at that time rightly rejected the proposals. The government tried again to make similar changes with its Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 2000, and the Senate again knocked it back. They were rejected and they should be rejected again.</para><para>The Australian people do not want the kind of antiworker and anti-union legislation that the Howard government continually proposes. They look to their representatives in the Senate to ensure that their views are listened to, because the Howard government has not listened to the views of the Australian people in relation to industrial relations. The Greens will certainly listen, and we hope that all senators will, in rejecting this consistent agenda of industrial relations reforms from the government. </para><para>Let us make no mistake: this is another of the government's tired attempts to attack workers and unions by enacting biased and draconian industrial relations legislation. It is part of their ideological attack against working people. They are running out of puff and they have run off course, but there is a federal election on the agenda so the Howard government are attempting to ramp up this attack on workers and on industrial relations. We know that recently the Liberal Party wrote to big business across the country warning of the industrial relations agenda of opposition parties and arguing that only a coalition government would defend and institute industrial relations laws that employers could use against employees. At the same time the Liberal Party asked these companies for big corporate donations to their Millennium Forum fundâtheir election war chest. The government may have the backing of big business when it comes to their crusade against the working men and women of Australia but they certainly do not have the backing of the Greens or any other people on this side of the chamber.</para><para>The government has sought in the past to whip up hysteria around these issues in the lead-up to an election. We saw that with the royal commission into the building industry which was instigated just before the last federal election. It did not work and yet the government is still trying to whip up hysteria around this particular issue. To start this first full week of parliament with six industrial relations amendments on the agenda is a clear indication that, in the lead-up to the election, the Howard government is again trying to whip up hysteria around industrial relations. Australians will not fall for it, the Senate will not fall for it and the Greens certainly will not fall for it. It needs to be seen for what it is: an unjustified, electorally motivated attack on Australian workers.</para><para>I want to look more closely at the provisions of the bill. This bill seeks to amend the Workplace Relations Act to require the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to hear and determine applications for orders under section 127 within 48 hours as far as practicable. It seeks to enable the commission to make an interim order if it is satisfied that the action is unprotected, if it has not formed a view and is unable to determine the application within 48 hours or if the action is likely to commence within 48 hours. It also seeks to amend the act to specify the matters the Australian Industrial Relations Commission must take into account when deciding whether or not to make an interim order.</para><para>At the outset let me say that there is clearly no need for this legislation. There is no difficulty, particularly for employers, in being able to seek section 127 orders from the Industrial Relations Commission. Most applications for section 127 orders are made by employers rather than by unions. This is despite the fact that industrial action such as lockouts by employers is on the rise. The University of Sydney looked at Australian Bureau of Statistics data in relation to this issue and concluded that industrial action such as lockouts is on the rise. They concluded that the proportion of industrial disputes which are lockouts is currently five times greater than it was in 1998. Previous changes to the Workplace Relations Act, such as allowing the use of lockouts to pressure employees to sign individual contracts, have facilitated lockouts by employers, so it is not surprising that we are now seeing the results of the Sydney University study saying that lockouts are on the rise. </para><para>Employers will be the ones to benefit from changes to section 127 applications. The provisions contained in this bill have been rejected before, so it is fair that we ask the question: what has changed that the government believes we need to look at this again? Has there been increasing industrial action in this country? Has there been an increasing number of section 127 orders requested of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission? The answer to both of these questions is no. There has been no increase in industrial action in Australia. In fact, the opposite has occurred. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the number of working days lost through industrial disputes continues to decline. In the 12 months to March 1996, 86 working days were lost per 1,000 employees and by March 2003 this fell to 31 days lost per 1000 employees.</para><para>Are the number of section 127 orders on the increase? According to uncontested evidence provided by the ACTU to the Senate inquiry into this bill, they are not. The ACTU looked at Industrial Relations Commission decisions over several years and found that 33 orders were issued in the year 2000, 26 in 2001, 35 in 2002 and, at the time of their evidence in September, only 25 in 2003. According to the ACTU's submission to the Senate inquiry into this bill:</para><quote><para>Many are concerned with reaction to employer unilateral action in the workplace, where workers take action on issues like termination or redundancy, roster changes, refusal to reemploy workers after a period on workers' compensation, payment of entitlements, safety and the like.</para><para>Issues which affect their daily lives, or those of their fellow workers are likely to be felt deeply in the workplace, and workers often feel that it is only by taking action that they can get attention to the issues from their employer.</para></quote><para>In other words, industrial action, whether legally protected or not, is usually a legitimate response to genuine workplace grievances. The figures of declining industrial action and the small number of section 127 orders show how successful the government has already been in removing the rights of workers and undermining unions' ability to represent their members. No change as outlined by the government in this bill is needed. The change that is needed is for workers to be returned their full rights to organise and to strike. The industrial imbalance wreaked by the Howard government needs to be redressed in favour of the working women and men of this country.</para><para>I want to look now at the requirement in this bill to hold a hearing within 48 hours and whether this is necessary. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission's annual report for 2002-03 shows that 85 per cent of section 127 applications are first heard within four days. According to people who regularly appear before the commission, a large proportion of these are heard within a day or two days. This is down from 2000-01, when 85 per cent of the first hearings were held within five days. The commission already endeavours to hold hearings as quick as possible, as it is required to do in the act. Section 127(3) of the act already requires the Industrial Relations Commission to hear and determine section 127 applications as soon as practicable.</para><para>If the government is really that concerned about increasing the speed with which applications get to a hearing, it should be increasing the resources of the Australian Industrial Relations Commissionânot forcing through an unrealistic and unnecessary requirement of 48 hours. Hamstringing the Australian Industrial Relations Commission with a 48-hour requirement will only undermine the effectiveness of the Industrial Relations Commission in resolving disputes by removing its discretion to prioritise its work and to address applications in the most appropriate manner in each circumstance. </para><para>It is when we look at the proposal for interim orders in this bill that the Howard government's industrial relations agenda becomes clear. Changes to the act would effectively enable employers to seek an order immediately ending strike action or other industrial action before an adequate airing of the facts and reasons for the dispute has taken place. Employers would use this legislation to attack the right of workers to strike by obtaining interim injunctions and avoiding having to address the issues at the heart of the dispute. Section 127(3A) would allow the commission to make an order for industrial action to stop or not occur even if it had not yet formed a view on whether the action was protected and that an application cannot be heard within 48 hours.</para><para>The unbalanced criteria in this bill that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission would have to give consideration to when deciding to make an interim order favours employers and enables them to obtain immediate orders against their workers. Section 127(3C) would mean an employer could argue industrial action should stop if, for example, industrial action might damage their industry and the action was ongoing or a sequence of action.</para><para>Workers do not take industrial action because they think it will help the employer's bottom line. In fact, that is the very point of taking industrial actionâso that issues raised in a dispute are resolved in the heat of industrial action. Sections 127(3A) and (3C) would enable employers to stop industrial action before having a full hearing on all the relevant matters related to the application and would undermine workers' capacity to effectively ensure the problem that caused the industrial action is addressed. Employers would be quite happy to discuss the issues under dispute forever as long as the industrial action is called off.</para><para>Employers will always try to get legal weapons to use against their work force, but this does not mean the government or the Senate should support them in doing so. The agenda of this government, backed by big business, has already divided this country and entrenched inequality. Precarious and casual work is expanding while employment security and full-time work is declining. People are working harder for less as government services in the form of health and education services are starved of funds and decline in quality. Meanwhile, we see executive salaries skyrocketing and big business profits increasing.</para><para>The Greens recognise that we need to turn this around. Rejecting this legislation and the government's ongoing campaign to increase industrial relations powers for employers is a significant first step in turning this around. We need a decent and fair industrial relations system that is centred on conciliation and arbitrationânot the division and conflict that is becoming the signature of the Howard government. The Greens are the only party in this parliament that unequivocally support workers' right to strike in our party policy platform. The withdrawal of one's labour in protest is a fundamental human right. The Greens are proud of their support of workers' rights and proud to have a policy that supports the rights of unions and unionists to take industrial action to protect and promote their legitimate industrial interests without legal impediment.</para><para>The lack of necessity for this bill reveals the government's real agenda in putting it forward. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission already has the capacity to make orders promptly and, if appropriate, to make interim orders. This bill is not about enabling the Industrial Relations Commission to work more effectively; rather, it is about removing its discretion and forcing it down a route favourable to employers at the expense of employees. The Australian Greens reject this bill. We see this, like so many attacks from the Howard government, as an attack on the rights of working women and men. It tips the scales of our industrial relations system even further in favour of employers. The Greens will not stand by and watch this happen. We will be opposing this bill. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>20520</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI remind the Senate that we are debating the <inline ref="R1594">Workplace Relations Amendment (Improved Remedies for Unprotected Action) Bill 2002</inline>.

As a result, if a strike or industrial action is illegal then certain consequences need to flow.</para></talk.start><para>This bill will strengthen the legislative intent of section 127 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996. Section 127 gives the Australian Industrial Relations Commission the power to order a return to work when unprotected and illegitimate industrial action is taking place. The bill will enhance this remedy by giving the commission another tool, interim orders, and by guiding the commission's discretion. The bill will provide that the commission should deal with applications for orders to prevent unprotected industrial action within 48 hours. The bill will provide an express power to issue interim orders where a final decision is not possible within this ideal time frame. Interim orders would be made in accordance with guiding factors contained in the bill. Interim orders will provide a very useful short-term stopgap measure while the commission properly considers the application. The bill will provide factors for the commission to take into account in considering whether to make interim or final section 127 orders.</para><para>Senator Collins said that the effect of the bill would be that the consideration of the effect of a dispute on an employer would become paramount. Senator Buckland said that the government is hoping to stack the odds in favour of the employers. This is not the case.

He does not want to be reminded of the fact that there were 100,000 Australians without a job who were unable to feed their families because of the sort of industrial thuggery that Senator Campbell personally undertook whilst he was a trade union leader. Then, of course, the Labor Party rewards that sort of thuggery by making him a senator and putting him on the front bench.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We make no apology for the fact that we believe there are such things as illegal industrial activities, illegal strikes and illegal lockouts. That is why under section 127 an order can be sought by an employerâlet me make it very clearâan employee or even, as Senator Campbell will be very happy to hear, a union. What can be fairer than that? Certain ex-trade unionists in this place want everything to go in a particular direction. There is no inherent bias in the factors for the commission to consider when determining section 127 matters. They are factors that have previously arisen in section 127 cases and they are consistent with matters the commission already takes into account. Rather than restrict the commission's discretion, the bill will give the commission a clear additional option when considering section 127 applicationsâthat is, the option of making interim orders where the complexity of the case prevents a quick final decision. The bill emphasises the undesirability of unprotected action. The bill would reinforce the integrity of the agreement-making system. </para><para>Senator Collins said that the commission should be given power to settle disputes because that is what the commission was designed to do in 1904âsome 100 years ago. A workplace relations solution that was appropriate in 1904 is not necessarily appropriate in 2004. This government has delivered a modern and effective workplace relations system for the 21st century that emphasises the importance of agreement in the workplace. It was interesting to listen to Senator Nettle's contribution. She recognised that over the past eight years, during which this country has been under the stewardship of the Howard Liberal coalition government, industrial disputations have gone down.</para><para>Increasing the arbitral role of the commission would not be consistent with the system. Certified agreements already contain dispute resolution processes that suit the parties' situation. This should be the way that parties resolve their disputes. Parties can and often do choose to give the commission a key role in resolving the matter. In any event, resorting to industrial action is not appropriate. The commission has sufficient powers to deal with disputes consistent with a workplace relations framework that is focused on the direct negotiation of terms and conditions of employment by the parties involved, with as little third party intervention as possible. The government's proposed amendments to section 127 are consistent with this broad objective.</para><para>It is important to remember that this bill should not detract from the significant legal immunity granted to protected industrial action. Legitimate industrial action taken during the bargaining process will continue to be protected action. The measures will only affect industrial action that is taken outside the legitimate bargaining process. The bill does not explicitly apply to lockouts. Senator Campbell's argument, which we heard in his interjections, is that the government system causes lockouts. The bill does not specifically mention lockouts, that is true, but what this ex-trade unionist fails to tell the Australian people is that the bill does not specifically mention strikes either. Of course, that is where all the rhetoric of Senators Campbell and Nettle becomes unravelled. It sounds very good to ask, `Why don't you mention lockouts?' but the fact is that we do not mention strikes either. All we talk about is unprotected action, and that is why it applies equally to the employer and the employeeâand, of course, unions have a right to become involved in the process. The bill refers to industrial action and that means it will apply to all unprotected industrial action, whether unprotected strikes by employees or unprotected lockouts by employers. That is the case that needs to be made, given the misrepresentations made by Senators Nettle and Campbell earlier in this debate.</para><para>Earlier today I was walking in the corridors and came across my good friend and colleague Senator Rod Kemp, the Minister for the Arts and Sport. He provided me with a badge to recognise National Jockey Celebration Day, which is on 13 March. To those of them in Parliament House, I wish them well and all the best in their endeavours. It made me think of the trifecta, and I suppose it is every jockey's desire to win a few races. For those who put money on racesâand I am not one of them, I must confessâI understand that to win the trifecta is something pretty special. I think the Howard government have in fact won the trifecta in relation to employment in this country. We have reduced unemployment. More and more Australian men and women are in jobs because of our policies. Unlike the situation under the Hawke-Keating government, under the Howard government real wages have increased above and beyond the rate of inflation. We have done that in a low inflationary environment. To achieve those three factors, I think, is like winning the trifecta, because it is great for our economy, it is great for the mums and dads of Australia and it is great for social unity within Australia. What the Australian Labor Party and the extreme elements that are represented by the Australian Greens cannot understand, cannot comprehend or do not want to admit is that our sound economic policy has delivered this country a low inflationary environment where real wages have in fact increased and unemployment has come down to historically low levels. Indeed, if you were to win four races that would be a quadrella, I think, and we also have, in this total context, the lowest rate of industrial disputation since records were kept, beginning in the 1940s. </para><para>Those who assert that they look after the interests of workers are confronted with a government that actually does look after the interests of workers. Having been in government now for eight years, we have seen the unemployment rate come down, the industrial disputation rate come down, real wages increase and a low inflationary environment. That is the record of this government and we will continue to seek to reform the economic infrastructure of this country. We will seek to reform the industrial relations infrastructure of this country to ensure that these wonderful achievements continue to be built on. We are not happy that the unemployment rate is down to 5.6 per cent or thereabouts; we believe it should be driven down even further. So we want to achieve more for the workers of this country. We are not happy with the high inflation rates that the Labor Party presided over. We are not happy with the high unemployment rates that the Labor Party presided over. That is why we have taken the tough decisions in industrial relations and tax reformâyou name it. We have taken the tough decisions, but we have taken them in a fair and even-handed way, as is shown by this legislation. It does not refer to lockouts. It does not refer to strikes. It simply refers to unprotected industrial action, and of course that applies equally to the employer and employee side of the equation.</para><para>I understand the Australian Democrats may have an amendment to move in the committee stage, and we as a government are of a mind to support that.

There are three essential components to the bill. The first is the 48-hour provision, the second is that interim orders do apply and the third is that the commission should have regard to a set of determinations or a list of criteria in coming to its view on these matters. The Democrats have had a careful look at the evidence. I must say again, as I said yesterday, that we were extremely careful about interfering with what is a very key procedure in the Workplace Relations Act governing the way in which industrial action may take place. We note that section 127(3), which the government seeks to withdraw, reads as follows:</para><quote><para>The Commission must hear and determine an application for an order under this section as quickly as practicable.</para></quote><para>In the evidence, again as I said yesterday, the department stated that section 127 has generally proved to be an effective mechanism and the government recognises that the majority of section 127 applications are handled reasonably expeditiously but, from time to time, there are cases where delays occur. Our view is that those times where delays occur are probably good delays, not necessarily bad delays. They tend to be in the minority and they tend to be in circumstances where some delay is justified. So, because we are very sensitive to the way in which this provision is operating and because we think it is operating effectively, as the government has acknowledged in evidence, we are not persuaded to change it to the 48-hour approach.</para><para>The second area of concern is the question of criteria which the commission must have regard to in determining whether or not to make an interim order. We as the Senate at times agree to the criteria that courts, commissions or tribunals should have regard to in legislation and at other times we leave it to their discretion. In our view, this is one of the circumstances where we should leave it to the commission's discretion. There is good jurisprudence in this area, there is good case law and there is a great deal of experience. It is a developing area and we again suggest to the government that, whilst the commission should obviously have regard to the many items they have outlined and to others that we believe are relevant, it should be left relatively open ended.</para><para>We are then left with the nub of the government's proposition, which is that interim orders should be confirmed as being applicable under this section and as being desirable instruments. As you know, again from our discussion yesterday, we are of the opinion that the act does indirectly permit access to interim orders. We do think it is appropriate for there to be interim orders. We do think it is appropriate for there to be no doubt that you can have interim orders. In those circumstances we support that central proposition. Accordingly, our amendment is very simple. It wipes out the government's item 1 and replaces it with the words:</para><para>	(3A)	The Commission may make an interim order under this section.</para><para>	(3B)	An interim order made under subsection (3A) ceases to have effect if the application is determined.</para><para>This is straightforward procedural commonsense.

However, we are glad that the Australian Democrats see the benefits of interim orders which will help the commission deal with section 127 applications without the distraction of ongoing industrial action. The government's approach is that the Democrat amendment will substantially negate a number of important elements in the bill but, unlike some other parties in this place, we do not live in a fantasy world. We accept the practicalities and realities of the numbers in the Senate and we are of the view that any improvement to the workplace infrastructure of this nation is beneficial.</para></talk.start><para>I would classify this as an incremental step towards a position that we as a government would like to get to one day but, given the Democrat amendment, we as a government will at least get something. I suppose we have to be thankful for that, given the numbers in the Senate, so I will not bleat too loudly, Senator Murray. At least it will provide some assistance so that we can keep the wonderful environment in which we currently live. I simply add that the decrease in the unemployment rate, the increase in real wages, the sound inflation basis and the low level of industrial disputation that we have enjoyed over the past eight years have not happened by accident. They have happened by the sheer hard work and determination of this government to put in place the policy parameters on which the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Greens have opposed us each and every step of the way.</para><para>I take my hat off to the Democrats, although somewhat begrudgingly, because they do not always agree with us, but at least they are in the real world of politics and on occasions are willing to discuss these things with the government to see where the common ground is, as opposed to simply having opposition for opposition's sake. That is something we were promised would cease with the new Leader of the Opposition, but unfortunately it has not happened, especially when it comes to the area of workplace relations.

In fact, one thinks of Senator Abetz's trifecta when one considers this bill. The extent to which the government are prepared to relinquish what they are seeking to pursue in order to allow some matters to pass the Senate makes one ponder why we are exercising so much time on some of these bills. One obvious reason is that the government's lack of preparedness in their business agenda is bringing forward bills of lesser priority that have been sitting on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> for quite some time. The government have decided to progress what Senator Abetz referred to a moment ago as begrudging small changes that the Senate has allowed through. Senator Abetz may indeed get his trifecta, but the real content of them is very far from the government's real agenda. But let us deal with this bill as it stands. </para></talk.start><para>The stated aim of this bill is to amend section 299 of the Workplace Relations Act and to codify the contempt provisions as they apply to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, but there are already provisions in the Workplace Relations Act which, in conjunction with the common law, ensure that any contempt of the commission is an offence and is subject to penalties. This is in existing section 299. The former Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, the member for Warringah, Tony Abbott, acknowledged this when he said, `There is a law prohibiting contempt of the Industrial Relations Commission.' These were the member for Warringah's own words in an interview in a publication called <inline font-style="italic">Human Capital Australia</inline>, published in March last year. That the then minister could be acknowledging this but at the same time pursuing this type of legislation again makes one wonder about its worth.</para><para>In Labor's view the Senate should not pass unnecessary legislation that has been introduced merely to progress an ideological agenda. There is no demonstrated or practical need for this bill. In light of the lack of policy basis for this bill, it seems clear that the real aim of the bill is to find another avenue for the government to spout anti-union rhetoric, some of which we have been hearing yet again from the minister today. This is most evident in the provisions of this bill that would have the effect of jailing participants in industrial action. As was noted at the Senate inquiry, threatening to imprison people because of their industrial activity is hardly the path to a cooperative industrial relations system. In the minority report of that inquiry we make precisely that point. What is wrong with this bill is that it uses imprisonment as a primary remedy for the taking of industrial action. Anyone who has any conception about how these things should operate would understand that a primary remedy of imprisonment is hardly appropriate.</para><para>Let us look at the government's reasons for the bill. The stated reasons for this bill do not stand up to scrutiny. The explanatory memorandum suggests that we need this bill because of a 1987 Law Reform Commission report. However, the Law Reform Commission report did not recommend the introduction of the disobedience contempt that is proposed in this bill, and the contempt provisions in the industrial relations legislation in 1987 are not the same as the ones in section 299 today. They were substantially added to and changed in 1993 following the High Court case of Nationwide News v. Wills. For this government to prop up its case, it is going back to a 1987 Law Reform Commission report and takes no account of the changes that have occurred subsequently to deal with these issues.</para><para>Since the changes in 1993, no actionsâand I stress no actionsâhave been brought under section 299. Not one witness to the Senate's inquiry into this bill presented any evidence of the use of section 299. The only group that raised concerns about the operation of the current provisions was the Australian Industry Group. But the Australian Industry Group claims that there were delays in enforcing orders in the court which, even if valid, were not addressed by this bill. So it would be absurd for the government to suggest that actions have been brought and failed because of some problem with the current legislative provisions when in fact they are just not used at all. Instead there is one reason and one reason only for this bill: the consistent theme of the Prime Minister liking provocative, conflict-driven workplace relations bills. Even if there is not a problem that needs fixing, the government continues to bowl up legislation like this, which leads us to Senator Abetz's trifecta we have today. </para><para>The Prime Minister continues to use bills such as this one to pursue his anti-union zealotry. He proudly told the Business Council of Australia in October last year that one of his greatest achievements was the de-unionisation of Australia's work force. We are talking not about industrial disputation but about de-unionisation as his objective. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister must not realise that even in the face of anti-union legislation like this bill and many before it there are still 1.8 million proud union members in this country.</para><para>Bills such as this one and several others that have been debated in the chamber in past weeks, and will be debated this week and in future weeks by this government, are aimed squarely at reducing the bargaining rights of working Australians and the capacity of their unions to represent them. The point of difference here is that the government argues that it is implementing a bargaining system. Yet it continues to find way after way, means after means to tie workers' hands behind their backs when they need to bargain. This government, going back to 1996, has never acknowledged that there is an unequal bargaining relationship between worker and employer. The only area where the government seeks to address that relationship is where the worker, through the characteristics of the industry, the sector or the time in which they are operating, has a glimpse of the industrial power that can address the imbalance in the relationship between the worker and their employer. It is then that we get the government wanting specific measures for the maritime dispute. It is then that we get the government wanting specific measures for the construction industry. It is then that the government wants to intervene and interfere. But it does not interfere when it needs to deal with the fundamental issue of having an adequate and fair bargaining systemâthat is, to understand and acknowledge that there will be a power imbalance between the employer and the worker and that the system should deal with that.</para><para>Many provisions in these bills may not be needed and they may never become law, but the Prime Minister is insisting that they continue to be bowled up. Almost none of the government's workplace relations bills have passed the Senate and those that have have been severely modified to contain the agenda that this government keeps promoting. Why have these bills not passed the Senate? Because they are poorly conceived and poorly developed. For those very strong reasons we will continue to oppose such legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>20526</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak to the <inline ref="R1839">Workplace Relations Amendment (Codifying Contempt Offences) Bill 2003</inline>. According to the government, the aim of the bill is to modernise certain offences that relate to the proceedings of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, to enhance certainty about, and accessibility of, criminal law that operates to protect the integrity of the commission's proceedings. The Democrats strongly believe that the rule of law must apply in Australia. If the law is being flouted we support stronger law, but increased powers are only justified where there is sufficient evidence that a real and significant problem exists. I might say that if a law is being flouted it is often not necessary to introduce stronger laws; it is necessary to enforce existing laws with the right resources and the right inspectorates and the right regulators to do so. </para></talk.start><para>The government argues that this bill's codification of the general contempt provision implements the approach recommended by the Australian Law Reform Commission in its report on contempt. It argues that the recommendations included that `deemed contempt' provisions like the current section 299(1)(e) should be replaced with specific statutory offences that identify contemptuous conduct. However, in their submission to the Senate inquiry into this bill, the ACTU argued that there is no indication that section 299 has ever been intended to include failure to comply with a court order or undertaking given to a court, which is disobedience contempt. The ACTU argued that there was nothing in the Australian Law Reform Commission report way back then which gave support to creating additional offences relating to contempt where these are already the subject of a specific statutory offence.</para><para>The ACTU further argued that, while recommending that deeming provisions should be removed, the Law Reform Commission specifically recommended:</para><quote><para>No new offence covering false allegations of misconduct against tribunal or commission members for non-compliance with orders should be created unless there is a specific need for it to protect a particular tribunal or commission.</para></quote><para>The ACTU correctly noted that the inquiry did not have evidence that there was specific need for a new offence. What we have actually seen with this bill and the <inline ref="R1734">Workplace Relations Amendment (Compliance with Court and Tribunal Orders) Bill 2003</inline>, possibly to be discussed later this week, is evidence for an independent national workplace relations regulator, not new laws. What we have seen is a need for existing laws to be enforced.</para><para>Section 178 of the Workplace Relations Act, `Imposition and recovery of penalties', already provides for a general offence of failing to comply with the terms of an order. A number of people can sue for a penalty for a breach of an order of the commission. They are an inspector, a party to the order, an employer who is a member of an organisation and is affected by the breach, and an organisation or an officer or employee of an organisation that is affected by the breach. We all know that `organisation' means registered organisations under the act. Section 356 of the Workplace Relations Act provides that a monetary penalty imposed under the act may be paid into consolidated revenue or to a particular person or organisation. The court will often direct that the penalty it has imposed be paid to the applicant, with reference to the applicant's costs and expenses in bringing the proceedings.</para><para>However, I understand that two problems exist. The first is that it can be costly for an employer and the employer organisation to pursue such cases, especially given that fines are paid into consolidated revenue. Secondly, once disputes have been settled, employers are reluctant to pursue offenders for fear of creating disharmony and further disputes. I do not think that those fears should be lightly dismissed. Like the ACCC and ASIC, an independent national workplace relations regulator would be responsible for pursuing such breaches. The minister, in a press release on 19 December 2002, referred to a list of 22 breaches of industrial court ordersâincluding alleged breachesâsince 1999 by four unions. This amounts to approximately five or six breaches a year. I understand that three of those cases, through the use of section 178, actually resulted in significant pecuniary penalties. </para><para>I found the following extract from the Australian Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecution's prosecution policy interesting:</para><quote><para>Sir Hartley Shawcross QC, then Attorney-General, stated to the House of Commons [in the United Kingdom] on 29 January 1951:</para><para>âIt has never been the rule in this countryâI hope it never will beâthat suspected criminal offences must automatically be the subject of prosecution. Indeed the very first Regulations under which the Director of Public Prosecutions worked provided that he should ... prosecute `whenever it appears that the offence or the circumstances of its commission is or are of such a nature that a prosecution in respect thereof is required in the public interest.' That is still the dominant consideration.â</para><para>This statement is equally applicable to the position in Australia. The resources available for prosecution action are finite and should not be wasted pursuing inappropriate cases, a corollary of which is that the available resources are employed to pursue with some vigour those cases worthy of prosecution.</para></quote><para>Further, in Australian Paper Ltd v. Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia 1998, North J. in the Federal Court commented on the nature of the court's power to issue injunctions to restrain breaches of section 127. His Honour stated that, although a Federal Court injunction often operates to enforce a section 127 order, the power to issue such an injunction is an independent power with particular ramifications, and the court will not automatically issue such injunctions just because there has been a breach of a section 127 order. Breach of the court's order could result in a fine, sequestration or imprisonment, and it was important for the court to keep this in mind when considering whether to issue an injunction.</para><para>It seems that the government is trying to enforce an ideology of 100 per cent compliance that is just not supported by the tradition of common law, by the commission or by the courts. I should also note that the ideology of 100 per cent compliance on behalf of the government is, it seems, pursued primarily in terms of unions, not primarily in terms of employersâand I am referring to the construction industry specificallyâwhere we have seen little effort made to address what we are told is massive undercompliance with awards. Of course, it is hard to know or be sure of the scale of this noncompliance but, if we just look at some of the evidence presented by unions at the Senate inquiry into the building and construction industry of the millions of dollars that they have recovered in underpayment of wages, we can assume that noncompliance is occurring without penalty. This is an important point. Some of the position taking in the parliament is very much political and dedicated to achieving a particular political perception, but the general view is that this government is not union friendly and is very employer friendly. Whether that is accurate or not, the government needs to be aware of that perception and therefore needs to attend with as much rigour and vigour employer noncompliance as employee noncompliance. It is just a question of being balanced and even-handed.</para><para>I do not want to get too far off track. Clearly, section 178 of the Workplace Relations Act addresses the problem of breach of commission orders and could be enhanced by a national workplace relations regulator. In addition, it is critical to note that section 178 is a civil offence and that the proposed new provision in this bill would create a criminal offence resulting in 12 months imprisonment. It is important to point out that the commission orders not only are orders that can be enforced by courts but also can be fairly minor and deal with procedural and administrative matters. That has been a matter of concern in the committee deliberations. </para><para>With respect to the proposed new provision to make publishing a false allegation of misconduct affecting the commission a criminal offence, given the history of section 299 I have some doubts about its prospective usefulness. The <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> notes that section 299 was amended in 1993, in the predecessor act, following a finding that a previous paragraph, which made it an offence to use words `calculated to bring a member of the Commission or the Commission itself into disrepute', was invalid. That case was about whether the section covered too much, such as a genuine exercise of a right of criticism. I suspect the current provision would face a similar problem. For example, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, in their submission to the inquiry into this bill, have argued that maintaining confidence in the commission must be balanced with freedom of expression, public accountability and open justice. Those were very good opinions for them to put on the record. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry sought a qualification to the proposed amendment that a person `held a genuine belief that was based on reasonable grounds that misconduct has occurred'. I think we would find that anyone could argue that they held a `genuine belief' and therefore the provision would become redundant.</para><para>Of greatest concern for me was the fact that evidence presented at the inquiry found that section 299(1)(e) has never been used in prosecution. In fact, a search of the DPP database revealed no cases where action was brought under section 299. Further, there has been no evidence nor call from the AIRC that a new offence of disobeying an order is required. Of further concern is that the current section 299(l)(e) under discussion is based on the same provision then and now applying to tribunals under the Trade Practices Act 1974 and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975. The government has not seen fit to change the contempt provisions applying to these tribunals. I think that is an important point. Where governments take a view as to what needs to be changed, generally speaking they make those changes across the whole of government and not just in one particular area of law.</para><para>I note the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, in their submission to this bills inquiry, state that when the opportunity arises such provisions in other Commonwealth legislation will be drafted in a similar way to those being proposed in this bill. So perhaps the government is contemplating that avenue. Might I be so bold as to suggest that the government create the opportunities to amend all legislation and that, if the government were serious about redrafting the general contempt provisions to enhance certainty and accessibility of the criminal law to protect commission and tribunal proceedings, it would be simultaneously trying to amend all acts with this provision, based on a thorough review and the recommended wording which I think would be drafted by the Attorney-General's Department. </para><para>The Democrats would definitely feel more confident in supporting more specifically defined contempt provisions, if the process I suggested above were undertaken. At the moment it appears that the two new suggested provisions are there to deal with matters concerning the government with respect to industrial relations and union behaviour. For example, there is no new provision to deal with dishonest conduct, conspiracy to defraud and bribery of Commonwealth public officials, which are also contempt provisions under the Criminal Code.</para><para>Debate interrupted. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>20530</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Intelligence: Weapons of Mass Destruction</title><page.no>20530</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>20530</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is directed to Senator Hill, the Minister for Defence.

It was in a slightly different form but basically the same question was asked. The Australian government did not rely on self-defence in terms of the UN charter to justify joining the coalition of the willing. The Australian government relied on the terms of UN Security Council resolutions, which are the alternative way of legitimately participating in such an action. The Australian government relied upon the resolutions of the Security Council that indicated that Saddam Hussein had failed to disarm in terms of previous resolutions and therefore was in breach of those resolutions and, to paraphrase the expression, would suffer the consequences if he did not comply. So Senator Faulkner is making a fundamental error when he looks at the basis of the justification.</para></talk.start></continue><para>If the government had relied on self-defence and, in terms of Senator Faulkner's claim, taken pre-emptive action, then it would have had to show that there was sufficient immediacy.

The government is committed to building not only better roads but also a better land transport system through the implementation of what we have called the national land transport plan. It has been given the marketing title of AusLink but it is the national land transport plan. What it is designed to do is ensure that there is more investment in an enlarged national road network and that the national road network integrates with other crucial parts of transport infrastructure, including rail. This government has an unsurpassed record of improving rail freight and also building historic links such as the Adelaide to Darwin link, which has already taken off with great success. We have invested more money in rail. With AusLink, or the national land transport plan, what we want to do is build a better road network and integrate it with sea transport, at our ports, with our airports and of course with rail. I noticed last night, while listening to a speech in another place, that the shadow minister talked about the government allegedly backing away from funding the national highway. Could I reinforce to all Australians that this government, under the national land transport plan, will in fact be investing more heavily in not only the national highway but also an expanded national road network. We currently fund the national highway 100 per cent and, as most senators would know, we fund a range of other programsâRoads of National Importance, for example, where we share funding with state governments.</para></talk.start><para>What we want to do with the new national land transport plan is to get away from the buck-passing and the political game playing which goes on around this country day by day and to fund an expanded national highway network where the Commonwealth invests more heavily, but we also invite the states to share in that responsibility. With most of these roads, the states gain significant benefit from the improved investment, as does the Commonwealth from having a better integrated national plan. This will build enormous benefits for all Australians. It is a benefit for transport operators, which means that Australians, wherever they live, are going to get their goods delivered to them more quickly and more efficiently; it should also lower prices. It means that we can better integrate with the rest of the world so that when we are shipping product from our farms, from our regional areas and through our ports we can be more competitive. It ensures incredible benefits flowing from the free trade agreementâlet us hope that it gets through the Senate. It ensures that the goods that are coming from our primary producers that can go to the American market through the assistance of the FTA can get there on time and on budget.</para><para>The senator asked me about alternative policies. I would need to expand on that somewhat. If the senator were to deign to ask a supplementary question then I could focus on alternative policies but the important thing is that the coalition government has an integrated national land transport plan. What Mr Ferguson made clear in the other place last night was that he wanted to stick to the old way, with the Commonwealth only funding the national highwayânot expanding its horizons, just looking backwards. We want to look forward to a stronger Australia with better roads and better transport, a place which is safer for motorists and, of course, better integrated with other freight modes. We have put our money on the table to do that.

One of them was from Mr Ferguson last night when he said, `We will go back to the old way; we will just fund the national highway and we'll ignore all the roads of national importance.' I worry about the people in Bendigo, Ballarat, Geelong and Ipswich if that is, in fact, the approach of the opposition. We have seen the Labor Party in power in Victoria and their approach to roads. You have to be careful about any promise Labor makes on roads. Take Scoresby: Labor in power promised to build it and promised not to toll it. They were elected and what did they do? They put a toll on it and backed away from it. They have turned up their nose and pushed away $465 million worth of funding from the federal government. We keep our $465 million on the table in Scoresby.

It is an opportunity for further access to the largest market and economy in the world, and for Australia as a trade nation that has to be a very good outcome. The challenge now, of course, is to turn the opportunity into material benefit. That will be the challenge before the Australian business community.</para></talk.start><para>In terms of a government responsibility to provide that access, this government can be very proud of its achievements. It can look to the new opportunities that it has provided through a free trade arrangement with Singapore, the new opportunities through a free trade arrangement with Thailand and now huge new opportunities through this agreement with the United States. What was the alternative of Labor? `Multilateral or nothing' was the cry of Labor and they are still saying it. Senator Cook, from the back bench now, continues to say it. He is the last adherent of putting all the eggs in the one basket. `Multilateral: take the benefits on the global scene or do not take any benefit at all.' </para><para>This government has a different approach. It wants to take the benefits of both methodologies. If we can get increased access through the multilateral round, we will do so; if we can do it bilaterally, we will do that as well. I know it is a harder task and it is more work, but Mr Vaile has been prepared to take up that challenge and has achieved a very fine outcome for Australia. The responsibility now, I would respectfully suggest, is for the parliament to as quickly as possible pass the enabling legislation, enable the agreement to be brought into effect as quickly as possible and get the benefits and opportunities flowing to Australian business.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>20533</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMr President, I ask a supplementary question.

The world price for sugar is now below the cost of production for many in the industry. Substantial domestic reform is therefore needed if the industry is to make the necessary productivity improvements to return to profitability.

I know that the Prime Minister has, and he has also discussed this with Mr Beattie.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I am encouraged by yesterday's announcement in Queensland that an agreement has been reached between the Queensland government, the Canegrowers organisation and the Australian Sugar Milling Council committing to comprehensive reform and restructure. The Australian government does recognise the difficulties facing the sugar industry, and the Prime Minister has on many occasions indicated his willingness to provide further assistance on the condition that the industry commits to significant restructuring. Cabinet yesterday discussed this matter, and we have decided that we will give it further consideration following discussions with the industry and with the Queensland government in the period ahead.</para><para>In the meantime, the government wants to help those in the most genuine need. The Prime Minister was pleased to announce today that the Australian government will provide up to $21 million in income support to sugar cane growers and harvesters experiencing financial hardship. From today the assistance will be available for 12 months and will help ease the financial position of those hardest hit by the current situation. Assistance will be paid at rates equivalent to the Newstart allowance. Cane growers or harvesters interested in applying for assistance can collect Centrelink forms from today to register their intent to claim. Eligible recipients will receive payments backdated to today. A further $5.6 million will be available for business planning support, so that growers who qualify to receive income support will also receive business planning support.</para><para>Senator Brandis, as I highlighted earlier, asked about alternative policies. I have mentioned a policy from Mr Lindsay Tanner, who does not want to give the growers anything. Then there is Mr Mark Latham, who went to Cairns in the company of Senator McLucas. He decided that the cane growers do need support and he will be supporting the government. What is the difference between those two policies? They both come from frontbench members of the Australian Labor Party. It clearly demonstrates that the Australian Labor Party will say something to the CPSUâMr Tanner talking to Senator Mackay's matesâwhen it suits them for that area but when Mr Latham goes up into the bush amongst the cane growers it has a completely different policy.

The inquiry that was recommended by the committee was one to be led by a formerâI think the words wereâ`senior intelligence officer' to look at the institutions themselves, and it would normally be the responsibility of government therefore to select such a person to carry out that task. But now if as an afterthought the Labor Party is suggesting that it wants to in a bipartisan way share in this executive responsibility, I will pass that suggestion to the Prime Minister for his consideration.</para></talk.start></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>20535</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMr President, I ask a supplementary question, since that was a short answer.

We have no embarrassment whatsoever about trying to ensure that the government, sensibly and prudently, could facilitate the development of this project on Christmas Island. We welcome and acknowledge the efforts of APSC as a company prepared to take risks and engage with the Russians to acquire the relevant rockets to pursue a space project on Christmas Island which would be very good not only for the economy of that particular territory but also for Australia. It has been one of the lost opportunities for Australia to engage in the space industry.</para></talk.start><para>It is a very difficult industryâthere is no doubt about thatâand APSC has constantly acknowledged the difficulties it has had in raising the requisite finance to ensure that it can proceed with this project. The government, through the industry department, did put in place very significant and stringent milestones before any resources were expended on this. The commitment by the government was very much on the basis of multi-user infrastructure on the island in the case of roads and things like that and upgrading the airport. No direct grants were proposed straight to the company or anything of that sort. My understanding is that very little of the total package has been spent because those milestones have not been achieved. Financial closure was the critical threshold requirement before any expenditure by the government on the multi-user infrastructure or upgrading of facilities on Christmas Island would be undertaken, and financial closure has not yet been completed. </para><para>I am advised, by virtue of this Industry brief, that a notification of the filing of an application for a wind-up order relating to APSC has been lodged with ASIC under the Corporations Act.

From her gesticulations to me I think she is asking: how much of that has actually got there? I do not have the figures in front of me. I suspect that by this time it is probably not a lot, because a lot of work has to be done to go to those particular areas where we wanted the environmental flows to make a difference.

We wanted to make sure that the five or six listed sites did get sufficient water to ensure that they were able to operate and regenerate.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Lees will recall that the Howard government has committed some $200 million to address the issues of overallocation of the water in the basin and the states between them have committed an additional $300 million.

So, Senator Lees, whilst you on that sideâalone, I suspectâunderstand the importance of the Murray-Darling Basin, regrettably, the Labor Party have so little interest in the Murray-Darling Basin and the environmental flows there that they have promised a commitment of $50 million less than the Howard government has already committed.</para><para>Senator Lees will know that the states are actually responsible for specific water resources in the Murray-Darling Basin. The states in the basin are committed to the cap and have agreed to implement the Living Murray initiative. I would hope that all those particular initiativesâin fact, the best science we have indicates that it is more than a hopeâwill deliver environmental outcomes back into the Murray-Darling Basin in the future. It is going to be long, it is going to be hard and it is going to be a very complex operation, but we will get the health back into the Murray-Darling system and we will do it in a way that does not destroying families, businesses and lives. </para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>20539</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Senator Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>APA</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMr President, I ask a supplementary question.

The cost of premiums and the availability of public liability and professional indemnity insurance is an issue of great concern to the government. Last Friday I hosted the seventh ministerial meeting on insurance issues in Hobart. These meetings include representatives of state, territory and local governments and have of course resulted in significant reforms being undertaken by all jurisdictions over the last two years to help ease the insurance crisis in Australia and to stabilise and reduce premiums. The most recent ACCC monitoring report on insurance premiums did show a significant slowing of premium increases in large part due to the negligence law reforms that have been implemented. At the meeting last Friday the Australian government was urged to press ahead with amendments to the Trade Practices Act to support state and territory reforms. The Australian government is keen to do that but its attempts have been stymied on two occasions by the senators opposite, who have opposed the reforms. The government's amendments to the Trade Practices Act are based on the expert recommendations of the Ipp report, they have the unanimous support of Labor state and territory governments, the support of industry groups, the support of the Insurance Council of Australia, community groups, businesses and all professionals struggling with higher premiums.</para></talk.start><para>In fact, the New South Wales Treasurer, Mr Egan, in point has described the opposition to these reforms as the `biggest obstacle to negligence law reform'. The use of the Trade Practices Act as an alternative to recovering for personal injuries is very real. Cases are now coming to light where a claim is too small to succeed at state level but can still be brought under the Trade Practices Act. While this loophole remains open, claims costs will not come down and these reforms will remain incomplete.</para><para>Mr Latham has said that he will put the national interest ahead of political interest. This is exactly what he should do here. Mr Latham should speak to his Labor colleague Mr Adams, the member for Lyons, for instance, who has written about the difficulties the premium rises in public liability are causing in his communities in Tasmania. I have the letter here. He says:</para><quote><para>I believe this is something that should be above politics and should be dealt with in order to find insurance that covers community activities before all community organisations are forced to disband.</para></quote><para>Mr Latham should listen to the Kempsey Country Music Club in New South Wales, who raise funds for charities and community groups. They now write:</para><quote><para>We feel that if the insurance rises much higher we will be forced to disband. If this happens we can no longer assist groups with donations.</para></quote><para>Mr Latham should also heed the calls from doctors, particularly doctors in rural communities. I have a letter from one faced with dramatically increased insurance premiums who is pleading for some balance to return to the system. One doctor has indicated that she will leave general practice because of premiums. She says: </para><quote><para>There is no longer such a thing as bad luck or an accident. Someone must be held accountable for every subzero outcome that happens in this world. We are turning Australians into a race that lacks responsibility.</para></quote><para>The people who lack responsibility are those sitting opposite, who oppose these sensible reforms. They are out of step with every expert opinion; they are out of step with their own colleagues in the state. Mr Latham now has an opportunity to put populism aside and do something that actually supports the national interest. Talk is cheap. Leadership is much more difficult.

You do not want to come out and say that would be your policy, but that is where it is going. Senator, I made it very clear to you: I do not have a copy of the advice that ATSIC sought, which is referred to in the paper. I do not have that. If ATSIC chooses to give that to me or to make it public then I think we can have a sensible debate about it. But, without it being made public, without us having the opportunity to have a sensible debate about it, I have nothing to say about it. All I can say to you is that the government received advice, which was not hastily sought yesterday. I asked for the advice that was available in the department.

In the past 20 years, on at least three occasions Australian governments have had discussions with US governments. In 1985 the US government approached the Hawke government to talk about a free trade agreement and it was decided that it was not in Australia's interests then. George Bush Sr announced in his campaign speeches that he would pursue bilateral deals, including with Australia. In the event, he pushed ahead with the Uruguay Round and NAFTA. So George Bush Sr offered us a deal. And again in 1999 the Clinton administration raised the possibility of a trade deal with the Howard government. So let us stop with this pretence that is a once-in-a-lifetime unique opportunity and that only the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, could get a deal out of the US for us. Let us just put it away and start looking at the facts. When we finally get the text releasedâhopefully today or overnightâwe can put that to bed. On all of the previous occasions Australia did not proceed with the US FTA because it was not considered to be maximising Australia's opportunity.

A former Labor ministerial adviser, he said:</para><quote><para>... the impact of this FTA will be historic.</para></quote><para>...	...	...</para><quote><para>At first glance, it's about expanding trade and investment with the US.

He is a man who has developed particular expertise in trade issues and, as I said, was a senior adviser to a previous Labor government. Of course, it is not only Alan Oxley who has spoken favourably about this free trade agreement. The deputy chief executive of the Australian Industry Group, Heather Ridout, described the free trade agreement as a good deal. She said:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>In terms of automotives, our utes will be able to go in there and be relieved of the 25 per cent tariff duty ...</para></quote><para>I ask Senator Cook, who was wailing about the free trade agreement a few moments ago, to go to Elizabeth.

Again, tell them that it is a bad deal for Australia. Tell grain producers that it is a bad deal for Australia. Tell sheepmeat and lamb producers that it is a bad deal. Every one of those groups will derive enormous benefits from the free trade agreement. Over 97 per cent of Australia's exports to the United Statesâwhich, it is worth noting, were worth $5.84 billion last yearâwill be duty free from day one of this agreement. As I said, that includes lamb and sheepmeat, where, in most cases, tariffs will be reduced to zero immediately and completely abolished within four years. The situation will be the same for wine producers. There is already a $1 billion market in America for Australian wine. The tariffs there will be reduced over an 11-year period. There will be no tariffs on cereal, flour mixes and wheat. Seafood, which is currently worth $140 million, will immediately become tariff free. That includes the removal of a 35 per cent tariff on canned tuna, giving Australian tuna producers access to a $650 million a year US market.</para></talk.start></continue><para>All of those groups are beneficiaries of this remarkable deal. It certainly was not a cave-in on the part of the Australian government, as the Labor senators have suggested. Indeed, it was quite the contrary. This was probably the one window of opportunity in Australia's history to successfully negotiate a free trade agreement with the United States. The governments and leaders on both sides of the Pacific were determined, because of the close relationship that they have had and the continuing close relationship between our two countries, to ensure that this was the year that this deal was achieved, to the benefit of both countries but in particular to the benefit of Australia. It is important to note that in the context of that deal our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is entirely protected and our single desk arrangements for particular agricultural commoditiesâmost notably wheat, rice, barley and sugarâare not detrimentally affected by this agreement. Again, the Australian government stood up for those producers in ensuring that those single desk arrangements were retained. We stood up for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme by ensuring that that was not affected by this agreement. That gives the lie to the negative claims made by Labor senators in this debate.

It is an agreement that has not yet been released and it really beggars belief that the government senators are able so confidently to say what is in the national interest. What is happening is that they are confusing their political interest with the national interest, and we on this side of the chamber will not do that. Labor's position is simple and clear. We will analyse the agreement and make a considered determination on whether or not this proposed free trade agreement is in the Australian national interest.</para></talk.start><para>Government senators seem to be relying on an initial study done at the height of the free trade agreement negotiations that indicated that a full and free trade agreementâone that provided absolutely free and total and immediate access to all markets both waysâmay deliver up to an extra $4 billion a year for the Australian economy. Of course, when that study was undertaken the Australian dollar was worth around 50-odd US cents, and that has changed considerably since then.</para><para>We have seen how quickly the government realised that they had oversold the benefits of this agreement, because we did not get anything like full and immediate free access to both markets. The author of the report, Dr Andy Stoeckel, said on ABC radio on 11 February:</para><quote><para>There is a whole series of unders and overs that you have to look at and recalculate to get any sensible number on that U.S. agreement. We really should get away from that estimate.</para></quote><para>He was referring to the estimate of $US4 billion. Even further, a significant proportion of the $US4 billion came from the elimination of the Foreign Investment Review Board, the abolition of restrictions on new investment in Telstra and Qantas, and the abolition of the four-pillars policy of our banking systemâthat did not occur. And 25 per cent of that $4 billion was derived from free access to sugar, and we all know that sugar was not included in the US free trade agreement.</para><para>The government is really just resorting to the spin that the deal will generate big bucks. That is the best they can come up with: big bucks. That is a nonsense. It is a nonsense for them to get up here and propose that the Senate should consider passing enabling legislation without even having seen the agreement and without even having any real understanding of what the impacts of this agreement will be on this country. </para><para>We even see Mr Vaile now backing away from his earlier claims about the size of the benefits to this country. At the Press Club on 12 February Mr Vaile said:</para><quote><para>I'll put my hand up and maybe we, as a government, did that, maybe industry themselves in selling it to constituent members; that this was a good thing to pursue; maybe it was oversold.</para></quote><para>Indeed this has been oversold but the government, rather than actually considering the benefits when they have seen the agreement, continue to want to push the agenda because they have been seduced by the notion of `free'. This government thinks that they are getting something for nothing, and without even reading the agreement they will tell us that a free trade agreement, which this is not, is going to be good for us. It is possible that at the end of the day the agreement could produce winners all around, but until we see the agreement we cannot determine that.</para><para>I just want to go to something that I consider very important. Being a senator from Victoria, where the manufacturing base of this country is located, I would like to go to what the Office of the United States Trade Representative say in their public information when they refer to the manufacturing industry. Their document, `An FTA for America's manufacturing sector', says:</para><quote><para>More than 99 percent of U.S. manufactured exports to Australia will become duty-free immediately upon entry into force of the Agreement. This is the most significant immediate reduction of industrial tariffs ever achieved in a U.S. FTA, and will provide benefits for America's manufacturing workers and companies; U.S. manufacturers estimate that the elimination of tariffs could result in $2 billion per year in increased U.S. exports of manufactured goods.</para></quote><para>That is $US2 billion in extra exports into this country.

This package has been sold on the basis of assisting Catholic schools, and nobody would argue with that, but I think we in this place deserve an answer to the question of how the government guarantees that, because as we know the SES model has delivered the best returnsâthe biggest increasesâto schools that could not be said to be the neediest: the non-Catholic non-government schools that have a very high level of resources available to them.</para><para>The Catholic sector would receive $360 million extra over the next four years. As I said, that seems worth while and logical, but the Democrats have criticised the fact that the Catholic system was outside the SES model when it was introduced. It is the case that even under that previous modelâthat is, the ERI modelâwhen there was a changeover to the SES funding model, the Catholic system received increases. It was based on the notional funding of all schools in the old ERI category 11âthat is, the second highest level of funding. The 600,000 children educated in Catholic schools represent 60 per cent of the total non-government school population or thereabouts, so for them to be not part of this new system was obviously an ongoing thorn in the government's argument that the model was the best method of determining need. </para><para>A high proportion of schools in the non-Catholic sector did not have that model applied to them either. That was because, if they had had the model applied, they would be receiving less than they already were. They were the schools that became known as the `funding maintained' schools. Now we discover in this new announcement that 60 per cent of Catholic schools will also be in this category; in other words, if the funding model were applied to them they would end up with less money than they currently have. So there are still probably more schools that are outside this model than are in it, in effect. I remind the Senate that under the SES model the poorest schools received a 30 per cent increase in funds whereas, for instance, schools like Haileybury received 290 per cent of their funding and Trinity Grammar received 250 per cent. These are some of the schools that charge very high fees indeedâ$15,000 or more is not unusual. Yet, as we knowâthis is why the SES is an anomalous formulaâthe SES has delivered them increases. This is because the assessment of need has been made based on the income from neighbourhoods within which those students live, and very often they will be in the higher income category of people within that area. Neighbourhood is not necessarily a measure of wealth, and it is certainly not a measure of the income which is available to non-government schools. I think it is time that the government answered some very important questions.</para><para>I must say that I am amazed that when Minister Vanstone came in here she had no idea about this subject, given the Prime Minister's announcement on the weekend. It has not been without some controversy; it has certainly been reported in the press many times and I am surprised that she was not expecting a question which would go to this central question of whether or not we are looking at needs funding or some other model. We need to know what is the baseline for determining which schools are `funding maintained'. For instance, do we go back to the level they were at under the old ERI system? Do we go back to the category 11 system for all schools? It is very hard to know what the government has negotiated with the Catholic sector. As with so much of the funding that has gone to non-government schools, there are real question marks in terms of accountability, particularly accountability about whether this is going to needs based schools or not. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><petition.group><petition.groupinfo><title>PETITIONS</title><page.no>20551</page.no></petition.groupinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1</name.id><name role="metadata">The Clerk</name><name role="display">The Clerk</name></talker><para>âPetitions have been lodged for presentation as follows:</para></talk.start></interjection><petition><petitioninfo><title>Immigration: Asylum Seekers</title><page.no>20551</page.no><no.signed>40</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>WH4</name.id></name.ids><names><name>Senator McGauran</name></names></petitioninfo><para>To the Honourable the President and the Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</para><para>Whereas the 1998 Synod of the Anglican Diocese of Melbourne carried without dissent the following motion:</para><para>`That this Synod regrets the Government's adoption of procedures for certain people seeking political asylum in Australia which exclude them from all public income support while withholding permission to work, thereby creating a group of beggars dependent on the Churches and charities for food and the necessities of life;</para><para>and calls upon the Federal government to review such procedures immediately and remove all practices which are manifestly inhumane and in some cases in contravention of our national obligations as a signatory of the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.'</para><para>We, therefore, the individual, undersigned attendees at All Souls' Anglican Church, Sandringham Victoria 3191; The âSunday at 6â forum at St Andrews Anglican Church, Somerville Victoria 3912,; and St John's Angilacan Church, Upper Beaconsfield Victoria 3808 petition the Senate in support of the above mentioned Motion. </para><para>AND we, as in duty bound will ever pray.</para><presenter><no.signed>40</no.signed><talk.start><talker><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name><name.id>WH4</name.id></talker><para>Senator McGauran (from 40 citizens).</para></talk.start></presenter></petition><petition><petitioninfo><title>Medicare: Bulk-Billing</title><page.no>20552</page.no><no.signed>50</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>84L</name.id></name.ids><names><name>Senator McLucas</name></names></petitioninfo><para>To the Honourable the President and Senators in Parliament assembled:</para><para>The petition of the undersigned shows that we reject the Howard Government's proposed changes to Medicare.

the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Bartlett, and pursuant to contingent notice, I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Bartlett moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion no. 776.</para></motion><para>I have put this motion not to be smart but because it is something we feel strongly about. We felt that the recent changes to parliamentary superannuation agreed by the government, following a change of position by the opposition, made this an apposite opportunity for this matter to be addressed. For well over a decade, the Democrats, a few Independents and a number of members of the major parties have recognised the need for, and have indeed called for, parliamentarians' superannuation to more closely match community standards. The life gold pass is another anachronism whose time is up. All that my motion does is to ask the government to review it, although of course it does have a little bit of gratuitous politics in it as well.</para><para>The life gold pass is a taxpayer funded free air and rail travel perk for qualifying retired parliamentarians and their spouses costing, at the last time it was evaluated, up to $2 million a year. Apart from retired members of some private sector air or rail corporations and federal and some state politicians, retirement travel benefit schemes are non-existent in the Australian community. The Australian National Audit Office told a Senate inquiry that entitlements similar to the life gold pass retirement travel benefits had never been available to public servants either past or present. They confirmed that retirement benefits for bureaucrats were composed solely of superannuation. The Department of Finance and Administration told the committee that it understood that life gold pass entitlements were ahead of the field with regard to retirement benefits available for members of parliament internationally.</para><para>Some submitters to the Senate committee, including the Association of Former Members of Parliament, argued that retirement travel benefits are legitimate compensation for the lower rates of salary that sitting members receive while in office and for the difficulties and stresses associated with being a member of parliament. I do not agree that rates of salary are too low now and, if they were low in the past, the proposition we have put to the parliament and to the government is that this measure be prospective, not retrospective. Even if the argument about low pay were true for some ministerial posts, and many backbenchers are not paid badly for the work they do, instead of providing for compensation after their service, members of parliament should be paid an appropriate salary for the work they do while in office. Except for transitional arrangements on leaving office, retirement benefits should be confined to superannuation at levels in accordance with community standards. </para><para>Former parliamentarians who wish to continue to provide public service or to perform official duties, if part of the functions of government, should be funded as such and not slip through via a parliamentary perks regime. The argument that the continuation of these retirement travel benefits is necessary to fund pro bono community or charity work is self-serving. Why is it acceptable for a former parliamentarian or spouse to select his or her own worthy cause on unknown criteria to be funded at public cost? Either the organisations themselves must fund such travel or government must decide in the public interest to make grants to charities for such services.</para><para>One of the good principles followed by both this coalition government and the previous Labor government is that hidden subsidies should be transparent. There should be, in our view, one exception: former prime ministers do have justifiable official engagements post retirement, and continued travel entitlements for them are appropriate. Their expenses, however, should be funded as an executive cost and not as a parliamentarian's benefit.</para><para>There are, essentially, three categories of entitlements afforded to members and senators. These are their salary package, what they need to do their job and their retirement package. The first includes matters such as salary and fringe benefits, car and other benefits. The second includes electorate allowances, office expenses and staff allocations. The third includes superannuation and retirement and travel benefits, including entitlements available under the life gold pass. Great improvements have been made in accountability measures to better audit, control and manage what parliamentarians use and need to do their jobs. Now the long and justified public attack on excessively generous retirement benefits is at last bearing fruit, and we think that the life gold pass should be added to the redundancy list.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>20559</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI listened with interest to Senator Murray's speech. He has indicated to the Senateâand I am pleased to hear itâthat he has put this proposal up, to use his words, `not to be smart'. He then went on to tell us that the motion does ask the government to review the life gold pass, which in part it does. Then Senator Murray said that it contains some gratuitous politics as well. When I see the gratuitous politics I realise that Senator Murray really is not serious about this at all. I do not think these sorts of issues are appropriate for half smart general business notices of motion. That is my view. I do not think they are appropriate for that sort of political approach. I would commend a more thorough and professional approach to dealing with these sorts of issues. On more than the odd occasion Senator Murray has applied a different approach to these entitlements issues, which are always difficult for parliamentarians to grapple with, no matter which side of the chamber they come from. That is one of the reasons that I have consistently and repeatedly argued, as every senator in this chamber knows, that these issues of parliamentarians' entitlements are best left out of the hands of the politicians. This motion we have before us at the moment tends to support that argument.</para></talk.start><para>I know that there has been a lot of community concern in recent years about the entitlements of parliamentarians. There has been a particular concern, of course, about politicians' superannuation arrangements. The Labor Party have consistently acknowledged that concern. I think any fair person would acknowledge that the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Latham, has acted upon that concern in recent times. Is this the appropriate way to deal with this sort of issueâin this piecemeal fashion, through this half smart notice of motion? What we have got at the moment is an arms-length, independent tribunal which is responsible for scrutinising, deliberating on and determining a range of entitlements. That is the Remuneration Tribunal. I do accept that the question of this particular entitlement, the gold pass, needs to be considered in the context of the entire remuneration package of parliamentarians. I do accept that point; it is a valid point. </para><para>We have certainly made it clear, in relation to Labor's proposal on superannuation reforms for parliamentariansâand not only parliamentarians but also judges and the Governor-Generalâthat those schemes should be closed for future entrants. Of course eventually under our policy, when we all die out, the schemes are going to have no members at all. But the issue of other entitlements is important as well. It is important to bring entitlements into line with community standards. That is an important principle. Ensuring a reasonable mix of salary entitlements which reflect the proper working conditions of the parliamentary vocation is a real challenge for all concerned. But let us treat it seriously. Let us deal with this seriously. It will be misunderstood, I think, if this chamber votes for or against this particular motion. It deserves and warrants a more serious motion. It deserves and warrants a debate which does not include the gratuitous politics, and I commend that approach. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>20560</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Manager of Government Business in the Senate</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWe will not be supporting Senator Murray's motion to suspend standing orders. I support most of the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. My own perception is that there are two issues. Firstly, when politicians start debating and making decisions about their own remuneration and non-salary benefitsâand perhaps <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> could render that word in parentheses because most people travel a long way to get to this place, and I do not really think you could regard travel as a benefit; in fact it is probably a negative on both your health and your wellbeingâa very cynical public become even more cynical. It is very hard to get good policy emerging from those who have, by the nature of their position, a clear interest and therefore a potential conflict of interest in determining those issues. This government has indeed already reviewed and revised the approach to the life gold pass. It was in fact this government that restricted the use of the life gold pass. The truth about why that happened is that some former membersâand you could probably count them on the three fingers of your left handâabused it.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>âFour fingers, was it, Senator Murray. I forget who those characters were and it does not matter. The important point to make here as we discuss the suspension motion is that, if you have the time and inclination to go through the tabled documents which reveal all of the travel of retired members and prime ministers and senators with the life gold pass, you quickly see that most retired members never use the pass at all. Those who do use it would only use it very infrequentlyâsometimes once a year. Of course, some of the former prime ministers use it a bit more often. I think that is a special benefit for prime ministers, and I do not even know whether it is called a gold passâI think they get it anyway. But the reality is that 99 per cent or thereabouts of retired members and senators use it very sparingly; only a few use it more often. Those people who have abused it in the past have brought the whole scheme into disrepute in the public mind, and that is easy to do. That point needs to be made. With those remarks, I indicate that the coalition will vote against this motion. </para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>20561</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Greens support the motion. You have to only look at the Constitution, section 48, to see that a lot of points that Senator Faulkner and then Senator Campbell put forward do not in fact have a leg to stand on.

Of course, over the last hundred years that is what has happened. Processes were in place, when this came under scrutiny and criticism, for putting it at arm's length through independent tribunals and so on. But none of us can say anything other than we are the ultimate arbiters of what the terms and conditions and the payment and remunerationâboth while we are in office and after we have left itâwill be, and we are totally responsible for it.</para><para>I for one do not want to be responsible for the gold pass system which provides travel expenses at the taxpayers' expense that now come to more than $1 million a year. We do know that these are not equally used by members who have retired; some use them a great deal and others use them very little at all. I think that the very generous retirement benefits that parliamentarians get should cover it. I am very aware that my fellow Green in the House of Representatives, Michael Organ, the member for Cunningham, has introduced legislation to do what Senator Murray's motion would do here in the Senateâthat is, to get rid of the life gold pass system. I think we should be agreeing that it should go. </para><para>As far as this being a situation in which it is half smart for Senator Murray to bring this inânot at all. Nor do I think it was half smart for the Leader of the Opposition to raise the matter of parliamentary superannuation outside this parliamentary arena for public debate. It led to the cascading effect whereby the Prime Minister very quickly followed suitâwithin two days, as I rememberâand that system is being drawn right in now. That was not half smart. That was responding to public concern. I think that is what Senator Murray's motion does and that is what Mr Organ's bill does in the other place. </para><para>I think we should debate this matter. I know the opposition has a policy which, in the main, has said that if we bring up matters of international significance there should not simply be a vote on them; there should be a debate. The process today of denying formality on this motion has put this particular issue of parliamentarians' entitlements after retirement in the same category. Why on earth should we not be debating this? It is our constitutional responsibility to do so. Of course we should be debating it. If there is a better motion or a more seemly way of putting it than the way Senator Murray has presented it, where is it from the opposition?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>âBut, Senator Faulkner, there have been years of opportunity to address this matter and the opposition has not done so. It is a bit too cute then, when somebody from the crossbench does move a motion of this variety, to say, `Wrong process.' What is the right process? The right process is for it to be brought in and debated here. I congratulate Senator Murray. I congratulate Michael Organ, and also Mr Andren, who has supported the bill in the other place. It must be dealt with. We should be dealing with it.

I thought that was most apt, because what this debate is really about is: should we debate this issue now? Not the principles of the issue but: should we debate it now or should it go onto the normal general business list? That is what is at stake, and not one speaker has addressed that today. The fact is that this will go on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>. If you want to give up your general business time when your turn comes around then by all means move it on that occasion. But we are not willing to carry a motion like this without the proper debate surrounding it so that we can put our point of view. We are not going to have it declared formal and we are not going to waste the rest of the day simply because minority parties can always rely on a bit of cheap-stunt publicity if they mention an emolument going to a member of parliament. It is a certain winner. I would love to be as certain of backing the Melbourne Cup winner as Senator Murray can be of getting a bit of cheap publicity out of this.</para></talk.start><para>Of course, you do not have to take the gold pass, Senator Murray. Only one Democrat has ever qualified for it, and the reason I had to alter the scheme in 1988 was because he and two others were abusing it. They were using it to get on the speakers circuit, where they were paid. In fact, they used to get extra money for that because the person sponsoring them did not have to pay their airfares.</para><para>So where there is abuse it should be cut down. The fact is, ironically, that the gold pass is being used less now than it was 10 years go. The cost every year is now going down in real terms rather than going up. Senator Murray himself has said that it was part of the original salary package. So if you want to review it in any particular wayâand I am talking out of self-interest here; I will put it straight on the tableâit will have to be grandfathered into the future because it was always part of the package. The appropriate body to review this is, I think, the Remuneration Tribunal. It is appropriate for Senator Murray to put his submission to the Remuneration Tribunal and get their response. What I would like to at least say is that every time you cut back on some benefit, some remuneration, for parliamentarians you might expect the general public to give you some brownie points for it. Never. All they do is move on to the next territorial demand. We do not always do things to get creditâI admit thatâbut you will never get their support. Most of my constituents would like me to walk to Canberra with a cut lunch and a thermos of tea. That would suit them.

He can set the example and so can all his colleagues. Funnily enough, I usually sit next to him or behind him. I do not sit in front of him, generally. Why don't you get out there and set the example? Why don't you cut back on the amount of staffing you have? I think that would be a terrible ideaâbut set the example. Don't just pick out one benefit that only one Democrat has ever qualified for in their 27 years in this parliament, because that is basically what you have done. We did debate these issues last year. Senator Abetz brought in changes and we had a full debate then, so you cannot say we never debate these issues. If you want to bring it up in general business, bring it up. </para></talk.start></continue><para>But I congratulate Senator Murray; he is on an absolute winner. Anyone who is as stupid as I am to get up and say, `Maybe I would contemplate that there is some merit in the gold pass,' just gets scarified in the media. I do not really care. I have nothing to lose in politics per se. I am willing to get up and say that the gold pass has been part of the salary package. Whether it was right or wrong at the time, other salary levels, other emoluments, were reduced because of it. It was part of the balance, and I believe it should continue into the future until the salary package is changed. The same thing applies to superannuation. It may well be that the salary of some parliamentarians will be adjusted because they no longer have a generous superannuation scheme. Not for me; I have a generous one. Anyway, congratulations to Senator Murray for another good, opportunistic move: you put this down in the Senate and you get a bit of publicity.

The Committee of Privileges was required to investigate whether there was any attempt improperly to interfere with a witness before the RRAT committee and whether any contempt of the Senate was committed in that regard.</para><para>The facts of the matter are briefly as follows. Mr Alix Turner, a wool grower, made a submission to the RRAT committee in which he made certain remarks about Mr Colin Dorber, the inaugural CEO of Australian Wool Innovation. When Mr Dorber gave evidence before the committee on 26 June 2003 he had not yet seen Mr Turner's submission. But two days later he rang Mr Turner at home on a Saturday evening and invited Mr Turner to repeat his remarks without the benefit of parliamentary privilege. Mr Dorber also apparently indicated that he would be campaigning for a reduction in the levy paid by wool growers to support the research and development activities of AWI, thus, in Mr Turner's view, threatening the demise of AWI.</para><para>The following week, Mr Turner brought the RRAT committee's attention to this telephone conversation by way of a supplementary submission but stated that he was not formally alleging any misconduct by Mr Dorber. Some two months later the RRAT committee received a letter from a wool growers organisation alleging that the telephone call did, indeed, constitute intimidation of Mr Turner and inviting the committee to investigate the matter. </para><para>The RRAT committee conducted preliminary inquiries and received further evidence from Mr Turner and Mr Dorber about the telephone conversation and any consequences. As Mr Turner was now of the view that Mr Dorber's conduct amounted to an offence under subsection 12(1) of the Parliamentary Privileges Act, the chair of the RRAT committee wrote to the President raising it as a matter of privilege and the President gave precedence to a notice of motion referring the matter to this committee. Along with the reference, the Committee of Privileges received copies of the relevant submissions and correspondence with the parties involved. As is often the case, the committee was able to conduct its inquiry on the basis of the papers before it.</para><para>In cases of alleged interference with a witness, the Senate has a choice of prosecuting the alleged offender for a criminal offence under section 12 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act, or proceeding against the alleged offender for contempt of the Senate. Although the RRAT committee's preliminary inquiries were directed at discovering whether there was a prima facie case against a person for an offence under section 12 of the act, the Senate, in referring the matter to this committee, determined to exercise its own jurisdiction to investigate whether a contempt of the Senate had occurred.</para><para>The committee found that the accounts of the telephone conversation given by Mr Turner and Mr Dorber did not conflict in any major respect. As there were no significant points of dispute between the two accounts, and it was unlikely that the committee would be able to independently substantiate either account, it chose not to pursue further evidence about the conversation.</para><para>The issue for the committee was whether Mr Dorber's telephone call constituted an improper interference with Mr Turner. Paragraphs (10) and (11) of Senate Privilege Resolution No. 6 provide that actions relating to interference with and molestation of witnesses may be treated as contempts. There are at least two elements of interference with witnesses. The first is whether improper interference was exerted in respect of evidence given or to be given by a witness, and this includes any inducement for a witness not to give evidence. The second is whether any penalty was imposed on a person, not necessarily a witness, on account of evidence given.</para><para>The Committee of Privileges considered that Mr Dorber's action did not interfere with Mr Turner's evidence. Mr Turner did not alter or withdraw any part of his evidence. Indeed, following the telephone call, Mr Turner augmented his evidence, stating to the committee at the time that he did not wish to make any formal allegations against Mr Dorber. With respect to whether any penalty was imposed, the committee found no link between Mr Dorber's position regarding the reduction in the wool levy and Mr Turner's evidence. The committee noted that the apparently robust exchanges between various players in the wool industry were not an uncommon feature of Australian democracy and that the exchange between Mr Turner and Mr Dorber should be seen in that context.</para><para>The committee made two observations that I wish to highlight here. The first is that it is highly undesirable for any person to confront a witness about evidence given to a parliamentary committee. There is too great a risk of committing a contempt, either wittingly or unwittingly, in these circumstances. </para><para>The second is that since 1988 the Senate has had procedures in place that require committees to invite responses from persons adversely commented upon in evidence. These provide for exchanges to occur under the committee's supervision and the guarantee of procedural fairness. The Committee of Privileges takes this opportunity to remind all committees of the importance of these adverse reflection rules and their obligation to follow them.</para><para>On the basis of the evidence before it, the Committee of Privileges concluded that a contempt of the Senate should not be found. I commend the report to the Senate and seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ASSENT</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>20566</page.no><id.no></id.no></debateinfo><para>Messages from His Excellency the Governor-General were reported informing the Senate that he had assented to the following laws:</para><para>Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance Reform) Act 2004 (Act No. 1, 2004).</para><para>Migration Legislation Amendment (Identific-ation and Authentication) Act 2004 (Act No. 2, 2004)</para><para>National Residue Survey Customs Levy Rate Correction (Lamb Exports) Act 2004 (Act No. 3, 2004)</para><para>National Residue Survey Excise Levy Rate Correction (Lamb Transactions) Act 2004 (Act No. 4, 2004)</para><para>Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Wine Grapes) Act 2004 (Act No. 5, 2004).</para></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>FUEL QUALITY INFORMATION STANDARD (ETHANOL) DETERMINATION 2003</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>20566</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Motion for Disallowance</title><page.no>20566</page.no></subdebateinfo><para><inline font-style="italic">Quorum formed</inline></para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>20566</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Fuel Quality Information Standard (Ethanol) Determination 2003, made under section 22A of the Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000, be disallowed.</para></motion><para>This disallowance motion seeks to disallow the Fuel Quality Standard (Ethanol) Determination 2003 under section 22A of the Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000. Section 22A, which was inserted into the act by way of an amendment bill passed by the Senate in November last year, allows the minister to make a determination requiring that a label be displayed at the point of sale where fuel blended with ethanol is sold. It also provides that the minister may determine the form that this label will take. When the fuel quality standards amendment bill was debated in the Senate last December, the government promised that the labelling scheme would be informative but would not further damage consumer confidence in ethanol. They promised that the label would not contain alarming warnings that would frighten motorists off this alternative fuel.</para><para>I have spoken at length in this place about the advantages of ethanol and done my bit to improve confidence in this fuel. It is fair to say that this fuel is able to reduce enormously the pollution that we currently see from petrol. It is an oxygenateâthat means it allows the fuel to burn more thoroughlyâand it reduces monoxide, nitrous oxide, and particulate and other pollution. That having been said, it was a surprise to discover that the label which the Commonwealth is now saying it requires at the point of sale of E10, or 10 per cent ethanol blended petrol, will carry, effectively, a warning. I will later be seeking leave to incorporate two labels in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. The first is the label which was recommended by the ministerial task force working group on ethanolâthe working group set up for the purpose of looking at measures which would improve confidence in ethanol. That is figure one. Figure two shows the label as determined by the minister. As those who look at <inline font-style="italic">Hansard </inline>in the future will see, these are very different beasts. The recommended label says: </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">ETHANOL BLEND</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">PETROL</inline></para><quote><para>Contains up to 10% ethanol</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">For automotive use</inline></para><quote><para>Check your handbook or contact your manufacturer regarding use of this fuel in non-automotive applications.</para></quote><para>But the label which is now required to be applied to fuels says:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">ETHANOL BLEND PETROL</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Contains up to 10% ethanol</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">For motor vehicle use</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Suitable for most post-1986 vehicles</inline></para><quote><para>Check with your manufacturer before using this fuel in your motor vehicle, motorcycle or in small engines such as chainsaws or outboards.</para><para>May cause a small increase in fuel consumption.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">DO NOT USE</inline> in any aircraft.</para></quote><para>The Democrats argued that, instead of a labelling system like this, we should have waited until we had some sort of rating system for all fuels so that we could warn the users of petrol that many of the ingredients in petrol are likely to be harmful to the atmosphere. We could compare, for instance, ethanol blended petrol with petrol which was not ethanol blended. Consumers could look at some of the new petrol products which are better for the environment and weigh up whether they are prepared to pay a little extra per litre for those fuels in return for knowing that their efforts in this respect would help improve air quality. But the government has taken a different view and some would guess, as I would, that this is the only label that we will ever seeâwe will not see the labels being required on fuel to tell consumers exactly what they are getting for their money. The fact that the minister has not taken the advice of the working group set up for this purpose is an indication that this government is not serious about improving confidence in this fuel. It is disappointing that the ALP will not join the Democrats today in disallowing this label because I think it is going to do a great deal of harm, if it has not already done so since the date by which this label needed to be applied was 1 March, which was yesterday.</para><para>Another document which I will table, not incorporate, is a reproduction of the label which was provided to us from Caltex. This is the one applied to the pilot E10 project, which has been under way in Queensland for some time. This label for E10 unleaded says:</para><quote><para>The E10 unleaded labelled nozzles on this pump dispense unleaded petrol that contains 10 per cent ethanol which is a renewable fuel.</para></quote><para>There we have it: a positive statementâ`a renewable fuel'. That will encourage those people who know that fossil fuels will eventually, in the not too distant future, run out. The label indicates to motorists that this is a renewable fuel so that they can do their bit in supporting an energy source which is not a fossil fuel and therefore does not add to our CO2 from this source. The label continues:</para><quote><para>The E10 unleaded sold at this site contains ethanol from a Queensland grown sugarcane.</para></quote><para>So there again a promotion for Queensland sugar farmers. In this place we know, as we have said earlier today, that sugar is in deep trouble. The minister during question time today indicated that the world price for sugar is below the cost of production in this country. Ethanol offers some hope for sugar producers; their waste material can be turned into ethanol in order to provide another income stream for farmers. So consumers would know (a) it is a renewable fuel, so that is good, and (b) it comes from Queensland grown sugar cane. The label goes on to say: </para><quote><para>By using E10 unleaded you will be helping to support regional Queensland. </para><para>Important: please read before purchasing this petrol. The fuel is not suitable for use in marine craft, aircraft, ultralites ... and Caltex recommends that you consult with your vehicle or equipment manufacturer.</para></quote><para>That label will need to be taken off in favour of a label that looks like one you would find on a tobacco product. In other words, we are going from one which encourages use to one which is about warnings. In fact, it is probably more alarming to many people than even tobacco warning labels. This label says E10 may cause a small increase in fuel consumption and people are going to look at that and say, `Yes, this fuel is going to be more costly because I won't get as much by way of energy out of it.'</para><para>The fact of the matter is that the difference in fuel consumption between petrol which does not have ethanol in it and petrol which does is so minimal as to be almost undetectable. Ethanol in fact adds to the fuel efficiency of petrol by making sure that all or most of the elements in it are burned. It is an oxygenate. That will mean that whatever loss there is in fuel consumption by virtue of its energy content will be more than likely made up for by the way in which the petrol will burn. It is a sad day and a great pity that we have come to this point where labels are going to be seen as warning labels, not as an indication to motorists to encourage them to use E10 blends. I seek leave to incorporate the two labels that I mentioned and to table the former Caltex E10 label.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The documents read as followsâ</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Figure l</inline><inline font-weight="bold">.</inline></para><para>Label Recommended by the Ministerial Taskforce Working group on ethanol</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">ETHANOL BLEND</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">PETROL</inline></para><para>Contains up to 10% ethanol</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">For automotive use</inline></para><para>Check your handbook or contact your manufacturer regarding use of this fuel in non-automotive applications.</para><para>âââââ</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Figure 2.</inline></para><para>Label as determined by the Minister</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">ETHANOL BLEND PETROL</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Contains up to 10% ethanol</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">For motor vehicle use</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Suitable for most post-1986 vehicles</inline></para><para>Check with your manufacturer before using this fuel in your motor vehicle, motorcycle or in small engines such as chainsaws or outboards.</para><para>May cause a small increase in fuel consumption.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">DO NOT USE</inline> in any aircraft.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>20568</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe fuel quality information standard ethanol determination 2003 sets new requirements for labelling petrol containing ethanol. The requirements are made under the Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000, which established a regulatory regime for activities involving fuel and fuel additives and, along with the Fuel Quality Standards Regulations 2001, provide the framework for making and enforcing national fuel quality standards and national fuel quality informationâthat is, labelling standards. Labor previously announced a policy that fuels containing ethanol must be appropriately labelled to enable consumers to be informed about what they are buying. Labor believes that consumers not only have a desire to know what they are putting in their cars but also have a right to know what they are putting in their cars. We also see this aspect as being vital to restoring consumer confidence in the ethanol product and, therefore, vital to building a self-sustaining market for ethanol. </para></talk.start><para>There is heightened consumer concern about ethanol in fuels, following extensive media coverage last year about the dangers of ethanol in some vehicles and which, I might say, was contributed to by the government's delays in finalising the appropriate legislation. Although the Democrats contend the details required on the label are onerous, the proposed label is broadly consistent with Labor's view on the rights of the consumer and the need for consumers to have confidence to build the ethanol market. We do not say that this label is perfect, but it does provide much of the key information required. It tells the consumer that the fuel contains ethanol. It tells the consumer that such blended fuel is predominantly for motor vehicle use. It tells the consumer that most post 1986 vehicles will not be adversely affected by the use of the blended fuel. It warns consumers that they may see a small increase in fuel consumption when they use blended fuels. It tells consumers to check with their manufacturer should they have concerns which, I might say, is a pathway providing consumers with confidence and ultimately a stronger market for ethanol.</para><para>Although I understand that the industry has undertaken voluntarily to introduce labelling for ethanol, should this motion be successful, and whilst new labels were negotiated, we believe the legislation provides consumers with the necessary surety and allows them to make an informed choice about their fuel usage. We do not support this motion because, if this disallowance motion were to be successful, labelling of ethanol would not be guaranteed and, therefore, consumers and ethanol producers would be back to square oneâthat is, consumers would not necessarily know if they were buying fuel containing ethanol. Whilst the Caltex example is no doubt quite a positive example for the ethanol industry, there have been many examples which are not so positive, and those examples have substantially affected the consumption of ethanol fuels. Until quite recently the limit on the content of ethanol in fuel to 10 per cent has been a great disincentive for consumers to buy fuel that they suspect might contain ethanol, because they have no legislative certainty that that component of the fuel which ethanol formed would not exceed what was generally accepted to be, for vehicles operating in Australia, the maximum which should be allowed.</para><para>I am certain that the industry, based on its experience of these labels in the marketâand that will be the testâwill reapproach the government, with modifications along the way if needed. That is an approach which ought to be acceptable to any government where there are unintended consequences of a labelling regime which could be demonstrated attributable to the regime and not to any inherent risk in the product. Modification would be, and quite clearly could be, contemplated by the appropriate minister at the appropriate time. In that regard, Labor will of course consider any changes the government brings, just as we will in government consider approaches from the industry with regard to matters which might be brought forward by the ethanol industry and by the fuel industry generally on merits of labelling.</para><para>I was somewhat disappointed that Senator Allison seemed to be implying that somehow the ethanol industry can be a saviour for the sugar industry in Queensland. The government has peddled that myth for some time. Sugar is a potential alternative fuel stock for ethanol, but we all know that the overwhelming majority of ethanol used as a fuel additive in this country is produced from grain. Indeed, a number of the proposed new ethanol plants propose to use sorghumâanother grainâas a feedstock. While there are some proposals in relation to sugar cane being used as a fuel stock, the reality is that, if we were to have a substantial industry based on sugar cane, we would not be using sugar caneâor very littleâto produce the type of ethanol which might be targeted for widespread use throughout the motor vehicle fleet in this country. The ethanol industry would be a purchaser of cane, were it to substantially take up that opportunity, but it would be looking at the opportunity costs of that cane, as against alternative markets for the cane. It would make the sugar industry unviable if cane producers switched from being sugar producers to ethanol producers, because without cane the sugar mills in Queensland would shut and one suspects in the current environment would be unlikely to reopen any time soon. </para><para>This hoary old myth that the sugar industry can be saved by the ethanol industry is just thatâa hoary old myth. There may be some minor benefits and opportunities at the margin for the industry to source product surplus to the needs of the mills in Queensland. It may be that the world price of sugar will be such that producers could do no worse than sell it to the ethanol industry, but I suspect that would mean the demise of the mills through the sugar belt in Queensland. We should be very careful about holding out ethanol production as a saviour to the cane growers and sugar communities in Queensland. It will not be. It may provide some minor assistance but I suspect the reality is that the majority of ethanol produced in this country for some time to come will be produced from fuel stocks other than sugar cane. The history of production to date has shown that. Around 97 per cent of the ethanol produced for fuel consumption is produced from wheat. A significant number of the additional contemplated processing facilities in southern Queensland and in New South Wales, for example, are talking about producing fuel from grain, either wheat or sorghum. Indeed, investigations are being conducted into the establishment of a sugar beet industry for the purpose of producing ethanol in Tasmania. I am not saying that that will happen, but there are so many potential feedstocks for the ethanol industry that it is fanciful to suggest that suddenly sugar cane growers are going to get some magical benefit from the ethanol industry.</para><para>The government made some promises to the ethanol industry, and I am certain that the ethanol industry feels those promises have not been honoured in the proposed labelling regime. I am aware that there is significant disappointment as to the government's approach on this issue. We are more than hopefulâwe are confidentâthat the environmental benefits of ethanol can be sold by the ethanol industry. I do not understand there to be any limitation on additional signage which deals with issues such as the positive benefits of ethanol. It is incumbent upon the ethanol industry and those retailers who seek to sell product containing ethanol to extol its virtues and to compete in the marketplace with fuels not containing ethanol. As a consumer, I would be far more confident purchasing a fuel where I was made aware of the inherent risks and would be more likely to do it upon taking advice rather than, on the other hand, feeling that there were inherent risks, that things had gone bad, or that a neighbour or a friend who had purchased the fuel had found problems with a motor vehicle or a small engine which, according to mechanical advice, were due to the use of that fuel.</para><para>We now have labelling, which may not be absolutely perfect but it is a step in the right direction. We are not prepared, at the end of this debate, to see that labelling removed, because we believe that would be a backward step for consumers and for the ethanol industry. We will need to revisit the argument again at some stage. It has been difficult enough to get the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Dr Kemp, to promulgate this regulation. We certainly are not going to see it disappear and wait months or years for another one. The opposition will not be supporting this motion. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>20571</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âJust as the opposition, we oppose this motion to disallow these regulations and are somewhat surprised that the Democrats would move a motion to disallow this determination. I concur with many but not all of the arguments put forward by Senator O'Brien. I particularly reject his unfair and unjustified criticism of the government, certainly of the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Dr Kemp, and his proposition that we are peddling a myth about ethanol saving the sugar industry. They are diversions from the core issueâthe core issue being that the government has issued this determination in relation to compulsory labelling for ethanol blended fuel. </para></talk.start><para>I am surprised by Senator Allison's motion, because this has been motivated by the government's sincere and concerted attempt to restore confidence in ethanol blended fuels. That confidence had been shattered by scare campaigns deriving from a number of sources, and there had been a buyer strike in relation to ethanol blended fuels. For that reason, the government introduced the E10 limit, the 10 per cent limit. Consumers then knew that anything they bought with ethanol in it would contain no more than 10 per cent, which is the generally accepted upper limit for fuel used in most vehicles on Australian roads, and that they would not be subject to scare campaigns stating that it contained anything in excess of that because the government would require labelling to that effect. What a compulsory label should do is give consumers the essential information they need when buying a product of this kind.</para><para>I think the label does provide that essential consumer information, and it does so in a way which should restore confidence by making the point most clearly. The clear statement on the label is that the fuel is for motor vehicle use and that it is suitable for most post-1986 vehicles. That is the critical thing that consumers need to know to purchase the product with confidence. It is essential that the label goes on to advise consumers that they need to check with their manufacturer before using enthanol-blended fuel in a motor vehicle, particularly in motorcycles and in small engines like chainsaws and outboards, because ethanol is not necessarily safe in small engines, particularly in ultralight aircraft. These can use normal bowser fuel, but there is the severe risk that the engine can cut out if the fuel contains ethanol. The ACCC has advised the government that there must be such a warning on the label in relation to aircraft. Certainly it is critical for people who go to sea with a two-stroke outboard motor to know they need to check with their manufacturer before putting an E10 blend in it.</para><para>I think the government has done exactly what is required of it, both to restore confidence in this fuel and to ensure people have essential safety information. I thought Senator O'Brien made the point wellâwith one exception. There is nothing to stop the retailer or the fuel supplier providing additional information by way of additional labels as to the other benefits of this fuel. Of course, the limitation is that they must be consistent with the requirements of the Trade Practices Act and not mislead consumers in any way. As I understand it, what Caltex are doing would not run counter to that. If Caltex or anybody else want to put a separate label on indicating the other benefits of the fuel then they are entitled to do so within the law as it regulates consumer information. </para><para>I think what the government has done is proper. I am surprised that the Democrats would move a motion to disallow this. As Senator O'Brien said, it is only going to cause more delay, more confusion and more difficulty for this industry and I think it is counter to the interests of the industry. I should say that I have taken a particular interest in this, both as industry minister and as finance minister. While we want to see ethanol have its opportunity, I would point out to Senator Allison that there are mixed views on the total environmental benefit of ethanol. I have done quite a bit of research on this. There is work in the United States which suggests that if you take the life cycle approach to ethanolâthat is, from the very outset of production the tractor is required to plough the fields to grow the grain to produce the fuel; as Senator O'Brien says, ethanol is mostly made from grain in this countryâthen the net environmental benefit is not quite as clear cut as Senator Allison has suggested to this chamber. Nevertheless, we have said that fuel can contain up to 10 per cent and we have given consumers the essential information. It is up to those who now believe that this fuel has clear environmental benefits to make their case to consumers and convince them that they should buy the E10 blend, albeit they need to know that with certain uses there is a risk and they need to check with their manufacturer.</para><para>I totally support the minister's determination and the label that has come out of that process. I think it is completely and utterly consistent with the government's policy intent of ensuring this fuel is available, that we restore consumer confidence in the blend up to the limit that is, generally speaking, appropriate for most vehicles on Australian roads but that the essential safety information is there for consumers. I would suggest to Senator Allison that she rethink her position on this issue. Unless she is going to withdraw the motion, we will vote on it. I am pleased the opposition will support the government in this matter, but I think Senator Allison's disallowance motion is unfortunate. If it were to succeed, it would cause more significant difficulty for those promoting the use of ethanol in our fuels.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>20572</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI indicate to the chamber that One Nation will support the Democrat disallowance motion. In supporting it, I would like to speak about several different aspects of ethanol. Firstly and primarily, we need to address the issue on which the industry participated in this process. From speaking to the ethanol producers in Australia, it is my understanding that there was an agreement between the industry and the government on the basic framework for the notice that would be attached to or displayed on the bowsers. You can inevitably predict the outcome if you put something to a committee. On lots of occasions if you are looking for a horse you will end up with a camel.</para></talk.start><para>This is why we have an objection to this notice. If this disallowance motion is not successful, a very negatively focused notice will go onto each and every bowser that pumps fuel with an ethanol content. I want to put it very clearly on the record that One Nation's support for the ethanol industry is 100 per cent. I will go into the reasons why we should do that, both health wise and in relation to the government's clean air standards, which it is locked into achieving by 2010.</para><para>The primary objection to this notice is from the industry. When the ethanol industry signed off on what they believed would be the notice, it merely referred the person to the manufacturer's data on the vehicle into which it was going to be pumped. The proposed sticker says very clearly: `May cause a small increase in fuel consumption. Do not use in any aircraft'. I would like to bring it to the attention of the chamber that avgas is used in aircraft. Its equivalent in our normal, everyday use is unleaded petrol. So where is the sign on every unleaded bowser in this country saying: `Do not use this product in an aircraft'? The signs do not exist. They are not there. I apologise to senatorsâI cannot reproduce all of the examples that I have hereâbut in California, Chevron's ethanol blend is 10 per cent, and there is absolutely no warning on its bowsers. None whatsoever. In Nebraska, Mobil fuel is labelled `E10 with ethanol added'. British Petroleum's service stations, again in Nebraska, advertise `E10 with 10 per cent ethanol'. We can go through as many as you likeâShell, British Petroleum. Right throughout the States there is no requirement for a label that cautions the use of E10. Where is the parallel with the oil companies? They have one set of rules for the US and a totally different set here in Australia. </para><para>Last year, over 10 per cent of all gasoline in the United States contained ethanol. Fuel with 10 per cent ethanol has been certified by the Environment Protection Agency as reducing carbon monoxide emissions by up to 30 per cent. Since 1981, over 152 billion gallons of ethanol blend have been used in the United States. In the United States, the only notification is that the fuel contains 10 per cent ethanol. Why does Australia have a totally different set of standards from those that are widely accepted in the United States?</para><para>Let us compare ethanol with the unleaded fuel that is sold within Australia today. Our normal unleaded fuel contains 42 per cent aromatics, and our premium unleaded fuel contains 48 per cent aromatics. It is my understanding that the Commonwealth government has made a commitment to reducing the content of aromatics to 40 per cent by 2010. If we are to continue to have premium unleaded in Australia, eight per cent of the octane rating has to be found from somewhere else. Clearly, ethanol is the only fuel that can provide this at this point in time. The structure of ethanol is such that each carbon molecule has attached to it two hydrogen molecules and an oxygen molecule. Ethanol is the product that will bring the octane rating of our unleaded fuel up to the clean air standards that the government has committed to.</para><para>So what is the government doing? Is the government going out and progressively encouraging people to fill their vehicles with ethanol? I do not believe that it is, because, when this sign is attached to every pump containing ethanol in this country, it is going to be a disincentive for people to use it. As senators well know, in the area where I live, up on the tablelands, Caltex is running a trial with ethanol. I definitely find that the vehicle I drive performs better with the 10 per cent ethanol blend in it. The clear indication is that the odour from that vehicle is considerably better. If you look at the kilometres that you get from a tank of fuel, it is most definitely better. One of the most dramatic examples of the benefits of ethanol came to light at the Mareeba go-kart facilityâan international standard go-kart facilityâwhere they ran a trial with the 10 per cent ethanol blend. Believe me, you would only want to do this on a closed track. It took the top speed of these vehicles from 150 to 180 kilometres an hour with absolutely no adjustments to them. It clearly showed that, on a high performance go-kart motor, the ethanol performed extremely well.</para><para>The problem that One Nation has with what the government is proposing is that the sign that has come out of this process is contrary to what the industry understood it was going to be. One Nation believes that the wording of this sign is negative. Rather than encourage people to use ethanol, it will act as a disincentive. If there is an industry that needs all of the assistance that it can obtain at present, it most definitely is our sugar industry. Ethanol can and would breathe new life into our sugar industry. We should be supporting it 100 per cent and not indicating to the Australian people that there are dangers in using it. With those few words, I indicate that One Nation will support the Democrats on this disallowance motion. </para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the motion (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allison's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>17:07:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.</para></division.header><para>(The Acting Deputy PresidentâSenator L.J.

The Democrats have less concern with the two new proposed offences, relating to witnesses giving false evidence and to inducing a person to give false evidence to the Industrial Relations Commission. There are currently no provisions in the Workplace Relations Act that cover these issues, and they reinforce offences under the Crimes Act 1914. Concerns were raised during the Senate's inquiry that the proposed provision regarding false evidence, unlike section 35 of the Crimes Act, does not require that the false evidence touch on matters material to the proceedings. The offence also applies to all evidence regardless of whether it was given under oath, which again is contrary to the High Court's interpretation of the Crimes Act. We will be moving amendments at the committee stage to address these issues. The Democrats support the government's aim to ensure the integrity of the Industrial Relations Commission is maintained, but we perhaps differ from the government on how best to achieve that.</para></talk.start><para>The Australian Democrats have a long tradition of supporting the commission having an independent discretion to determine industrial relations matters on their merits. Discretion, of course, is never open-ended, but it has long been our view that wherever possible such discretion is a better guarantor of fairness and flexibilityâwhich is a repeat of something I said earlier today with respect to another bill. The Democrats also believe that one of the weaknesses of the current system is the lack of powers of the Industrial Relations Commission to arbitrate and conciliate disputes. The Democrats argue that the capacity for the Industrial Relations Commission to resolve disputes on its own motion should be increased and that resources to the Industrial Relations Commission should be increased to ensure the timely resolution of disputes. With respect to increasing penalties, the Democrats support tougher civil penalties for those who purposely ignore commission and court orders, and we will be supporting those provisions in the bill. We have circulated a set of amendments on sheet 4132 and we look forward to debating them at the committee stage. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>20575</page.no><name role="metadata">Santoro, Sen Santo</name><name role="display">Senator SANTORO</name><name.id>BOT</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn the face of it, codifying offences so that what constitutes an offence is always clear seems to be sensible policy. It is too often the case that you find that those who would argue against codificationâsay, on the grounds that it limits or is too prescriptive of judicial responsesâare those who are seeking to find some excuse for people to continue to flout the law. No-one would want to limit judicial reasoning or trespass on the sound jurisprudence that almost always flows from learned judges applying their minds and their training to problems of the law, but in the <inline ref="R1839">Workplace Relations Amendment (Codifying Contempt Offences) Bill 2003</inline> no such action is proposed. Indeed, except at one remove, it does not even impinge on the freedom of thought of judges at all.</para></talk.start><para>According to the opposition spokesman on workplace relations, the member for Rankin in the other place, this is `a vacuous piece of legislation'. He said that in his speech on the bill in the House of Representatives. It is not the legislation that is vacuous; the member for Rankin's comments were in fact vacuous. The member for Rankin's comments are often the very model of Labor Party vacuity when they are not just barefaced expositions of his and his party's preference for a return to the union closed shop and special privilege for the union movement. Amongst the dross that the opposition spokesman delivers, there are sometimes little shafts of light that illuminate his thinking. He said in the same speech on this bill in the House of Representatives:</para><quote><para>For 100 years Australia has supported an Industrial Relations Commission as an independent umpire being able to arbitrate on disputes.</para></quote><para>He can get 10 out of 10 for history there. Both sides of Australian politics have always supported the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The essential difference, which is clear in this billâand it is clear why Labor is opposing itâis that the side of politics that supports an independent Industrial Relations Commission is this side. We support an Industrial Relations Commission that is armed with effective weapons against union thuggery and provided with a clear mission statement by the legislature with regard to what it may order.</para><para>Labor prefer to keep things obscure. They use the smoke and mirrors method of hiding things. I talked about smoke and mirrors last night when debating another bill. They say they are all for independent arbitration but they really mean they are all for unions and their operatives being able to continue to get away with flouting the law. There is no intention in this bill or by this government to undermine the basic rights of anyone.

Those opposite may choose to argue that it is sometimes valid to be in contempt of the commission. There would indeed be some intellectual validity to their argument, no matter that it is entirely wrong, were they to come clean on that point, but they cannot argue that no contempt has ever taken place, as they regularly do.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Without going back over the full history of the union movementâand I again want to make it clear at this point that it is only a minority of unions and union organisers and bosses who regularly and wilfully flout the lawâfor the record, we are not anti the union movement. I hope that Senator Murray is listening to this. We respect the vast majority of union members, shrinking though the number is. We have only to go back to the Cole reportâthe report of the Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industryâto find evidence of numerous contempts of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission or numerous actions and events that would be in contempt of the commission if evaluated on any reasonable understanding of the law. The former minister made reference to one such instance reported by the royal commission: the Patricia Baleen industrial dispute in Victoria in late 2002, a strike that ran for almost two months, despiteâindeed, in the face ofâtwo section 127 return to work orders being issued by the commission. If that is not contempt, I just do not know what in fact can be defined as contempt. </para><para>The bill before us has one objective: to ensure that the commission is respected. The Labor Party and others can only vote against this bill if they are prepared to countenance continued contempt of the commission. The argument the Labor Party put forward over this bill is a political argument. If they were genuinely arguing it on administrative grounds, or on grounds of support for the rights and duties of the commission, they would not be arguing at all. They would be rushing to pass the bill.</para><para>It would be instructive at this time to take the Labor Party through the actual provisions and intent of the bill. The bill amends section 299(1)(e) of the Workplace Relations Act which makes `contempt of the commission' a criminal offence. The new offences clearly identify each type of conduct that constitutes contempt and the bill increases the level of penalties for such offences. There are three key elements to the government's overall compliance policy in relation to breaches of the court and commission orders: contempt proceedings for breaches of Federal Court orders, which are to be initiated either by the Attorney-General or the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations where there is evidence of defiance and where instituting the action is in the public interest; civil proceedings for breaches of commission orders under section 178 of the Workplace Relations Act, which will be investigated and enforced by inspectors appointed under the Workplace Relations Act; and criminal proceedings under the statutory contempt provisions in part XI of the Workplace Relations Act, which will be investigated by Workplace Relations Act inspectors and prosecuted by the Director of Public Prosecutions.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>GB6</name.id><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>NB5</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator George Campbell</name></talker><para>âHe is reading from his copious notes.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BOT</name.id><name role="metadata">Santoro, Sen Santo</name><name role="display">Senator SANTORO</name></talker><para>âIf the honourable senator actually listened, he might learn something. This bill concerns criminal proceedings for contemptuous behaviour in relation to the commission. It clarifies the scope of the offence relating to conduct that amounts to contempt of the commission contained in existing section 299 of the Workplace Relations Act. In other words, while it does create new offences, it actually codifies what constitutes contempt on a basis that I believe most people would already clearly understand to be contempt and enforces action and appropriate penalties against such contempt. It means that union organisers would no longer be able to thumb their noses at the commission with impunity or, indeed, immunity.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The government believes this bill is necessary to ensure that the law, and in particular the application of criminal law, is clear; that it is accessible to those who believe they have a case; and, further, that it is capable of delivering legislated remedies for unlawful action. In this it is no different from any other bill that supports the criminal justice system. The industrial landscape is not one that should be quarantined from the force of the law, as senators opposite would want. Industrial disputes are not some sort of game, as the Labor Party apparently believes. They are not necessarily minor or momentarily diverting arguments between friends. </para><para>We should perhaps again go through all of the other reasons why this bill is necessary and should be passed. This bill amends Workplace Relations Act offences relating to contemptuous behaviour against the Australian Industrial Relations Commission so that it is clear and unambiguous. It codifies section 299(1)(e) of the Workplace Relations Act, which is currently a catch-all provision, prohibiting any offence that would, if the commission were a court of record, be a contempt of that court. It deals with the problem that this kind of `deemed contempt' provision imports the common law of contempt with all its uncertainties and complexities. As contempt of the commission is a criminal offence, it should be stated with certaintyâwith certainty that currently does not exist. It is the responsibility of the parliament, this Senate, to ensure that its laws are as clear as possible. </para><para>The bill clearly sets out specific forms of contemptuous behaviour which will attract criminal sanctions under the legislation. This implements the approach recommended by the Australian Law Reform Commission that `deemed contempt' provisionsâsuch as the current section 299(1)(e)âshould be replaced by specific statutory offences that identify contemptuous conduct. Existing offences in generally-applying legislation such as the Crimes Act and the Criminal Code already prohibit some contemptuous conduct in relation to the commission. This bill only creates a new offence to prohibit conduct not already adequately covered by the existing offences. The bill also updates penalties for a range of offences under part XI of the Workplace Relations Act, many of which have not been substantively revised for more than 15 years, and of course the world has moved on considerably in those 15 years.</para><para>The proposed new offences are: engaging in conduct which contravenes an order of the commission, publishing a false allegation of misconduct affecting the commission, and inducing a person to give false evidence to the commission. These would, I am sure, be viewed by most Australians as offences against which the law should act rather than stand idly by while offenders treat it with contempt. It is this sort of contemptuous behaviour that has hitherto escaped penalty. I do not believe that there is any reasonable Australian out there who would not see the sense that exists in the provisions of this bill that we are debating here today.</para><para>Like most Australians, most union members and officials are sensible people who understand that the law must be obeyed. I did not need the prompting of the honourable senator opposite for me to have considered my contribution and included those comments in my prepared statement. I did not need you, or indeed Senator Murray or anybody else in this room, to force me to say what I said.

I was amazed at the character of the speech made by Senator Santoro, who I understand was a minister for industrial relations in the fine state of Queensland, to show such ignorance of the issues that the chamber has before it. The reality is that, if we were debating this issue on its merits, this debate would have been long over. We would not have wasted five minutes on it, because there is no merit in the legislation that is before the chamberâabsolutely no merit whatsoever. The <inline ref="R1839">Workplace Relations Amendment (Codifying Contempt Offences) Bill 2003</inline> is just another piece of mischievous legislation designed to satisfy this government's vitriolic hatred of the trade union movement and to vilify the achievements and proud history of an organisation that has looked after the rights and conditions of working Australians for well over 100 years. Anyone with any sense of fairness who reads history objectively would know that the living standards that we all enjoy in this country todayâwhether you be a worker in a factory, a senator sitting in this chamber or a high-flying business executiveâgo back to the role played by the union movement over the past 100 years in arguing for and promoting the rights of ordinary Australians to better working conditions, better standards of living, better wages and better conditions. We all know thatâand, if there was any sense of fairness on the other side of the chamber, Senator Santoro would get up and admit it and Senator Abetz when he closes this debate would get up and admit it. But we know they will not, because they have never been able to bring themselves at any stage in history to admit that the trade union movement has played an effective role on behalf of workers in this country. </para></talk.start></continue><para>This legislation is just another piece of Orwellian doublespeak. If you look at the industrial legislation that the government have brought into this chamber since 1996 and compare the language used in the titles of those bills with the actual intent behind them, then you would have to say that the government studied well George Orwell's <inline font-style="italic">Nineteen Eighty-Four</inline>. They understood clearly the message that was exposed in that piece of literature, because they have used it very effectively in all the industrial legislation they have been promoting. Those bills have been referred to, I think, as `the dirty dozen' reform agendaâthe dozen bills that are about trying to neuter the effectiveness of the trade union movement by pretending to promote the interests of ordinary Australian workers.</para><para>This bill is simply a part of this broader picture of industrial relations reformâpart of a series of bills which have been developed on ideological grounds. We know where the ideology comes from. It was there in 1996, it was there in 1998 when Peter Reith ordered the men in balaclavas and the dogs onto the wharves to go after the Maritime Union of Australia, it was there in the royal commission into the building industry when they sought to get at the building workers; and it will be there in future actions undertaken by this government in its approach to dealing with the trade union movement. It is unfortunate that it has confused the concept of reform with the politics of regression. This legislation and many of the other bills that we have before us are based on nothing more, as I said, than bland ideological hatred of the trade union movement and the collective ideal.</para><para>If this legislation were to get through this chamber in the form that is being promoted by this government, what would it achieve? It would lead to the creation of industrial turmoil out in the workplace. Workers and unions would be driven into a position of having to take direct industrial action to defend their living standards against the attacks that are clearly designed in this legislation. The legislation is designed to ensure that Australian workers will suffer, that Australian businesses will suffer and that conflict in the workplace will be inflamed. We have seen the example in Victoria with Jeff Kennettâwhich I was reminded of last weekâwhen over 100,000 workers marched up Bourke Street in protest at his industrial laws. That is a clear example of what happens when you overstep the mark. In the same way that Kennett overstepped the mark in Victoria, this government has been attempting to overstep the mark since its election in 1996, but it has been prevented essentially by the actions of people in this chamber. It has been saved, some would say, from itself in its approach on industrial relations. </para><para>Let us look at some of the Orwellian titles of the dirty dozen. In many cases the intent of the bill is diametrically opposed to its title. Take the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002, which allows small businesses to dismiss their employees with impunity and leaves sacked workers without recourse to unfair dismissal laws. Where is the fairness in that bill? Yet the government have deliberately used the term `fair dismissal bill'. What about the Workplace Relations (Award Simplification) Bill 2002? It simplifies the responsibilities of employers by removing matters such as limits on the minimum and maximum hours for part-time employees and payment of accident make-up pay, but it creates chaos and uncertainty in the lives of Australian families who find the safety net protecting their pay and conditions has been shredded to bits. The reality is that these ham-fisted class warriors of the Howard government are having themselves and working families on with this legislationâand this bill is no better. </para><para>On the surface, the bill sounds fairly innocent and fairly reasonable. It seeks to amend section 299 of the Workplace Relations Act relating to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission including the offence of contempt. The bill also increases fines for contempt and related offences. For some offences imprisonment terms will be increased. These are all provisions in the current act. They are not new; they are in the act and have been there since 1993. However, the reasons given by the former Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Mr Abbott, for introducing this bill that the Industrial Relations Commission is somehow not respected and that its judgments are regularly flouted just do not add up. Of course the decisions of the independent umpire should be respected, but what has this government sought to do since 1996? It has sought to take the whistle off the umpire. If you look at the legislation across the board, you can see that much of it has been targeted at gagging the umpire's ability to blow the whistle and restricting the capacity of the umpire to play an effective role in running the industrial relations game. That is what the government has sought to do since 1996, yet it expresses concern that somehow or other the Industrial Relations Commission has not been respected. </para><para>If anybody holds the Industrial Relations Commission in disrespect, it is people on the other side this chamberâin fact, that is the very point. Issues of contempt in the commission are dealt with appropriately. As I have said, the act already contains numerous provisions which allow prosecutions for contempt of offences against the commission to be brought. Section 299 sets out a range of offences in relation to the commission, and they are very specific. In addition to section 229, there are other related provisions in the act, namely the Crimes Act and the Criminal Code that cover a wide range of offences, including the threatening, intimidation, coercion or prejudice of witnesses and non-compliance with commission requirements to appear, swear or make affirmation. These provisions also provide for significant penalties, including up to six months imprisonment for some offences. </para><para>The current system is clearly comprehensive, detailed and properly and effectively thought out. All parties operating under our industrial relations framework, whether they are unions or employer groups, understand their obligations to the commission. Noone in the industrial relations field is in doubt about what their commitment is to the commission and how they have to act within it and respond to it. The reality is that the current laws are working effectively, and the reality also is that the minister knows it. The minister knows the laws are working effectively. </para><para>So what is the government's real agenda with this legislation? It cannot be that actions brought under the section are proving problematic or ineffectual because there has not been an action brought under the section since 1993 when the contempt provisions of the act were significantly added to and changed. You would have thought, having listened to Senator Santoro's speech, that there was mayhem and chaos out there, that people were regularly holding the commission in contempt by ignoring its decisions. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>GB6</name.id><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>NB5</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator GEORGE CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>âSenator Collins, I do not think they want to go as far as `tough love'. `Gentle love' might be more appropriate in these circumstances. If the commission had been subjected to the type of activity you would have thought they were being subjected to were you to believe Senator Santoro's speech, they would not have acted under the current provisions of the act to have protected their rights. The reality is that they did not. Non-compliance with commission orders are generally resolved in the Federal Court either directly between the parties involved in the dispute or with the assistance of the court. </para></talk.start></continue><para>We have to ask ourselves: why does the government feel it necessary to amend Section 299 when not one action has been brought under the section for over a decade? At the same time, you have to pose the more baffling question: why is the government not moving to make changes to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, which contains a number of provisions largely equivalent to section 299 of the Workplace Relations Act? The answer is that the government is not really concerned about the commission being held in contempt at all. It simply wants to create a set of circumstances in the public relations environment to try to demonstrate that somehow or other the trade union movement are being big baddies out there: `We are dealing with them. We are going to make them pay. We are going to send them to prison. We are going to fine them double what they used to be fined.' </para><para>This morning Senator Abetz, in berating a comment I made on another bill, trotted out the old line that Paul Keating once used about my having the jobs of 100,000 metalworkers around my neck as a millstone. Two hours later, Senator Santoro had doubled that amount to 200,000. We have a number of industrial relations bills listed for debate in this chamber this week. By Thursday, the number of jobs that I will be accused of having around my neck will be around a million. Again, the truth does not seem to have much relevance for the other side when we are debating industrial relations.</para><para>I want to take a couple of minutes to identify what I think is the real government agenda. That real agenda is to say to working families in Australia, `Either you will play it our way or you will pay.' If you look at the evidence that was given to the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee, which examined a number of the government's proposed workplace relations bills, including this one, the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations themselves summed up the agenda. They said in short to the committee that the government considered that amendments to the act such as this one were necessary because they brought the law into line with government policy. The government use the term `policy', but of course we use the term `ideology'. They said they brought the bills in line with government ideology. That is what this agenda has all been about. This ideology, this hatred of the trade union movement, is not new to the Howard government. I have been in the industrial relations field for a long time and successive Liberal-National Party governments from Menzies right through have consistently put laws into the federal parliament aimed at attacking or restricting the capacity of the trade union movement to defend workers' rights. You can go back and see them. The legislation of 1975, the Viner amendments of 1983 and the bills that have been put through this chamber over the last six or seven years by the Howard government are all consistent in their objective, which is to restrict the capacity of the trade union movement to work on behalf of ordinary working Australians to improve their working conditions, their living standards and their pay. </para><para>At the end of the day, that is what is truly shocking about this bill and the other bills that we have in front of us this week. They simply demonstrate, once again, the paranoid fantasy that this government has about its imagined ideological enemiesâits preparedness to set aside the rights of ordinary Australians and what it sees as the big bogyman in being able to attack the trade union movement. This bill, like the others, is sneaky, unnecessary and cynical. It demonstrates again the government's fanatical hatred of trade unions. That has never, and will never, be a sensible approach to industrial relations reform. I simply take this opportunity to say that I condemn the bill. I trust the Senate will treat this bill with as much contempt as this government treats the Industrial Relations Commission.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>20584</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWho said dinosaurs were extinct?

He set out the government's position very well.</para><para>During the debate we heard the lament about the deunionised work force. If the work force is being deunionised it is because workers are deciding not to join trade unions. You may wonder why the workers are leaving the trade union movement in droves. But it is no wonder when we have to listen to the sorts of contributions that have just been made in this place by Senator George Campbell on the other side. It would be somewhat embarrassing to have somebody like Senator George Campbell represent you if you were a worker. Senator Campbell made sure that his job was so much easier by ensuring that 100,000 people in the industry that he was allegedly representing lost their jobs. That is not my statistic, that is not Howard government rhetoric; that is the accusation made against him by former Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating. </para><para>When people from your own side of politics accuse you of having lost 100,000 jobs in a particular industry whilst you were the head trade union official, there is merit in analysing and examining that allegation.

The people of Australia need to realise that if later this year there is a change of government it would be the likes of Senator George Campbell who would be deciding the industrial relations policy of this country.

The work force is being deunionised because of the sort of behaviour that we are witnessing now from a former trade union official. They are all former trade union officials over there, Madam Acting Deputy President Kirk, as you would well know. Workers nowadays, because of this government's policies, actually have a choice about whether or not they want to be members of a union. And we believe that that is a very important choice that each and every individual Australian worker should have. Once they were given that choice they left in droves.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Another contributor to this debate suggested that every workplace relations bill that has come before the parliament from this government over the past eight years has been designed to be provocative towards unions and the workers. If that is the case they might like to explain to the Australian people why we have enjoyed the lowest rate of industrial disputation in this country, ever. If we were so provocative and if we were wrecking the industrial infrastructure within this country, one would imagine that the workers would be outraged and there would be industrial disputation every day of the week. The simple fact is that as a result of our policies the workers of this country are enjoying not only more job opportunitiesâbecause we now have more people in employmentâbut also an increase in real wages. We are still in a period of strong economic growth with employment growth and, as a result, employment opportunities.</para><para>A suggestion was also made that there was some sort of imbalance of power. If there were an imbalance of power, one would imagine people would be getting lower and lower wages.

The greatest social wage we can give is an actual wage or an actual jobâwhich the Labor Party were unable to deliver because of their policies. We have now delivered jobs not by the thousands or hundreds of thousands but by the million for the people of Australia. That is why the unemployment rate has come down to below six per cent. Sure, we have a long way to go. Whilst 5.6 per cent is a good figure, it should be even betterâand we are working hard to achieve that. But when the people of Australia come to compare the Australian Labor Party with the Liberal and National parties in this area they will see that it has been our policies that have delivered these very exciting results for the working men and women of this country. People have jobs, their wages have increased in real terms, and that provides them with real and genuine security.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator George Campbell gave us a very interesting discussion. I will not seek to deal with everything that was mentioned by Senator Campbell. Suffice to say that his defence of the building industry in the face of the findings of the royal commission that highlighted the corruption, the thuggery, the standover tactics is just beyond beliefâand that remark comes from a frontbencher. I remind the Senate and the Australian people that, if the Labor Party were to win at the next election later this year, Senator Campbell would be serving as a minister in the Australian government and, by implication, condoning the sorts of activities that were found to be illegal by the royal commission. Of course, with those sorts of activities we would have a government that would be overseeing yet again an increase in unemployment and a decrease in real wagesâand they claim to be the champions of the worker.  </para><para>The workers of this country expect their government to have a regime in place whereby the rule of law does apply to industrial matters. That is exactly what this bill seeks to do. It seeks to codify the contempt offences in the Workplace Relations Act. It is as simple as that. The nearly hysterical opposition, put forward by the Australian extremes and the Australian Labor Party, is just mind-boggling. It goes to show what their ideology is and what their methodology would be should they ever be given the Treasury benches in this place.</para><para>The proposed amendments to this bill are essentially technical amendments that are necessary to ensure that the legislation operates effectively and that the obligations it imposes are clearly understood. The contempt provisions of the act are intended to protect the integrity of the commission and to support commission proceedings and orders. If you genuinely believe in the Industrial Relations Commissionâas those opposite claimâone would imagine that they would therefore support provisions that ensure that people cannot act in contempt of its orders. The Workplace Relations Act already prohibits contempt of the commission, but it does so through a deemed contempt offence that imports the uncertainties and complexities of common law contempt. All we are seeking to do, as the bill says, is to clarify that. The average person does not necessarily understand what conduct amounts to contempt. The bill takes this broad and potentially confusing offence and converts it into a number of offences that clearly spell out what conduct breaches the law. It makes the law clear; it makes the law accessible. </para><para>The bill has four main components. Firstly, the bill sets out specific offences that are a contempt of the commission. These offences are already substantially covered by the current catch-all offence. Secondly, it draws attention to existing offences under the Crimes Act and the Criminal Code that apply to the commission. Thirdly, it provides for a new specific offence of giving false evidence to the commission. Fourthly, it updates the penalties to more accurately reflect the seriousness of conduct that would undermine the integrity of the commission, which is what those opposite are opposing.</para><para> The opposition has focused its criticisms on proposed new section 299(3), which provides for an offence to prohibit the contravention of an order of the commission. This is disobedience contempt at common law. Unlike the existing provision, the new offence is very clear about what sort of conduct can result in a court imposing criminal sanctions on a person. There is a penalty of imprisonment, which has been referred to by Senator Collins. But contrary to what she suggested, this bill does not use prison as a primary remedy against industrial action. That is an absolute misrepresentation of the amendments. No-one will be penalised for taking protected, legitimate industrial action which is allowed under the Workplace Relations Act. </para><para>Before a person is exposed to a penalty under this bill, in connection with taking industrial action, the person would need to have (a) taken the unprotected industrial action and (b) be the subject of an order by the commission that the industrial action cease or not occur and (c) have intentionally failed to comply with that order or been reckless as to whether they complied with the order. One wonders why the Australian Labor Party is so trenchant in its opposition of such a provision. There are three aspects that need to be satisfied. If all three are satisfied then it seems reasonable that in those circumstances a substantial penalty ought be applied.  </para><para>The current act already includes a sentencing option of six months imprisonment for breaching section 299(1)(e), which could apply where a person breaches orders of the commission, but the current provision is not clear that this sort of conduct could result in such a sanction being applied. This bill makes it clear. It is appropriate that there are effective sanctions that can be imposed where a person who is bound by an order intentionally breaches that order. Courts are protected by criminal sanctions for contempt, as are other Commonwealth tribunals, and the government's policy is that the commission warrants the same degree of protection. It is obvious that the Australian Labor Party does not believe that the commission warrants that degree of protection. We happen to disagree; we believe that the commission is worthy of that protection.</para><para>The opposition has asserted that there is no evidence that the incidence of industrial action or noncompliance with orders has increased or is so prevalent that systematic changes are required to deal with these issues. However, even the ACTU conceded in its submission to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References committee that orders of the commission are sometimes breached. The ACTU submission referred to a number of excuses for such breaches. They were either minor or trivial or the industrial action did not continue for too long after the order was made, or the action ceased after the federal court followed up the commission's order with an injunction. Responsible union officials, one would have thought, should always respect orders of the commission. The government's view is that there are no excuses. If a union does not agree that the commission should have made an order, it should appeal against the order. The government agrees with the president of the commission, when he said:</para><quote><para>The act provides for the manner in which decisions and orders are to be challenged and that process is to be preferred to a practice of selective observance based on a perceived interest.</para></quote><para>Other commissioners have noted the seriousness of failing to comply with its orders. For example, Senior Deputy President Acton noted in the Calsonic case last year:</para><quote><para>It is clear that the AMWU failed to comply with all the terms of the section 127 order I issued on 28 May 2003. The AMWU's failure in this regard is a serious matter and is to be condemned, not the least because it undermines the rule of law and the objects of the act.</para></quote><para>Can somebody remind me which union Senator George Campbell was associated with? It would not have been the AMWU, by any chance? </para><para>My friend and colleague from the Democrats Senator Murray was concerned that the government was seeking to prosecute every example of noncompliance. This is not the case. The Director of Public Prosecutions is an independent officeholder and he will decide if a case is to be prosecuted under the Commonwealth's prosecution policy. Under this policy, a prosecution can occur only where the DPP decides that it is in the public interest, taking into account all the relevant facts. Knowing who the DPP is, might I say that Senator Murray should have no fearâthe DPP is a Tasmanian. </para><para>The suggestion was made by a number of contributors that there was no evidence that section 299(1)(e) has ever been used. Senator Collins suggested that this meant there was no need for any amendment. There are a number of likely reasons for the existing offence not having been used to date: (a) the very low penalties that may be imposed; (b) the lack of clarity about which conduct amounts to contempt of the commission; and (c) that it has not previously been a key government priority to investigate possible breaches and seek compliance with orders. These are the very factors the government is trying to remedy through this bill. The bill would ensure that the sanctions for contempt of the commission are effective. It does this by replacing the existing offence, which is unclear and out of date, with offences that are clearly drafted and supported by adequate penalties.</para><para>There are other matters that I would like to pursue during the committee stage. While I thank all honourable senators for their contributions, I think the approach being taken, especially by the Australian Labor Party, is to be regretted. If they genuinely believed in the role of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, they would want to see its orders being observed. If they believed in the commission being the umpire, it would be appropriate for both sides of the equation to abide by the decisions and there would not be selective observance of the commission's orders. I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>20588</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Billâby leaveâtaken as a whole.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>20588</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI refer to Democrat sheet 4132 and the 15 amendments that were circulated on 1 March. I have no idea how this debate will progress, except that, judging from what they have said, I am certain the Labor Party will vote against the bill as a whole. I do not know what the government's attitude is going to be. With respect to the attitude of the Democrats, if you refer to schedules 1 and 2, it is quite clear that we have two distinct approaches. On schedule 1, we are singularly cautious about what is being proposed. On schedule 2, we mostly agree that it is time for penalties to be lifted and in fact have made some recommendations for additional penalties. I do not know what the government's intentions areâwhether this bill is going to be a double dissolution triggerâbut, if you find the one side unacceptable and you want to split the bill so that schedule 2 gets through, we would certainly not be opposed to schedule 2 returning to the Senate to be dealt with separately. The reason I raise that now is not tactical but so that the participants in the debate clearly understand the options before them when considering the amendments we will be putting.</para></talk.start><para>However, the bill is not split, so let us begin. The Australian Democrats oppose schedule 1 in the following terms:</para><quote><para>(1)	Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (lines 5 and 6), <inline font-weight="bold">TO BE OPPOSED</inline>.</para><para>(2)	Schedule 1, item 2, page 3 (lines 7 and 8), <inline font-weight="bold">TO BE OPPOSED</inline>.</para><para>(3)	Schedule 1, item 3, page 3 (line 9) to page 4 (line 15), <inline font-weight="bold">TO BE OPPOSED</inline>.</para><para>(4)	Schedule 1, item 4, page 4 (lines 16 to 24), <inline font-weight="bold">TO BE OPPOSED</inline>.</para></quote><para>Item 1 creates two new content offences. We outlined in the debate on the second reading why we are concerned about these and why we think they should not be introduced. I laid out in my speech in the second reading debate the concerns we have. We think section 178 already provides for a general offence of failing to comply with the terms of an order and it has been utilised in the past. The ACTU submission to the Senate committee noted that the Australian Law Reform Commission said: </para><quote><para>No new offence covering false allegations of misconduct against tribunal or commission members for non-compliance with orders should be created unless there is a specific need for it to protect a particular tribunal or commission.</para></quote><para>We also said that the courts and the commission had cautioned against automatically pursuing cases that may not be in the public interest; other things do need to be considered. Section 178 is a civil offence and the proposed new provision would be a criminal offence. The commission deals not only with orders that can be enforced by courts but also with orders that can be fairly minor and deal with procedural and administrative matters. That area of concern I have just outlined is probably the core of our fears concerning these matters. The government has not made similar amendments to the same provisions which apply under the Trade Practices Act 1974 and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, which is a little inconsistent. We think the problem is of enforcement of existing provisions and we have remarked that we think a national regulator would do far better at enforcement than the current dispersed means of enforcement. Of course, if you raise the penalties and enforce them it gets far tougher out there, which is a good thing in some respects.</para><para>We believe the publishing of false allegations provision will have similar problems as the pre-1993 amendment, which was deleted because the section was deemed to cover too much, such as the genuine exercise of a right to criticism. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry also argued in their submission that maintaining confidence in the commission must be balanced with freedom of expression, public accountability and open justice, which I agree with. The ACCI requested the qualification:</para><quote><para>... held a genuine belief that was based on reasonable grounds that misconduct had occurred.</para></quote><para>We believe anyone could argue this and so we do not support it. That is a summary of our views in that area and that is why we are not supporting schedule 1.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>20589</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank Senator Murray for dealing with the items in schedule 1 together, which will of course assist in the time taken by the chamber to deal with them. The government does not support the first two items. Retaining the existing deemed contempt offence in the Workplace Relations Act goes against the entire purpose of the bill. The government is seeking to repeal the existing broad and potentially confusing offence and to convert it into a number of offences that clearly spell out what conduct breaches the law.</para></talk.start><para>As I have said before, accepting this would defeat the entire purpose of the bill and the government's policy that the elements of criminal law offences should be clear. Senator Murray has once again referred to the suggestion that minor or technical matters might get caught up in criminal proceedings. At the end of the day it is not going to be the government's decision; it is going to be the Director of Public Prosecutions, who is an independent statutory office holder, who will have to exercise his mind as to whether or not it is within the public interest to prosecute a matter.</para><para>Just as the local police do not necessarily prosecute every speeding offence that is committed, similarly the Director of Public Prosecutions would have a look at each matter referred to him and determine whether it is in the public interest or appropriate to pursue a criminal charge. In those circumstancesâI am sure that he would not say it directlyâthe logic of what Senator Murray is saying by implication is that he does not have confidence in the Director of Public Prosecutions to exercise his mind in an appropriate fashion to ensure that frivolous criminal proceedings would not be brought where there have been simply technical breaches. That is a concern to the government, as we in fact have confidence in the Director of Public Prosecutions. </para><para>Removing item 3 of the bill would create new offences. It prohibits contemptuous conduct in relation to the commission. The offences prohibit contravening an order of the commission and publishing a false allegation of misconduct affecting the commission. The government believes it is appropriate that the commission is clearly and adequately protected from this sort of conduct. It is disappointing that the Australian Demo-crats do not believe that the commission should be protected from that sort of conduct. The government acknowledges that these amendments will be carried in the chamber with the support of the Labor Party.</para><para>Item 4 of the bill sets out the application provisions for the new offences. That, of course, is consequential on the other three. Having said that, let me indicate that we, the government, feel very strongly about this legislation. We oppose all the amendments being put forward by the Australian Democrats, but we are realistic enough to know that, if we were to divide the chamber on each and every one of them, or even groups of them, the Labor Party and the Democrat numbers combined would defeat the government. Therefore, we will simply record our opposition to the amendments on the voices. We will not bother dividing the chamber on what would be quite a number of occasions. That would just take up unnecessary time given that, unfortunately, the dye is cast on these amendments. But the mere fact that we are not dividing on them should not give anybody the impression that we are not very strongly supportive of our legislation and vehemently opposed to the amendments being put forward this evening.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sue (The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN)</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Knowles)</inline>âThe question is that items 1 to 4 stand as printed.</para></talk.start><para>Question negatived.</para></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>20590</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move Democrat amendment (5) on sheet 4132:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(5)	Schedule 1, item 5, page 4 (line 29), after âfalseâ, insert âsworn or affirmedâ.</para></quote><para>I have never appeared before the Industrial Relations Commission, but I have read a number of their proceedings over time. I am aware that there is a range of ways in which evidence is expressed. Testimony is given which is not sworn. I recognise that sometimes, when people are giving evidenceâsuch as evidence to Senate committees, where Senate committees do not swear them inâpeople can be hyperbolic or a little exaggerated or express themselves more freely than when they are giving sworn evidence, which is an entirely different kettle of fish. Amendment (5) provides a penalty for giving false evidence of imprisonment for 12 months. Imprisonment for one day is pretty toughâ12 months is very tough.</para><para>The Democrats happen to agree that this is a serious matter and we agree with the intent of amendment (5), but we certainly do not agree that it should apply to anything other than sworn testimony. I am a little surprised that the government have already signalled that they will automatically not agree to this amendment. I would have thought that the amendment we offer is a perfectly reasonable and protective amendment. We do not believe it is appropriate that unsworn testimony can result in people going to jail for 12 months. Our understanding is that unsworn testimony can include submissions to commissions and discussions not taken under oath. </para><para>Our amendment reflects findings of the High Court in Edwards v.

We would be interested to hear why the government believes that provisions in the Workplace Relations Act should not reflect the ruling of the High Court with respect to the Crimes Act. We support the government's intention to punish people who give false evidence, but we do think it should attach to sworn evidence and not to the somewhat looser version which we would describe as testimony or unsworn evidence.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>20591</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIf it assists Senator Murray, we would be happy to deal with amendments (5) through to (11)âall of the matters you deal with in relation to schedule 1âin one group. I can indicate generally that these essentially deal with amending the government's provisions that create a new contempt offence with respect to the giving of false evidence to the commission. Labor opposes these amendments because we oppose the principal provisions. There is simply no demonstrated need for them. The current section 299(1)(e) captures this issue. As with the other parts of section 299, it has never been tested, so why is there a need to change it? </para></talk.start><para>The approach taken right through hereâand Senator Murray just referred to further examples of itâreflects back to the principal point. If there is such a case for these changes, as the purposes indicated in this bill, why has the government never sought to deal with similar provisions such as those in the AAT? It is obvious that the government does not care about similar provisions in other areas. This is part of their core industrial agenda. There has been no meritorious case put. The current provisions under section 299 deal with giving false evidence in much the same way as Senator Abetz gave us a lecture in the previous bill. I sat here and listened to him arguing that lockouts were covered because they are encompassed in the definition of industrial action.

If we believe that there should be an offence in the event that any evidence given before the commission is false, I suppose all we are really arguing about is the penalty and not the principle. As I understand it, what Senator Murray is doing with his amendment is knocking out the principle as opposed to seeking to amend the penalty in relation to giving false unsworn evidence. Basically, to put it in a nutshell, we do not believe it is okay to lie to the Industrial Relations Commission, whether it be sworn or unsworn evidence. I think it sends a very bad message to the community that, if you are appearing before a body such as the industrial commission, it is okay to lie just because your evidence is unsworn. We do not think that is good enough. If the Australian Democrats believe that it is inappropriate to give false unsworn evidence before the commission then possibly we should get our heads together to see if we can talk about the issue of penalty, if that is the real concern of the Australian Democrats. </para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>20592</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI can see your training as a solicitor coming to the fore there, Ministerâtaking someone's argument and twisting it a little. As the minister knows, the punishment has to reflect the crime and penalties should be related to the offence. I said I agreed that there should be some sanction for anyone who deliberately misleads or lies to the commission. But I gave the example that people giving unsworn evidence, who give submissions or who trot along and are asked for their opinion, may be somewhat loose in their presentation and may thereafter be threatened, theoretically, with 12 months imprisonment. I get a bit concerned about this, because the process of swearing evidence requires you to be properly proofed. As the minister, as a former practising solicitor, knows better than I do, when you swear evidence the document is properly proofed. You are taken through it and made sure that what you are doing is accurate to the fullest knowledge you have.</para></talk.start><para>So, if you were to say to me, `Does the act need to make sure that, regarding the giving of false evidence in any circumstance, the commission have some sanction available to it?', I would say yes and we could discuss that.

That is my concern. I do not disagree with the principle at all. I am faced with what I have before me, and I cannot in all conscience support imprisonment for 12 months for unsworn evidence which is prepared in the way in which I know these things can be prepared.

They have clearly shown that it is within their power to move amendments, and it is interesting that they have not done so in relation to the issue of penalty. It is good to see that there is common ground between us. I have a funny feeling that this bill may well be going back to the House of Representatives and then possibly coming back here. That may well give us the opportunity to tease out this issue a bit more, if the only issue that divides us is the issue of penalty.</para></talk.start><para>In the Crimes Act, as I understand it, the maximum penalty for giving false sworn evidence is five years. To take up Senator Murray's point, the government did consider that the punishment should fit the crime. That is a reasonable and longstanding proposition that has withstood the test of time. I think every reasonable person would accept that as a fundamental proposition. That is why the Crimes Act has a provision in it for a penalty of a maximum of five years imprisonment for giving false sworn evidence. The proposal here is that, given that the evidence is unsworn, the maximum penalty be only 12 months. There is a substantial reduction in the proposed penalty for unsworn evidence. The basic situation remains that this is not a situation of giving wrong evidence, where sometimes people can be honestly mistaken; this is about lying and giving false evidenceâalbeit unsworn. For that to be a crime, you have to have the appropriate mens rea, the appropriate intent. </para><para>In effect, a person would be setting out deliberately to mislead or lie to the commission and we believe that it is not okay to lie in those circumstances and that there should be a penalty. The maximum penalty we have suggested is 12 months, and that is in contradistinction to the maximum of five years in a circumstance of false evidence being given in the sworn context. We believe that the penalty has been reduced so that it would fit the crime or the offence, but this area of penalty may be appropriate for further discussion between us when the bill undoubtedly bounces from the House of Representatives back here again.</para><para>Question negatived.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>20593</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI move Democrat amendments (6) to (11) on sheet 4132:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(6)	Schedule 1, item 5, page 4 (line 29), after âevidenceâ, insert âtouching any matter material to that proceedingâ.</para><para>(7)	Schedule 1, item 5, page 5 (line 6), at the end of subsection (3), add:</para></quote><para>Note:	Section 10.2 of the <inline font-style="italic">Criminal Code Act 1995 </inline>states that a person is not criminally responsible for an offence if he or she carries out the conduct constituting the offence under duress.</para><quote><para>(8)	Schedule 1, item 5, page 5 (line 7), after â<inline font-style="italic">Inducing</inline>â, insert â<inline font-style="italic">or coercing</inline>â.</para><para>(9)	Schedule 1, item 5, page 5 (line 14), after âinducesâ, insert â, threatens or intimidatesâ.</para><para>(10)	Schedule 1, item 6, page 5 (line 23), omit all words from and including âof that subsectionâ to the end of subsection (1).</para><para>(11)	Schedule 1, item 6, page 5 (line 27), omit all words from and including âof that subsectionâ to the end of subsection (2).</para></quote><para>With respect to Democrat amendment (6), as mentioned in my speech in the second reading debate, concerns were raised through the Senate inquiry that the proposed provision regarding false evidenceâunlike section 35 of the Crimes Actâdoes not require that the false evidence touch on matter material to the proceeding.

They are directed at the application provisions of the offence-creating amendments. The amendments seem predicated on some apprehension about retrospectivity, but that apprehension is misplaced as the conduct has to occur after the amendments commence for that conduct to be caught by the new offences. These amendments would make the application provisions at best unclear and at worst inoperative. The effect of the amendments would be that the application of the offences would be to the giving of false evidence after the commencement and the inducement after the commencement. This begs the question: after the commencement of what? The provisions of the bill will commence at various times. Some parts of the bill will commence on royal assent and some parts will commence later.

We are surprised that the government itself has not moved to increase the penalties under section 178. If the government is concerned about breaches of commission orders by unions, section 178 is currently the appropriate avenue used to penalise unions and individuals. Surely an increase in penalties in that section would act as the deterrent it looks for against behaviour which is unacceptable. We would prefer to see an increase here rather than support the government's proposal to criminalise contravening an order of the commission. Section 178 also applies to employers who breach awards, which is something we would like to see dealt with.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>20595</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âDemocrat amendments (12) to (15) insert new increases to penalties for breaches of awards and agreements. We appreciate that Senator Murray is seeking to introduce some sense of balance into this bill by increasing the penalties for what are more likely to be employer initiated breaches of the industrial relations system. However, this attempt is futile given that the federal inspectors who enforce these provisions rarely, if ever, seek penalties. There were no prosecutions in the last quarter, for instance, according to the department at estimates just two weeks ago. Because these penalties are so rarely enforced it is also impossible to say whether they are an adequate deterrent or not. For any review of these penalties to be effective it would need to occur in the context of the resourcing of the enforcement and compliance parts of the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations. In the current enforcement context a review of penalties is meaningless, and therefore Labor will not support it.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>20595</page.no><name role="metadata">Marshall, Sen Gavin</name><name role="display">Senator MARSHALL</name><name.id>00AOP</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn following the debate this evening in relation to these amendments it is worth refocusing on one of the significant roles of the Industrial Relations Commission in resolving industrial disputes. The parties often go to the Industrial Relations Commission to assist them to find common ground in order to avoid escalation of industrial action. Part of the role of the commission is to enable the parties to engage in a full, frank and open dialogue in order that the commission can assist the parties in finding that common ground, to avoid the escalation of any disputation. The instigation of penalties and sanctions does nothing to assist that process; in fact, it will retard the process. Ultimately, if people are fearful of presenting their views of a potential dispute frankly and honestly as they see it before the commission, because of the inadvertent omission or the fact that they may not be fully aware of all the facts when they are presenting their case, they will be discouraged from using the commission to resolve those disputes. We will find that people will avoid it. When people are summonsed to the commission, they will refuse to cooperate fully and frankly and the commission will be rendered useless.</para></talk.start><para>The commission plays a positive role. As a former union official I have appeared before the Industrial Relations Commission on hundreds of occasions. I can say to the credit of many of the commissioners that they work tirelessly to assist the parties to come together. Often it is a matter of engaging in that full and frank debate so that all sides of an argument are put on the table; misunderstandings are then sorted out and solutions are found. More often than not, all parties are satisfied with the resolution of that dispute. But there is no way that the parties would be able to reach any such agreements if they felt intimidated or fearful of engaging in full and frank discussion before the commission. </para><para>Progress reported.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>20596</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sue (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Knowles)</inline>âOrder!

It has been recently announced that the after-hours GP service, which started with a seven-year pilot program in my area in the Hunter, is now to be expanded to cover the whole state of New South Wales. There are plans to open 48 new after-hours clinics in hospitals across the state, and it is a terrific step forward in relieving the pressure on hospital emergency waiting rooms. Late last year I reported to the Senate on the Hunter Urban Division of General Practice after-hours scheme, which has been operating in the Hunter for seven years.</para></talk.start><para>When we came into government, general practitioners in the Hunter region identified what they termed a `rapid disintegration' of the services available to help people who required urgent medical treatment out of hours. There was mounting pressure on hospital waiting rooms in the region and doctors were reporting that a great percentage of the cases filling hospital emergency waiting rooms could have been attended to by a general practitioner. To tackle this issue, the Hunter Urban Division of General Practice started working towards achieving an improved system of after-hours care for patients who live in the Hunter region. I would like to pay a special tribute to Dr Arn Sprogis, whose visionary leadership has brought about this scheme in the Hunter.</para><para>In July 2003 the Hunter Urban Division of General Practice expanded the service from the initial pilot in Maitland to a Hunter-wide service with five after-hours clinics across the valley. In its first six months of operation 20,000 patients have been seen in one of the five centres, and a further 20,000 patients have accessed telephone advice from a registered nurse. When the after-hours clinic opened near Maitland Hospital, demand for emergency room resources dropped by 60 per cent. When a similar clinic opened near the much larger John Hunter Hospital, the main hospital for the Hunter Valley, medical staff reported a 15 per cent drop in emergency demand.</para><para>The GP after-hours service benefits all patients, nurses and doctors. Medical providers are saved from having to be constantly on call. If there is an after-hours clinic available to the public, it dramatically reduces the amount of doctor call-outs. The scheme has also resulted in a massive reduction in pressure on hospital emergency rooms. During the Christmas period alone, after-hours clinics were catering for over 250 patients per day that would have otherwise clogged up precious emergency room resources. The after-hours GP service pools all funds from the federal and state governments and uses them from within existing infrastructure to ensure a sustainable, high-quality medical service. Most of the after-hours clinics are actually located within hospital walls.</para><para>A number of weeks ago I had cause to use the after-hours GP service. I entered the clinic on Hunter Street in Newcastle at about 10 o'clock at night. The first step in the process is that you are asked for details at the desk by a registered nurse, and then the nurse asks what the nature of the complaint is and whether it is urgent enough for immediate medical help. This process is important as it prevents people stopping in for repeat scripts and small complaints that could be attended to during normal hours by GPs. I was then taken to an assessment room where the nurse assessed my ear infection. A GP then attended to me and an appropriate course of treatment was recommended. I was very impressed with the professionalism displayed by the staff in the after-hours clinic, and the whole process took under an hour. This was in marked contrast to my previous experience when I arrived at the outpatients of a hospital late at night, and by the time I had been through the process and left the sun had come up. This new after-hours service is far more efficient and provides for the people a much better service, particularly outside normal GP hours. </para><para>In addition to the clinical services, it runs a toll-free telephone line for people who live in remote areas or would rather self-treat in the privacy of their own homes. These call centres are serviced by registered nurses and they have proven to be very popular and inexpensive as a source of medical advice. Perhaps the most important factor in the GP after-hours service is that it is entirely bulk-billed. Patients are not charged any cash up-front, and in this way the general practice after-hours service is a working example of Medicare reform. The pooling of funds from the federal and state governments and the utilisation of existing infrastructure has enabled the establishment of a sustainable, high-quality after-hours medical service at little additional cost. This shows what can be done by utilising infrastructure and using better organisation and ingenuity.</para><para>The general practice after-hours service makes full use of the skills of registered nurses, and patients are only referred to a doctor if their illness is deemed urgent enough. Patients are charged nothing up-front; it is bulk-billed. If this scheme is adopted state-wide, we can expect the demand on emergency waiting rooms to drop considerably. This in turn will mean better access for cases that require emergency casualty care and more precious hospital beds for those who need them. It truly makes me proud that such an innovative scheme was born in my area of the Hunter. It goes to show what can be done with existing resources and infrastructure when the needs arise. The demand for such a service appears, at the moment, to be only on the increase. </para><para>I am very interested to see the outcomes that will stem from the state-wide implementation of this general practice after-hours service. It will diminish emergency waiting room times, it will reduce ambulance queues and the general demand on hospital and emergency room resources will drop. It will no doubt relieve much of the pressure that has been placed on our hospital system. The patient is also more comfortable with a quick service and a course of action that alleviates their discomfort. I anticipate that at some time in the near future, this initiative could be adopted nationwide. I believe the Australian medical system in general would greatly benefit by this introduction. It is a very simple, well-planned and well implemented scheme that has already revolutionised medical care in the Hunter region, and it holds the promise of doing this across all of New South Wales and eventually across Australia.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Torres Strait Islands</title><page.no>20597</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>20597</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt gives me much pleasure to rise to address the Senate on my recent visit to the Torres Strait, which was ably assisted by you, Madam Acting Deputy President McLucas. It was the first opportunity that I had had to visit the Torres Strait. It was an opportunity in the context of my new role as the shadow minister for reconciliation and Indigenous affairs and shadow minister for regional services. I propose to be an aggressive proponent of the interests of Torres Strait Islanders as shadow minister. I hope that before the year is out I might have the opportunity to serve their interests as minister. Certainly, the people of the Torres Strait deserve a minister willing to listen to their concerns and, where possible, act on them in a timely manner. I do not think that is what they have had under the Howard government.  </para></talk.start><para>First tonight I want to make what might seem an obvious pointâthe islands of the Torres Strait are a long way from this place and their residents get scant attention in the major policy debates in this chamber. Like other rural and remote communities, the adage `out of sight, out of mind' all too often applies. I hope in the course of coming months to redress that situation in respect of not just the Torres Strait but other rural and remote Indigenous communities as well. I give fair warning to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Vanstone, that she will need to turn more of her attention to responding to the needs of the people of the Torres Strait.</para><para>The Torres Strait is a fascinating part of Australia. Its people face some challenges similar to residents of other remote communities, including an extraordinarily high cost of living. Other challenges are unique, not least those related to the region's close proximity to Papua New Guinea. Over an area of 48,000 square kilometres, the Torres Strait comprises 17 inhabited islands and 20 distinct communities, including a community based on the northern tip of Cape York. At the last census, about 6,700 people living in the Torres Strait identified themselves as Torres Strait Islanders, out of a total of about 8,000 residents. Almost 37,000 people living in other parts of Australia, but predominantly in Queensland, identified themselves as Torres Strait Islanders.</para><para>Over the period 3 to 5 Februaryâover three daysâI had the opportunity to visit seven islands: Horn, Thursday, Moa, Mabuiag, Warraber, Yorke and Darnley. On Thursday Island I met with the General Manager of the Torres Strait Regional Authority, Mr Mike Fordham, and his senior officers. I am grateful for the briefing that I received on key administrative matters. I was fortunate to have the TSRA facilitate a meeting with the Chair of the Island Coordinating Council and Chair of Hammond Island Council, Mr Henry Garnier. </para><para>Mr Fordham and TSRA Manager of Economic Development Services, Ms Robin Maxwell, were kind enough to accompany me on a brief tour of the Torres Strait Cultural Centre site. The Commonwealth-state funded cultural centre is an important project for Thursday Island and the Torres Strait. I am hopeful of being able to attend the opening of the centre in the near future. I trust it will provide visitors to the region with a much deeper appreciation of the unique culture of the Torres Strait. I hope it will also act as a vehicle for the development of the arts economy in the region.</para><para>On Thursday Island I was also pleased to meet with the energetic Mayor of Torres Shire, Pedro Stephen, and his council. Three key issues were raised during my meeting with Torres Shire Council: first, the failure of the government to respond to demands for reform of the Torres Strait Regional Authority, principally in respect of the election of board members; second, the lack of resources devoted to the management of illegal fishers brought to the island by Commonwealth authorities; and, third, the failure to provide direct representation of the people of the Torres Strait in negotiations with Papua New Guinea over the shared use of regional resources, including health services on Thursday Island. </para><para>I was also pleased to meet the publisher of the <inline font-style="italic">Torres News</inline>, Mr Mark Bousen, during my visit. The <inline font-style="italic">Torres News </inline>is a small, vibrant and fiercely independent publication that serves the Torres Strait community. Matters raised during my meeting with Mr Bousen, particularly improved regional services and transport links to support economic development, were raised time and time again during my meetings with island councils. I suspect the paper has a much firmer grip on regional affairs than the principal decision maker on Torres Strait Islander affairs, Minister Vanstone. I suggest that she visit the newspaper during her first visit to the Torres Strait as the responsible minister.</para><para>My recent visit coincided with the last week of the Queensland state election campaign and I was able to witness the operation of mobile polling stations on about half the islands I attended. The first polling station I witnessed in operation was in Kubin on Moa Island. I am pleased to note the work of the Queensland state electoral commission and acknowledge the professional job they did in the face of significant logistical challenges. On Moa Island, Senator McLucas and I met with the Chair and Deputy Chair of Kubin Council, Mr Saila Savage and Mr Roy Genai. Our discussion focused on Moa Island's infrastructure needs, including a sealed road between Kubin and St Paul's.</para><para>I also had the great pleasure of meeting Christine, the remote area nurse working at the Kubin health centre in what can only be described as difficult circumstances. I think the work that Christine does on Kubin reflects admirably the magnificent work done by nurses and other health professionals in remote locations elsewhere in the Torres Strait and around Australia. </para><para>On Mabuiag Island I met with the council CEO, Ms Flora Warria, and together with Senator McLucas discussed a range of economic and social development issues, including, but not limited to, the short runway on the islandâan experience to beholdâthe demand for medical and dental services and the then current dengue fever outbreak. On Yorke Island I met the chair of the council, Mr Don Mosby, and discussed the fishing industry, the impediment high transport costs present to development of tourism opportunities, and TSRA reform. </para><para>On Darnley Island I had the great pleasure to meet and speak with the respected leader Mr George Mye about regional governance. Mr George Mye also raised the issue of TSRA reform. I also spoke with Darnley Island council officer Ms Shelly Houghton about issues that concerned the council, including the high cost of living for island residents. Finally, on Darnley Island I met with the Principal of the Darnley Island State School, Ms Diann Lui, who gave me a tour of a proposed cultural centre site on school grounds and showed me some of the work created by her students.</para><para>I have sought to canvass some of the issues I confronted during my short visit to the Torres Strait. I have done so because issues of this type get an all too rare airing in this parliament. As I said at the outset, I think that is in part due to the remote location of the Torres Strait and in part due to the quality of the Indigenous affairs ministers under this government. Having said that, I recognise that Senator Vanstone is new to the portfolio and I hope she will surprise me. I thank Senator McLucas for sharing with me her knowledge of the Torres Strait, which was critically important for my visit there in understanding and coming to grips with some of the issues and for introducing me to some of the people who were very helpful in making me aware of the issues in the region.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Defence: Darwin Wharf</title><page.no>20600</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>20600</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to say a few words tonight about a matter of national security significance, and that is the continuing access to Navy of the wharf facilities in the port of Darwin. A plan for the Northern Territory government to develop the Darwin wharf area for a convention centre and residential development was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Northern Territory</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">News</inline> late last year. Thereafter, and I stress `thereafter', the Northern Territory government said that it wanted to negotiate with Navy itsâthat is Navy'sâfuture birthing arrangements subject to the new development. </para></talk.start><para>I indicated to the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory my disappointment that Defence had not been consulted prior to the public release of the planâan approach which seemed to indicate a disinterest in the defence consequences of the plan. I further indicated that I would respond in detail as to Navy's present and future requirements. I provided the detailed requirements to the Chief Minister on 24 December last year. On 18 February she responded that Navy's operational requirements had been anticipated by Northern Territory officials and could be accommodated in the plan. The Chief Minister confirmed this to me personally on 19 February. On 25 February 2004 the Chief Minister answered a question in the Northern Territory parliament in which she reiterated that the Darwin city waterfront project team had anticipated Defence needs and that there are `essentially no problems meeting the operational needs of Navy within the development of the Darwin waterfront'. As I understand it, the bids from the three parties that had been invited to tender were on the basis of her satisfaction that Navy's interests could be accommodated within that plan.</para><para>Commonwealth and Northern Territory officials will now commence a dialogue on this matter. However, I should say that there are significant issues of concern to Navy. The proposal includes intense urban development close to the wharf at which warships birth. It means a significant reduction in the fuel capabilities of Stokes Hill, in that fuel will no longer be able to be landed from the sea, and the option of trucking fuel to Stokes Hill can at best be regarded as short term. It also means major urban and cultural development adjacent to fuel lines. It therefore raises serious issues of the ability of Navy and visiting warships to be able to use the wharf facilities as in the past.</para><para>These matters are of serious concern to the federal government. Darwin is of strategic importance. Access to the wharf is important for operations, exercises and support. Honourable senators will remember the importance of the wharf facilities for the East Timor deployment not so long ago. Access is of course also important in the defence relationship with our allies. If Darwin were to win ship-swap work with the United States, it would be important for that as well.</para><para>It would have been better, of course, if the Commonwealth had been consulted before the plan was published, but the Northern Territory government instead put its urban and social development plans as its first priority. The Commonwealth government understands the desire of the Northern Territory government to develop its Darwin foreshore. However, it should also be reminded of its responsibility to Australia's defence and of the economic benefits that it might forgo. Defence is a major contributor to the Northern Territory economy, with much greater potential for the future. Having said that, the Commonwealth will discuss these matters further with the Northern Territory in good faithânotwithstanding the political manoeuvrings of that government to date on this particular matter. We hope that a resolution of these issues can be found, but it is not going to be a straightforward matter. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>New South Wales: Redfern Protests</title><page.no>20601</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>20601</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAt about 10.30 on the evening of 15 February this year, I was attempting to get to Redfern station. I encountered at that time an enormous police presence in the area. I have lived in the area of Redfern station for several years and I have regularly seen a large police presence in that area. Relations between the Aboriginal community and the police in Redfern have a long history. In the heart of the area known as `the Block' is Pemulwuy Park. Pemulwuy was an Aboriginal warrior from the Eora nation, the traditional owners of the Block and of most of Sydney. He was a leader of the resistance against colonisation and fought in many battles in Parramatta and other parts of Sydney. He was shot and captured by police. He escaped from custody but was eventually shot and killed. He was decapitated and his head was sent to England as a gift to Sir Joseph Banks. In more recent history, instances of police abuse of Aboriginal people were documented by the Council for Civil Liberties and date back to the 1960s. In the early 1970s the first Aboriginal legal service in Australia was established in Redfern, because of police harassment of Aboriginal people in the area. By the mid- to late-1980s, riots between police and young Aboriginal people were relatively common.</para></talk.start><para>I quote here from an unpublished opinion piece written by Associate Professor Chris Cunneen, the Director of the Institute of Criminology at University of Sydney law school. An investigation by the Federal Human Rights Commissioner in 1990 over the use of tactical response police in raids on Eveleigh Street and the surrounding area of the Block found that the police used excessive force and that the justifications for the raids exhibited institutional racism. At the same time an investigation by the Ombudsman's office into the raids found that the search warrants were invalidly obtained by police. The previous year, in neighbouring Marrickville, tactical response police had shot dead in the doorway of his bedroom an innocent Aboriginal man by the name of David Gundy. The raid on David Gundy's house also involved the use of illegally obtained search warrants by the police. The police raid was unlawful. Several years later the New South Wales Police paid compensation to Gundy's widow and son.</para><para>The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody that investigated 66 deaths in police custody reported in 1991. Hal Wootten, the Royal Commissioner for New South Wales, found that many of the deaths were preventable. The last decade has brought widespread disappointment with the royal commission among Aboriginal people. Police officers involved in specific deaths appear to have never faced any consequences for their action, while the implementation of the recommendations from the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody has stalled. Fundamental to the findings of the royal commission was the need to reduce Aboriginal imprisonment rates. In reality, Aboriginal imprisonment has increased at a faster rate than non-Aboriginal imprisonment.</para><para>It would be wrong to assume that the New South Wales Police have not changed over the last decade. Events such as the conflict on Sunday, 15 February are relatively rare in New South Wales now. The use of police tactical response groups is less frequent in Aboriginal communities. The police force has now released its second three-year Aboriginal strategic plan, which has a central focus on improving Aboriginal and police relations. Yet, at the same time, there are still constant complaints of police harassment, particularly from Aboriginal youth. There has also been a focus on zero tolerance style police operations and the use of public order legislation that clearly targets young people. For every step forward to improved relations, there has also been another step towards more criminal justice policies which inevitably target the most marginalised groups in society. </para><para>Although the relevance and memory of the history of events around Redfern are forgotten by most politicians and the public at large, they remain an important part of Aboriginal knowledge in the Redfern area. It goes a long way to explaining why many Indigenous people were ready to believe immediately that police were involved in the death of T.J. Hickey and why there is a depth of trauma in the community that can so easily spill over to a riot. My Greens colleague in the New South Wales parliament, Lee Rhiannon, has pursued a range of issues raised by the community at the Block about T.J.'s death and the role of the New South Wales Police. She has asked questions in parliament about why the officers moved T.J. from the fence without calling for appropriate emergency rescue services or an ambulance and why the police officers involved made their first radio call for back-up rather than for emergency services or an ambulance.</para><para>The Prime Minister last week jumped into the debate around T.J.'s death. He jumped in firmly on the side of the police. He did so whilst four inquiries into T.J.'s death are being carried out by the New South Wales parliament. It is entirely inappropriate for the Prime Minister to declare that there is no evidence of police involvement in the tragic death of T.J. Hickey. The Prime Minister is not conducting an inquiry, he is not collecting evidence and he is not hearing from witnesses, so he is not in a position to comment. There are legitimate concerns within the community that have been put to the police. The Prime Minister should recognise this and not jump to conclusions. The comments from the Prime Minister reveal an ignorance of the complexity of the situation for the Indigenous community in Redfern. The Prime Minister should visit the Block and speak to the community rather than trying to play populist politics with the tragic death of a young Aboriginal man. I hope that the recent comments by the Prime Minister are not the start of what an ATSIC commissioner has labelled `black bashing'. The acting ATSIC deputy chairman made comments last week that he believed the Prime Minister's recent comments were a sign that black bashing is back on the agenda in the lead-up to the election.</para><para>One of the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody was that all political leaders and their parties need to recognise that reconciliation between the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities in Australia must be achieved if community division, discord and injustice to Aboriginal people are to be avoided. To this end, the royal commission recommended that political leaders use their best endeavours to ensure bipartisan public support for the process of reconciliation and that the urgency and necessity of the process be acknowledged.</para><para>We as a community must not fail our Aboriginal friends. Yet again, where our government appears to be failing on this front, the community needs to stand up for decency, understanding, compassion and justice. We must insist that our Aboriginal colleagues are acknowledged by the government as the original custodians and owners of this great land. The injustices perpetrated against Aboriginal Australians must be acknowledged and redressed. We must not further contribute to the problem by overpolicing communities such as Redfern that are suffering from the loss of a young Aboriginal boy. </para><para>As I attended the memorial service for T.J. Hickey at the Block some time ago, the sirens of the police cars could be heard echoing through the Block as they drove down Lawson Street past Redfern station. This did not help the mood of the community. But the community at the Block have come together to show tremendous strength and unity in standing up against the attacks that they have faced in the New South Wales parliament and in the media, particularly in Sydney. Consultation with the community is what is needed, to hear the voices of the Aboriginal people who have lived in Redfern for so long. It is their community and it is their voices that the Prime Minister in particular needs to be listening to before he makes such comments.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Child Abuse</title><page.no>20603</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>20603</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise tonight to speak about an issue of national importance. It is an issue which needs to be addressed comprehensively by governments of whatever political persuasion in Australia. It is an issue that has been prominent in the media over the past few years and it has impacted on various institutions and governments. Most importantly, it is an issue that has affected, and continues to affect, thousands of children. The human and economic costs are so great that we cannot afford to go on addressing this issue in the same manner as we are currently.</para></talk.start><para>According to a recent study by the Kids First Foundation and the Abused Child Trust, child abuse and neglect costs Australians $5 billion every yearâthat is, $250 for each man, woman and child in this country. Furthermore, reports of abused and neglected children have gone up by 40 per cent in just the last 20 years. Total child protection notifications in Australia increased between 2001-02 and 2002-03 from 138,000 to 198,000âthat is, an additional 60,000 children. As we might expect, Indigenous children were overrepresented in those abuse statistics.</para><para>In <inline font-style="italic">A history of child protection: Back to the future?</inline> by Adam M. Tomison, the author highlights the fragmented nature of the child protection system in Australia. He says:</para><quote><para>The responsibility for Children's Courts and child welfare legislation as it affects children subjected to child abuse and neglect, rests with the individual state and territory governments. As a consequence, there are major variations in child welfare laws governing children in need of care and protection, including how child abuse and neglect are defined, the structure of the child protection system and the child protection services that have been developed and consequently in the reporting, investigation and intervention in cases of suspected and/or substantiated child maltreatment.</para></quote><para>It is also clear from recent reports into child abuse and neglect that the child protection systems across the states and territories are struggling to cope. The serious systematic faults uncovered in the recent Crime and Misconduct Commission report into the Department of Families in Queensland is a warning to the Commonwealth government and the states and territories on how seriously we should take our duty of care to Australia's vulnerable children.</para><para>The picture Australia wide is pretty bleak. According to the ACT Minister for Education, Youth and Family Services, Katy Gallagher, reports of suspected child abuse have gone up 50 per cent nationally in the last year. In October 2003, the <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide Advertiser</inline> reported that 33 cases of child abuseâincluding cases of children exposed to prostitution and drug abuseâhad been reported to Family and Youth Services in one week, but had not been investigated because of insufficient resources. Family and Youth Services in South Australia also failed to act on 38 reports of sex abuse of an eight-year-old girl because of a lack of resources. </para><para>In Victoria the system is overwhelmed with about 40,000 notifications in each year, more than 60 per cent of which are re-notifications, and only one in five of which is `substantiated' as abuse or neglect. More than 60 per cent of children in out-of-home care in Victoria have had four or more previous placements. The <inline font-style="italic">Northern Territory News</inline> reported that figures released by the child protection team revealed that 197 children under the age of 14 contracted sexually transmitted infections in 2003. In October last year, Brisbane's <inline font-style="italic">Courier</inline><inline font-style="italic">-</inline><inline font-style="italic">Mail</inline> reported that an investigation by child protection expert Gwen Murray had found that only 36 per cent of all notifications were investigated within the required 24 hours of being reported. Almost a quarter of the allegations had not been assessed two months after they were first reported. </para><para>New research has indicated that child abuse and neglect can have serious consequences on subsequent growth and development including retarded cognitive development, inability to form meaningful relationships, homelessness and depression, abuse of own children, adult crime and violence, substance abuse, youth suicide and violent or aggressive behaviour. So the lasting effect of abuse and neglect on vulnerable children cannot be overestimated. The 1994 <inline font-style="italic">Alternative Law Journal</inline> reports that 80 to 85 per cent of women in Australian prisons have been victims of incest or other forms of abuse. A study of 27 correctional centres in New South Wales found that 65 per cent of male and female prisoners were victims of child sexual and physical assault, and the New South Wales Child Protection Council reported in 1992 that the probability of future delinquency, adult criminality and arrest for violent crime, increased by around 40 per cent for people assaulted and neglected as children. </para><para>As instances of abuse and neglect rise and the states and territories struggle to cope, it is also clear that the contributing social and environmental factors within families are not being addressed. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has found that child abuse and neglect is associated with low socioeconomic status, alcohol and substance abuse, domestic violence and family disruption. Mental health issues are also a common factor. The Victorian Department of Human Services report into child abuse and neglect in 2003, found that the percentage of parents involved in child protection matters who had a mental illness, had an intellectual or physical disability, suffered from alcohol or substance abuse, or were involved in domestic violence incidents had increased significantly between 1996-97 and 2001-02. In 2001-02, in 40 per cent of cases parents had experienced domestic violence, in 25 per cent of cases parents had problems with substance abuse, in 21 per cent of cases there were problems with alcohol abuse, and in 15 per cent of cases parents had a mental illness. The greatest increase was in substance abuse, which doubled from 12.5 per cent of parents to 25.2 per cent.</para><para>So it is very clear to me that families involved in the child protection system face many difficulties and challenges. If we are going to stem the rising tide of child abuse and neglect then we have to realise that this is an Australia-wide problem and I think the Commonwealth government needs to take an Australia-wide approach. The Commonwealth government currently funds a number of projects and initiatives to tackle child abuse, including the Early Intervention Parenting and Good Beginnings prototype projects, but these are clearly local initiatives and only a drop in the ocean. We need a national strategy which removes the disparities between the states and territories. We now have a national framework for tackling bullying and abuse in schools but funds and determination, particularly at the state level, are essential for progress. </para><para>The Productivity Commission showed that the national average amount spent on child protection varies enormously from state to stateâfor example, $227 per child is spent in News South Wales compared with just $187 in South Australia. My colleague Kate Reynolds in the South Australian parliament pointed out as recently as last week that the Rann government still has not responded to a report made to it some 14 months ago. We need to educate parents by investing in and adopting an early intervention focus which works with families to help them overcome and deal more effectively with the social and environmental risk factors that are becoming so prevalent in our society. </para><para>According to the Australian Institute of Family Studies, centre based parent education has considerable benefits because it offers parents a chance to meet other parents, breaks down isolation, helps program participants find their own supports in the community and provides opportunities to share and normalise feelings. However, the institute concludes that there is very little information available regarding access to child abuse prevention services, including group based parent education.</para><para>I think it is time for action. The Commonwealth government and the state and territory governments have to start taking responsibility for education and protecting Australia's children. Leadership needs to be shown otherwise we will never get to grips with the task of preventing the enormous damage that is currently being done to our children and young people.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Capital Territory</title><page.no>20605</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>20605</page.no><name role="metadata">Humphries, Sen Gary</name><name role="display">Senator HUMPHRIES</name><name.id>KO6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise tonight to reflect on the way in which the Australian Capital Territory has fared under the present federal coalition government. In the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times </inline>a few weeks ago the Chief Minister of the ACT, Jon Stanhope, was quoted as saying:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Canberra is in fine fettle. The town is lovely. I don't think it has ever looked better ... people are essentially happy; they are contented; they think it is doing very well. The economy has never been stronger. The Budget position is really good. Unemployment is at an all-time low. </para></quote><para>As a rule, I have little reason to quote and agree with the comments of the Labor Chief Minister of the ACT, but I do agree with his comments in that statement. Where I would part company from him is in the analysis of why Canberra at the present time is booming in economic and other terms. The answer lies in something that the Deputy Chief Minister said before the 2001 ACT election. He said:</para><quote><para>It's clear that a large slice of the ACT's current favourable economic position is due to riding the crest of a national wave in growth. Importantly, there has been a significant increase in Commonwealth funding over the period of the current Assembly.</para></quote><para>That statement is as true today as it was in 2001, but I doubt that Mr Quinlan would care to repeat it. The social dividends of running a strong growth economy are jobs and increased spending on services that are important to the citizens of this city, as they are to citizens of other parts of Australiaâspending in health, education and so on. The Canberra experience demonstrates this very clearly. Unemployment in the ACT is now under four per cent from 7.8 per cent in June 1996.</para><para>We have benefited from the politically courageous decision of the federal government to introduce the GST, a growth tax which of course goes to the states and territories. The last federal budget allocated $20 million in GST revenue to the ACT governmentâ$10 million above the guaranteed amount that would have come to the ACT prior to the new tax system being implemented. This means that the money flowing to Canberra since the inception of the GST will have increased by 35 per cent. This is the biggest percentage increase in any state or territory in Australia. On top of this, in 2003 the ACT government received $32 million from the Commonwealth in local government assistance grants, a boost of 3Â½ per cent on the previous year. </para><para>Canberra has a well-educated and adaptable work force. It is therefore no surprise that the ACT is at the forefront of Australia's knowledge industries. The coalition government has recognised this and in 2003 allocated over $8 million to Canberra based IT firms under the R&amp;D Start program. That money was almost a third of the national total available under that program. That is not bad for a community that the federal government is supposed not to favour. Our highly educated work force is surely linked to the ACT having some of the best public schools in the nation. The Commonwealth is helping to consolidate this position. Last year, the federal budget announced a six per cent increase in funding for government schools in the ACT, despite the fact that enrolments in government schools had fallen by two per cent in the previous year. </para><para>Of course, increased inputs sometimes does not equate to better outcomes in education. When this government came to office, it found that almost one in three primary school students could not read or write to a suitable standard. The coalition responded to this by introducing its comprehensive plan to test students against national literacy and numeracy standards. We believe it is the right of all parents to know whether their child has gained these essential literacy skills, which is why the Australian government has secured the agreement of the ACT government to provide this information in years 3 and 5 student reports to all parents.</para><para>Child care is another issue of importance to ACT parents. Late last year the coalition government, I think, responded magnificently to concerns raised by me and other people about the shortage of outside school hours places in the ACT by allocating a nationwide boost of 10,000 extra places to child care of that kind. Of those 10,000 places, the ACT received 1,177, 12 per cent of the total. Again, that is not bad for a city which is supposed not to be favoured by the federal government. </para><para>The coalition has also delivered on aged care in the territory. Since 1996, the ACT has been allocated 660 new aged care places. In the most recent round of approvals the ACT was allocated an extra 121 places, almost double the number approved in 2002. The Australian government's planning framework for aged care aims to provide 100 aged care places for every 1,000 people aged 70 years or over. As a result of those extra places, the total in the ACT is now 107 per 1,000 people aged over 70.</para><para>This Commonwealth commitment to the health of the ACT community does not stop at aged care. The Australian health care agreement, signed last year, will boost Commonwealth funding for Canberra's public hospitals by $148 million over the next five years, an increase of 17 per cent in real terms. The low rate of bulk-billing in the ACT has been addressed by the Commonwealth's decision to include the ACT as part of the More Doctors for Outer Metropolitan Areas scheme.</para><para>The key claim made by many on the other side in this place about the Howard government's approach to Canberra is embodied in the claim made by the shadow minister for the arts that somehow the Howard government engages in a war on culture and that Canberra's national institutions are in the firing line. It never fails to bemuse me, when I hear that claim, how those critics reconcile that claim with the fact that it was the government of John Howard which, after a decade or more of dithering by successive Labor governments, took the decision to build the centrepiece of our national cultural institutions a few years ago with the construction of the National Museum of Australia at the cost of $155 million. That was an achievement of the Howard governmentâthe government which is supposed not to believe in or support Australia's and Canberra's cultural institutions. The Howard government demonstrates its commitment to the National Museum of Australia by maintaining funding at around $40 million, almost doubling the funding allocated in the 2000-01 budget.  </para><para>Other institutions have similarly been generously treated by this government. In the last budget, for example, the National Archives received a $2.8 million boost, the National Gallery an extra $1.3 million and the National Library an additional $1.5 million. Again, claims by Labor that there have been cuts to those institutions simply are not true. Screensound, over which Labor has made a particularly big case in recent times, was extended and extensively refurbished by this very government, which supposedly is waging a war on culture. Disaster relief of $3 million was given to Canberra after the January 2003 bushfires; there has been very extensive jobs growth in the Australian Public Service in Canberra as a result of the last budget; $23 million in local roads grants, Roads to Recovery funding and black spot funding; 84 places at the new ANU Medical School; and an additional $15 million over the next three years for universities in Canberra. The list goes on.</para><para>If the coalition government has an anti-Canberra agenda, its actions at least in the last 12 months simply do not support that claim. Perhaps its critics might believe that somehow the federal government is trying to kill Canberra with kindness. The Canberra community has benefited very generously from the actions of the federal Liberal coalition government. Those actions have translated into enormous jobs growth and economic growth in this city. That growth is not attributable to other factors; it is attributable primarily to the generosity of the federal government. </para><para>Truth will be a casualty in any election campaign, but I put Labor on notice that I will be exposing any hyperbole, misrepresentation or misinformation about the record of this government in its treatment of this city, which, after all, is the product of successive Liberal-National governments over many years.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Liberal Party of Australia</title><page.no>20607</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>20607</page.no><name role="metadata">Tchen, Sen Tsebin</name><name role="display">Senator TCHEN</name><name.id>86Y</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAfter the Senate adjourned at the end of the 2003 spring sittings, the Victorian division of the Liberal Party conducted its preselection process for candidates for the Senate at the next election. There were a large number of nomineesâeight including me. The result of the preselection was that I was unsuccessful in my bid to be re-endorsed as a candidate. Consequently, my term as a member of this august forum will end in June 2005, barring of course the unlikely event of a double dissolution of parliament.</para></talk.start><para>Preselection by the party I represent is an affair internal to the party that I represent. Normally I would not speak in this chamber on this topic and until today I have not. However, two weeks ago, unbeknown to me at that time, the member for Maribyrnong, Mr Bob Sercombe, made a statement in the other place on this matterâa premature valedictory. Surely it would be churlish of me to ignore him and not respond. Thus I rise tonight to speak on this rather personal topic and I thank the Senate for its indulgence. </para><para>While I appreciate that Mr Sercombe regarded my performance so highlyâ`an extraordinarily hard-working senator' was the phrase he used, although presumably he did not use the performance of my Liberal colleagues as a benchmark because, if he had, he would have realised that my performance is just ordinary; obviously he was using other senators as a benchmarkâas to make my affairs the subject of his statement, I would have been considerably more moved and gratified had he not used his statement as an opportunity to denigrate the Liberal Party. Even so, I do appreciate his kind words about me. I appreciate even more the interjection made by the member for Reid, Mr Laurie Ferguson, who confirmed that I was indeed a hard-working senator. I appreciate this especially because Mr Ferguson interjected when Mr Sercombe was commenting on my performance but remained silent when Mr Sercombe was attacking the Liberal Party. So we know Mr Ferguson's opinion on which part of Mr Sercombe's comments was correct.</para><para>There are two issues arising from Mr Sercombe's statement which I particularly wish to comment on. The first one is about the Liberal Party. As I said earlier, preselection by the Liberal Party is an internal matter. I have the privilege of sitting in this chamber as the result of a gift from the Liberal Party. As my colleague Senator David Johnston said in his first speech, the personal vote he received in the election was something like 0.1 per cent of the quota to be elected and therefore he was here by virtue of the fact that he represented the Liberal Party. It is the same with me because when I was elected in 1998 I received a grand total personal vote of 125 votes. That is less than 0.001 per cent of the quota. I would not be here if it were not for the Liberal Party's endorsement of me. So I am here as a member of the Liberal Party and I will remain a member of the Liberal Party.</para><para>However, perhaps Mr Sercombe failed to understand the nature of the Liberal Party, because the Liberal Party is a truly democratic party. We have a process where any members have a right to nominate for any position. It is up to the party and the people who represent the affairs of the party to make the best choice at the time of the candidates available to be endorsed representatives of the party. It should not surprise us that Mr Sercombe may not understand that because the Labor Party, although they also describe themselves as a democratic party, really practise a kind of guided democracy. It is not true democracy such as the Liberal Party practises. I am very proud to be and continue to be a member of the Liberal Party and remain in this place until 2005 to serve the Australian and particularly the Victorian people.</para><para>The second issue arising from Mr Sercombe's comments is the general nature of his comments in that he felt it necessary to denigrate, as I said, the Liberal Party over this issue. Despite all this, I knew Mr Sercombe before I came to the parliament. As far as I am concerned, Mr Sercombe and 99 per cent of the members of both chambers who serve this parliament are good, hard-working people who are here to serve the people of Australia.</para><para>It is the nature of our political system that we draw a distinction between the individuals and the collective party that they represent. In this adversarial system that we have, it is necessary for us to attack the work of the other party. However, it is a very fine line and it is very easy to cross from criticising the other party for what they believe in or what they propose to attacking them just because they are a different party. Generally speaking in Australia, for whatever historical or sociological reason, we have this adversarial system. We are one of the few truly democratic countries in the world and yet, in general, in our society we do not regard our politicians highly. We are ambivalent about them. It is an occupational hazard to be criticised for what we do and how we perform. </para><para>Yet, for a true democracy to work, we need people whose real aims and beliefs are to serve the people of the nation. We cannot have that if we continue to denigrate the people who practise that profession. It is particularly distressing when people who are in that profession themselves, through their actions or through their anxiety perhaps to show themselves different from the other party, criticise people for issues other than policies.</para><para>Earlier my colleague Senator Humphries was talking about the Howard government's contribution to the development of cultural facilities in Canberra. These are facts, and yet the story out there, as he recounted it, was total, almost mindless criticism and denigration of the Howard government's record in providing cultural facilities in Canberraânot just in Canberra but right across Australia. We speak of Australia as being a sporting nation. In fact, the figures will show that the Howard government has invested more in Australia's culture than in our sports. That is something that nobody talks about or gives the Howard government credit for.</para><para>It is important for members and colleagues in this place when we speak about politics to make the distinction between what is actually true and what we believe should be true. We should not make it such that anything we do not believe in is therefore black and untrue. Denigrating and demeaning people who serve the nation, in the long term, does not actually serve the nation.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tasmania: Air Services</title><page.no>20609</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>20609</page.no><name role="metadata">Barnett, Sen Guy</name><name role="display">Senator BARNETT</name><name.id>00AUF</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn Monday, 1 March I hailed the decision by Airservices Australia to install a $10 million transportable radar at Launceston airport. Launceston won the right to have the radar ahead of other Australian locations, and I am thrilled that we have managed to secure the service. I now believe this will eliminate concerns that Tasmanians and the interstate travelling public may have held about Launceston airport as a result of previously publicised aviation incidents. I also understand that the radar will provide some coverage to north-western and southern airports. In that regard, I give credit to Senator Richard Colbeck for his hard work to improve air safety in Tasmania.</para></talk.start><para>I wrote to and contacted executives of Airservices Australia some weeks ago to lobby for the radar to be considered for Launceston airport, given that Airservices Australia had mentioned Launceston when announcing its review of new air safety procedures. This tremendous news came just two weeks after the Bureau of Meteorology reversed a decision to fully automate the weather station at Launceston airport. It now has plans to retain staff at the northern bureau and to relocate it to a Launceston city shopfront. The opening of a weather shop in Launceston's CBD is a first for Australia. If it is successful, and I believe it will be, the weather shop concept could be replicated around Australia. This initiative by the weather bureau will bring benefits to the farming and fishing industries and indeed to the local aviation industry. It will include a $350,000 upgrade of the facilities and services at the Launceston airport.</para><para>I want to now turn to a deeply disturbing concern regarding the proposed new Qantas and Jetstar services for Tasmania. These are vital because we, as a state, are surrounded by water and have few options in terms of travel to and from the mainlandâit is either by air or by ship. Seventy per cent of all travel is by air. My office has been inundated with complaints about the new Jetstar luggage and ticketing plans and the new plans generally. I have urged Jetstar and its owner, Qantas, to seriously review its plans because elderly citizens, disabled people and families are angry about having to recheck their luggage on mainland connecting Qantas flights and about having to deal with multiple web sites to make bookings online for connecting flights. On Sunday, my wife, Kate, and family attended the annual general meeting of the Motor Neurone Disease Association. Two of the members were in wheelchairs and others clearly were physically disabled. It will be diabolical for these people and their families to have to recheck their luggage in Melbourne. Is it right that air travel should only be for the fit and the healthy? Travellers are also upset about not being able to accrue Qantas frequent flyer points on Jetstar flights, even though the airline is wholly owned by Qantas. You can acquit points but you cannot accrue them on Jetstar. </para><para>I have organised a lunchtime public meeting at Launceston's Doherty International Hotel on Friday, 5 March between 12.30 p.m. and 1.30 p.m. I have invited Qantas and Jetstar executives to the meeting to explain the changes and to gauge public feedback. Qantas state manager, Roch Van Delft, and Jetstar's head of commercial division, Bruce Buchanan, plan to attend. I have also invited Airservices Australia to explain the air safety benefits of the new transportable radar. I have written to Qantas and Jetstar to express my concerns, and today I met with Qantas's head of government and international relations, David Hawes. I have asked, on both occasions, for a review of the arrangements. I have said many times that I welcome the announcement by Qantas of a progressive increase in flights and seat capacity. There will be a 27 per cent increase by September 2004. There has been an assurance by Qantas that there will be no job losses and that, potentially, there will be an increase in jobs. </para><para>The low-cost fares have been well received. However, in addition to the inconvenience caused by the need to recheck one's baggage and the inability to accrue frequent flyer points, other concerns have become apparent over the last few days. Firstly, people who fly through Melbourne to Sydney or Brisbane and who wish to gain a low-cost Jetstar fare will have to travel 40-odd minutes to Avalon airport on a bus or a taxi. You are also required to check in at the counter at least 30 minutes prior to your flight. If you are late, you will lose your money. Secondly, if you are flying through Melbourne to another destination, you have to collect your baggage. The minimum wait between arrival and departure is 90 minutes, much longer than the current arrangements.</para><para>On Jetstar there are no allocated seats, so it is first in best dressedâsubject to children, families and the elderly, I understand. If the weight of your baggage is over the limit, you pay extra and, of course, there is no food or drinks. Those who have already booked on Qantas after 26 May, when Jetstar plans to commence in Tasmania, may be required to fly Jetstar. Lawyers other than me will no doubt look at the contractual arrangements for this and at the current and future arrangements for Qantas Club membership. Today the business community in Tasmania, through the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, have expressed their significant concerns. They have specified them in dot point format, in meetings with Qantas and through the media. Travel agents have expressed their concerns directly to me and to others with regard to the proposed arrangements. I was advised today that pets are not allowed on these flights, but this has not yet been confirmed. I have also been advised that unaccompanied children will not be allowed. </para><para>What is the overall impact of these changes on our tourism industry? Who will benefit and who will be disadvantaged? These questions need to be answered. I am into solutions. I am prepared to work with Qantas and Jetstar to get to the solutions, but I believe Qantas and Jetstar representatives have not yet been fully apprised of the views of the Tasmanian community, including those with disabilities, older people, families and parents with young children. As I asked earlier, is air travel simply for the fit and healthy or is it for all Australians? </para><para>I accept that Qantas is attempting to create a low-cost airlineâthat is fine, we live in a free country and it is entitled to do that; it is based on experiences in Europe and on airlines like Ryanairâbut, if there is not an adequate review, there is every chance that Tasmanians will vote with their feet and fly with another airline. That is what competition is all about, but in Tasmania we do not have that many options. We are an island state and 70 per cent of our travel is by air.</para><para>I pose one final question: what are the state Labor government doing about this? Their silence is deafening. They should be strongly advocating the views of the people of Tasmaniaânot sitting on their hands, but arguing for a review by Qantas and Jetstar and for better arrangements. I truly hope that the outcomes of the public meeting this Friday will deliver benefits in terms of much improved arrangements for air travel for the people of Tasmania. I have a particular concern for people with disabilities, and I am concerned that the bulk of this air travel as proposed by Qantas and Jetstar will cause enormous inconvenience to these people and their families. I am involved with a number of disability groups, and they have expressed their views to me in no uncertain terms. I implore and urge Qantas and Jetstar to review their arrangements and to see if they can be properly and fairly accommodated.</para><para>Finally, another view that has been put to me is that this is the beginning of the end of Qantas's arrangements in terms of flying air travellers to and from Tasmania. We will have one flight from Launceston to Melbourne and one flight from Launceston to Sydney per day, and two from Hobart to Melbourne and one from Hobart to Sydney. Is this the precursor of Qantas pulling out? I do not know; I hope not. Can that guarantee be given? I do not know. We will be asking that question of Qantas and Jetstar. For the sake of the Tasmanian people, I hope that the arrangements can be concluded and improved markedly for the benefit of all Tasmanians.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>O'Farrell, Professor Patrick James</title><page.no>20611</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>20611</page.no><name role="metadata">Stephens, Sen Ursula</name><name role="display">Senator STEPHENS</name><name.id>00AOS</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak of the recent loss to this country and to celebrate the life and contribution of Professor Patrick O'Farrell, who died last Christmas Day.

I have chosen this volume for a few reasons: first, to remind us of his lively mind and fresh way of seeing; also, to illustrate what a careful and meticulous thinker he was; and, most of all, perhaps, for the sheer pleasure of feeling his presence here in this place, because his style is utterly distinctive. Here is how he describes the early days of the colony: </para><quote><para>To this distant tip for human garbage, this refuge for refuse, this utilitarian colonial experiment, came the archaic, melancholy, humorous, religious, contradictory and occasionally indomitable Irishry, maddeningly pre-modern, non-conformist, and volatile, dividing and hesitating in the face of possible destinies.</para></quote><para>It is clear what his colleague Professor John Carmody meant when he described Professor O'Farrell's style as `an enchanting blend of wit, lucid scrutiny and stylistic elegance'.</para><para>Since 40 per cent of Australians claim an Irish connection, it is worth focusing for a few moments on Professor O'Farrell's argument that the Irish have been the dynamic factor in Australian historyâwhat he called `the galvanising force at the centre of the evolution of our national character'. He boldly claimed that we owe the egalitarianism of which we are so rightly proud to the Irish, the biggest minority group in Australia from European settlement in 1788. He said:</para><quote><para>The distinctive Australian identity was not born in the bush, nor at Anzac Cove: these were merely situations for its expression. No; it was born in Irishness protesting against the extremes of Englishness.</para></quote><para>If this argument sounds a little extreme to some, Patrick would be delighted: he encouraged debate, celebrated questioning and loved the intellectual cut and thrust of a good argument.</para><para>I must point out that his sense of the Irish who shaped our identity is not that familiar, even clichd, picture of sentimental ballad singers with an equal fondness for blarney and the bottle and a tendency to solve their problems by violent means. He had no time at all for clichs or clichd, lazy thinking. He based his argument on studious research into the Irish involvement in such issues as education, conscription, immigration, sectarianism, labour and capital. From this knowledge base, he argued that what drove and inspired the Irish was their `faith in a structured, peaceful society as a cradle of civilisation and human values'. No small ambition! He went on to argue that the Irish fought for the right to be included in the opportunities and prosperity that this country offered, rather than to be kept marginalised as a peasant class under the continued domination of British influence. In other words, it is thanks to the Irishâand no doubt a great relief to us allâthat Australia did not evolve into a mini-England.</para><para>While that, in a nutshell, is what he is principally remembered for, he was not Irish and he never wanted to be. It seems to me that Patrick O'Farrell's interpretation of our history has an application far beyond our Anglo-Celtic beginnings. I think it catches something of what makes this such a wonderful country: the opportunities here for everyone, whatever their origin or background, to better themselves and to have a shaping influence on society.</para><para>Those of us who were fortunate enough to hear Gerry Adams speak last month at the National Press Club will be aware that the relationship between Ireland and its nearest offshore island has been one of colonialism and domination, and many members of this chamber will have in their time studied that troubled history. Our library shelves are full of accounts of British history and the problem referred to as `the Irish question'. In this context, it is interesting to note the title of Professor O'Farrell's 1971 book, <inline font-style="italic">Ireland's English Question</inline>. It was this ability to literally turn an accustomed way of seeing on its head, to look at old problems in new ways, that made him such an exceptional historian. I think it is worth noting that, despite Ireland's sorry history of violence over the past two centuries, the Irish in Australia achieved what they did without resorting to violence. </para><para>It is tempting to think of historians as being absorbed in the past, but the reason we value and encourage the study of history and the humanities is that it contributes to our understanding of the human character and helps us to improve our world. One of Professor O'Farrell's students at the University of New South Wales, Elizabeth Malcolmâwho herself went on to become Professor, Gerry Higgins Chair of Irish Studies, at the University of Melbourneâpoints out that O'Farrell's insights into political violence were especially profound. His writing in the context of the troubles in Northern Ireland in the early seventies are pertinent to us all today. He said:</para><quote><para>Situations may develop in human affairs which eventually imprison men and events in some kind of historical trap from which they are unable to escape.</para></quote><para>Having just returned from Israel, my thoughts fly to the complexities of the Arab-Israeli relations and to today's exciting news that perhaps peace is finally a little closer. He continues, and here our thoughts might go to recent events in Iraq:</para><quote><para>It is often claimed that once the gunman and the bomber have been caught, all will be well. But ... a relatively low level of actual violence could sustain a really destructive, divisive force, a relatively high level of suspicion, fear and hatred. It would be possible to reduce greatly the incidence of violent acts, without any corresponding degree of immediate settlement of the problem.</para></quote><para>These speculations about Ireland proved only too true and provide insights into what is happening today in other parts of the world. I have quoted enough of Patrick's work for us all to hear the care and precision that were hallmarks of his thinking and therefore his prose. Everything he wrote was carefully considered. In the words of Michael McKernan:</para><quote><para>O'Farrell has never been a comfortable historian. He is eminently readable but he believes that before all else the historian must question, doubt and worry.</para></quote><para>This tendency to interrogate his subject matter gave rise to some insights into such subjects as the formative importance of our sense of community. He wrote that community:</para><quote><para>... is more than a place, it is a proposition, to which people freely and unspeakingly adhere. That proposition is that such people acknowledge that they are involved, engaged, interdependent.</para></quote><para>This is more than just a recording of the facts; it helps us to know who we are as a society and provides direction about how we can go about improving society for the community good. In his early work on the labour movement Professor O'Farrell noted the prominence of the Irish Catholic community and he went on to research the history of another community, the Catholic Church in Australia. This polished, persuasive and humane study received just acclaim, and the words of Father Edmund Campion are an example of this:</para><quote><para>To him more than any other individual, we owe the fact that Catholic intellectual life in Australia is noticeably historical, rather than theological, philosophical or biblical.</para></quote><para>His interests were always wider than the categories of the Irish or the Catholic Church in Australia might suggest to people who have no particular interest in either of those subjects. Here, for instance, are some of his thoughts inspired by his reading of a book edited by Chris McGillion called <inline font-style="italic">A Long Way from Rome: Why the Australian Catholic Church is in Crisis</inline>. I am quoting from Patrick's review of last March in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>, and again we can hear in the movement of his sentences his passion for accuracy and his disciplined pursuit of an idea: </para><quote><para>What would be really surprising is if the Australian Catholic Church were not in crisis. ... For the fact is that every other major western institution is in crisis: the family, political parties, trade unions, universities, law, medicine, the Anglican Church, bowling clubs. If it is an institution, or even merely an organisation, and particularly if it claims any kind of authority or sets out rules, today it has a problem, it is in crisis. Or, rather, multitudes of crises: structural crises, crises of confidence, support, attendance, enthusiasm, purpose, loyalty, unity, direction and, of course, leadership.</para><para>Basically, all authority is in crisis: this is the age of sovereign man, sufficient unto himself ... The ethics of private life have become matters of individual choice rather than mass conformity to external guidelines and rules from on high ... Pondering is what this case needs, and lots of it.</para></quote><para>Patrick O'Farrell's legacy is that he always refused settle for the quick or obvious idea. He spent his life pondering at great length and formidable depth who, what and why we are as we are. He is to be remembered not only for his enormous contribution to the study of Australian history but also for the way in which, through a dozen books and over a hundred articles on a wide range of subjects, his rigorous intellect has expanded our understanding of ourselves and our society.</para><para>It is the nature of an obituary to focus on the individual we have lost, to speak as if that life were separate and separable from others, and of course this is not so. In Patrick O'Farrell's case, it is particularly distorting to present him in isolation because he was an extremely sociable person. Many people depended on him for guidance, support, insight and argument, and he depended on his wide circle of colleagues, students, friends and family to test and hone his ideas. His widow, Deirdre, was his partner in the richest sense, collaborating with him on much of his writing. Their childrenâClare, Gerard, Virginia, Richard and Justinâalso enriched his life and were enriched by him in return. His fierce belief in equality and his scholarly pursuit of that belief won him the love of many and the respect of all. Our thoughts and prayers go to the O'Farrell family, who I know are listening this evening and who of course miss him dearly. We as a society are all the better for having had the pleasure of Patrick O'Farrell's fine mind and lively company.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Ministerial Reply</title><page.no>20614</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>20614</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn closing, I want to comment on two very different speeches that were made during this adjournment debate. One was generous and genuine; the other was full of invective, class and race hatred, ideology and hypocrisy reminiscent of the Stalinist speeches of the forties and fifties. The first speech, the generous and genuine one that I referred to, was from Senator Tsebin Tchen. It is not often you hear a speech that is so genuinely put and so generous in its application. I suggest it is the real stamp of the man, who has been a colleague of ours for some five years now, to see his high praise for the Liberal Party, a party which he is obviously very committed and attached to. It does show that the people of Victoria and the Liberal Party in Victoria were very right five years ago when they elected Senator Tchen to represent them in this parliament. It has certainly been our pleasure to work with Senator Tchen, and I know that we will all very cheerfully and fruitfully work with Senator Tchen during the next year and a bit. </para></talk.start><para>The other speech was from Senator Nettle and was about Redfern. I am never ceased to be amazed by the ultra left wing Greens party and the way they go on in this chamber. Senator Nettle had a problem with Redfern. I will not enter into that. I am from Queensland; I do not really understand the issues and I do not really want to comment on them. But I do know this much about it: it is a New South Wales problem. It is an issue for the New South Wales government. Senator Nettle continually blamed the police and various other authorities, and yet somehow it all became Mr Howard's fault. It was all because of Mr Howard that these things happened. It was the federal government and Mr Howard that, it appeared from her speech, caused all these problems. Not a word of criticism about Mr Carr and the Labor government in New South Wales, because they are on the same side politically as Senator Nettle; although I have to say Senator Nettle is so far left of even the Labor Party that I suspect even they are embarrassed at some of her old style Stalinist approaches.</para><para>Why are all these things always the fault of the only non-Labor government in Australia, the federal governmentâa government that has done such a marvellous job for Australia and a marvellous job for the Indigenous people of Australia? We have done real things for the Indigenous people. If I had three hours I could not list all of the areas where we have given genuine help to a very great people: the Indigenous people of Australia. I can only talk about my areas in forestry and fisheries, where Indigenous people are doing real things, very ably and very happily, and where the Howard government is assisting in that matter. But all we get from the Greens all the time is this ultra left wing rhetoric, this ideological hatred and this class and race hatred that is more reminiscent of the forties and fifties in Stalinist Russia than it is in Australia. The Greens, as I have pointed out on many occasions, have no interest in the environment. They masquerade as an environmental party.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator Ferris</name></talker><para>âWe saw that at estimates.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name></talker><para>âYou have reminded me, Senator Ferris, that there were some 20 hours of estimates committees that involved conservation or the environment. I know that because it was my `pleasure' to sit through all 20 hours. There were people there from the Labor Partyânot a lotâand there were people there from the Democrats every now and again. But in the whole 20 hours of estimates committees on the environment and conservation, not one person from the Greens turned up to challenge the Howard government. I take that to mean they acknowledge that the Howard government is the best government for the environment that this country has ever had. You would think that if they were greens they would at least exercise the pretence of turning up and showing some interest in the environment and conservation, but not for one second of those 20 hours was either of the Greens senators there.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I am really appalled that there are many well-meaning Australians who believe in the environmentâas I know you do, Madam Acting Deputy President, and as I am sure all of us in this chamber doâand that these well-meaning Australians, who like koalas and trees as we all do, are hoodwinked by the Greens into thinking that this is a party that will look after them. If only those well-meaning Australians could watch the Senate or read some of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports, they would see that the Greens never mention the environment. They are not interested in the environment. All of their speeches and their questions at question time are about left wing ideological social issues: hate the Americans, hate the British, hate the establishment, hate the business communityâhate anything that I consider to be genuinely Australian. These people masquerade as environmentalists. I hope that at some time those well-meaning people of Australia who support these people for genuine environmental reasons will understand that the Greens are not a party of the environment. </para><para>If people want to vote for a party for the environment, they will vote for John Howard's Liberal and National Party coalition because this government is genuine about the environment. We have put more money into it; we have done any number of great initiatives for the environment: the Natural Heritage Trust, the Great Barrier Reef, Green Corpsâit goes on and on. This is the genuine party of the environment, but well-meaning people are hoodwinked into voting for the Greens because they think they are environmentalists. In fact, they are nothing more than a party that until recent times would have been called the Communist Party. I suspect there are many young people who do not really understand what the Communist Party was, but certainly people of my generation understand what the Communist Party was all about and they can see it reincarnated today in the Greens party. I urge those who have an interest in the environment to look carefully not at the rhetoric that you see on the grab on TV but at the real actions of the Greens party and understand that they are not a party of the environment.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 8.23 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>20616</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>20616</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following government documents were tabled:</para><quote><para>Grape and Wine Research and Develop-ment CorporationâReport for 2002-03âErrata.</para><para>Native Title ActâNative title represent-ative bodiesâReports for 2002-03â</para><para>Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement Inc.</para><para>Central Queensland Land Council Aboriginal Corporation.</para><para>Goldfields Land and Sea Council Aboriginal Corporation.</para><para>Gurang Land Council (Aboriginal Corporation).</para><para>Ngaanyatjarra Council (Aboriginal Corporation).</para><para>South West Aboriginal Land and Sea Council Aboriginal Corporation.</para><para>Stevedoring Industry Finance CommitteeâReport for 2002-03.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Stevedoring Levy (Collection) Act 1998</inline>âReport for 2003.</para><para>Treatiesâ</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Bilateral</inline>âText, together with national interest analysis and annexuresâConsular Agreement between Australia and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (Hanoi, 29 July 2003).</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Multilateral</inline>âText, together with national interest analysis and annexuresâ</para><para>Amendments, made at Marrakesh 2002, to the Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union (Geneva 1992) as amended by the Plenipotentiary Conference (Kyoto 1994) and by the Plenipotentiary Conference (Minneapolis 1998).</para><para>Withdrawal from the Agreement Establishing the International Fund for Agricultural Development (Rome, 13 June 1976).</para><para>World Tourism Organization (WTO) Statutes (Mexico City, 27 September 1970).</para><para>United NationsâInternational Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial DiscriminationâCommittee on the Elimination of Racial DiscriminationâCommunications no. 26/2002âOpinion (<inline font-style="italic">Replacement for document previously tabled on 11 February 2004</inline>). </para></quote></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>20617</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><quote><para>Corporations ActâAccounting Standard AASB 1046âDirector and Executive Disclosures by Disclosing Entities.</para><para>Currency ActâCurrency (Perth Mint) Determination 2004 (No. 1).</para><para>Export Control ActâExport Control (Orders) Regulationsâ</para><para>Export Control (Fees) Amendment Orders 2003 (No. 2).</para><para>Export Control (Fees) Amendment Orders 2003 (No. 3).</para><para>Prescribed Goods (General) Amend-ment Orders 2004 (No. 1).</para><para>Fisheries Management ActâNorthern Prawn Fishery Management Plan 1995âTemporary Order No. 1 of 2004.</para><para>Quarantine ActâQuarantine Service Fees Amendment Determinations 2003 (No. 1).</para><para>Superannuation Industry (Supervision) ActâRequests from Minister to APRA, dated 28 October 2003 [2].</para><para>Sydney Airport Curfew ActâDispensations granted under section 20âDispensation No. 3/04 [2].</para></quote></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions on Notice</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>20618</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Immigration: Detainees</title><page.no>20618</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1609)</subtitle><id.no>1609</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>20618</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 10 July 2003:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Was detainee Hammed Qhatani ever refused delivery of postcards handed to centre officers at Woomera by nursing staff or anyone else;

In early 2003, following the Australian Government's December 2002 announcement of the selection of this route, the Roads and Traffic Authority (RTA) recalculated the 2001 estimate to produce an âout-turnâ estimate. This estimate took into account inflation since 2001 and included an adjustment to take into account future inflation on works to be carried out in future years. The 2003 out-turn estimate amounted to $395m. Following the recent inclusion of an Australian Government's contribution to the Bandiana Link in the project, this estimate has now risen to $408m, including an Australian Government contribution of $402.2m.  </para><para>(3)	The RTA's concept design for the NSW section includes an 11 metres wide median, except where squirrel glider movements are expected, where the median would be 20 metres wide. The RTA considers these changes to be consistent with existing planning approvals and in keeping with its design guidelines. It considers that the proposed reduction in median width will reduce construction costs and contribute to lower environmental costs, although it has not costed the potential savings. The concept design has some raised median. Before construction commences, the tenderer for the project will be required to prepare a detailed design concept, which will address safety issues among other things. This design may vary from the median widths in the concept design and may include central crash barriers. The design will be assessed by the RTA and subjected to a safety audit before construction can start.</para><para>(4) and (5)	The 1995 Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Effects Statement calculated the likely impact of building proposed route options on accident rates in Albury-Wodonga both on and off route. It used statistics based on overall accident rates on four categories of Victorian roads (local roads, undivided roads, divided roads and freeways) during the previous three years. No comparison was made with accident rates on rural section of the Hume Highway. The road will be built to achieve a high level of safety for users, similar to other new roads. The spacing of proposed interchanges in central Albury comply with RTA road design guidelines. Before construction commences, the tenderer for the project will prepare a detailed design concept, which will be assessed by the RTA and subjected to a safety audit before construction can start.</para><para>(6)	The Hazard and Risk Assessment Update carried out by Granherne in March 2001 dealt with possible accidents in relation to the transport of hazardous goods made no comment on the design of the proposed Albury upgrade or the spacing of its intersections. It included no comparison of the safety of urban and rural sections of the F6.  </para><para>(7)	I understand that a number of reports commissioned by a local community interest group have been forwarded to the Australian Government. The Department of Transport and Regional Services has sent copies of these reports to the RTA for its consideration. As noted earlier, before construction commences, the tenderer for the project will prepare a detailed design concept, which will be assessed by the RTA and subjected to a safety audit before construction can start. I expect that the safety audit will consider the matters raised in the previously mentioned reports.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Immigration: Asylum Seekers </title><page.no>20628</page.no><subtitle><inline font-weight="bold">(Question No. 2435)</inline></subtitle><id.no>2435</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>20629</page.no><name role="metadata">Marshall, Sen Gavin</name><name role="display">Senator Marshall</name><name.id>00AOP</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 1 December 2003: </para></talk.start><para>(1)	Does Australia currently have a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Cambodia in relation to immigration matters and/or the repatriation of failed asylum seekers;
