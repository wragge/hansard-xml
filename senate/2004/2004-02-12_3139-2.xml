We question the evidence submitted at the trial as it has since been admitted by witnesses that their testimony was perjury and in some cases paid for by Australians For Honest Politics Trust Fund.</para><para>3.	We believe the presiding justice contradicted herself in the summing up and instruction to jurors phase of the trial.</para><para>4.	We believe there was no Mens Rea, no intent to commit a crime.</para><para>5.	The jury in the trial were aware of further pending charges what were later dropped and may have unduly biased them.</para><para>6.	We believe that a large number of Australians have been disenfranchised by a co-ordinated campaign of political character assassination.</para><para>7.	We believe the only person who can cause a political party to be deregistered by fraud or misrepresentation, is this case to be the Electoral Commissioner of Queensland, as the responsible authority.

The resolutions relating to the declaration of senators' interests and the establishment of the committee were agreed to on 17 March 1994. The regime is thus 10 years old next month. During this parliament the committee undertook the first comprehensive review of the resolutions since they came into effect and, as a result, recommended a number of changes which were adopted by the Senate on 17 September last year. The most important changes were: (1) a change in the dollar thresholds for declarations of interests and gifts, to take into account the effect of inflation since the resolution came into operation; (2) a new requirement for all senators to make fresh declarations when a new Senate term begins, not just those senators being sworn in; and (3) the removal of the requirements for a separate oral declaration of interests in debate or before divisions on the grounds that the senators' interests are already on the public record in the register. </para><para>The committee also took the opportunity to revise the explanatory notes for the guidance of senators in making declarations and these notes, together with the consolidated resolutions and the forms determined by the committee, were published in a new information booklet tabled in October last year and distributed to all senators. In this report the committee notes a slight increase in requests for public access to the register and recommends the continuation of its practice of tabling regular six-monthly updates to the register. I commend the report to the Senate.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>HEALTH: DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>20104</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>20104</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senateâ</para><para>	(a)	notes that:</para><para>	(i)	42 million women, men and children are living with HIV/AIDS globally, with more than 95 per cent of these people living in developing countries,</para><para>	(ii)	more than 3 million die each year of AIDS (8 500 a day),</para><para>	(iii)	there are more than 7.4 million people living with HIV/AIDS in Asia and the Pacific,</para><para>	(iv)	every year, 2 million people die of tuberculosis (TB) (i.e. more than 5 000 a day) and 8 million develop active TB,</para><para>	(v)	malaria kills between 1 and 2 million people each year,</para><para>	(vi)	there are more than 3 million con-firmed cases of malaria in South-East Asia and the Pacific each year,</para><para>	(vii)	the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly in 2001, is already saving lives, contributing to placing 700 000 people on anti-retroviral treatment for HIV/AIDS, detecting and treating more than 2 million TB cases and providing 64 million bed nets to protect people from malaria transmission,</para><para>	(viii)	2 years after its creation, the fund is facing a massive shortfall in funding, and</para><para>	(ix)	according to the Equitable Contri-butions Framework, Australia should be contributing 1.2 per cent of the fund's resources, or $AU110 million for the period 2002 to 2004; and</para><para>	(b)	urges the Government to join the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Japan and France in contributing to the fund, in accordance with the Equitable Contributions Framework.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUDGET</title><type>Budget</type><page.no>20104</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration by Legislation Committees</title><page.no>20104</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Additional Information</title><page.no>20104</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>20104</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator FERRIS</name><name.id>5L6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAt the request of the chair of the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee, Senator Tierney, I present additional information received by the committee relating to supplementary hearings on the budget estimates for 2003-04.</para></talk.start></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BILLS RETURNED FROM THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>20104</page.no><id.no></id.no></debateinfo><para>Message received from the House of Representatives agreeing to the amendments made by the Senate to the following bill:</para><quote><para><inline ref="R1750">Migration Legislation Amendment (Identification and Authentication) Bill 2003</inline></para></quote></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NATIONAL MEASUREMENT AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>20105</page.no><id.no>R1932</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>20105</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill received from the House of Representatives.</para><para>Senator IAN CAMPBELL (Western AustraliaâManager of Government Business in the Senate) (9.39 a.m.)âI move: </para><motion><para>That this bill may proceed without formalities and be now read a first time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>20105</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Senator IAN CAMPBELL (Western AustraliaâManager of Government Business in the Senate) (9.40 a.m.)âI move:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>â</para><para><inline ref="R1932">NATIONAL MEASUREMENT AMENDMENT BILL 2003</inline></para><para>The National Measurement Amendment Bill 2003 is a Bill to amend the National Measurement Act 1960. This is the legislation that establishes Australia's national measurement system and provides the basis for setting and regulating measurement standards.</para><para>The National Measurement Act gives effect to the Commonwealth's constitutional power for âweights and measuresâ, granted under section fifty oneâsubsection fifteen of the Australian Constitution. </para><para>No doubt, when the Constitution was drawn up, âweights and measuresâ had a more limited meaning than can be attributed to it today. Measurement functions today cover a wide spectrum of physical and chemical, legal and biological standards and measuring techniques. </para><para>The National Measurement Amendment Bill delivers the Government's announcement in the 2003/2004 Budget that it would establish a National Measurement Institute that will cover all these aspects of measurement. </para><para>Measurement underpins every aspect of our lives. It is the foundation for all forms of disease diagnosis and health care, forensic science, environmental monitoring, occupational health and safety, and consumer confidence and protection. It provides the basis for successful trade and commerce. It drives the continuous development of science, technology and industry innovation. </para><para>Every nation has a profound reliance on its ability to measure accurately. </para><para>Government has a crucial role in maintaining and fostering the development of a rigorous and cohesive metrology system that links to international measurement standards and is responsive to changing technologies and international trade demands.</para><para>Many measurement requirements are supported by legislation or regulation. These aspects become part of Australia's legal metrology system.</para><para>This Bill will enhance the operation of our measurement system and the way in which measurement services are delivered to government and industry.</para><para>Establishing the National Measurement Institute involves the amalgamation of three government agencies that currently provide measurement standards and services to government and industry in Australia. </para><para>By doing this, national functions in physical, chemical and biological measurement will be brought together into a single agency and under a single legal metrology framework. </para><para>The National Measurement Institute will be formed by amalgamating the National Measurement Laboratory, a national facility within CSIRO; the National Standards Commission; and the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories.</para><para>The National Measurement Laboratory maintains and develops Australia's national standards of physical measurement. It's against these standards that we set our measurement of mass, area, length, voltage, time, volume and light. On-going developments in these measurement standards provide industry with the tools to take Australia to the forefront of innovation and technological development. The National Measurement Laboratory also provides services in calibration against our primary standards of measurement that are vital to government and industry. </para><para>The National Standards Commission administers our legal metrology system under the National Measurement Act 1960. It provides testing and approval of the basic designs of measuring instruments for use in trade and commerce. It also has a regulatory role with regard to utility meters.  </para><para>The Australian Government Analytical Laboratories provide a wide range of chemical and biological measurement services. AGAL has an international reputation for its quality production of chemical and biological measurement standards. Its measurement services support key programs of Australian government agencies, such as the forensic work of the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Customs Service; the drugs-in-sport testing program of the Australian Sports Drug Agency; the National Residue Survey of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry; as well as food import standards required by AQIS. AGAL also provides chemical and biological measurement services to industry that help underpin developments in new techniques, including in the areas of biotechnology.</para><para>The Government's announcement of a National Measurement Institute has been welcomed by industry. The new institute will provide a one-stop shop and better coordinated support for industry clients. Some clients, like those in the electricity and gas industries, need physical, chemical and legal measurement services. These will now be delivered by a single agency.</para><para>New enabling technologies, such as biotechnology and nanotechnology, span the traditional disciplines. Measurement in these areas draws on physical, chemical and biological techniques. The National Measurement Institute, with expertise in all these areas, will better support these new technologies. </para><para>The National Measurement Institute will provide national leadership in legal metrology. It will work with State and Territory weights and measures bodies to foster compliance with measurement standards in commerce. </para><para>To ensure the strategic direction and work of the institute remain focussed on the needs of stakeholders, an advisory forum representative of key stakeholders will be set up to provide advice on these aspects.</para><para>The Bill establishes the National Measurement Institute within the Department of Industry Tourism and Resources. </para><para>The National Standards Commission will be dissolved and its staff, together with staff from the National Measurement Laboratory and the Australian Government Analytical laboratories, will form the National Measurement Institute.</para><para>Having the National Measurement Institute within the Department will provide a strong corporate support network for the new institute and enable better coordination with government policy objectives.</para><para>In keeping with the governance arrangements for the institute, metrological functions of the Commonwealth are vested in the Secretary of the Department. Key metrological functions are set out in the Bill. These functions are representative of the broad scope of tasks the institute will undertake and measurement services it will provide. </para><para>The Bill establishes a position of Chief Metrologist.</para><para>The Chief Metrologist will be an employee of the Department under the Public Service Act 1999. He or she will be engaged by the Secretary of the Department and be responsible to the Secretaryâand through the Secretary to the Minister.</para><para>The Bill vests in the Chief Metrologist a number of specific functions and powers that are contained in the National Measurement Act 1960 and that are currently being exercised by the National Standards Commission and CSIRO through its National Measurement Laboratory. These relate essentially to maintaining and developing standards of measurement and providing pattern approval services.</para><para>The Bill ascribes other specific functions and powers relating to appointments and enforcement to the Secretary. This is in keeping with legislative policy principles.</para><para>The Chief Metrologist will be a scientist of international standing with expertise in metrology. He or she will provide scientific leadership within the institute and contribute to further enhancing Australia's contribution in international metrology forums.</para><para>The Bill provides flexibility as to the engagement of the Chief Metrologist as chief executive of the National Measurement Institute. It is expected that there will be a chief executive who will provide leadership and management of the business unit; while the Chief Metrologist will provide scientific leadership and exercise the functions given to him or her by the Bill. </para><para>The decision to create a National Measurement Institute and to bring chemical and biological measurement into the functions of the institute and into the legislation underlines the contemporary importance of these measurement functions for innovation in industry and for trade. It also highlights the increasing need for more rigorous metrological principles to be applied to chemical and biological measurement. </para><para>The National Measurement Institute will be a significant milestone in the history of measurement in Australia and a legacy to the commitment and contribution to more accurate measurement that have been made by science and industry.</para><para>Australian businesses, research organisations, and government agencies can have increased confidence in the research and measurement services available to them through the National Measurement Institute.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mackay</inline>) adjourned.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BILLS RETURNED FROM THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>20107</page.no><id.no></id.no></debateinfo><para>Message received from the House of Representatives returning the following bill without amendment:</para><quote><para><inline ref="S381">Health Legislation Amendment (Private Health Insurance Reform) Bill 2003 [2004]</inline></para></quote></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>20107</page.no><id.no>R1965</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>20107</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 10 February, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vanstone</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para><inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>20107</page.no><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name><name.id>TH4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âToday we are debating particularly important legislation that has been around since last year: the <inline ref="R1965">Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare) Bill 2003</inline>, otherwise known as the MedicarePlus package. The sad thing about debating this bill today is that it should have been debated last year and passed by this Senate last year. But once again the Labor Party in this parliament decided that the people of Australia did not need the contents and the assistance contained in this bill. That is why this is a very sad day.</para></talk.start><para>The select committee that was established to look into the A Fairer Medicare package reported yesterday on the MedicarePlus package that the Labor Party have simply decided that no matter what this government puts up by way of legislation, in a general sense, they will oppose it. In a more specific sense, they grizzle about health and Medicare yet, when an opportunity arises to vote for a bill that injects into the Medicare system money that is unparalleled in the history of Medicare, they choose to block it, to move it to a committee and, ultimately, to vote against it. In this place there are, fortunately, some people who want to see the people of Australia benefit from these initiatives, but none of those people are in the Labor Party. Some of them happen to be on the crossbenches and they may, in due course, decide that it is in the interests of the people of Australia that this bill be passed.</para><para>Yesterday we talked about the contents of the bill. The purpose of the bill is to create a safety net for people who have out-of-pocket and out-of-hospital expenses that can at times be completely and utterly financially crippling. For people who have catastrophic incidents, accidents, ongoing illness or who might have children who need continuing treatment but not hospital treatment, such costs can be absolutely prohibitive to their daily existence. Yet this bill, while trying to help with those costs, is being rejected by the opposition in this parliament. They and they alone will have to answer to the public for that sort of action, and I hope that they are put under extreme pressure to answer for that action. Considering that at least 200,000 people a year will benefit from this bill, one would have thought that for once the Labor Party could put aside their political grandstanding and vote for something that this government has introduced for the sake of the country; but no, they are going to oppose it. </para><para>Quite frankly, I think that before Christmas in the House of Representatives they decided to oppose it on a whim. After all, it was government legislation and that was a good enough reason to oppose itâ`Let's not look at the content.' Ms Gillard decided, just on a breeze, that they would oppose it and now they are stuck with it. They have had to ignore a lot of the evidence that was presented to the committee. They have had to ignore the evidence of the medical practitioners, who have said that this is a desirable piece of legislation that should be passed sooner rather than later. They have ignored the wishes of so many people who are suffering long-term illness who want help. They have decided that they do not want to help those people for whatever reason. In debating this bill today, as opposed to the committee process that Senator Bartlett, Senator Humphries and I sat throughâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>âIt went for 25 weeks.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>TH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name></talker><para>âI would be fascinated to see them come in here and explain why it is that whenever any money is injected into Medicare they want to vote against it.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>âTwenty-five weeks in committee and now they filibuster the Senate.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>TH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name></talker><para>âThat is exactly right, Senator Campbell. It is a very important comment. It would be a very desirable outcome if we could have this bill passed today, considering that it could have been passed last year. But no, the Labor Party has wheeled out a whole heap of people onto the speakers list, many of whom have no interest whatsoever in health.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>âYou know it's a `fill the bucket' list when Senator Buckland is on the list!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>TH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name></talker><para>âA few of them on the list have never spoken on health matters in this place. Obviously they were rung by their whip this morning and have been told, `We don't want this to go to a vote by 12.45 p.m. We want you to go in there, take up the time of the Senate and reject a bill that will be putting $266.4 million into Medicare.' That $266.4 million will simply go back to general revenue and will not be spent, thanks to the Labor Party.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I do not know what the Greens are going to doâone can never tell what the Greens are going to do. I do not know whether Senator Nettle is in here to speak on the bill. I have not seen her at any of the hearings. I have not heard her make any contribution on this particular issue. Once again, it would be interesting to know, if she is opposing it, why she is doing so. Is she prepared to send $266 million back into general revenue, instead of giving it to people who need it? Is she that well off that she cannot even bear to think of those people who need that sort of assistance? It is a valid question. I do not think there are too many people out there in voter land who would say, `I'm that well off that I do not need assistance,' when there is some long-term illness, accident or catastrophic event in their life and would prefer not to have that type of assistance.</para><para>When we talk about out-of-hospital out-of-pocket expenses we are not just talking about specialists' fees. We see the Labor Party politics of envy and greed and so on saying, `You've just got to cut the specialists' fees.' Any one of us would agree that, at times, specialists' fees are way over the top. But that is not the issue with this bill. The issue with this particular piece of legislation is that it covers general practitioners, it covers specialists, it covers any tests that might be done for pathology or radiology, it covers pap smears, it covers chemotherapy or radiotherapy and a whole range of other treatments that are required for ongoing illness.  </para><para>The bill also covers psychiatry. Take, for example, people who have been adversely affected by a traumatic event, such as a motor vehicle accident. You might be able to stitch them up, you might be able to get rid of their bruising and you might be able to repair their broken bones. But quite often you might not be able to repair quite as easily the psychological impact of that accident. The ongoing costs of psychiatric treatment can also be crippling, as can the costs of physiotherapy. But do the Labor Party care? I do not think so, because clearly, if they did care, they would not be filibustering on this bill. They would be coming in here, putting up their hands to vote for it immediately and saying, `Let's put this into play now and give people assistance.' Do they want to do that? No, they do not. All they want to do, as I said yesterday, is carp and harp about the bulk-billing rate.</para><para>We have to remember that as part of Medicare, which was introduced by the Labor Party, there was never a compulsion for 100 per cent Medicare bulk-billingânever. Unfortunately, I do not have the quotes here with me today from Dr Neal Blewett, who introduced Medicare. But he clearly stated that there was no compulsion for doctors to bulk-bill patients. And there is nothing in this piece of legislation that will prevent a doctor from bulk-billing a patient.</para><para>But we have even seen, as part of the broader debate, the Labor Party wanting to question and, if they could, knock back an increase of $5 in the rebate to concessional card holders. That is how politically blind they are now. They cannot cope with it. But the mere fact of the matter is that, if we did have 100 per cent bulk-billing by general practitioners, it would not solve the problems being encountered by patients with out-of-hospital out-of-pocket expenses. They would still have those bills even if there was 100 per cent bulk-billing, even if it was back to 80 per cent. But what does the Labor Party say? `Sorry, we're not going to give you the assistance.' So those people with chronic conditions are still, if it is left to the Labor Party, going to be confronted with this problem on an ongoing basis.</para><para>The MedicarePlus measures add $1.5 billion to the previously announced $917 million committed in the A Fairer Medicare package. What have the Labor Party done with both packagesâthe largest injection into Medicare in living memory? They have completely and utterly rejected both of those packages out of hand. I put to the Senate that it is a requirement for this bill to be passed urgently, and I ask the Labor Party not to filibuster with this bill but to have it passed by the Senate today.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>20109</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is clearâin fact 100 per cent crystal clear for anyone who has their eyes openâthat this government is intent on destroying Medicare, and that the <inline ref="R1965">Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare) Bill 2003</inline> that we are debating today in the Senate is simply the latest instalment in Prime Minister John Howard's long campaign to destroy Australia's universal national health care system. The Howard government has been running down Medicare since it came to office, and now it is seeking to drive that final nail into the coffin of universal health care in this country. If the Senate supports this legislation then it will stand condemned for failing the Australian people and putting politics ahead of good public policy and the health concerns of millions of Australians. Medicare is in peril because this legislation is part of a plan to turn it into a welfare safety net. This is in blatant disregard of what Australians deserve and of what they want. Australians support Medicare. </para></talk.start><para>The government's first attempt at addressing the rising tide of concern amongst Australians about access to general practitioners and the continued decline in bulk-billingâthat was the so-called A Fairer Medicare packageâwas overwhelmingly rejected. That is because it sought to turn Medicare into a welfare measure and push most Australians into privatised health care. The latest version is a more expensive recipe for disaster. The so-called MedicarePlus package is more of the sameâtargeted at those the government deems needy and a threadbare safety net for everybody else.</para><para>No-one should be fooled into believing that the government's latest package demonstrates a commitment to Medicare or to bulk-billing. Despite what the Prime Minister and the health minister say, what they want to do is to promote bulk-billing for some but not for all Australians and to force everybody else to pay more money to visit the doctor when they are sick. This is about favouring private health over public health, with a grudging acceptance that some needy individuals may still need government assistance in meeting their health needs.</para><para>The Doctors Reform Society of Australia say that the government's changes to Medicare will lead to higher health costs, reduced bulk-billing and reduced access to health care. They also say they will condemn needy people to second-rate health care and endanger the lives of many people who will not qualify for the safety nets.</para><para>The National Rural Health Alliance says that there is little in the package for bulk-billing in rural areas and that the new differential GP rebate represents a serious move away from universality. The Australian Consumers Association says that, in the medium term, bulk-billing for most Australians will almost disappear. As I said last night in the chamber, Canberra University health economist Ian McAuley estimates that bulk-billing rates will fall to as low as an average of 40 per cent across the country. They are lower than that in some areas already today. Is this the sort of public health care system that the Senate thinks is appropriate? The Greens do not believe it is appropriate. </para><para>The ACTU says that more and more average income earners will be forced to pay up-front for GP visits, even though Australians have already paid for Medicare through the Medicare levy and general taxation. They should not have to pay a third time round because this government has dismantled bulk-billing. This government is proposing to say to Australians who have health care needs that the user should pay once, the user should pay again and then, when the user is sick and needs to go to the doctor, the user should pay a third time around. We Australians pay our taxes in the knowledge that some of that revenue will pay for our children's check-ups. We pay a Medicare levy knowing that our friends and neighbours can regularly access a GP and stay healthy. It is this collective community benefit that universality delivers, but this system is undermined when the government asks us to pay again an up-front fee of $25, $50 or more each time we need to visit a doctor. </para><para>Minister Abbott says that bulk-billing rates might rise a little, but the government has costed this Medicare package based on no increase in bulk-billing rates. Minister Abbott also says that he does not really mind if bulk-billing rates keep falling from the 14-year low of 67.4 per cent to around 62 per cent. Australians in regional, rural and remote areas already have less access to bulk-billing. The rate is around 53.4 per cent in large rural centres compared with the capital cities, where it is around 75 per cent. This package will see a further decline in the ability of rural Australians to find a doctor who bulk-bills. Bulk-billing has fallen to the low 30s in some areas, and it is sure to keep falling while the government continues to refuse to bring rebates for all consultations up to sustainable levels. This deliberate refusal leaves doctors in no doubt that universal bulk-billing is not supported by this government. This is an attitude that ultimately will accelerate the demise of the public health system in this country.  </para><para>We know that Prime Minister Howard has never liked bulk-billing. We remember in 1987 when he went so far as to call it a rort. Doctors remember this too and should be rightly suspicious of ministers expressing a passion for the system and for bulk-billing. The problem is that the Prime Minister does not seem to understand that bulk-billing does matter. Bulk-billing ensures that no-one is prevented from seeing a doctor because of an up-front fee. Delaying medical treatment costs everyone a lot more in the long run. Good primary health care is good preventative health care. </para><para>The government has been putting increasing emphasis and resources into promoting preventative health care but its Medicare package will undermine any good work it has done on preventative health care in this country. The Australian Greens believe that bulk-billing is vital, that every Australian has an entitlement to bulk-billing and that government has a responsibility to give meaning to this entitlement. Several factors have caused the fall in bulk-billing rates. It will not be easy to reverse this, but it is not impossible. The government lacks a commitment to turn around the falling bulk-billing rates we are seeing in this country. When it released its original proposal, the government never promised to increase bulk-billing rates and now Minister Abbott has admitted that the government already considers Medicare to be a safety net and that slugging sick Australians with more fees when they go to the doctor is a private matter between patients and the doctor. </para><para>The Australian Greens disagree profoundly with this view of Medicare. We should be finding ways to increase the rate of bulk-billing for everyone, not to entrench bulk-billing as a second-rate payment system reserved for those deemed by the government to be needy. When it comes to health, we are all in need at some time and we should all have access to comprehensive quality public health care. If the government thinks that a $5 increase will encourage doctors to bulk-bill, it should increase the rebate for all Australians across the board. It is ridiculous for Minister Abbott to have said late last year that the government cannot find the $400 million a year that it would cost to do that, when this government spends $2.4 billion of public taxpayers' money subsidising the private health insurance industry. </para><para>The proposed safety nets in this bill are a tacit acknowledgment by the government that bulk-billing rates will continue to fall for most Australians. The Prime Minister says that the principle behind the safety nets is to protect people against unreasonably high expenses. But the safety nets have massive holes in them. They will not provide peace of mind for all Australians about the cost of their health care. Australians need a universal national health insurance schemeânot a safety net with holes in it. </para><para>The government's safety net is inflationary and its value diminishes over time. Professor John Deeble told the second Medicare inquiry that the safety nets amounted to the government agreeing to pay a higher proportion of increasingly rising specialists' fees. The failure of safety nets was one of the main reasons that Medibank was introduced. Safety nets are not set in stone forever by this legislation. They can and will be changed by governments looking for spending cuts. That will lead to sick people paying more to visit the doctorâand that is just the people who have not fallen through the safety net. This is simply not good enough when we are talking about the health of the Australian population. The Greens and others say that safety nets must not be allowed to become the primary focus of government policy, enabling bulk-billing rates to drop and to continue to be ignored.</para><para>The safety nets proposed in this legislation are the latest instalment in the government's drive to privatise health care in this country. As I said yesterday in this chamber, the government cut almost $1 billion out of the latest Australian Health Care Agreements with the states last year even though its own policy of neglect had forced more and more people into public hospitals to seek treatment that GPs could and should be providing. The government wants to increase the patient copayment for essential, life-saving medicines by 30 per cent, but thankfully the Senate has prevented it. We are yet to see the detail of how, in a free trade agreement with the United States, this government has consented to sick Australians paying more money to US pharmaceutical companies for the medicines that they need.</para><para>We can gauge the government's priorities not only by how much public money it spends but by where it directs that spending. The entire funding for the four-year Medicare package is equal to what the government spends on the private health insurance rebate every year. Australians are spending more and more on private health. This is not so bad if it is for services and products that are optional extras; but it is bad when private fees become a barrier to accessing primary careâand there is increasing evidence that this is the case. The government's Medicare package continues the privatisation push. Privatising health care is bad economics because it drives up the total cost. For example, a procedure performed in a private hospital costs on average three times more than the same procedure being performed in the public hospital system.</para><para>Privatising health care is poor social policy. Do we want to head in the direction of the United States in relation to health care? The US spends 14 per cent of its gross domestic product on health care but has 42 million people who are without any form of cover. This results not only in bankruptcies from massive hospital bills but alsoâand more shockinglyâunnecessary pain, suffering and ultimately death for want of the dollars to pay the premiums. This is where Prime Minister Howard is seeking to take Australia with his vision and with this legislation. Private health care will come to dominateâmaking a few people very richâand public health care will become something only for the poor, which most Australians refuse to invest in because they no longer have a stake in it.</para><para>The Australian Greens have a very different vision for Australia's public health system. We regard access to health care as a human right. We believe all Australians have a stake in a strong public system. The Greens support an increase in the patient rebate of $5 across the board, as we have done since April last year, and we support further financial assistance to help doctors who bulk-bill. This could be in the form of regular payments to help with practice costs. Other income increases should be tied to health outcomes. This could be done by remodelling the existing practice incentive payments. The Australian Greens say that we should be increasing our focus and spending on preventative health care, which currently accounts for around two per cent of government health care spending. One way to do this is for the Commonwealth and state governments to invest more in community health centres where salaried doctors can practice with other health professionals. This would be particularly attractive in rural and regional areasâproviding professional support and reducing the costs of establishing and maintaining a private practice. This sort of model would also attract doctors who work part time. </para><para>The North Richmond Community Health Centre provides a good model for this sort of approach. The centre employs six GPsâmost of them work part timeânurses, social workers, and youth and health promotions officers. It runs a dental scheme and a drug and alcohol program. Its services are free of charge. It works in a culturally diverse community and is located on the site of Victoria's largest public housing estate. The focus is on preventative health care, holistic medicine that includes addressing the social determinants of health, and health professionals supporting each other. Its only Commonwealth funding is via the patient rebate for medical benefit schedule services, whilst other funding comes from state and local governments. </para><para>There are a few similar services in other parts of Melbourne but this is the kind of model that the Australian Greens say we should be trialling across the country, especially in areas with no or low levels of bulk-billing services available. Instead, we are faced today with legislation from the government that proposes turning our national, universal public health care system into a safety net. It is only available for those people whom this government deems to be needy. I will not go now into the issue that this government deems self-funded retirees who earn up to $50,000 a year to be needy and yet it does not deem working Australians who are earning just $35,000 a year to be needy.</para><para>This government is proposing to turn our universal public health care system into just a safety net for those people that it deems to be needy. Last night we had the debate on access to bulk-billing for those other than concession card holders or children under the age of 16. Today in this legislation the government is proposing that concession card holders and other individuals should have to fork out enormous amounts of private money before they have the capacity to have any rebate from the government. At the time that the government announced these proposals for the safety net, there were claims put forward by the Prime Minister and the health minister of the day to say that vast numbers of Australians will be eligible to access this scheme. They contrasted significantly with the number of Australians who had spent that amount of money on out-of-hospital, out-of-pocket expenses in the last financial year.</para><para>This government is not prepared to invest in strengthening our public health system. Instead, it is trying to destroy it. The Senate cannot let this happen. This bill should be rejected in the interests of patients. It should be rejected in the long-term interests of the community. It should be rejected in the interests of an Australia that can still look after all its peopleâyoung, old, rich or poorâthrough collective effort for collective benefit.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>20114</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1965">Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare) Bill 2003</inline>. I indicate on behalf of the Labor opposition that we will be opposing this bill. It is a significant component of the government's MedicarePlus package. In our view, MedicarePlus represents an attempt to under-mine the fundamental nature of Medicare. Medicare was designedâand, until the Howard government, has been generally respectfully treated by governments of all coloursâas a universal insurer that delivers health care benefits based on need, not on income. However, the Howard government has sought to change this with its ideological insistence to insert means testing into Medicare, a universal insurance system that is designed to be progressive and that takes account of Australians with different financial means. </para></talk.start><para>The Medicare levy is a progressive tax of 1.5 per cent. High-income earners pay more to support Medicare than low-income earners in order to protect the principle that every Australian can access a doctor when they need to without fear of being unable to pay for the consultation. That is what universality means, and that is what a Labor government is determined to return. Medicare is a universal health insurance system that ensures that all Australians get health care when they need it regardless of their ability to pay. That is why Labor is determined to protect bulk-billing, which is an integral part of the systemâand not middle-class welfare, as some in the Liberal Party would have us believe.</para><para>Australians pay for their health care through their taxes and should not need to routinely pay cash at the point of service as well. Medicare is about taxpayers insuring themselves and other Australians against the possibility of needing a doctor through the year, not about individuals paying a hefty sum to a doctor for each and every consultation that they need through that year. However, the government is trying to persuade us otherwise. The government, through bloody-minded persistence and often sneaky arguments that mischaracterise the design and intent of Medicare, is trying to reduce people's expectations of Medicare. Because the Prime Minister wants bulk-billing to die a quiet death, he is not making it a priority or even an objective to restore bulk--billing rates to the 80-plus per cent they were at in 1996. Labor is determined to restore bulk-billing and to oppose all measures that are designed to soften the blow that Australians will suffer if the government gets its way and dismantles our universal health insurance system, which is regarded very favourably throughout the world. For this reason and many others, Labor opposes this bill.</para><para>The safety net proposal, which is the centrepiece of this bill, is opposed by Labor. There are a number of reasons for this. Firstly, there are in fact two safety netsâtwo very different qualifying thresholds that different Australians will have to reachâthat the government proposes. The separation of the safety net into two thresholds creates winners and losers in the system and offends the principle of universality. Secondly, the $500 and $1,000 thresholds are too high to effectively tackle the significant costs of accessing basic care and are instead focused on covering high-cost specialist fees. Thirdly, the thresholds are too high to deliver meaningful benefits to more than a tiny handful of Australians each year. Fourthly, the two categories of people chosen to receive the lower thresholdâthat is, concession card status or receipt of family tax benefit Aâare not selected on the basis of their health needs. They are based on totally unrelated criteria. The categories particularly discriminate against those Australians without dependent children and low-income individuals, while providing significant benefits to many higher income families.</para><para>The tests of eligibility for the safety net are inappropriate because Australians who do not have children, many of whom are low-income earners, are not eligible for the family tax benefit A. Yet the FTBA is one of the two eligibility tests for access to the safety net. Not having children does not mean one is less likely to get sick or to have high medical costs. There are the extra costs of the health care of the children but, in terms of the individual, there is not necessarily a difference between a person who is a parent and a person who is not. The basic problem of safety nets and Medicare is that eligibility for a safety net is not based on the health need of the individual. Australians who are not eligible for family tax benefit A because they do not have children and who are not eligible for a health care card because they earn $1 over $17,500 are not eligible for the lower safety net. This means low-income-earning Australians who are very ill and have high medical expenses will not get a cent back from the government until they have spent more than $1,000 in any given year. </para><para>Labor's fifth reason for opposing the government's proposed Medicare safety net is that the functional simplicity of the Medicare system will be compromised and weakened by linking the benefits to the complicated family tax benefit A system. Everyone in this chamber, and most Australians, have become aware of the chronic and enormous problems that the government's administration of family tax benefit eligibility has created.</para><para>All these problems, which the government has grappled with unsuccessfully for two or three years now, will be transported into Medicare for the first time ever. That is the sort of help Medicare does not need. So, if there are queries about a person's entitlement to receive family tax benefit A over the course of a financial year, those uncertainties will affect their eligibility to access the safety net too. Finally, Labor opposes the safety net proposals because the payment of uncapped out-of-pocket benefits will have an inflationary effect and is generally poor public policy. </para><para>There was near universal consensus that the government's safety net proposal should not be supported by the individuals and organisations that made submissions to the Senate committee inquiring into this bill. I commend that committee and its members for the work they have done over quite a long period. When one looks at the detail of the safety net proposals, it is clear that they have high eligibility hurdles to jump and most Australians will not be able to jump them. Under the government's proposal, all concession card holders and families in receipt of family tax benefit A will be eligible for an 80 per cent rebate of all out-of-hospital, out-of-pocket expenses in excess of $500 in each calendar year. That is all very well, but, even if you are lucky enough to qualify because you receive family tax benefit A or have a health care card, you will need to spend $500 in a year on medical expenses before the safety net cuts in. Many Australians cannot afford to spend $500 on medical expenses each year, and many do not spend that much. The latter group will get no relief, and those who do get some relief will have to spend in excess of $500 before they get a cent backâthey will get a rebate for each dollar they spend over $500. </para><para>For those families and individuals that do not get family tax benefit A or have a health care card, under the government's proposal they will be eligible for an 80 per cent rebate on out-of-hospital costs in excess of $1,000 in each calendar year. The same objection appliesâthese Australians will need to spend $1,000 before they become eligible to get one cent back, and they will not get a cent of the $1,000 they have already spent. So that is a sunk cost that the government will not be helping them with.</para><para>In the case of a self-funded retiree couple of pension age earning up to $80,000 per annum, they will be eligible for a health care card and hence for the $500 safety net. But a working couple without children, earning the same amount, will be eligible only for the $1,000 threshold. This is a clear inequity brought about by this rushed and ill-thought-out proposition. An individual working full time earning $35,000 per annum and who has a chronic medical condition will enter the safety net only after spending $1,000 out of their own pocket. But a self-funded retiree of pension age earning up to $50,000 will qualify for the lower threshold. These are gross inequities. There is no justification for them, and they are creating a deal of unfairness in the system and, as I say, infecting the Medicare system with family tax benefit problems that have plagued so many families in recent years and that have led to so many families having terrible debts and complicated discussions and arguments over eligibility. </para><para>The Senate Select Committee on Medicare found that the two categories chosen by the government for receiving the lower thresholdâconcessional status or receipt of the family tax benefit Aâare both poor measures of need. There are many working people on low incomes and chronically ill individuals who struggle to meet health costs but do not qualify for concession cards. The government's proposal also discriminates against those without dependent children. The relatively generous FTB part A income thresholds that apply to those with dependent children contrast markedly with the low cut-off levels for those without. A couple with dependent children may enjoy a concessional safety net threshold, notwithstanding that their income is over $80,000 per annum, whereas a single person without children would be subject to the $1,000 threshold on an income of less than one quarter of that of their neighbours. As well as being patently unfair, this deepens the poverty trap for many more Australians. </para><para>In fact about only 200,000 families and individuals will qualify for these two safety nets in any given year. This is about three per cent of all families, which is not many. So we are talking here about safety nets that are of no utility to most Australians. If the Howard government has its way, all Australians will have to spend hundreds of dollars in out-of-pocket expenses before the government cares to chip in anything. Too many Australian families and individuals face a financial crisis every time they have to go to the doctor. These families cannot afford to spend $500 or $1,000 before they reach the safety net. That is why bulk-billing is so important. Patients can afford to see a doctor every time they need to if they are bulk-billed. Very few families will reach the new safety net thresholds just by visiting a GP. The other things that cause health care costs to mountâmedicines, special foods, special equipment et ceteraâare not included in the safety net. Most families who reach the safety net will do so because of visits to high charging specialists and diagnostic services.</para><para>I am sure other members of the Senate Select Committee on Medicare will go into great detail about this, but very interesting evidence was given to that committee, particularly from Professor John Deeble. His evidence explodes the underpinnings of the government's arguments for their propositions. Professor Deeble said:</para><quote><para>It is appalling to find a system which failed so disastrously over 30 years ago now being promoted as the answer to exactly the same problem. Medibank was designed to overcome the inequities in the previous health system. What John Howard is seeking to do here is again take us back to the fifties, take us back to the inequities that existed prior to the introduction of a universal health system in Medibank.</para></quote><para>The Senate Select Committee on Medicare decided that the proposed safety nets should be rejected in their current form. In the committee's view, the most viable alternative, which sidesteps many of the problems of the safety net, is to minimise the importance of safety nets through the provision of health care that is affordable in the first place. As the Mt Druitt Medical Practitioners Association put it: </para><quote><para>A safety net is very much like the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff rather than the fence at the top.</para></quote><para>The fence at the top can only be achieved through the restoration of a comprehensive health care system, primarily achieved through a commitment to bulk-billing and MBS fee adherence as a sound mechanism to deliver access and affordability.</para><para>In conclusion, the Labor Party will not support passage of the government's legislation. We do not believe the safety net route that the government is taking is the appropriate one. People do not need a safety net once they have spent $500 or $1,000âthey need a safety net every time they need to visit a doctor. Too many people have to find an additional $10 or $20 to pay the doctor that they just do not have. That is why the Labor Party puts the emphasis on restoring bulk-billing. Bulk-billing is the fundamental part of the system that provides the protection and the safety net to families to seek medical care based on their need, not on their income. Bulk-billing provides them with the ability to seek medical care when they need it without fear of the financial burden. The government is taking us away from that fundamental tenet of Medicare to a two-tiered system, a safety net based system which says they will help those who are struggling with the costs once they reach a situation where the costs are so exorbitant that they cannot cope any more. That is not the sort of approach that the Labor Party recommends or advocates. Minister Abbott is walking away from ever recognising that the Medicare schedule fee must reflect doctors' costs. His safety net proposal says to doctors, `If you want more income, you'll have to take it from your patients' pockets; but don't feel too bad about it because there's a safety net.' It places the wrong signals in the system. With this uncapped, inflationary measure the Howard government is walking away from a responsible long-term approach to health care policy.</para><para>There is a fundamental difference in Australian politics between the government and the opposition over health care. That will have to be argued out in the community. I thought that was an argument that had been won when John Howard walked away from his criticism of Medicare and his opposition to a universal health system. What we are seeing here is John Howard again seeking to fulfil his promise of 20 years ago to dismantle Medicare. This is one of the steps taken in order to return us to a two-tiered system of health care in this country. It is one that undermines the universality that Medicare has provided: the protection for all Australians, regardless of their income, to be able to access good quality health care. It is a fundamental issue; it is a fundamental signal of a civil society that such access is ensured for all Australian citizens. The Labor Party will continue to fight for that. This is a key plank to ensure a just and fair Australian society. The government's proposition takes us down the wrong path. It takes us away from ensuring universal access to health care based on need. We will oppose it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>20117</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move the second reading amendment standing in my name:</para></talk.start><quote><para>At the end of the motion, add âbut the Senate:</para><para>	(a)	condemns the Government's attempt to undermine the principle of universality that underpins Medicare and for its policy of privatising health care in Australia, including the Private Health Insurance Rebate, which should be abolished and the funds directed to public health care; and </para><para>	(b)	calls on the Government to establish an independent inquiry into the rebate and the Lifetime Health Cover policy, as recommended by the Select Committee on Medicareâ.</para></quote></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>20118</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1965">Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare) Bill 2003</inline>. The Senate inquiry has been extremely useful in distilling the main problems of the MedicarePlus package and in showing the inadequacy of what we have now. There is no doubt about itâeveryone would agree that Medicare has problems. That is because the agreement between doctors and the government about what the appropriate fees should beâof which 85 per cent is then payable by the government for the patientâhas broken down. This is the reason that the government is asking for a safety net in this billâbecause successive governments have failed in the compact with doctors to set fees to which doctors will adhere. The government senators, in their dissenting report, said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Out-of-pocket expenses incurred for out-of-hospital services can be financially crippling, especially when the services required are extensive, on-going and intense. Often they are unforeseen, due to accidents or the sudden onset of serious illness.</para></quote><para>This is an extraordinary admission of failure on the part of the government. There should be no need for Australians to suffer crippling costs. The whole point of Medicare is to ensure that Australians are insured against crippling costs. That is what Medicare was devised for and what we, as taxpayers, contribute to through the tax system.</para><para>Medicare is a public insurance system that is most fair because you pay for your insurance through the tax system according to your capacity to pay. When you retire and you are on a lower income, you pay less but you get the same quality of care, if you need it, as if you were wealthier. When you become unemployed, you do not need to worry about facing health insurance payments, because your fellow Australians who are employed are contributing to the insurance pool. That is what solidarity and Australians pulling together is all about.</para><para>But Medicare is not working well. The Department of Health and Ageing in their submission said that, compared to when Medicare was introduced, contributions by patients to GPs' fees have risen by 65 per cent in real terms. Patient contributions to specialists' fees have risen by an enormous 310 per cent. What this means is that increasingly doctors are not agreeing to charge at a level that is worked out by government and are choosing what they think the market will bear.</para><para>Labor has focused its attention largely on bulk-billing. For the purposes of primary care this is indeed a significant factor. Prevention, early intervention and seeing a doctor for check-ups are increasingly seen as important in our fight against the 21st century diseases: the chronic and so-called lifestyle illnesses. For instance, epidemiologists estimate that 50 per cent of all diabetics in Australia do not know that they are diabetic. And when they first attend a doctor, it is usually when their disease is further advanced, making it much harder to treat, with worse health outcomes. If people are put off from going to see the doctor about a changing mole on their skin or feeling tired, because they do not want to spend $30 from the household budget on a two-minute consultation, then we are losing the preventive battle. If anything, we want more proactive medical intervention, which has to mean an open-door policy that does not bring finances into the equation. </para><para>However, there are lots of people who will accept that they should pay something, particularly for high-quality expertise such as that provided by specialists and GPs who are prepared to spend quality time with their patients. To focus only on bulk-billing misses the point that Medicare was trying to achieve two things: to keep prices low and free of charge at consultation for many and to keep costs limited and affordable for others. The crisis is not just in bulk-billing but in what those people who are not bulk-billed have to pay. Some people who would willingly pay a small amount are increasingly not having that option. The amount that they pay will be significant. Even if bulk-billing rates were restored to the highest level of 81 per cent, these are the people who will miss out.</para><para>At the public hearing we heard the Department of Health and Ageing admit that the schedule fee is increasingly irrelevant. When Medicare was introduced, only 21 per cent of specialist services were bulk-billed but a further half of all specialist services charged the schedule fee. That means that, at the beginning, specialists agreed to the principle underpinning the public insurance system, which meant that patients' costs were limited and affordable such that for three-quarters of specialist services the schedule fee or bulk-billing was adhered to. This very clearly and perhaps irretrievably has broken down. Now we have 27 per cent of specialist services bulk-billed, more than was the case at Medicare's inception but only a further 14 per cent of services charge the schedule fee. That is, 20 years down the track less than half of all services are charged according to the Medicare agreement. That is why we need a safety net. That is why the government can legitimately argue that people could face crippling costs. </para><para>Why has this agreement broken down? I qualify the following by emphasising that the focus of the inquiry was on GP fees. We heard very little from specialists and to some extent what is very clear now is that specialists and new technologies make up one-third of government expenditures on rebates, and that is in need of greater scrutiny. It is their fees that are spiralling out of control, it is their fees that will be likely to be captured in the new safety nets.</para><para>Returning to the GP issues, arguments were advanced by some economists who provided submissions to the inquiry that it is a question of competitionâthe more doctors you have in an area the lower their fees will be. That is the free market argument suggesting that because doctors operate in the small business model they are sensitive to prices and their patients will shop around for the lowest price. Other economists pointed to the erratic pattern of bulk-billing, suggesting that doctors in higher socioeconomic areas will charge their patients more because they know those patients can afford it.</para><para>Further evidence to the inquiry suggested that much of doctors' billing patterns is attitudinal. That is, some doctors are intractably opposed to the concept of so-called free consultations, and charge according to their view of how much individuals can pay, and the value the doctor places on their own work. Other submissions pointed to the disgruntlement doctors feel when comparing their remuneration to either other professions or their specialist colleagues. They feel they are missing out.</para><para>The relative value study appears to have been a key strategic mistake on this government's partâit raised doctors' expectations that their remuneration from government would increase dramatically because it proposed substantial increases in the government endorsed and funded schedule fee. As a result of their dissatisfaction when the government did not raise their fees, many doctors changed their adherence to the lower schedule fee and started charging the AMA suggested fee. As the inquiry concluded, perhaps all of these factors have contributed to doctors charging more. The question is, what has the government done about it to get Medicare back on track? </para><para>It has put in place measures to increase the GP work force which, if the assumptions about fees being driven by competition are right, should lead to fee constraint. It has introduced a $5 rebate for services to some groups of patients, many of whom are already bulk-billed, to halt the decline of bulk-billing for these groups. It has introduced a safety net that will reimburse those who first must pay $500 or $1,000 in one year. But it has not tackled the fundamental issue about how you come to an agreement with the medical profession about a sensible remuneration model that means the government and taxpayer have some certainty about what is charged and that does not lead to spiralling costs.</para><para>It is an interesting argument that the government runs, that it is taking a proactive role in scrutinising private health insurance fees and making these operate more efficiently on the grounds of a 30 per cent stake through the private health insurance rebate, but that it cannot intervene in the medical services market where it still has a very significant $8.6 billion investment. Of course we know the arguments about constitutional constraint of civil conscription of doctors, and I am not suggesting that we prescribe a fee that doctors must charge. However, there are real issues about the extent to which doctors who receive considerable remuneration through the schedule fee rebate should remain outside the legitimate purview of government. For example, the original design of the bulk-billing incentive was remarkably successful in limiting fees. I am sure that creative health economists would be able to design new incentive structures and remuneration alternatives that would meet the principles of patient and government affordability without compromising doctor remuneration and clinical autonomy.</para><para>I am sympathetic to the government's argument that consumer expectations, increased household wealth and new technologies leave the government susceptible to an ever-burgeoning health budget. But governments of both persuasions have responded to that over the past two decades by limiting their relative contribution to medical services. If you look at the Medicare data, you see that in 1984-85 the total amount the government contributed for all Medicare feesâthat is, GPs, specialists, X-rays, blood tests et ceteraâwas 90 per cent of the total fees charged. That is, overall, patients only had to contribute to doctors a copayment of 10 per cent of total fees. This is because a lot of doctors accepted 85 per cent of the schedule fee so that patients did not have to pay a gap and many doctors adhered to the schedule fee.</para><para>However, that figure of 90 per cent was never reached againâthere has been a slow but steady decline in the government's contribution to all Medicare fees since then. This applies to both Labor and Liberal governments. And we are now left with government paying only 79 per cent of Medicare's fees. That is, across the whole system patients are now contributing twice the proportion of all fees, as well as paying through taxes.</para><para>But the market mechanism of allowing price signals to determine and limit consumer behaviour works poorly for health. Professor Richardson in the early nineties found that increased up-front costs for health care do not deter people from getting care, but that the care not sought was as equally likely to be for serious conditions that required treatment as the frivolous reasons that pure economic theory would have us believe would not be paid for. Obviously health does not operate as a market, which is exactly why strong government intervention continues to be necessary. The Democrats believe that the government's broad approach to shifting costs to patients and providing a signal to doctors that they can charge whatever the market will bear is poor and unsustainable policy. </para><para>I turn now to the safety net. The Democrats have indicated that, until the government gives serious attention to the issue of fees containment, there is a need for an improved safety net. The evidence at the inquiry was that the parameters of the proposed safety net are clumsy, administratively complex and expensive to administer. Eligibility criteria for the proposed different thresholds are unlikely to be anything other than a blunt instrument with inequities created between groups in terms of the costs they face. And, of course, wherever boundaries are created that mean some groups benefit while others do not there is the potential for community divisiveness.</para><para>The Ombudsman provided evidence that the use of the family tax benefit receipt as eligibility criteria is fraught with difficulties in a payment system that already generates many complaints. This was persuasive in suggesting that the government still has not got this right. However, I also accept that the proposed safety net, with all its flaws, will be of greater benefit to many people than the existing safety netâat least in the short term. The key problem in supporting its passage in its present form is whether the community and government consider the task completed. The Democrats say that MedicarePlus will not fix patients' access to bulk-billing and small copayments, and it will not send a message to GPs and specialists to rein in their fees.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>20121</page.no><name role="metadata">Marshall, Sen Gavin</name><name role="display">Senator MARSHALL</name><name.id>00AOP</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise today to speak on the <inline ref="R1965">Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare) Bill 2003</inline>. While this individual bill implements aspects of the government's Medicare agenda, it does not implement the whole thing. As we know, the government was forced into rethinking its approach to Medicare following the flop of its A Fairer Medicare package under former Health Minister Patterson last year. Since then, Mr Abbott has been appointed to the portfolio. He made sweeping changes to the A Fairer Medicare package and, subsequently, we are left with a legislative and regulatory package that is piecemeal and all over the place.</para></talk.start><para>Our country has had a proud, egalitarian reputation. Our `fair go for all' philosophy and historical commitment to the provision of social services to all, regardless of class or wealth, are admired worldwide. Universal access to Medicare and bulk-billing GP services have been essential ingredients in fostering this sense of egalitarianism. Medicare is one of this country's greatest achievementsâa Labor achievement. Since its 1984 establishment the system has remained well regarded by the Australian public. Any attempt by governments or oppositions to wind back or alter the nature of the Medicare system has been resoundingly rejected by the Australian public, and for good reason.</para><para>Australians recognise that our health systemâthe Medicare systemâis world class and worth protecting. Australians are rightly frightened by international health systems, including the American system, that are inherently user pays and lead to millions of citizens being locked out of access to health care because they do not have the money to pay for it. This is not the kind of society Australians want. Australians want a health system where everybody has equal access to doctors and primary health care. Australians want to know that, if they fall ill, they will be able to see a doctor. For many millions of Americans, this is simply not an option. Australians want to use their Medicare cards to access health care; they do not want to use credit cards or massive wads of cash to pay their way through the system. </para><para>Unfortunately though, Prime Minister Howard does not seem to share this view. John Howard and the Liberal Party have never been committed to Medicare. They have never been committed to any kind of health system in which all Australians are granted universal access to bulk-billing GP services. It just goes against the grain in both cases. As Treasurer in the Fraser government, Mr Howard played his part in destroying Medibank, the first universal health care system set up by the Whitlam government. In the 1980s, as opposition leader, Mr Howard let loose about his thoughts on Bob Hawke's reconstructed Medicare. He labelled it `a miserable cruel fraud', `a scandal', `a total and complete failure', `a quagmire', `a total disaster', `a financial monster' and `a human nightmare'. Mr Howard threatened to pull Medicare right apart and to get rid of the bulk-billing system. Bulk-billing, Mr Howard said, was an `absolute rort'.</para><para>Given Mr Howard's attitude towards Medicare and the bulk-billing system, it comes as no surprise to anyone that eight years into his term of government the current situation facing Medicare and bulk-billing is dire. The Howard government of 2004 is delivering upon the Howard opposition's threats of the 1980s and is trying to emulate the feats of the Fraser government with respect to Medibank. Either way one looks at it, the Prime Minister has it in for Medicare and bulk-billing and he will do all that he can to destroy both systems.</para><para>Over the past few years in particular, the Howard government has presided over a national bulk-billing rate that has been in free fall. Has it acted to rectify this situation? No, it has not. Why is this? Because, as Tony Abbott argues, bulk-billing is an issue between doctors and patients, and the government will not come between that relationship. In short, he refuses to act. He would like to have us believe that there is nothing his government or any government could do to rectify the situation facing bulk-billing, but we know that is a furphy.</para><para>The Commonwealth government is in a prime position to influence the national rate of bulk-billing because it has the means to make bulk-billing an attractive service for GPs to provide to their patients, if it so wishes. Issues and problems arise when political will is needed to make this happenâand this is particularly true for the Howard government as constantly deteriorating bulk-billing figures can testify. The fact is, under the Howard government, no strategy to address ailing bulk-billing rates has been implemented at all. John Howard, his health ministers and his wider government have been all too happy to sit back and allow for and facilitate the slow disintegration of Medicare and the bulk-billing system. Bulk-billing is being killed by stealth and attrition, and it is no accident.</para><para>As it is, the national bulk-billing rate has fallen by over 13 per cent since John Howard's conservative government came to office in 1996. In my home state of Victoria the bulk-billing rate is now down to 60-odd per cent. In the federal electorate of Indi, also in my home state of Victoria, the level of bulk-billing is now a paltry 29.3 per cent of all GP consultations. These are totally unacceptable figures and, worse, the latter would suggest that not even all concession card holders are being bulk-billed in the federal electorate of Indi. What sort of system has this been allowed to become? Patently, it is a hopelessly deficient one. </para><para>Hand-in-hand with the experience of free-falling bulk-billing rates, patients accessing GP consultations outside public hospitals have experienced a steady incline in the level of out-of-pocket costs. In the past three years alone, out-of-pocket expenses for a visit to the doctor have risen by more than 23 per cent. Of considerable concern also is the fact that the national level of GP visitation has dropped dramatically over the past year. Last year, 1.75 million fewer GP consultations were recorded than in the year before. This represents the first time since 1995 that the number of GP visitations in a calendar year has dropped below 100 million. Far too many Australians are being forced to decide whether they can financially afford to seek medical treatment when they fall ill. As the figures suggest, many Australians are simply not going to the doctor when otherwiseâand in the pastâthey would. Many are ending up in our already overcrowded public hospital emergency departments seeking treatment. This is not the sign of a healthy country or a health system under control. The system is falling apart and, in the process, so too is the primary health care of the Australian people.</para><para>There is little doubt that Medicare needs fixing. The current situation facing the system is dire and it is stuck in a downward spiral. Something must address the draconian rates of bulk-billing within our communities. But the question is: is the package being put forward by the government the right package, and will it do anything to rectify the current situation? The short answer, I believe, is no. This package is heavily flawed and it will do more to harm the system than it will to address any of the serious problems plaguing it. Under the Howard government's MedicareMinus package, Medicare will become Medicare minus its heart and soul. It will become Medicare minus the universality of bulk-billing.</para><para>Under the plan, GPs will be paid an additional $5 for every consultation of a concession card holder or child under 16 years who is bulk-billed. Importantly, while this group receives the $5 bonus payment, no other group does. This $5 bonus payment for only certain groups of Australians will do nothing to boost the national bulk-billing rate. Even the government's own documents say that MedicareMinus will cause the bulk-billing rate to fall further. It is clear that this provision is simply ideologically motivated to bring about the destruction of the universality of bulk-billing. On top of the $5 additional payment, another incentive payment of up to $20,000 will be made available to GPs who bulk-bill concession card holders. This provision is not contingent upon a doctor bulk-billing a certain percentage of the whole population but only on a doctor bulk-billing concession card holders and children under 16.</para><para>If this is not enough, another incentive is being offered to bring about the swift destruction of universal bulk-billing and introduce the Americanisation of our primary health care system. On top of the $20,000 incentive payment, doctors will be able to charge Medicare directly for other non-concessional patients and charge them fees on top of that. This practice is currently outlawed and for good reason. It will encourage the charging of higher out-of-pocket costs to millions of Australian patients. The historic universal nature of the bulk-billing system will be no more, and patients will continue to pay ever-increasing out-of-pocket costs. As the first report of the Senate Select Committee on Medicare states:</para><quote><para>At a philosophical level, the government package amounts to a decisive step away from the principle of universality that has underpinned Medicare since its inception. The Committee does not accept the government's argument that, because everyone continues to be eligible to be bulk-billed and receives the same rebate, universality is preserved. This argument is disingenuous and ignores the reality of the incentive system the government seeks to put in place. In practice, a GP will receive more public money to treat a concession card holder than they will for treating a non-concessional patient. </para><para>At a practical level, the policy is focused on `guaranteeing' bulk-billing of concessional patients in a way that is quite simply unnecessary, since the majority of these people are in all likelihood already bulk-billed ... the package essentially focuses on a solution to a problem that does not exist.</para></quote><para>As Dr Tait submitted to the committee:</para><quote><para>By only focussing on Medicare as a safety net for Health Care Card holders the government will set up a three tier health system: those who are recognised as `poor' and needy, those who are the unacknowledged `poor' who will miss out the most and those who can afford to pay for what they want.</para></quote><para>Medicare is not and has never been a safety net available only to those who cannot afford to pay for their own health care. Medicare was designed to be and has always been everyone's health care safety net. Speaking of safety nets, the safety nets that are to be enshrined in this package are also an unnecessary component if what existed was an adequate system providing all Australians with access to adequately funded bulk-billing GP consultations. Under the plan, three new safety nets will be implemented to cover 80 per cent of the out-of-pocket costs incurred for out-of-hospital Medicare services above a specified threshold in a calendar year. For people with concessional benefits the threshold will kick in at $500. For family tax benefit A recipients the threshold will also kick in at $500. For all other families and individuals the threshold will kick in at $1,000.</para><para>There are already two so-called safety net arrangements in place to protect Australians who have high out-of-hospital, out-of-pocket expenses. This measure recognises that out-of-pocket expenses are bound to rise for patients in the future and it also gives the green light to doctors to charge patients higher fees, because they are assured that the government will pick up 80 per cent of costs above the two thresholds starting at $500. The effect of this bureaucratic nightmare of a provision will be to divide the community yet again and to move away from a non-means tested system. It is totally unacceptable to Labor.</para><para>The government's policies do very little to address areas of work force shortage. Since the Howard government came to office, over $6 billion has been cut from the higher education system, severely disadvantaging the future pool of Australian medical professionals. Today we are seeing the effects of this neglect and funding regression. On top of this neglect, the recent changes to the higher education system will see degrees in the broad areas of the health and medical sciences priced beyond the reach of many. The policy before us now fails to deliver adequate resources to the training and support of new GPs and nurses and to deliver GPs and nurses to areas of work force shortage. The measures announced are fixing a problem of the Howard government's own making. Of course all measures to increase training opportunities are welcome, but those foreshadowed in the current proposals do not go far enough. In fact, many of the announcements made in relation to these policies have been rehashed from previous budget announcements and promises. There are also other problems. According to the first report of the Senate Select Committee on Medicare:</para><quote><para>It must also be noted that on early indications, the system by which the government is distributing the bonded places to various universities appears to be having inequitable results, with some universities actually <inline font-style="italic">losing</inline> non-bonded HECS places. According to the Department of Health and Ageing, the University of Sydney will offer 27 bonded places in 2004, but will lose 23 standard HECS places, over its 2002 enrolment while Monash University which enrolled 138 standard places in 2002 will only offer 128 in 2004. </para></quote><para>It is therefore difficult to be confident that any of the promises and announcements made by the government in relation to additional university or training places as part of the Medicare package will be promises delivered upon.</para><para>In stark contrast to the packages being put forth by the government, Labor's policy to address the eight years of Howard government neglect of Medicare is fair and equitable, is a long--term plan and not a short-sighted political fix and will have a significant impact on the terribly low bulk-billing figures we witness quarter after quarter at the moment. Labor's plan would raise the Medicare rebate for the bulk-billing of all patients, not only concession card holders and children under 16, as the government would have it. Labor's policy would raise the patient rebate progressively and would, by 2006-07, reach 100 per cent of the schedule fee. This measure will encourage those GPs who already bulk-bill to continue to bulk-bill all patients and it will encourage those who no longer bulk-bill to recommit to the service. Labor will pay targeted incentive payments to doctors who meet certain bulk-billing ratios. Sums of up to $22,500 will be made available on an annual basis to encourage GPs to bulk-bill all of their patients. Labor's plan will introduce the use of 100 new Medicare teams of two doctors and a nurse, which will be deployed to identified health hotspots around the country and would be co--located with public hospitals, in turn   offering people bulk-billing services they otherwise would not have access to and relieving some of the pressures from our public hospital emergency departments. As part of Labor's education policy, 1,404 extra bonded medical places and 4,225 new nursing places will be made available. Labor will also offer cash incentives to encourage GPs to move into identified areas which lack GPs or bulk-billing services. Labor believes that everybody, regardless of their wealth or where they live, should have access to bulk-billed GP consultations.</para><para>Earlier this year, Labor leader Mark Latham announced that a new federal Labor government will invest $300 million over four years to resurrect, in partnership with the states and territories, a national dental health scheme, like that abolished by the Howard government in 1996. Under Labor's plan, concession card holders and their dependents will gain access to free dental check ups when they are needed, as well as subsidised dental treatments, restorations and dentures. This package will provide Australians with up to 1.3 million extra dental procedures and will clear the existing backlog and significantly reduce waiting lists. Further announcements in relation to Labor's plan for a healthy Australia and a stable and fair health system are likely over the coming year.</para><para>This government's Medicare proposal is an outright attack on the universal system Australians have come to depend upon and want protected. There are two certainties about the government's proposals: bulk-billing rates will continue to decline while out-of-pocket expenses will continue to rise. According to the findings of a study undertaken by the Australian Institute of Primary Care, which was commissioned by the Senate Medicare committee to analyse the potential inflationary effects of the government's package, bulk-billing levels under this package are expected to fall to approximately 50 per cent of all GP services and out-of-pocket costs will rise by 56 per cent. There is absolutely no doubt about it. It is what the government is striving for. This government, under a Prime Minister who is an out-and-out opponent of the universal nature of Medicare and bulk-billing, is doing just what was promised when Mr Howard was in opposition in the 1980s. This policy is doing more than taking a scalpel to Medicare; it will indeed pull Medicare right apart and it will get rid of the bulk-billing system, just as John Howard promised. Australians do not want Medicare to turn in to an Americanised health system where user pays is the name of the game. Australians want to use their Medicare cards to access bulk-billing GP consultations. They do not want to use credit cards or go without primary health care because they cannot afford it. Such a policy is un-Australian and it cannot and should not be tolerated. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>20126</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Australian people know which political party supports Medicare and which political parties do not.

Mr Howard, we recall, in 1996 promised to maintain Medicare lock, stock and barrel. We were told in 1996 that no Australian would be worse off under the Howard government. Of course, many Australians are worse off today under this government, particularly in the area of health care. Many Australians who were able to find a bulk-billing doctor in 1996 today cannot access a bulk-billing doctor in their suburb or town. The concept of universal access to bulk-billing doctors has all but disappeared. The rate of bulk-billing has declined from over 80 per cent at the time the Howard government came to office to around 60 per cent today. In some parts of Australiaâparticularly in towns and cities in rural and regional Australiaâpeople cannot find a doctor who will bulk-bill. In some cases they are lucky to even find a doctor because doctors, particularly GPs, have increasingly been leaving the profession.</para><para>Why has this happened? It has happened because while this government professes to support Medicare, it does nothing to enhance it, does nothing to encourage doctors to bulk-bill and does nothing to encourage doctors to continue to support a universal health care system. When Medicare came inâindeed, before that when Medibank came inâthe medical profession were opposed to it. They did not like it. They campaigned against it.  </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>âIs that your measure of a professionalâapproval or disapproval?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name></talker><para>âI can recall going to medical surgeries, as I am sure Senator McGauran can, where the doctors even had signs on their walls saying, `This is not a bulk-billing practice. We encourage you to take out private health insurance.' Eventually the medical profession came to accept that Medicare was here to stay. That is essentially the reason why bulk-billing rates increased. There was a government in power, under Bob Hawke and then Paul Keating, that was committed to Medicare and made sure that the medical profession and the Australian people understood that, so eventually the medical profession accepted its inevitability. But as costs have spiralled, particularly in the area of specialists, this government has sat back and let it all happen. It has shifted its focus from trying to ensure Medicare remained vibrant, healthy and the pillar of our universal health system to promoting private health insurance. So we have seen more Australians in effect being left behind when it comes to the ability to access Medicare through bulk-billing.</para></talk.start></continue><para>As we know, there are two key features of the package that is before this parliament. One of those requires legislative passage in order to bring it into effectâthat is, the safety net proposal. I will come to that later in my speech. The other key aspect of this so-called MedicarePlus package is the increase of $5 in the rebate for doctors who bulk-bill particular patients. I want to deal with that area first. The previous package this government brought before the parliament was called the A Fairer Medicare package. That package was examined last year by the Senate Select Committee on Medicare. You, Madam Acting Deputy President McLucas, as chair of that committeeâand I congratulate you on the excellent job you didâwill well recall that there was widespread opposition to the government's so-called A Fairer Medicare package. It was not fair and it did nothing to address the real problems with Medicare that this government have allowed to occur. They put up a proposal in that package to pay doctors an additional amountâin some cases it was as little as $1 extra per patientâwhere they bulk-billed. That proposal was so insignificant and inconsequential that it was rejected by the medical profession and rejected by all other interested bodies and persons involved in health care.</para><para>Following the committee's report, the government withdrew that proposal. They have now come back with this new proposal of MedicarePlus. Under MedicarePlus the government propose to pay an additional $5 to doctors who bulk-bill patients who are either concession card holders or under 16 years of age. They have singled out two groups within society and said to doctors, `If you bulk-bill people in those two groups, instead of receiving the normal 85 per cent rebate of the schedule fee you will receive that amount plus $5. If you continue to bulk-bill all the other patients that you previously bulk-billed, you will get the same as you got beforeâthe Medicare rebate.</para><para>That is an improvement on the previous offer, but the distinction is that this proposal does not apply to all patients who are bulk-billed. For the first time in the history of Medicare, the government is introducing a differential level of rebate or differential level of payment, if you want to be more correct because the bulk-billing payment goes to the doctor. That undermines the universality of Medicare and no amount of argument or sophistry from government senators about whether or not Medicare was ever intended to apply to 100 per cent of Australians refute the proposition that this proposal undermines the universality of Medicareâit does. Prior to this proposal being implemented with respect to any Australian who was bulk-billed the doctor received the same payment. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>âRich or poor.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name></talker><para>âSenator McGauran, the principle of Medicare, as you know, is that a Medicare levy is made on all Australians through the tax system and it recognises that people pay according to their means. But everybody should be entitled to equality of access in terms of their health care. For instance, why should it be the case that, when a mother in a family on a low income goes to the doctor and takes her child with her, the doctor receives a higher payment for treating the child than he does for treating the mother? Why introduce that element of discrimination? How can you believe that the government's proposal is equitable where a doctor will receive a higher payment for treating children from a family on a very high income, yet that will not apply to a family on a low income where a child may be over 16 years of age? It is a nonsensical proposition which discriminates amongst Australiansâsomething that we have never had under Medicare or Medibank. It discriminates against people on the basis of their income or their age. I will quote the evidence very briefly, because I could not put it any better than the way it was put by some witnesses in the inquiry. The Australian Council of Social Services said:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>The objection to the proposal lies with the continuing attempt to divide patients into two groupsâthose who are expected to make a co-payment and those who are expected to get a `free' service. </para><para>This approach undermines both the concept of the universal health care system and the practice of a fair approach to meeting the costs of illness based on need.</para></quote><para>Catholic Health Australia commented:</para><quote><para>Only concession card holders and young children are the targets for bulkbilling. In other words the Government is content that nearly half of all GP patients can hold little hope of being bulkbilled.</para></quote><para>Many other witnesses, such as the National Rural Health Alliance, UnitingCare and the Australian Consumers Association make similar comments. The Australian Consumers Association said:</para><quote><para>We are giving up the universality of Medicare. That is what universality is. It is not about 100 per cent bulk-billing; it is about the promise that when people go to a doctor they will be treated equally based on what they clinically need rather than on what their income is.</para></quote><para>So when the government say that nothing, in terms of the principles of Medicare, is under-mined here, they are simply not telling the truth. I move on to the other aspect which is before the parliament under this billâthat is, the safety net. As has been explained, the safety net proposal is to establish two thresholds. Where a concession card holder or a family in receipt of family tax benefit A has out-of-pocket costs, representing gap costs between the rebate and the schedule fee that amount to more than $500 a year, 80 per cent of those extra costs will be reimbursed. For all others, the threshold rises to $1,000.</para><para>The government's argument essentially comes down to this: `We recognise there's a problem with people having increasing out-of-pocket costs, particularly, as we know, through specialist treatment, and we're going to bung in another safety net to try and help some Australians meet those costs.' Their proposal, of course, ignores the fact that there already are existing safety net schemes in Medicare. It ignores the fact that many Australians who would be in a similar situation with high out-of-pocket medical costs would never qualify for that $500 threshold because they do not fit into the category of concession card holder or receive family tax benefit A. It also ignores the fact that this proposal adds a further layer of complexity and a further layer of discrimination between Australians. It is essentially a flawed safety net scheme. </para><para>What does the government then say? It saysâI heard Senator Humphries say this, and he may well say it again in this debateâ`Look, it's better to have a flawed scheme than to have no scheme at all.' Frankly, that is an absolutely disgraceful cop-out. It is like the old joke where the doctor says to the patient, `I'm sorry we amputated the wrong leg, but the good news is the other one's getting better.' As stated in this report, one of the witnesses said that it is like having the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff rather than at the fence at the top. What this government should have done was to sit down and consult the health groupsânot just relied upon the AMA's supportâand fix the issues relating to increasing costs for out-of-pocket expenses, particularly in the specialist area, and rework the existing safety net scheme to ensure that it properly addressed the issues of high out-of-pocket costs.</para><para>There are another couple of points that should be made because what the government is trying to do here is run a scare campaign. It is trying to say, âLook, by opposing the safety net proposal, Labor is really denying chronically ill Australians the opportunity to have some of their costs or all of their costs met.' I even heard Senator Knowles say that some of the costs that people incur in this regard relate to physiotherapy after being involved in a serious accident. It is true: if you have to have constant physiotherapy treatment, your costs will be exceedingly high. The problem is that Senator Knowles got it wrong; physiotherapy costs are not covered by this proposal. Physiotherapy is not a Medicare item; it is covered by private health insurance, if you have private health insurance. </para><para>That then leads me to my other point: this is an inequitable proposal. It has two thresholds that again discriminate between Australians over health care. But when you look at the current private health insurance subsidy of 30 per cent that this government introducedâwhich currently costs $2.4 billion a year and is risingâyou find that it applies to all Australians equally. This government's approach, when it comes to providing a subsidy to private health insurance, is to treat all Australians equally. If you have private health insurance, you get a 30 per cent subsidy on the cost of your health insurance. It does not break people up into categories of young and old, concession card holders and people on family tax benefits or other Centrelink payments and say, `Some of you will get 30 per cent, some of you might get 15 per cent and some of you might get nothing.' No, all people are treated equitably. But when it comes to this Medicare safety net proposal, that principle goes right out the window. Why? Because it is again about undermining the fundamentals of the Medicare systemâcreating two tiers of patients in this country. This proposal should be rejected and the government should go back and fix the problem. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>20129</page.no><name role="metadata">Stephens, Sen Ursula</name><name role="display">Senator STEPHENS</name><name.id>00AOS</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âYesterday when we were discussing the tabled report of the inquiry into the <inline ref="R1965">Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare) Bill 2003</inline> I addressed most of my comments to the work force issues and I would like to continue in that vein today. It has been very adequately put this morning that there are both philosophical and practical concerns about the proposals in this bill, and certainly Senator Forshaw and Senator Marshall have quite clearly articulated all of that. But the critical issue that we need to understand is that what we create in this bill is a two-tiered system that moves right away from the fact that Medicare was established to ensure that clinical need rather than personal financial circumstances should determine your ability to access appropriate services. That principle goes by the way with the proposals in this legislation. </para></talk.start><para>As I said, I really want to address my concerns and my remarks to the work force change issues and the proposals that are outlined in chapter 4 of the report entitled <inline font-style="italic">MedicarePlus: the future for Medicare?</inline> The A Fairer Medicare package provided for 234 new medical school places bonded to areas of work force shortage, plus 150 new GP registrar training places, plus funding for 457 full-time equivalent practice nurses. The MedicarePlus package adds funding for an additional 1,500 full-time equivalent doctors and 1,600 full-time equivalent nurses over the period 2003-07 and the welcome creation of a new Medicare item number to enable a rebate for practice nurses who are undertaking immunisation and wound management, which of course will be in addition to the grant of $8,000 per full-time equivalent GP in a practice to support the employment of practice nurses in urban areas of work force shortage, which I will come back to. It also includes the introduction of some short-term placements for training medical practitioners in outer metropolitan, regional, rural and remote areas in an attempt to address the current supply shortage. It includes some incentives for non-vocational registered doctors to practice in the areas of medical shortage for a period of five years and there is some funding to increase the number of overseas trained doctors directed to areas of work force need.</para><para>The bonded medical places from the previous package remain. I am pleased to see that the original recommendation from the committee's first Medicare inquiry which suggested that students willing to undertake postgraduate vocational training in rural areas should be able to attribute the period spent there against their bond termâa sensible recommendationâhas been taken up by the government in this new package. Otherwise, the additional undergraduate and postgraduate training places for GPs as well as training places for nurses and allied health workers from the original package remain. </para><para>I would like to consider the implications of the proposals and the practical response we have heard from the doctors associations, the universities and other health care professionals regarding how well the proposals address our concerns about access to health services, particularly in the regions. The uncontroversial elements of the package were: the concept of training more doctors and nurses in Australia, increasing access to aged care facilities, helping ex-doctors return to the medical work force and assisting overseas trained doctors to assimilate smoothly and productively into the Australian work force. </para><para>The concern that I did not see addressed by the Department of Health and Ageing during the inquiry was how we are going to be able to recruit 1,500 new overseas trained doctors. We heard from several important witnesses about how problematic that solution will be. There are difficulties in evaluating the quality of overseas qualifications and prior postgraduate learning and vocational training. There is concern that we are going to be drawing overseas trained doctors from a world pool and that we are not providing incentives that will overrule the incentives that are being provided in EU countries, in particular. We have the worldwide phenomenon that overseas trained doctors are sent to areas of needâmost commonly rural and remote areasâwhere they remain isolated from the support structures for people from non-English speaking backgrounds. Rural and remote communities have far less experience and understanding of the special support needs of international graduates and less capacity to respond, even if those needs are understood. If the policy of placing overseas trained doctors in areas of need continues, it has to be accompanied by a commitment to support programs for them and the communities in which they will be living.  </para><para>An important issue raised with the inquiry was the fact that EEC work practice legislation limiting hours of work and time on-call for doctors in Europe is leading to a huge demand for more medical practitioners there. So Australia will be competing for medical graduates in a world environment that is deficient in doctors. Increasing the number of medical students trained in Australia is the solution to the problem. We should be training and supporting our own doctors. The way to do that is to ensure that we have additional numbers of places for medical students and nurses in universities and colleges. Until we recognise that fact and start to integrate our health, economic and education and training systems, we are not going to be able to achieve that. </para><para>UnitingCare made an important point to us during the inquiry about the mathematics of this proposal. They put it this way in their submission: </para><quote><para>The announcement of additional short-term supervised placements in regional and rural areas for junior doctors is positive. However, it will result in only an additional 70 full-time doctors every year, when it has been estimated that a total of 2,000 are needed. </para></quote><para>The real message we heard from doctors organisations is that these additional equivalent full-time places, which are being promoted as the solution to the problems of overwork, the lack of locums and the impossibility of rural doctors being able to maintain their accreditation and undertake professional training because they have not got any replacement doctors, may alleviate the stress and the workload on doctors but they are not going to convert into additional full-time doctors out there in the bush. We have to understand the stresses and the pressures that are on rural and regional doctors, in particular. They cannot access support for a locum or someone to replace them so that they can undertake additional training or maintain their accreditation and may find themselves on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week. That is often the load on a country doctor, and it is the load we are going to be putting on overseas trained doctors who will be supported to go to country Australia. </para><para>This issue was also taken up by the Australian Health Care Reform Alliance. Their submission made the important point that more training places for general practitioners is a hollow initiative, given that the places currently available are not being filled, so unattractive is the prospect of entering general practice for many young doctors. The funding of additional training places will be a good idea, and indeed essential, once the basic underlying problems that are deterring doctors from entering general practice have been solved. We heard time and time again that the problem is not just doctors' incomes or their circumstancesâit is the whole pressure of the health system. We have all heard the Australian Health Care Reform Alliance's agenda and seen their communique that came out of the national summit last year. </para><para>I have another concern about the impacts of this legislation on rural and regional communities. The provision of hospital facilities for the practice of procedural services has decreased. Doctors who are skilled in procedures are being forced out of procedural medicine. They no longer have access to hospital facilities in order to provide their procedural services. This is becoming much more commonplace in rural and regional communities, particularly small communities. Many people who could have day surgery or be treated by the GP in the GP's own surgery now have to travel long distances and be hospitalised for those procedures. </para><para>These are simple issues that seem to slip through the net when considering rural health care. There are real needs in rural communities where health services are declining. The issue for us is that doctors who are skilled in procedures but who are deprived of access to a facility in which they can perform those procedures in their community may leave that community in order to be able to continue to practise those procedures. Alternatively, because they are not able to practise those procedures they lose their accreditation to perform them. So we are losing important procedures being performed in the bush. I personally see the proposal for practice nurses as one of the strongest parts of this package, but the capacity for those practice nurses is restricted to urban GPs. That does not actually take into account the role that practice nurses can play in rural communities as well. We have many nurses working alongside community practices in regional centres who deliver extraordinary services far above and beyond the call of duty. They are a linchpin in some of those smaller practices, especially where the doctor is under extraordinary stress in caring for his patients and delivering quality care.</para><para>The other issue that was not really recognised in this packageâand which was, importantly, taken up with the committeeâwas the changing dynamics of new doctors training and the emergence of many more female GPs. Women are more likely to work part time. We got the message very clearly though that many young male doctors are also expressing their intention to work fewer hours in order to find some balance between family and work. Young doctors are likely to be supported by a partner who also is likely to have a profession. We heard many submissions from advocates of young doctors telling us that the health system needs to take into account the need to balance work and family. This is just as important for the medical profession as it is for any other. We heard a very sensible solution being trialled in Canada where doctors are salaried to area health services. I think that model is worthy of consideration here in Australia.</para><para>The final issue I want to talk to you about today is the concerns the committee heard about the dependence on overseas trained doctors. We heard very strong evidence about this. Associate Professor Hawthorn provided the committee with a comprehensive analysis of the issue. She stressed to us the difficulties that overseas trained doctors face when seeking permanent residency. Many have significant problems qualifying for work in Australia, primarily because of the ban on OTDs applying under the skilled migration program. This means that a decidedly different cohort of entrants arrive, with applicants entering Australia through a generalised non-profession based criteria. So they do not actually apply to enter Australia as doctors; they apply in other ways, particularly under general migration. They do not have the proven competency in either English or medicine and they can find exams, such as those from the Australian Medical Council, a huge challenge. We heard that the failure rates in these circumstances are extra-ordinarily high.</para><para>The Australian Healthcare Association told us:</para><quote><para>While the recruitment of overseas doctors is a good notion in principle, in practice Australia has encountered major problems with recruiting overseas doctors. The problems include the high rate of failure for the AMC test, Part 1 of the AMC is an English comprehension and multiple choices and Part 2 is a practical oral examination of patients and conditions. At present 2,000 doctors have passed Part 1 of the AMC but have not completed Part 2. Another 3,000 doctors have expressed interest in sitting Part 1 but have not yet felt confident to sit the exam. The AHA has said that overseas students may need extra assistance and training before sitting the exam, including spoken English practice. </para></quote><para>What we have here is a really important issue: the dependence we have on the use of overseas trade doctors to resolve our current work force shortage. What is not recognised in the government's acknowledgement of this issue is that many of these applicants for permanent residency are not precluded from practising without the relevant testing.</para><para>Professor Hawthorne told the committee that, due to demand-driven processes, substantial numbers of these OTDs had entered Australian practice prior to passing one or both of the AMC exams. It was extraordinary to hear this evidence and to have explained to us how that was able to happen. She told us that temporary resident OTDs are able to bypass the occupational English test and the AMC exams at the point of entry, proceeding immediately to medical practice. Quite significantly, she called for reform of OTD entry requirements, including the lifting of the ban relating to medically trained applicants within the skilled migration program and the adequate resourcing of professional transition training for both temporary and permanent OTDs.</para><para>The work force issues are an important part of the package. As you will note from yesterday, there is no recommendation in the report specifically relating to the work force issues, but they were a very important part of the consideration of the overall health system in Australia and they are important for us to consider in terms of our response to the legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>20133</page.no><name role="metadata">Kirk, Sen Linda</name><name role="display">Senator KIRK</name><name.id>00AOO</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn her speech this morning to the Senate, Senator Knowles attacked the length of the speakers list for the <inline ref="R1965">Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare) Bill 2003</inline>. Senator Knowles seems to think that an end to universal health care in this country should not be a matter of concern to people in this house. I, like my Labor colleagues before me, am of a somewhat different persuasion on this issue. We believe that this bill fundamentally undermines the Medicare system as we know itâthat is, Medicare as the foundation of universal health care in this country. This so-called MedicarePlus package in fact reduces Medicare to a residual rather than a universal model of health care.</para></talk.start><para>Labor are unequivocal in our opposition to this bill. We argue that it is a package that goes to the core of what kind of society we want in Australia. Medicare, as a universal system, commits us to collective responsibility for the health of our nation through the taxation system. In essence, a universal health care system is about health care for those who need it, not just for those who can pay for it. The disgraceful decline of bulk-billing under this government has meant that health care for those who need it is fast becoming part of our history.</para><para>Last year my office in Kent Town in Adelaide, South Australia, sent out Labor's Medicare survey to constituents in the Norwood area surrounding my electorate office. In the federal electorate of Sturt, where my office is located, bulk-billing has declined by 18.6 per cent in the past three years. In Norwood, many people reported to me that they were increasingly not seeking medical advice because of the cost of a visit to the doctorâand some of these people were ending up in hospital emergency departments. Others reported that their doctor let patients who pay extra jump the queue while most patients had to wait up to 10 days for an appointment. In one of the surveys that I received from constituents, a woman wrote:</para><quote><para>I am a passionate supporter of a fair medical system. I don't understand why an egalitarian society has a two level system. I'd much rather pay a higher Medicare levy than buy into a system that offers a preferential medical service to those best placed to pay. Rather than further dismantling Medicare, let's have a good system that provides a good service to all Australians. </para></quote><para>Labor will fight the creation of a two-tier system of health care in this country. We believe in a system that provides health care to those who need it, not to those who can pay for it. We want a good system for all Australians, not a two- or three-tier system that this government, it seems, is trying to create.</para><para>It is clear that Medicare is in crisis. Many of my constituents have very disturbing stories to tell about the state of the health system and its effect upon people. One aged pensioner wrote to me:</para><quote><para>I moved to Norwood in 2001, so I changed my Doctor. At the first visit they charged me $58. But I am a single aged pensioner and can't afford so much money up front ... So I changed the doctor again, who bulk bills, but I have to catch two buses to get there, as I don't drive a car, no doctor around here bulk bills, it is all very upsetting as I am not too well.</para></quote><para>The $5 incentive to GPs who bulk-bill concession card holders and children under 16, brought in by this government, will not fundamentally alter the number of GPs that bulk-bill throughout Australia. Another one of my constituents wrote to me:</para><quote><para>There are no bulk billing services in the eastern suburbs of Adelaide. It is assumed that everyone is wealthy. I am 55, was made redundant, have a small superannuation pension and do temporary work whenever something is available. In other words, one of the many working poor.</para></quote><para>It is people like this woman who will miss out under the Prime Minister's and the Minister for Health and Ageing's `MedicareMinus' bulk-billing package. Concession card holders and families receiving family tax benefit A will be eligible for an 80 per cent rebate of all out of hospital, out-of-pocket expenses in excess of $500 in each calendar year. But there is a catch here: you cannot get into the safety net without paying $500 or $1,000 up front. Australians do not get access to the sham safety net until they have paid out $500 or $1,000.</para><para>The Howard government's $500 sham safety net applies to the two million families receiving family tax benefit A. Families receive fortnightly payments of family tax benefit if they register with Centrelink and provide an estimate of future income. Due to the difficulty of predicting income, six out of 10 families are paid incorrectlyâeither too little or too much. In 2001-02, 1.2 million families received incorrect payments. As a consequence, families are consistently lumped with massive bills due to the inadequacies of this system. Many families who have already been burnt by the family payment debt trap now choose not to register with Centrelink for family tax benefit. Instead, they wait until the end of the financial year to get the family tax benefit paid in their tax return. These families are eligible for family tax benefit A but are not registered for it. We have to ask: how will these families get extra Medicare payments if their expenses are more than $500 per year?</para><para>If Medicare payments are now going to be made on the basis of this failed system that I have just described, it leaves the door open for the government to claw back Medicare payments if families are subsequently found ineligible for family tax benefit. The government's assurances that it will not simply do not stack up with its zero tolerance policy for family tax benefit. Instead of fixing the family payment debt trap, it seems that the government is attempting to export the idea to Medicare. The linking of these two doom schemes could result in families having to repay family tax benefits and Medicare benefits at the end of the financial year.</para><para>Only 200,000 Australian families will get anything at all from this package. Only 0.8 per cent of the government's health budget will be spent on this so-called safety net. For the lucky few individuals who can get on the lowerâbut not low enoughâsafety net of $500, their incomes are already so low that the safety net is simply inadequate. Income limits for the majority of concession card holders are appallingly low. Health care cards are currently available to those individuals earning below $336 per week before tax. On this kind of income you can hit the safety net but it will not provide much of a softening effect for the harsh reality of escalating health expenses and an absence of bulk-billing. For those people who fall slightly on the other side of this upper income limit, the government is offering nothing. Its refusal to restore bulk-billing means that not only will these people find it harder to find bulk-billing services but also they will be paying more and more for the health care that they require. These people, like so many others, will receive no benefit until their out-of-pocket medical expenses reach $1,000 per year. It is the working poor who will miss out on safety nets and on private health insurance premiums. </para><para>Yesterday the Senate Select Committee on Medicare tabled in the Senate its second inquiry report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Medicare Plus: the </inline><inline font-style="italic">future for Medicare?</inline> Welfare groups, in their submissions to that inquiry, overwhelmingly pointed out that the $500 for concession card holders and family tax benefit A recipients would likely be out of reach for themâlike many of those who will only be eligible for the $1,000 threshold. In their submission to the inquiry, the Doctors Reform Society wrote:</para><quote><para>Even for those who might reach the threshold, the proposal does nothing for them until they reach that threshold. Thus, if they are struggling with costs in January, or June, before they reach the threshold, they may simply delay their visit until desperate, or seek the cheaper alternative at the public hospital emergency department. The concept of a `safety net' which cuts in after a certain threshold spending requires a capacity to budget for the year. Many of the patients who are struggling financially have trouble budgeting for a week, let alone years, and will be little helped by this proposal.</para></quote><para>The Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Ageing seem to be pretending to Australians that a safety net will catch them when they have high health costs. They are trying to convince the public that it is anything but the truthâthat is, Medicare minus bulk-billing.</para><para>We know that Medicare is broken. Everyone is aware of this reality. But the government's remedy is one that will only make Medicare sicker in the long term. What is this government offering as a solution? A safety net that is full of holes. Australians do not want a safety net that does not work. They do not want Medicare minus bulk-billing. Only Labor are committed to saving Medicare and to ensuring that Australians get access to bulk-billing.</para><para>Labor have pledged to save Medicare and restore bulk-billing. Labor will introduce Medicare teams for health hotspots around Australiaâthose areas in which bulk-billing rates are in free fall. Each health hotspot will have up to four Medicare teams, each consisting of two doctors and a practice nurse who together will provide an estimated 56,000 consultations per year at no cost to the patient. Labor's plan is one that will restore access and equity to our health system and will provide powerful incentives for GPs to extend bulk-billing.</para><para>Labor have also announced that in government we will invest $300 million over four years in a national dental care program to help the half a million Australians currently facing a wait of up to five years to get dental treatment. This will clear the backlog and shorten the waiting lists of the many Australians who are waiting for public dental health care in this country. This is in stark contrast to what the Minister for Health and Ageing and the Prime Minister are offering. Currently, the principal form of Commonwealth involvement in dental care is via the private health insurance rebate. For many Australians this is simply out of reach. In practice this means that Commonwealth spending is directed primarily to the wealthy while providing no targeted assistance to those most in need. </para><para>Labor believe that dental care, like health care, is a national responsibility. A Latham Labor government will be committed to health care for those who need it, not for those who can pay for it. The earlier select committee on Medicare, which reported last year, found that the problems in accessing doctors around Australia are significant. The committee found: an increase in GP attendances over time which had not been matched by new entrants to the profession; a move away from hospital based care; and an increase in the health care needs of an ageing population, with a corresponding growth in chronic illnesses. </para><para>This is a concern that came through time and again in the responses that I received from my constituents in South Australia through the Medicare survey. They reported that bulk-billing doctors are harder and harder to find. Those doctors are less and less able to spend quality time with their patients. The $5 increase in the Medicare rebate for concession card holders and for children under 16 is a measure that does not go far enough. There should be a $5 increase for bulk-billed consultations for all Australians. That is Labor's position. Bulk-billing should be retained. Rather than funding a safety net with more holes than substance, this government should defend bulk-billing. That is what the Australian people want and that is what came through in my Medicare surveys.</para><para>This bill, if it is passed as a part of the government's MedicarePlus packageâwhich is in fact MedicareMinusâwill see an end to bulk-billing, and an end to universal health care in this country. Labor's plan by contrast is for a $1.9 billion injection into the health system to ensure that all Australians get fair access to bulk-billing and that all Australians have an extra $5 in their Medicare rebate for bulk-billed consultations. Labor are committed to a fair society. Labor's commitment is one underpinned by real money and attainable goals that will ensure that health care is available not only to those who can pay but also those who need it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>20136</page.no><name role="metadata">Denman, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator DENMAN</name><name.id>FY5</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="R1965">Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare) Bill 2003 </inline>proposes, in part, to divide this nation. It seeks to create two classes of health care. It will result in some Australians being able to access the health care they need and others being forced to take risks about their personal wellbeing, the cost of which all Australians will have to pay down the track.</para></talk.start><para>It is the government's assertion that the universality of Medicare does not include bulk-billing. It says that it was always intended that each general practitioner would have the right to determine whether he or she would bulk-bill their patients. The government says that the basic principles of Medicare only include the right to treatment in a public hospital and to be reimbursed the agreed rebate of the schedule fee. But the expectation of the Australian people has always been that it should not be difficult for general practitioners to reach the conclusion that they should bulk-bill.</para><para>It was always the intention of Medicare that access to health care would be based on each Australian's state of health, not their wealth. The men and women of Australia and their families expected that the government would maintain the rebate and the schedule fees at such levels that bulk-billing would be commonplaceâat least commonplace enough for Australians to be able to choose between a doctor who bulk-billed and one who did not. They expected that bulk-billing would be available to all Australians whatever their age and wherever they might live. </para><para>Let us look at what this government is saying about Medicare and this legislation. In the other place the Minister for Health and Ageing said:</para><quote><para>I want to make it clear that Australia has one of the best health systems in the world. For the past 20 years, Medicare has provided Australians with essential protection through affordable access to medical, pharmaceutical and hospital services.</para></quote><para>Under this government, this protection has proved to be expendable. The government has not practised what the minister now preaches. Medicare must continue to provide this essential protection to all Australians. Sadly, this government clearly does not believe that this is the case, despite what the minister says. In the debate in the other place the minister went on to say:</para><quote><para>MedicarePlus responds to the concerns raised and seeks to guarantee that Medicare remains a universal system of affordable access to high-quality health care.</para></quote><para>Perhaps the most extraordinary claim from the minister was couched in the following terms, when he said:</para><quote><para>The government is committed to a high level of bulk-billing as a key element to Medicare.</para></quote><para>Their definition of high level must be very different from that which we on this side of the Senate have. I am sure that the government's definition is also vastly different from that which most Australian men and women would expect. Take the current bulk-billing rates in my home state of Tasmania. The September figures for 2003 reveal completely unsatisfactory rates of bulk-billing throughout Tasmania. A comparison with the year-by-year figures since the year 2000 show a rapidly deteriorating situation. This is during the tenure of a government which professes to be committed to a high level of bulk-billing. </para><para>When Mr Howard became Prime Minister in 1996, the national bulk-billing rate was 80 per cent. It now languishes at 68 per cent. Of course, in the regions it is very much worse than that. In the region where I live in the north-west of Tasmania it is very difficult to find a bulk-billing doctor. I cannot regard 41.5 per cent bulk-billing in Bass, 46.6 per cent in Braddon, 47.3 per cent in Franklin, 51.4 per cent in Denison or even 64.6 per cent in Lyons as demonstrating a high rate of bulk-billing. These rates are pathetically low. They are unacceptable and the proposals now put forward by this government to remedy the situation are way too little and, more significantly, way too late. </para><para>Even more stunning has been the rate of decline. At the end of March 2000, after four years of the Howard government, the bulk-billing rate in Bass was bad enough at 53.5 per cent. It is now a whole 12 percentage points lower at just 41.5 per cent. In Braddon the decline has been even more pronounced at 16.1 percentage points, down from 67.5 per cent in 2000 to just 51.4 per cent. In Denison the decline has been a full eight per cent.</para><para>Maybe the difficulty for this government in acknowledging the problem has been the fact that the bulk-billing rate in the electorate of the Prime Minister has hardly varied at all over the past few years and still sits at just under 80 per cent. Perhaps the realisation for the government that something needed to be done has come because the electorate of the new Minister for Health and Ageing is not quite so well served as that of the Prime Minister. In Warringah, whilst the rate is still relatively high compared with regional areas of Australia, it has dropped to 70.8 per cent from 77.6 per cent in 2000. The measures proposed in this package may well lift the bulk-billing rate back up in Warringah and make the minister feel that he has made a difference, but they will do little to remedy the desperate state of affairs which exists outside the big cities and particularly in my home state of Tasmania. I listened to some of the previous speeches and heard contributions from my side about the difficulties of attracting GPs to regional areas. That is very true, particularly where I live. We are losing GPs. We are getting overseas trained doctors who cannot always stay for any length of time and it is creating great problems. </para><para>The government has allowed the rate to decline because it has lost sight of the real purpose of Medicare, despite all the claims about how committed it is to universal health care in Australia. I know that the medical practitioners throughout Tasmania, should they choose to bulk-bill, find it difficult to run their practices economically with the current level of rebate, and I understand that. Our lower population and its decentralised nature do not offer Tasmanian doctors the same economies of scale available to their big city counterparts. The same would apply to practitioners in most if not every other region of rural Australia.</para><para>It is also fine for the government to extol what it sees as a basic right under Medicare for every Australian to be able to be treated in a public hospital, but that assumes that the public hospitals can manage the increase in patient load which occurs when the local doctor no longer bulk-bills or is only prepared to bulk-bill some patients. Again, at the local hospital in my area this is a real problemâpatients come in through outpatients and have to wait a long time because they cannot get a bulk-billing doctor. The fact is that they cannot. There has been enough blame and responsibility shifting between the various levels of government and that has to stop.</para><para>It is accepted by all sides of politics and in all tiers of government that Australians are entitled to proper health care wherever and whenever they genuinely need it. It should not matter what sort of card they have in their wallet, how old they are or whether they happen to be in the street next to where a bulk-billing doctor lives. No Australian should have to make a decision for themselves or for a member of their family that they cannot have medical treatment they genuinely need because on that day the family cannot afford itâand hence the outpatients department in the hospital near where I live is being inundated with these families, and it is not their fault. General health and access to proper medical care ought to be the unassailable right of every Australian. It is true that some Australians are more vulnerable than others. There is an argument that children under 16 and persons covered by Commonwealth concession cards are in this category. It is that avenue which the government now takes to attempt to rebalance the scales of its appalling record of providing basic health care to all Australians. It is not enough and it does not address the basic issue of ensuring all Australians have a real chance of finding a bulk-billing doctor if they need one.</para><para>It is true that since the start of Medicare it has been up to each individual general practitioner to choose whether he or she would bulk-bill a particular patient. But it is the government which can substantially influence that by creating an environment in which GPs can afford to bulk-bill. I believe that most doctors are prepared to do the right thing but there has to be some real incentive for them to do so. Individual and small group practices in regional areas cannot be expected to bear the brunt of the government's preparedness to allow bulk-billing to run down. Government must lift the rebate for applicable general consultations for all patients, not just for patients in certain categories. </para><para>The package proposed by the government sends, in my view, the wrong signal to our GPs. The message sent by this legislation is that GPs are really only encouraged to bulk-bill Commonwealth concession card holders and children under 16. A truly universal system must take away the need for any Australian to question whether they can take care of their genuine health problems when they are confronted with them. Take a young 18-year-old starting out in the work force with a typical Australian carefree `she'll be right mate' attitude. With the limited disposable income he or she has, are they going to make the right decision about their personal health care? The young person gets a cold which turns into pneumonia and then, in the absence of bulk-billing, opts not to visit the doctor to get proper care. The illness leads to time off work, perhaps the loss of incomeâdepending on the nature of the employmentâor even the loss of job. The end result is that this young Australian is on the social security payroll and, somewhat ironically, under the scheme now proposed by the government is then eligible to be bulk-billed for any further medical treatment. These are the sorts of issues that we have to look at and address in this legislation.</para><para>Take another Australian couple who are not yet financially secure and are trying to buy their first home. They are not eligible to be bulk-billed and problems come along. They are not covered by a Commonwealth concession card, they become illâI had an example of this up my wayâthe wife becomes pregnant and they can no any longer access the income they once had, so they are in dire straits and look like losing their home. We pay for the increased cost of health care for Australians whose health conditions should never have been allowed to worsen in the first place. If the situation worsens, we pay again through the need to provide social security or even housing to those who could have provided for themselves. Just as owning your own car or home has been very much the Australian dream, access to medical care when you need it has rightfully become the expectation of every Australian.</para><para>The right to basic health care is fundamental to the Australian way of life. It is a hallmark of our society. It is one of the pillars on which the economic and social prosperity of this nation is built. A healthy population makes for a strong and healthy economy and way of life. There are some things that we cannot afford to let drift: the right to a good education and access to health care.</para><para>This government has allowed bulk-billing to decline to the stage where in many parts of Australia, especially in rural and regional areas, it is now impossible to find a doctor who will bulk-billâI have addressed this issue previously up my way. Through this package of legislation, the government now seeks to apply a bandaid solution. It wants to give a bit of an incentive to doctors to bulk-bill young children and concession card holders and hopes that the figures will improve so that the next quarter's media release can contain some positive points. That would be news, because it is a long time since the quarterly release of bulk-billing rates around the country has contained any good news, especially for my constituents in Tasmania. But the reality is that this is nothing more than a bandaidâand I am sure we have all had experiences with bandaids. They do not actually solve the problem; they assist in stopping the situation from getting any worse. Sometimes they do not even succeed in that. In fact, left uncared for, they can make the situation much worse. </para><para>I fear that this is exactly what the result will be of the government's piecemeal attitude to providing universal health care for all Australians. The safety net is put forward by the government as a key tenet of its grand solution but it does nothing to address the basic problem. Why wait until medical expenses get to those levels? Why not address the issue when the person becomes ill in the first place? We are yet to know the full details of the procedures which will be required to take advantage of this so-called safety net. It is hard to imagine that it will be anything other than a bureaucratic nightmare, especially for those without a concession card or access to family tax benefit A. The reality in very many cases is that proper medical care accessed at the onset of the problem will prevent the need for further treatment and ballooning costs. I wish to join my colleagues in opposing this bill and urge the Senate to do the same.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>20140</page.no><name role="metadata">Buckland, Sen Geoffrey</name><name role="display">Senator BUCKLAND</name><name.id>009D2</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak in this debate and join my colleagues in passing comment that the <inline ref="R1965">Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare) Bill 2003</inline> before us is ill-conceived by the Howard government and certainly needs defeating. In considering the bill, we need to understand what Medicare is all about. It seems to me that the Howard government has lost sight of the fundamental principle of Medicare when introducing its safety net arrangements.</para></talk.start><para>Medicare is the Commonwealth funded health insurance scheme that provides free or subsidised health care services to the Australian people. It is a universal health insurance schemeâat least it was intended to beâbut the safety net arrangements proposed in this legislation take the universality out of it by categorising the population into two distinct groups: the less well-off and the not so well-off perhaps. I suppose there is a third group who are well-off and not too fussed by anything being proposed, but I tend to think they are in the minority. This seems an odd thing to do if the government is serious about maintaining a health insurance scheme whereby all Australians can access affordable health care no matter where they are, where they live or how much they earn. They are eligible for a universal rebate for the services they receive, they are able to benefit from free care in public hospitals and receive subsidised medicines through the PBS. Under this scheme, the very idea of access to affordable health care for all Australians goes out the window; all it does is create a series of winners and losers.</para><para>It is not my intention to reiterate and bore the Senate with what has already been saidâit has been said very well by my colleagues. I was not part of the committee that inquired into this issue, but I give praise to Senator McLucas and her colleaguesâfrom all sidesâfor the effort they put in. It is a shame that the government members could not join the majority report. Having not been a part of the committee, I relied heavily on the report and also, more importantly, on the evidence that was given before the committee. Much of it moved me to believe that some of it should be put on the record in this place. Some of the rhetoric does not match the reality of the proposed reforms.</para><para>This package does not strengthen Medicare as a universal entitlement; rather, it enhances the safety net provisions for people clocking up medical bills as a result of the chronic underfunding of the federal Medicare Benefits Schedule. It also confirms that the costs of medical practice are outstripping the Australian government's willingness to properly cover a visit to the doctor for everyone. It signals very clearly the government's preference for well-off people to pay more at the point of service, so that a defined groupâchildren under 16 and people with concession cardsâmay attract an additional $5 per visit Medicare insurance entitlement and thus have a slightly better chance of being bulk-billed. They have a slightly better chanceâit is not a guarantee. </para><para>There appear to be some major assumptions underpinning the MedicarePlus package. Firstly, there is the assumption that many people will pay more to see a GP. Only concession card holders and young children are the targets for bulk-billing. In other words, the government is content that nearly half of all GP patients will have little hope of being bulk-billed. In the mind of the Australian government, this is obviously acceptable public policy. What I have just said comes from the Catholic Health Australia submission. It is one that I would encourage all members of the Senate to pay attention to, along with all of the other very fine submissions. The reason I think it is important for people like me to rely on the evidence is that the people making these submissionsâthe welfare groups and the individualsâare the people who are experiencing the difficulties of health care day by day and hour by hour. They experience these difficulties 24 hours a day.</para><para>GPs will only be able to sustain bulk-billing at its current rate of remuneration by seeing more patients for shorter consultations. This is another observation from that same submission, and isn't it right? I am a very fortunate person, and so are the members of my family. We rarely need to see a doctor, but that could change at any time. In fact, last year was the first time in four years that I have been to see a doctor. I took sick here in Canberra with the flu because of the weather. I am blessed in that I do not need to continually use the services of a GP. Many times doctors are putting people through as quickly as they can, sometimes simply to maintain some level of service but also to keep the level of income up. I do not know if that is greed based. I do not know if it is because there are so many sick who cannot access doctors, particularly in rural areas, where there are not sufficient doctors. That is not an aspersion on doctors at all. Indeed, I have spoken with many doctors in rural areas who felt this need to push patients through as quickly as they could. It is endemic within our community now that we have insufficient doctors able to continue practising in rural areas. The government should do a lot more about it, rather than just talk about it.</para><para>There are people on concession cards who have better means than average working families. The many people who are in the work force and do not have concession cards, but do have families, mortgages and responsibility for someone who suffers an illness, are the ones who will lose out under the proposed legislation before us. They will lose out. They can be earning but they will be no better off than concession card holders or those who fall into the safety net area that the government says will be covered. The committee report found that the key objective of any health safety net is the minimisation of hardship resulting from incurring medical costs. This often involves the identification of those in the community who are economically disadvantaged and/or those who incur above average medical expenses. In assessing the proposed new safety nets, it is important to establish the situation as it presently exists. The rationale behind the current safety net system was explained to the committee by Professor Deeble. Professor Deeble said:</para><quote><para>The underlying reasoning was that a combination of bulk billing by doctors and access to free public hospital care should and would ensure that people with unavoidably high medical use were not forced to pay out large amounts themselves.</para></quote><para>...	...	...</para><quote><para>But the primary concern was with high medical use, <inline font-weight="bold">not</inline> high doctor fees. Benefits have therefore been limited to the full schedule fee, not the doctor's charge. If the schedule fee was `fair and reasonable' covering higher charges was seen as unjustified and contradictory. </para></quote><para>These are people who are out there every day dealing with the problem we have in our health care system. The report goes on to say:</para><quote><para>The submission from the Department of Health and Ageing argued that while out-of-pocket expenses for GP services have increased over time, patient contributions for specialist, diagnostic and treatment services have increased by dramatically more. The Department's Submission indicates that between 1984-85 and 2002-03, average patient contributions for GP services increased by 65% in real terms, compared with a 310% real increase for non-GP services.</para></quote><para>It does not matter where you go in this report or where you go in the evidence that came before the committee, everyone is saying that what is being proposed in relation to the safety net by this government is not right. It is wrong and it needs to be rethought. As I said earlier, one of the principles of Medicare is equityâsomething for all Australians. This is another way the government has found to divide the nation into different groupings. On the point of equity the report says:</para><quote><para>Setting aside the issue of universality, does the creation of incentives to bulk bill concession card holders and children under 16 years represent an effective measure of need for bulk billing? Evidence to the inquiry has raised two principal objections to the scheme.</para><para>3.51 Firstly, a focus on concession card holders and children tends to exclude a group loosely categorised as the working poor.</para></quote><para>That was pointed out in the Country Womens Association submission. I will not quote the full text of that but I would encourage senators to read that part of the submission dealing with equity. The Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union made a similar case. Again, without going into too much detail of that, reflecting the same view they said:</para><quote><para>There is another group of Australians, the forgotten Australiansâ</para></quote><para>this time not the working poor but the forgotten Australiansâ</para><motion><para>that are key to this debate, they are low paid Australian workers. </para></motion><para>not those on benefits, but those who are commonly called the working poor. The same problem was gone into in great detail by ACOSS, a respected organisation in many different areas. ACOSS said:</para><quote><para>Our analysis shows that people without children and earning the minimum wage (around $450 a week) and part time workers earning more than the concession card cut-off point of $340 a week, will miss out on the bulk billing incentives. They face a current average co-payment of $13 for every GP visit and $45 for an x-ray. </para></quote><para>So it goes on. The Geelong and Region Trades and Labour Council made a submission along the same lines as did the Council on the Ageing, which said that illogical differences would emerge:</para><quote><para>â¢  between concession card holders and those whose income is only marginally beyond eligibility limits;</para><para>â¢  between low wage earners and people on income support payments; and </para><para>â¢  between dependants who are 16 and dependants who are 17âboth still in education and being supported by their parents.</para></quote><para>These are the people who are missed out and suffer from this ill-conceived proposed legislation. Many of the submissions saw this whole proposal as being ill-considered. The Uniting Church called it `illogical and unrealistic'. Catholic Health Australia, which I made reference to earlier on, made the point that there `are people with concession cards who have better means than average working families.' The Doctors Reform Society concluded: </para><quote><para>Doctors who currently bulk bill everyone are being told that they will be paid less for seeing a struggling worker in a low paid job than a comfortable pensioner or the children in a wealthy family. The message to the doctor is that he/she should charge the struggling worker a co-payment.</para></quote><para>It does not matter who you talk to or where you go, we find real difficulties confronting us with this bill.</para><para>There are other parts of this bill that would be worth exploring if time allowed and at some time we may do that. The submission that touched me more than anyâand I suppose knowing the author made it seem a little bit closerâwas from the St Vincent de Paul Society. On the safety net it reads:</para><quote><para>The Safety Net, which pays 80% of medical costs (not including expenditure on medications) over a $500 (for Concession Card holders or recipients of Family Tax Benefit A) or $1000 (for others) a year threshold, sanctions the high fees of Specialists and Diagnostic Services, encouraging further rises.</para><para>This, in our view, should be unnecessary with access to affordable GP services. The current proposal is unsatisfactory for the 4.6 million people in low income households.</para></quote><para>That is, there are 4.6 million people we have missed out. It continues:</para><quote><para>As mentioned above, they do not have the $500, much less the $1000, to spend on health care. The opportunity to use the Safety Net depends on their ability to spend these sums of money in the first place to reach the out-of-pocket expense threshold. Those who don't have the money either forego the medical care they need or seek it in overstretched Emergency Departments of Public Hospitals.</para></quote><para><inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>20143</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would also like to contribute on behalf of the Democrats to the debate on the <inline ref="R1965">Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare) Bill 2003</inline> and to the broader debate on Medicare. There has been a lot of talk on this already today and frankly a large proportion of it has not gone to the specific content of this bill, which introduces an enhanced safety net. Whilst there has been a lot of interesting rhetoric and talk about philosophies and theory, again a lot of it has not been particularly linked to the imminent reality people are facing. My feeling is that in this debate not just today in the Senate but in the community over many months a lot of people have let their loathing of this government and its ideology get in the way of objectively assessing the broader issue of our health system and more specifically the content of the piece of legislation before us. I can very much understand people's loathing of this government and of a lot of what it is about, but that should not cloud their assessment of the potential impact of the legislation that was presented to the Senate this morning.</para></talk.start><para>This legislation, and the broader MedicarePlus package, was referred to a Senate committee, and the report was brought down yesterday. I commend the report to anybody to read. The majority report of the opposition and Democrats senators, along with Senator Lees, provides a fairly good outlineâwhich, while reasonably brief, has sufficient detailâof its examination of not just the safety net issue but some of the broader issues in the MedicarePlus package. This legislation, of course, deals with just the safety net issue.</para><para>The Democrats believe very strongly that many Australians are hurting, and that some of them are hurting a lot, because of the continuing and developing problems with Medicare and with our broader health system, but we want to do more than just acknowledge that fact and use it to bash the government around the head. We also want to see if we can alleviate some of that hurt. I find it quite extraordinary that Labor and the Greens are building as strong a picture as possible of how much people are hurting at the momentâand a lot of it has strong basis in factâbut then using that to somehow justify not exploring the opportunity to alleviate some of that hurt. There has been a suggestion in some of what has been said this morning and in other commentary, including in the Senate committee, that the very idea of a safety net is anathema to Medicare and that if we put in place a safety net it will mean that the opportunity to ensure the future of Medicare is lost. There is even a quote in the report about the idea of a safety net being a cruel hoax. </para><para>I am sorry, but there is already a safety net in place. The fact that many people do not know about it is a demonstration of how inadequate it is. The Senate committee report explains in quite good detail in chapter 2 on pages 11 and 12 why the existing safety net is no longer adequate and why it does not work. The report quite clearly and specifically says:</para><quote><para>It is clear that, under existing arrangements, out-of-pocket costs are mounting up to levels which are unaffordable for many Australians. The lack of adherence to the Schedule Fee and the drop in bulk billing rates has eroded the effectiveness of the existing safety net. </para></quote><para>That is what the majority report saysâthat is, the report from the Labor senators, the Democrats senators and Senator Lees. Obviously we want to get more adherence to the schedule fee and improve bulk-billing rates, but preventing this bill from going through in any form is not going to improve bulk-billing rates or adjust the schedule fee. You are dealing with completely different issues. The report itself acknowledges that the existing safety net is inadequate. It says:</para><quote><para>The result has been reduced affordability and access to even some basic medical services.</para></quote><para>I find it extraordinary that the response should be to oppose any attempt to address the existing safety net. The committee in the majority report agrees that the new safety net offers one possible option to address these problems. The report also saysâand the Democrats agree with this; that is why we signed up to itâthat there are some fundamental problems with how the safety net as proposed in this legislation is structured, not least of which are the two different thresholds. Some in the community will qualify sooner than others, which immediately opens up the possibility of widespread anomalies. The committee report details some of those anomalies, and one is that some people with a greater need who are in greater poverty will have to meet a higher threshold than others. It seems to us that a safety net with that anomaly is not the best mechanism.</para><para>Similarly, a universal health system with two different qualification thresholds presents problems. There is also the problemâand, thankfully, it is starting to be acknowledgedâthat people on lower middle incomes suffer a significant disadvantage.

The maximum rate is currently $3 per tonne of wine grapes and the present operative rate, set under the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Regulation 1999, is also $3 per tonne. This amendment will allow future changes to the operative rate to occur within the proposed $10 maximum rate. Any attempt to increase the levy must meet the 12 levy principles introduced by the government in January 1997. One of the principles relates to the need for demonstrated support for the industryâin this case, the wine industryâfor any change to the levy rate. That will require proper consultation with the industry and evidence of support for any increase. </para></talk.start><para>As the member for Hunter told the other place, Labor will ensure that all 12 tests are met before any levy is endorsed by the parliament and we will ensure that we widely consult with the wine industry. The Australian wine industry first sought the imposition of a levy in 1979 to assist research and development through the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation. Since then, the operative rate of the levy has been increased to $3 per tonne, with the last levy increase occurring in February 1999. This industry has expanded enormously in recent years, with exports now valued at $2.4 billion.</para><para>As a South Australian, I can say that wine grapes have increased in quality, particularly those grown in South Australia.

There are some things we leave unsaid. I note Mr Fitzgibbon made that claim about New South Wales but, of course, he is wrong and I think we need to make that very important point. South Australian wine growers make an outstanding contribution to the industry, the local economy and the national economy, and they play an increasingly important role in my state's tourism sector. As the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry said in his second reading speech, the Australian industry is globally recognised as a technological leader. Australian growers and winemakers have always been open to new ideas and keen to adopt new technology. As the member for Hunter pointed out, that is clearly the key to our success in the international marketplace. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Support for this amendment from the Winemakers Federation of Australia confirms the industry's commitment to research and development as a platform for the future. The Winemakers Federation is the declared winemakers organisation for the purposes of the legislation and represents some 95 per cent of wine production in Australia. As with other rural research and development arrangements, the government matches the expenditure of the levy funds on eligible research and development projects, up to 0.5 per cent of the determined gross value of production of the industry concerned. The amendment will provide the industry with the capacity to seek an increase in the operative rate of future vintages from July 2004.

Labor's big spending ways lead to higher government debt, higher taxes and higher interest rates.

That is why this government has negotiated the free trade agreement with the United Statesâan agreement that gives our industry and our exporters greater access to the world's largest economy. More export earnings for Australia and more jobs for Australian workers. That is what it is all about. The car industry says it is a good deal for Australia.

It might be appropriate, Senator Conroy, to have a look at the factsâapart from the fact of how you get rid of Senator Carr from the Victorian Labor Party.

I know that you are one of these other people like Senator Carr who never get out of Melbourne and so would not know what an avocado looked like, but let me help you, Senator Conroy. The arrangement is that 2,500 tonnes of avocados will be available for shipment between 15 September and 31 January.

He would find that most of the avocados are grown in Queensland and New South Wales. He would also find out that there is a very wide geographic distribution of avocado growing in Australia, anywhere between 17 and 32 degrees south. I can tell you from my wide experience and travel in country Australia that they grow just about anywhere, from up in Cape York down to where Senator Heffernan comes from. So there is a wide geographic range, and they become available at different times of the year. Here is the important bit: production peaks from June to December, with lighter supplies available during the summer months. If you go back to what I said earlier, September to January is the period when we can do 2,500 tonnes of avocados; from 1 February to 15 September, 1,500 tonnes of avocados.

I just cannot understand Mr Latham's carping, negative approach to this. Mr Latham had a great opportunity to work in Australia's interests, but he has gone back to the old-time Labor approach: flip-flopping all over the place and being negative just because the Howard government has promoted this very, very good deal for Australia.

Over the summer recess of the parliament Minister Anderson, the Deputy Prime Minister, and I were able to announce one of the most significant road funding packages and road funding boosts in Australia's history, which will significantly improve the quality of roads that motorists in most places in Australia drive on. The funding announcementsâwhich you would have noticed, Mr Presidentâdo in fact benefit all states of Australia in terms of Commonwealth funding. There are two significant parts. Firstly, there was the announcement of another $1.2 billion over four years for the extension of the Roads to Recovery program, one of the most popular road funding programs in Australian history. That will see $300 million a year going to local councils throughout all states and territories of Australia. That money will commence flowing immediately on the expiration of the existing Roads to Recovery program.</para></talk.start><para>What we will do in stage 2 of the Roads to Recovery program, which will commence in July 2005, is break it into two segments. A $200 million a year program is given directly to councils so that local councils and local communities and citizens in their local areas can drive the road funding prioritiesâas opposed to state Labor roads ministers who tend to drive their priorities into their own little favourite areas. In Western Australia we have a road minister who does not really like roads; she likes railways and wants to build a $1.2 billion railway down to Mandurah and allow all the roads to crumble.  </para><para>The other segment of the Roads to Recovery program is a $100 million per year program which will allow councils to work together at a regional level to invest in road projects that have strategic importance to the timber industryâwhich I think Senator Macdonald will be pleased to seeâto the tourism industry or to other strategic industries. Through you, Mr President, I might say to Senator Johnston that that fund has been described already by Labor as a slush fund for the next election. Unfortunately the shadow minister who described it thus was confused, because the funds actually do not commence until after the next federal election. There is no politics in this; it is just good sensible policy for building better roads and safer roads for Australiansâsafer roads for families driving on holidays, tourists going around to various beautiful parts of our lovely country and freight operators who are plying local roads.</para><para>Senator Johnston asked me whether there are any alternative policies. This policy has been described by the Australian Labor Party, both by the shadow minister and by the leader, in derogatory terms. Roads to Recovery was originally called a `boondoggle' by the Labor Party, which perplexed most Australians. Mr Latham himself has actually said that they will not commit to the $100 billion per annum strategic fund. He said in typical Mr Flip-Flop style language that he would change the priorities. There is also an injection of over a quarter of a billion dollars into the national highway and other strategic roads which will ensure that goods and services are moved far more efficiently and safely around Australia. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name></talker><para>âMr President, I rise on a point of order.

You consistently imply that a family that has had an overpayment should be able to keep it, whereas this government's position is that a family on the same income in the same circumstances with the same number of children should get the same amount of money. Therefore, someone who has had an overpayment should have it treated as a down payment on the next year or, if they are able to, pay it back.</para></talk.start><para>It is an equity issue: families in the same situation with the same number of kids of the same age on the same income get the same amount of money. Those who get an overpayment are expected to pay it back. Those who cannot do so up front can pay it back by way of negotiated amountsâ$20 or $40 a fortnightâand others have it taken out of their next year's payment. So I think it is somewhat of a misnomer, Senator, for you to refer to them consistently as debts rather than explaining properly to the Australian public what they are, which is overpayments to people who have got more than another Australian family in the same circumstances.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>20157</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMr President, I ask a supplementary question.

It must be understood that when you do that, you bring a whole new category of people onto welfareâthat is, people who otherwise would not be entitled to any welfare become entitled to some. You may think, Senator, it would be a great achievement for a government to continue to reduce withdrawal rates so as to put a greater portion of the community onto some form of welfare. I do not happen to share that view. I am very pleased to be part of a government that has dramatically increased payments to families: over $2 billion more; over $11 billion a year in the hands of familiesâan average payment of $5,000 to $6,000 per family and higher for Indigenous Australians.

This comes from the same Mr Latham who, in July 1991 as Councillor Latham, called for a public register of all donations to council campaigns, undoubtedly because it was the ethical thing to do. Yet in May the following year the same Councillor Latham failed to declare that he received a secret $3,000 for his campaign from a developer. It is so typical of Mr Latham's old Laborâsay one thing in a blaze of glory but do another when it can be of personal benefit to youâand of Labor's Mr Flip-Flop. So it is no surprise that Mr Latham says he will not take money from companies which as part of their business make cigarettes yet accept money from all those companies which as part of their business sell cigarettes, like the Labor controlled workers' clubs which sell tobacco products and are big donors to Labor. No consistency, no policy integrityâthe only thing Mr Latham offers, as former Labor Attorney-General Michael Lavarch said, is cheap populism. What we have from Mr Latham is no real policy, no ladder of opportunity but the blabber of opportunism.</para></talk.start><para>If we want to talk about unethical political donations, let us talk about the two biggest cash cows for Labor. Both involve ripping money out of workers' pay packets. The biggest, worth some $5 million last year, is the taking of a person's compulsorily paid union dues and giving them directly to Laborâmany from workers who support and vote for the Howard-Anderson government. The worst rort of all is Centenary House, which last year brought in more than $1.2 million to Labor thanks to the Commonwealth Electoral Act and the requirement for public disclosure.</para><para>The Senate will remember that Labor and Mr Latham have been asked to renegotiate the lease on proper market terms to save taxpayers' money. Three times Labor have said they could not do it, because the mortgage was structured in such a way as to make it impossible. Yet what do we see in the latest returns? Centenary House, which cried that it was too poor to give the taxpayers of Australia a break, has donated $1.235 million to the Australian Labor Party! Well may Mr Latham question some donations, but one habit he cannot kick is the union and Centenary House fix which unethically funds Labor. He self-righteously seeks to clothe himself in political virtue by publicly rejecting a small voluntary donation, whilst accepting secret funds from a developer and millions of dollars from compulsorily extracted funds.

It does require the cooperation of states under national protocols. In October last year the Western Australian police notified Centrelink of 25 escapeesâsomeone has to tell Centrelink that they have escaped. Centrelink responded to that request within a few days, giving the addresses of 11 escapees that they knew ofâthat they knew the names of, that is; they did not know at the time that they were escapees. Of the 24 individuals on the list circulated by Mr McGinty last week, only 15 were included on the Western Australian list, so it does appear that nine of them were not quite as wanted by the police as Mr McGinty indicated. Had that been the case, the Western Australian police would have passed on the names to Centrelink at the time.

We are not in the business of being property developers, nor should we be, and appropriately we have got out of that business.

However, six of the eight sustained some injuries, mainly lacerations and bruises but one was seriously injured with a broken leg and possible spinal injuries. The aircraft was on a routine military training flight at the time. Next of kin of most of the injured have been advised and others are being advised. The injured have been taken to hospital. Air Force air medical evacuation teams attended the accident together with Queensland Police and the ambulance service. A full accident investigation team has attended, and of course there will be a full investigation. The aircraft was from the School of Army Aviation at Oakey. I am sure all honourable senators join with me in wishing the injured a speedy recovery.

The first point, which I think was raised in several questions, is that this document is 14 months old and, despite a mixture of very sensible recommendations in this report, what can be highlighted is the absence of any action by this government. I thought it might be useful in taking note to go through some of the history, which again makes very stark the lack of action taken by this government on work and family issues. The way I like to characterise it is that the Prime Minister has described work and family as `the big barbecue stopper' but he never puts on the gas. Time and time again, he seeks to delude the electorate that this is an area of critical importance but continues to refuse to act. My suspicion is that once the government finally gets around to acting on thisâprobably in the budget, in the lead-up to an electionâworking families of Australia will be far too cynical to be easily deluded. These working families are the ones that have suffered year after year under the Howard government while it continues to project an image that it always fails to meet.</para><para>Let us have a look at some of the more recent history on this issue. As early as 1995 articles printed by the Australian Institute of Family Studies called for a whole-of-government approach that would also include the states and territories and local government in this area. In fact, some action occurred in September 2002 to a consultation report that recommended to the Commonwealth government that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Larry Anthony, announce that the federal government would begin work on the development of a national agenda for early childhood. Let me reinforce this date: recommended by a government consultative committee prior to September 2002; the government finally announced in 2002 that it would start work on a national agenda; but here we are now in 2004 and we have seen nothing of a strategy or an agenda. </para><para>On 20 February 2003 Mr Anthony released the consultation paper <inline font-style="italic">Towards the development of a national agenda for early childhood</inline> and on 22 October 2003 he released a document called <inline font-style="italic">Towards a national agenda for early childhoodâwhat you told </inline><inline font-style="italic">us</inline>, and that is as far as the government has got. It spent copious pages telling us what a consultation committee told it back in 2002 and now in 2004 it has again simply elaborated what blind Freddy frankly knows is going on in this area. About two paragraphs in this report highlighted the way forward, which indicated that Minister Anthony at this point in time was to finally get around to talking to the states. Given that the Institute of Family Studies and the consultation committee to the minister previously recommended the importance of engaging state and local governments and of getting a nationally agreed agenda happening, this is an outrage. It is an outrage that all of this is reflected in a cabinet-in-confidence document that is 14 months old and still we have no action.</para><para>The only recent action we have had in this area occurred on 5 December, when the government made a bandaid announcement that allowed for no growth in children's services. Without a national approach to the delivery of children's services, this money is going to end up being wasted. The government was told back in 2002 in this IDC report that there was a shortage of 30,000 outside-school-hours care places. Finally, in December 2003, it came up with 10,000 places. The outrage is: what is happening to the other 20,000 young school-age children who need care? They cannot wait for an election budget. This government has allowed an extreme situation to occur such that a pent-up level of demand for children's services is denying our children care. We have the Prime Minister seeking to parade an image that he cares about children. The lack of any action, and the withholding of action until an election budget, is an outrage. He is compromising the children's services sector. Many of the services are waiting until June to know what their future will be. It is an outrage. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>20162</page.no><name role="metadata">Chapman, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator CHAPMAN</name><name.id>FF4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWhat needs to be recognised in relation to this issue is that child care is a very important part of the federal government's vision for families, particularly with regard to balancing family and work commitments. It is important to recognise that the present government has spent and continues to spend more on child care than any federal Labor government has ever done. For 2003-04 to 2006-07âthat is, the next four yearsâthe government has allocated about $8 billion to support child care in Australia, and more than $8 billion has been spent on child care in the last six years in this government's term of office. That amount is more than double in actual dollars what was spent by Labor in their last six years. Yet they come into this chamber and dare to criticise the present government for its approach to childhood services.</para></talk.start><para>Since the introduction of the child-care benefit in July 2000, affordability of child care has improved significantly. Families receive an average child-care benefit payment of more than $2,000 a year. The child-care benefit subsidises about 70 per cent of the total cost of child care for low-income families. Families are paying less out of their pockets for child care than they did before. For example, a family earning $50,000 per year with one child in full-time care would have paid about $380 a year more in June 2000âthat is, in real terms after allowing for inflationâfor fees than an equivalent family today. That represents a significant improvement in the benefit available. Fee data collected annually by the Department of Family and Community Services shows average long day care fees have increased by less than one per cent between 1999 and 2003, going from $192.23 to $194âthat is, in real terms adjusted for inflation, an increase of less than $2 a week. </para><para>Furthermore, record numbers of children have access to Commonwealth funded child-care places. The number of children using child care has increased by 19 per cent from 642,000 to about 763,000 since the child-care benefit was introduced. The largest increase is in the use of outside school hours care, something to which the senator opposite referred. The number of children using these services increased by 44 per cent, from 125,000 to 180,000, since the introduction of the child-care benefit. The number of Commonwealth funded child-care places and services has increased since this government came to office in 1996. The number of child-care places increased by about 211,000, making a total of approximately 518,000 places across all service types. The largest increase was in outside school hours care, which increased by 158,000. In December 2003 the government also announced a further 10,000 outside school hours care places and 2,500 family day care places. When these new places become operational, there will be over 530,000 approved child-care places.</para><para>In terms of the cost to families and the number of child-care places available, there is absolutely no doubt that this government has provided more than any other government with regard to children's services. The government has also implemented quality assurance systems to ensure that services provide quality outcomes for children. It is also important to reinforce the fact that the child-care benefit has significantly improved child-care affordability and that therefore a greater number of families have access to this benefit. There is no cap on the number of long day care centre places that attract the child-care benefit so opposition claims that numbers have fallen are obviously wrong, and that is demonstrated in the figures I referred to a moment or two ago. There were 160,000 long day care places in 1996 and there are now over 211,000 places, and those numbers continue to grow because of the support they receive from this government. <inline font-style="italic">(</inline><inline font-style="italic">Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>20163</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to take note of the answers.

The Government is considering the option of a taxpayer-funded scheme of paid maternity leave as just one of the ways it could respond to the many challenges parents face in balancing work and family life. </para></quote><para>I interpose there to ask: where is the policy proposal on the taxpayer funded scheme of paid maternity leave? What has happened? The Prime Minister talked about the importance of considering this option. We know, of course, that other ministersâI think Minister Abbott was oneâsaid that this would come in `over their dead bodies'. But the Prime Minister held out a promise of a paid maternity leave scheme. We have heard nothing. I quote further from this policy document:</para><quote><para>The Government will also be examining the current range of financial supports for families, childcare arrangements, and how the workplace relations system is delivering family-friendly practices.</para><para>The Government has established an inter-departmental task force chaired by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to review all of the options that might better facilitate choice for parents in balancing their work and family lives.</para></quote><para>A lot of noble words, a lot of promises, about looking at improving the lot of Australian families, particularly when it comes to balancing family and work responsibilities. But what has happened in practice? For a number of years now, ever since this government changed the methods of calculating the family assistance payment, we have seen hundreds of thousands of Australian families placed into debt as a result of the operation of the family payment system. Today, Minister Vanstone said, `It is not a debt; it is an overpayment.' To those families, it is a debt and increasingly they are having to find the money which they have been overpaid to pay back Centrelink.</para><para>A number of situations have been brought to my attention where on a number of occasions families have been advised by Centrelink of changes in their family circumstances. One familyâI will not name themâcontacted me. They had spoken to Centrelink on five or six occasions to tell them that their children were working and that they should no longer be receiving certain family assistance payments. But they kept getting the payments and eventually they received a debt notice for thousands of dollars. They have now had to negotiate with Centrelink about paying it back. I know the staff at Centrelink are very competent people, but the pressures that they have been placed under because of the stupid policies of this government with respect to those systems of payment are certainly the fault of the minister and this government. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>20164</page.no><name role="metadata">Barnett, Sen Guy</name><name role="display">Senator BARNETT</name><name.id>00AUF</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to take note of the answers.

I refer to some of the benefits that have flowed through to Australian families. I am a family man. I have three young children and I love them dearly. I am very thankful to live in this country. I do not take it for granted. It is something that we can be proud of. We have a great nation and the family is the backbone and bedrock of our community. It is something that I will be supporting in my time in the Senate and throughout my political career. Major changes have been introduced in terms of family payments and the workplace relations system. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Let me give you the big picture and look at it in terms of how we support the family. Firstly, with regard to our economic recordâand that means low interest rates and low inflationâwe have had the lowest interest rates and lowest inflation in a generation and that leads to growth in real wages, it leads to employment and it leads to productivity. Those benefits flow through to families. We have an unemployment rate of around 5.6 per cent from which families are benefitingâthe lowest unemployment rate in the last 22-odd years. These facts cannot be denied. In this financial year, the government will allocate an estimated $19 billion in assistance to families. This is a Howard government proud to support to families.</para><para>I now want to touch on a couple of those areas where assistance is provided. You have got just over $11 billion in family tax benefitâan increase of around $2 billion a year compared to the previous family assistance system. You have got the child-care benefit of about $1.6 billion. You have got the parenting payment of $5.9 billion. You have got the maternity allowance and maternity immunisation allowance of $220 million and then, of course, you have got the baby bonus, which provides additional assistance to families following the birth of a child on or after 1 July 2001. Isn't that excellent? Isn't that a great support for growing families and for families who have children? The Prime Minister has also indicated that, as economic circumstances permit, there may be merits in considering additional support for women when children are born. The government has also allocated $220 million to the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy over the next four years. Those are all initiatives which are very important to acknowledge and in saying, `This is what we're doing to support families.'</para><para>The other area of assistance I want to point out is $6 million for research through the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children. I want to commend in particular Larry Anthony, the Hon. Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. Larry Anthony has led the way here. He has been one of the best ministers in this portfolio for a long, long time. He has demonstrated this by action. He has led the way by supporting initiatives to address obesity amongst children and with his recommendation over the summer for after-school care. On that point, I note that the opposition have claimed that we have reduced our funding per place, but in fact there has been a massive increase in outside school hours care. The number of places has increased from 72,000 in 1996 to around 230,000. What Larry Anthony said was: `There's got to be quality assurance. There's got to be quality control. And, in terms of these kids, why don't we put more into helping them have a balanced diet and regular exercise?' These are initiatives that I support and they are great initiatives. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>20166</page.no><name role="metadata">Webber, Sen Ruth</name><name role="display">Senator WEBBER</name><name.id>00AOT</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is all very well for those opposite to talk about the big picture when it comes to payments, particularly payments to families. But no amount of buck passing, no amount of hollow justification, excuses the shameful situation that exists at the very heart of the Centrelink payments problem created by this government. It is simply not good enough. It is not good enough to have prisoners on the run receiving Centrelink payments, as has been revealed recently. The failure of this government to address this problem demonstrates the shallow electoral populism that is at the very core of everything that it does. This government is quite content to ridicule a person on unemployment benefits. It is more than happy to toss the people on disability pensions onto the unemployment scrapheap. It revels in the so-called merits of its Work for the Dole schemeâa scheme that leads to no real long-term employment solutions. But this government is also prepared to sit back and do nothing about escaped prisoners receiving Centrelink payments. </para></talk.start><para>Of course we get the line from the government that this is actually a state problem, that it is up to the states to chase escaped prisoners. I will accept that; that is true. But these escaped felons are in receipt of Centrelink payments gained by fraudulent means, and that is a Commonwealth problem. Put simply, the Commonwealth has the responsibility to ensure that fraud is not committed against the Centrelink payments systemânot the state governments but the Commonwealth government. The states are doing their part by informing Centrelinkâas has been conceded by the governmentâof the identity of these escapees. But is Centrelink doing their bit? Where is the government who will do something to correct this injustice? It is missing in action as usual. This government wants the Australian people to believe that it is someone else's responsibility to ensure that people who are not entitled to Centrelink paymentsâthat is, escaped criminalsâdo not receive them. This situation is high farce.</para><para>The Australian people, fortunately, are not that susceptible to being misled by this government. The Australian people understand that Centrelink uses Commonwealth moneyâprovided for by Commonwealth legislationâto support other members in our community. The Australian people also understand that escaped felons are not in fact entitled to Centrelink payments. Whose responsibility is it then? Who is charged with the responsibility to ensure the integrity of the Centrelink system? Who is charged to ensure that the Centrelink system is adequately resourced? The Australian people understand that it is actually the Commonwealth government's responsibility.</para><para>But what do we get from this government? We get platitudes, we get `let's talk about the big picture', we get excuses and we get `blame another administration'. This government, and this government alone, cannot on the one hand run around telling Australians how wonderful its economic management is when on the other hand it cannot even get simple payments right. The headline grabbers that are part of this government, which is willing to put the boot into welfare recipients whenever it pleases, are now prepared to sit there and pretend that they are not responsible for the fact that criminals are receiving money that they are not entitled to. Those on the other side are quite happy in fact to prosecute to the fullest extent anyone else except, if we can believe itâand we have to, because the government has confirmed itâfugitives from justice. All that money that has been spent over the years on improving Centrelink systems, all that money spent on data matching with other agencies, all those extra resources poured into the Centrelink payment system, all that boasting in the press from those opposite, and yet they allow this fundamental abuse, this corruption of the system, even when the states provide the government with the information that is necessary to fix the problem. </para><para>It is simply not good enough. It is time for the minister and for this government to fix this fundamental problem, rather than blame everybody else in the entire system. It is not good enough to come in here and sayâin my caseâthat it is the Western Australian government's fault, when the government has confirmed that the minister in my state has given it the information it needs, but there are still people receiving Centrelink payments that they are not eligible forâ (<inline font-style="italic">Time expired</inline>)</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>20167</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank colleagues for allowing me to take the sixth spot today, as no-one else from the minor parties is here. In speaking on the motion moved by Senator Collins I would like to address some of the issues raised by Senator Minchin and Senator Amanda Vanstone in response to questions by the opposition today. Work and family policy is shaping up to be a big issue in this election campaign. Arguably it is the single largest domestic policy issue that the major political parties have failed to deal with adequately over the past few election periods, and certainly when in government. Today we heard claims by Senators Minchin and Vanstone that this government had done things to assist Australians with the work and family balance, but one outstanding issue remains. There are many things that this government could do, but Australia lags behind the rest of the world in that we are still one of only two OECD nations that fail to provide working women with a paid maternity leave scheme. </para></talk.start><para>I was very encouraged to hear questions from the opposition today in relation to maternity leave, and I hope that we will hear some specific policy announcements from Mr Latham shortly. But, as it stands, there is only one piece of legislation on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> that relates to the implementation of a national paid maternity leave scheme for Australian working women, providing 14 weeks paid leave at the minimum wage. Today we heard reports about the cabinet-in-confidence document. We heard about the Sex Discrimination Commissioner's proposals. Indeed, I am very pleased to see that the proposals that emanated from that inquiry, held by Pru Goward, ended up endorsingâemulatingâthe same model that the Australian Democrats put to the parliament in the form of a private member's bill. </para><para>Contrary to what was said by the ministers today, it is possible to provide a paid maternity leave scheme in Australia for less than the cost of the baby bonus. The government's regressive baby bonus we know now is not working; it is an abject failure. It favours wealthy women, wealthy households, and it rewards women who take more time out of the work force. All the messages and all the principles there are wrong. We should be implementing a scheme that prevents discrimination against women and that allows bosses, allows workplaces, to retain some of their most productive employeesâmore and more of whom are women. We should meet international standards. We should provide for that biological imperative that women should stay at home and spend some time with their child. They should have the option of spending a minimum of 14 weeks with their child on the birth of that child. That is what we should be doing. </para><para>A scheme costed by the Australian Democrats was for $352 million. The Sex Discrimination Commissioner has done some costings, which include retaining family and other payments that are currently provided. Under the scheme, which would essentially be universal, it can be done for $213 million per annum. How does that compare to what is already on offer, the ad hoc scheme for the baby bonus that this government came up withâI think the Prime Minister himself came up with itâin the 2001 campaign? It is estimated that in its third year of operations you would be looking at about $500 million per annum and still rewarding wealthier women and not women in those lower- to middle-income socioeconomic groups who need the money.  </para><para>Two-thirds of Australia's working women cannot access any form of paid maternity leave. I know there is unpaid leave on the books, and that is goodâwomen fought very hard to get thatâbut two-thirds of Australia's working women cannot get it. So you have women going back to work a week after caesareans, you have women losing their jobs, you have women being discriminated against and you have families putting off having a second child because they cannot effectively balance work and family commitments and, in particular, the need for a second income. </para><para>We have had enough rhetoric, enough talk. We have looked at the bill in committee. So let us vote on it, or at least let us see in this budget some action from this government that has failed women. Successive governments have done it. Other parliaments around the world have legislated for paid maternity leave. For goodness sake, let us do it. In 2004 it is ridiculous that Australia is one of those two OECD countriesâthe US being the otherâthat does not acknowledge all of the key issues in relation to maternity and the special role, that important and valuable role that we all talk about, that is motherhood. Let us reward it. Let us adequately look after it and let us ensure that the burden does not fall to small business alone but is shared by government and business.

The purpose of making a statement today is to make it ahead of estimates committee hearings next week. The government has been and continues to be committed to transparency in government advertising and public information projects and has worked to provide the Senate with comprehensive information through mechanisms such as the Senate order on departmental and agency contracts, commonly called the Murray motion, through agency and departmental annual reporting arrangements and through the gazettal of contracts on the Internet. </para></talk.start><para>The scrutiny of government by the Senate through questions on notice and Senate estimates hearings are also important ways in which details of particular and topical issues are made public, and the government continues to support these approaches as important methods of accountability to the parliament, particularly where the public interest is served. These mechanisms allow detailed information about the cost of government advertising campaigns to be made publicly available. Government support for these mechanisms has seen a high level of compliance and progressive improvement in the information reported.</para><para>The order also seeks an opinion as to whether campaigns comply with guidelines to government advertising recommended by the JCPAA in its report No. 377 of 4 October 2000. Those guidelines were the subject of dissent within the committee on the grounds that they would require inter alia that officials would have to make assessments as to whether or not advertising material was liable to misrepresentation as party political. The government has not adopted these guidelines and continues to observe the `Guidelines for Australian Government Information Activities' that were adopted by the previous government in February 1995. The government continues to support a broad approach which allows detailed scrutiny and accountability but avoids duplication and unnecessary complexity and cost. Therefore our position is that the existing levels of scrutiny should continue and will be underpinned by the former government's 1995 guidelines in relation to implementing government communication activities.

The Government does not consider that any amendment to clauses 21 and 22 of the International Criminal Court Bill 2002 (now sections 20 and 21 of the International Criminal Court Act 2002) is warranted.</para><para>2)	The privileges and immunities of officials of international organisations are dealt with in regulations under the International Organisations (Privileges and Immunities) Act 1963. Now that Australia has ratified the Statute and the Acts have been passed, the Government will make regulations to provide privileges and immunities to the officials identified in Article 48 of the Statute. The Assembly of States Parties has adopted the Agreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the Court, which extends privileges and immunities to a wider range of officials than Article 48. The Government is currently considering becoming a Party to the Agreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the Court.</para><para>3)	The definition of âtortureâ as a war crime in the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Act 2002 is drawn strictly from the definition of the war crimes of torture in the Elements of Crimes paper. The Government therefore does not agree that this definition broadens the ambit of these crimes beyond the Statute.</para><para>4)	In developing the crimes contained in the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Act 2002, the Government has drafted the provisions to mirror the definitions of crimes in the Statute and the Elements of Crimes paper to take full advantage of the principle of complementarity. Accordingly, the Act criminalises the conscription of children under the age of 15. This is consistent with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which obliges Australia to take all feasible measures to ensure that children under the age of 15 do not take a direct part in hostilities.</para><para>The Government is aware that the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict prohibits the conscription of children under the age of 18 years. Australia signed the Protocol on 21 October 2002 and is currently considering ratification. The definitions of crimes in the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Act 2002, for the purposes of complying with Australia's obligations under the Statute and the principle of complementarity, do not represent a Government position on a minimum age for the conscription or use of children in armed conflict, or on ratification of the Optional Protocol.</para><para>The Defence Instruction promulgating the Australian Defence Force's compliance with the terms of the Protocol was jointly signed by the Chief of the Defence Force and the Secretary of Defence on 28 June 2002. The Government will bring the matter of Australian ratification of the Protocol before the JSCOT.</para><para>5)	If a person is arrested in Australia and charged with an offence under Division 268 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code, then that person will be subject to the same laws governing the holding of that person on remand as any other person who has been arrested and charged with a serious Commonwealth criminal offence.</para><para>If a person is arrested in Australia at the request of the ICC so that the person can be surrendered to the ICC and charged with an ICC crime, then the holding of that person on remand is governed by Division 3 of Part 3 of the International Criminal Court Act 2002. If a person is arrested pursuant to a request from the ICC for provisional arrest, then a magistrate must release that person after 60 days unless a request for surrender has been received or the magistrate is satisfied that a request for surrender will be received within a specified period (section 26). A person who is arrested has the right to apply for bail (which may be granted in special circumstances) (section 23). The Attorney-General also retains a general discretion to order that a person be released from custody (section 25). The Government considers that these provisions properly balance Australia's obligations under the Statute with the need to ensure that persons do not spend unduly long periods on remand. </para><para>6)	Where a person is charged in Australia with a crime in Division 268 of the Criminal Code (which was inserted by the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Act 2002), then that person will have the same rights to legal aid as any other person charged with a Commonwealth criminal offence.</para><para>Section 185 of the International Criminal Court Act 2002 allows a person who is involved in proceedings before a magistrate regarding detention under that Bill to apply to the Attorney-General for legal assistance.</para><para>Article 67 of the Statute sets out the rights of an accused person in a trial before the ICC. These rights include, in paragraph (1)(d), the right to legal assistance including the right âto have legal assistance assigned by the Court in any case where the interests of justice so require, and without payment if the accused lacks sufficient means to pay for itâ.</para><para>7)	The Government amended the International Criminal Court Bill 2002 to ensure that the provisions on the tracing, freezing and forfeiture of proceeds of crimes were, to the extent applicable, consistent with current Commonwealth policy as set out in the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and the Proceeds of Crime (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Act 2002. These amendments are now reflected in the International Criminal Court Act 2002.</para><para>The new provisions replaced Division 14 of Part 4 and Part 11 of the Exposure Draft of the International Criminal Court Bill. Because of the revised structure, there is no longer any requirement for amendment to the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 (the International Criminal Court Act 2002 contains all necessary provisions) and Schedule 6 of the Exposure Draft of the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Bill was deleted.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>20173</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para></motion><para>The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties report on the International Criminal Court was tabled in parliament on 14 May 2002, nearly two years ago. Since that time, I have left the treaties committee and gone on to different committeesâit has been that long. In that time great progress has been made in establishing the ICC. Its judges and prosecutors have been elected and the necessary structures and procedures of the court are being laid down. In the first year after the ICC statute came into effect the court received nearly 500 communications from non-government organisations and individuals in 66 countries. The Chief Prosecutor of the court, Mr Luis Moreno-Ocampo, has indicated that he is monitoring closely the situation in the Ituri region of the Democratic Republic of Congo, about which he has received several communications from non-government organisations and individuals. These reports tell of massive human rights abuses against civilians, including arbitrary executions, rape, child sexual abuse, sexual slavery, torture and mutilation. The prosecutor stands ready to seek the authorisation of the pre-trial chamber to commence an investigation. A key factor in any decision will naturally be the ability and willingness of the new national government to bring the perpetrators to justice and prevent further abuses. </para><para>More recently, the ICC received a reference from Uganda about activities of the Lords Resistance Army in the north of that countryâthe court's first communication from a state party in fact. According to reports received by the prosecutor, and it is worth quoting what he said:</para><quote><para>... the situation has resulted in a pattern of serious human rights abuses against civilians in the region, including summary executions, torture and mutilation, recruitment of child soldiers, child sexual abuse, rape, forcible displacement, and looting and destruction of civilian property.</para></quote><para>The prosecutor is now gathering the information needed to determine whether to seek authorisation to conduct an investigation into the Ugandan situation. These two examples illustrate not only the potential of the court in bringing to an end violence and restoring peace but also the strong information gathering and decision-making processes in place to enable the court to determine when it is appropriate to act. So it can be seen that considerable work has been done in the international arena to make the International Criminal Court a reality.</para><para>By contrast, the actions of the Australian government in that time have been disappointing. Despite its longstanding leadership role in the international campaign for the establishment of the court, Australia is not represented among the judges or prosecutors of the ICC nor is it likely for some years to gain any of those positions. Australia is represented on the court's committee on budget and finance, and it is good to see this contribution of Australian expertise, but it must be said that that falls far short of the Howard government's stated goals of securing the election of a judge or prosecutor. Similarly, it has been disappointing to observe the Howard government's unquestioning willingness to negotiate an immunity agreement with the United States that would prevent the surrender of American nationals to the court. It is difficult to see how it is in Australia's national interest to undermine the multilateral framework of the court in this way. Our alliance with the United States does not require it. Indeed, for some time the United States was a signatory to the ICC statute. No explanation has been forthcoming from the Prime Minister, the foreign affairs minister or the Attorney-General for the government's decision in this regard. It seems that, in the case of the International Criminal Courtâas in so many other areasâan independent Australian foreign policy is nowhere to be seen. It is also surprising that it has taken the government nearly two years to come up with a response to the report of the joint committee on the ICC statute. This is particularly so as the government substantially accepted and implemented the recommendations of the committee when it amended the International Criminal Court bills almost two years ago.</para><para>I now turn briefly to the issue of the proposed immunity agreement with the United States. It is interesting to note that the government acknowledged in its response to committee recommendation 8 that article 98 was inserted into the Rome statute to enable states to continue to fulfil their existing obligations under international lawâfor example, those relating to diplomatic privileges and immunities. This is consistent with the view of article 98 expressed by, amongst others, the Law Institute of Victoria. No doubt a debate will be had when any article 98 in fact surfaces. There is a strong body of expert legal opinion that article 98 was intended to enable states to continue to uphold their existing obligations, and it is interesting to note that the government's response is consistent with that view. A further concern raised by the government's response is the apparent lack of commitment by Australia to the international agreement on the privileges and immunities of the court. This agreement was opened for signature back on 10 September 2002 and will remain open for signature until 30 June this year. It has been signed by 44 countries but not by Australia. At the second assembly of state parties in September last year, the president of the court said: </para><quote><para>I call as well on the cooperation of States Parties regarding the Agreement on Privileges and Immunities ... </para></quote><para>And it goes on:</para><quote><para>... essential to the proper functioning and integrity of the Court. Without privileges and immunities, the personnel of the Court will have great difficulty acting outside the Host State. I therefore ask all States Parties to support the work of individuals and personnel of the ICC through the signature and ratification of the Agreement.</para></quote><para>The document tabled today states that the government is still considering whether to become a party to that agreement. It is very disappointing that, having once been a leader of the International Criminal Court, Australia now seems to have become a follower. Are we to see a repetition of the farce which surrounded Australia's ratification of the Rome statute itself when, thanks to infighting in the coalition, our instrument of ratification was deposited on the last possible day? Once again we seem to be limping over the line at the back of the pack. In conclusion, while we welcome the tabling of this response, we are surprised at the time it has taken to arrive and record our concern at the government's continuing retreat from Australia's traditional position of leadership on the International Criminal Court.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>20175</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Auditor-General's Reports</title><page.no>20175</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report No. 28 of 2003-04</title><page.no>20175</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âIn accordance with the provisions of the Auditor-General Act 1997, I present the following report of the Auditor-General: Report No. 28 of 2003-04â<inline font-style="italic">Audit Activity Report: July to December 2003.</inline></para></talk.start></interjection></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUDGET</title><type>Budget</type><page.no>20175</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Portfolio Additional Estimates Statements</title><page.no>20175</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>20175</page.no><name role="metadata">Vanstone, Sen Amanda</name><name role="display">Senator VANSTONE</name><name.id>7E4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Reconciliation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI table four portfolio additional estimates statements for 2003-04.

The committee adopted an inquiry under standing order 25(2)(b) so it could explore these concerns. </para><para>The committee invited comment from a number of key individuals and organisations, and sought submissions by advertising in the national press. Four public hearings were held by the committee, and it heard evidence from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry; WoolProducers; AWI's founding managing director, Mr Col Dorber; and former AWI board members. Key concerns addressed in the report include the appointment by the chair of Australian Wool Services of the founding managing director of AWI; the delays in finalising the inaugural strategic and operating plans; the direction of the AWI and its management highlighted in project management and accountability controls; and the department's oversight of the newly created AWI.</para><para>In response to these issues raised in evidence, the committee has made a number of recommendations. Perhaps the most significant of these is the question of whether AWI used company money to campaign for sitting directors during the 2002 board election, in breach of Corporations Law. This should be referred to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. Concern was also expressed during the inquiry that certain AWI operations and projects were not within the terms of the statutory funding agreement. The committee recommended that compliance with statutory funding agreements be pursued by the department. The committee's examination of the issues also resulted in a recommendation that the statutory funding agreement be amended to clarify the definition of `agripolitical activity'. Finally, the committee examined how AWI and the department have responded to these issues, leading to a recommendation that before a new statutory funding agreement is agreed the minister should review the effectiveness of the remedies for breaches of the agreement that are currently available through the Wool Services Privatisation Act 2000.</para><para>In conclusion, the committee's inquiry did reveal matters of grave corporate governance that disturbed it. It hopes its recommendations, if implemented, will contribute to an environment where such matters will not occur or, if they do, they can be readily identified, rectified and addressed. I would also like to place on the record my appreciation of the contributions made by my colleagues on the committee and the work of the secretariat, in particular Mr Geoff Dawson. I have to say that getting this report to the chamber, given what has happened with our computers in the last couple of days, has been a bit of a nightmare for everyone at the secretariat. I especially thank Mr Geoff Dawson for his contribution.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>20176</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThis inquiry was about the administration and operation of the statutory funding agreement between the Commonwealth and AWI and the expenditure and application of funds under that agreement. It was not supposed to be an exercise in denigrating former or current employees or directors of AWI. While I am happy to sign up to the recommendations in the committee report touching on the public administration issues raised by AWI's brief history and the recommendations referring the evidence to relevant authorities for investigation, I am not happy to sign up to the sweeping conclusions that reflect adversely on the performance of individuals based on incomplete evidence.</para></talk.start><para>For that reason, I have declined to support the conclusions made by the committee in chapter 4âparticularly paragraphs 4.45, 4.57 to 4.59, 4.79 to 4.83, and 4.154 to 4.158. The conclusions reached by the committee may or may not be correct, but I do not believe that the committee has taken sufficient evidence to draw such broad conclusions on the performance of AWI or its directors. To make findings based on incomplete evidence affects the credibility of the committee's report, leaving its report unbalanced and the committee vulnerable to assertions of being a kangaroo court. Natural justice and due process should dictate that the committee should either complete its investigations or make no adverse findings. Having said that, I believe that it is not in the public interest or the interests of AWI or wool growers to have the allegations and counterclaims left unresolved. In my report, I make a recommendation that a proper, genuine, independent review should be conducted into the various claims made to this committee, with full access to AWI records and current and former AWI directors and staff. </para><para>This inquiry has become the latest forum in the long fight between the two `camps' in the wool industry. On one side have been the WoolProducers organisation and the new board of AWI; on the other side have been the `rebel' wool growers in the Australian Wool Growers AssociationâAWGAâand the old board of AWI. The events referred to in this report cover the period leading up to and following the hotly contested board elections of 2002, which resulted in wool grower-shareholders splitting roughly evenly between the two camps.</para><para>AWI was established as a separate subsidiary on 1 January 2001, with a formal demerger effected on 30 April 2002. As 2002 progressed, relations between AWI and WoolProducers, clearly deteriorated. The board found itself criticised in the rural media, with one former director referring to the `extraordinary, untrue and vindictive comments from a minority of shareholders and the rural press'. Representative organisations and individuals spent $45,000 to support the WoolProducers preferred candidates for the AWI board elections held in late 2002, particularly in gathering the names of the five per cent of shareholders necessary for nomination. As the election approached, the campaign by WoolProducers against AWI's board continued. WoolProducers President, Simon Campbell, was quoted in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review </inline>as saying:</para><quote><para>We believe there has been a consistent failure on the part of the current executive team to observe standards of transparency and accountability that is required of a body that is charged with spending the tax on wool producers.</para></quote><para>The board sought to respond to these continuing attacks; but, in doing so, it appears to have crossed the line of using company funds to support its own re-election as opposed to defending the company's good name.</para><para>Other wool grower organisations, including the Australian Wool Growers Association and the Australian Association of Stud Merino Breeders, remained strongly supportive of the board's direction. In the end, wool growers split down the middle in supporting and opposing the old board of AWI. At the 2002 AGM, six former directors attracted slightly higher support among growers than the WoolProducers team, averaging 3,460 votes per directorâ51 per centâcompared to 3,324 votes for the five challengersâ49 per cent. However, when the formal poll was counted with votes weighted for wool tax paymentsâthat is, with larger producers receiving more weightâsupport for the former board fell to an average of 220,597 votes, falling further to 214,872 if the director backed by both sides was deleted. Support for the new board members averaged 247,932 votes.</para><para>I have been very critical of the weighting of votes in agri-political organisations, which are based effectively on the size of farm. Given such polls concern the collection and spending of compulsorily collected funds, it is the Democrats firm view that one vote-one value principles should apply to elections of agricultural bodies, including Dairy Australia and Meat and Livestock Australia. </para><para>The assertions of corporate governance failings have not ended with the election of the new board in 2002. Indeed, several submissions to this inquiry have made various assertions against the current board's management as well, covering expenditure decisions such as support for the Wool CRC, the protection of intellectual property, and the 5 June 2003 letter to shareholders. These matters should also be investigated by the independent person I referred to earlier.</para><para>The Democrats firmly believe that public bodies should adhere to the highest standards of corporate governance and public administration. As the main committee report highlights, the `hybrid' public-private model used for AWI, and which was earlier used for Meat and Livestock Australia, raises some concerns in a public administration and accountability sense. Many of these issues were canvassed in AFFA's June 2002 report on corporate governance of portfolio bodies and are considered in detail in chapter 7 of the committee's report.</para><para>The Democrats believe that AFFA should have acted more energetically and earlier in establishing clear lines of accountability, reporting and consultation. The recommendations in this report will help clarify the proper relationship between the Commonwealth and `hybrid' producer bodies and ensure that proper accountability for compulsorily collected levy funds to the Commonwealth parliament is more apparent in the future.</para><para>I commend the recommendations to the Senate and urge the government to adopt them in full in redrafting of the statutory funding agreements with AWI and other hybrid bodies. Like the chair of the committee, I commend the work of the secretariat that produced this report in a very difficult period.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>20178</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI too commend the work of the secretariat in the compilation of the report titled <inline font-style="italic">Australian Wool Innovation Limited: Application and expenditure of funds advanced under Statutory Funding Agreement dated 31 </inline><inline font-style="italic">December 2000</inline>. It was a difficult task for the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, but I am certain that it was doubly difficult for the secretariat. I endorse the remarks of Senator Heffernan in that regard. </para></talk.start><para>By any measure, this is a damning report. It identifies an episode of mismanagement by an important rural industry services body established by this government. All the recommendations of this report, as I understand it, were unanimously endorsed. It also identifies yet another episode where the current Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Truss, has failed to protect the interests of farmers in a key rural sector. It is clear from much of the mismanagement and abuse of the authority within AWI that it need not have occurred. </para><para>The inquiry clearly established that Mr Truss was given a clear warning of major problems brewing within the company, but he failed to act. We do not know whether that failure is attributable to incompetence or negligence on the part of the minister, but it is almost certainly one or the other. This inquiry also established the minister's failure to ensure that his department had the resources required to properly oversee this private industry service body. It is important to recognise that AWI and similar bodies enjoy substantial income from compulsory industry levies and consolidated revenue in the form of matching R&amp;D payments. </para><para>This inquiry has exposed problems with the formal relationship between these private companies and the government. In relation to AWI at least, the inquiry revealed that the inadequate obligations imposed by the government through a statutory funding agreement and inadequate government oversight exposed levy payers and taxpayers to unnecessary risk. This inquiry would not have been necessary if Mr Truss had done his job.  </para><para>On 4 February 2002, the industry organisation WoolProducers wrote to the minister raising concerns about a number of AWI activities. They raised six areas of concern, the first four of which related to particular matters and the last two related to general management of the company. I will comment on the last two matters raised in that correspondence. The first general matter concerns performance measurement and the transparency of the company's operations. WoolProducers said in part:</para><quote><para>It is critical that transparent and readily available information is provided to levy payers before the next wool poll.</para></quote><para>And further they stated:</para><quote><para>[T]he performance measures that AWI has released in public are contradictory, confused and inconsistent.</para></quote><para>The government imposes a compulsory levy on wool growers and hands levy funds to AWI. It is a tax in all but name. The government has a clear responsibility to ensure that levy revenue is expended in a manner consistent with the interests of growersâno ifs, no buts. Growers told Mr Truss that they could not find out how their levy money was being spent, and he failed to act on those concerns. That was a clear breach of his responsibilities as minister.</para><para>The second general matter raised by WoolProducers in their letter went to the administration of the company. WoolProducers told Mr Truss:</para><quote><para>Woolproducers are concerned that appropriate accountability and a system of internal controls have not been put in place by the Board of AWI.</para></quote><para>They also said:</para><quote><para>[T]here is great concern among members that substantial funds are able to be expended by the CEO without full knowledge of the Board.</para></quote><para>The statutory funding agreement between this company and the government demands appropriate accountability and internal controls. The minister was handing this company $55 million collected from wool growers and $16 million collected from Australian taxpayers. He was told that there were inadequate accountability and control systems in place and he did not act. This was not an internal problem for the company, as the department suggested to the committee. This was clearly a problem for levy payers and, importantly, it was a problem for taxpayers as well. It was a direct and immediate problem for the minister.</para><para>I want to go to the view of the committee on this matter. The committee is of the view that both these matters require the minister's urgent attention. It is important to make the point that this is not a view held by just Labor; it is a view held by the whole committee. The committee finds in part:</para><quote><para>Any concern that there was no effective accountability through the board to both the minister and levy payers and that there was no system of internal controls in place should have been quickly and fully investigated.</para></quote><para>This represents a serious lapse on the part of Mr Truss. It echoes many other lapses for which this most incompetent minister is responsible: his failure to properly manage the US beef quota and the commercial damage suffered by many exporters that resulted; his failure to ensure that the single desk for wheat was properly monitored by the Wheat Export Authority, even after he had been told it did not have the capacity to do its job; and his gross mishandling of the <inline font-style="italic">Cormo Express </inline>fiasco, which resulted in mass animal mortality, terrible financial cost for sheep producers and a massive loss of public confidence in the live export sectorâall of this after he had been told years before by his own expert group to clean up the industry. </para><para>It is worth noting that these disasters were created by Mr Truss but fixed by others. It has been the Prime Minister's office, Senator Heffernan, Senator Ferris and this committee that have sorted out these problemsânot the minister. Senator Heffernan and Senator Ferris should take a cut from Mr Truss's pay packet. I can see Senator Heffernan smiling, but certainly they have earned it. As for Labor, we will be content when the member for Corio, Mr Gavan O'Connor, is in the minister's chair before the year is out.</para><para>I want to go to some of the recommendations arising from this inquiry. The committee is of the view that the question of whether the former AWI management and board breached the Corporations Act by funding a campaign for sitting directors should be referred to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. The committee formed the view that the expenditure of this money was improper. In forming this opinion we relied in part on the advice from the Australian Government Solicitor that it was probably a breach of the Corporations Act. Mr Truss must pursue this matter. The committee also recommended that Mr Truss should consider referring to ASIC other potential breaches of the Corporations Act by AWI. We noted that the minister's department has obtained advice from the Australian Government Solicitor on possible breaches of the statutory funding agreement or the Corporations Act. These are important recommendations with potentially serious consequences, and the minister should act upon them urgently.</para><para>This inquiry has highlighted a number of problems in the government's preferred industry service model. The committee is of the view that all expenditure by these private companies should be spent in accordance with the terms of their statutory funding agreements. That is a view Labor hold very strongly. We think that the minister should direct his department to pursue compliance and other reports pursuant to all statutory funding agreements. We are also recommending that Mr Truss review the remedies available to him if there are breaches of statutory funding agreements. The committee recommends that all statutory funding agreements should include a requirement mandating that expenditure is consistent with the strategic plan, the operational plan and the research and development guidelines. In Labor's view there is a need to revisit all statutory funding agreements, with the view to incorporating these changes.</para><para>Some of these recommendations sound a lot like instructions to the minister to do his job, and that is precisely what I think they are meant to be. Most of the problems that have been exposed by this inquiry may well not have happened if Mr Truss had done his job. If he had responded to the issues raised by wool producers at the beginning of 2002, the flaws and mismanagement exposed by this committee would not have occurred. On this one, the buck well and truly does stop with the minister.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>20180</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Sandy</name><name role="display">Senator SANDY MACDONALD</name><name.id>CX5</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>NATS</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAustralian Wool Innovation Ltd, AWI, is the wool industry owned R&amp;D company and was formed out of the R&amp;D components of the previous Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation. Its formation came flavoured with all the problems that the wool industry had faced in the 1990s, with the wool stockpile and low prices. The industry was completely demoralised by the time the stockpile had been sold, and among the many reforms was the privatisation of the commercial aspects of the common owned property, like Woolmark. This became part of Australian Wool Services. The R&amp;D element became Australian Wool Innovation. The initial AWI board and its appointed management was responsible for the period of time that this Senate inquiry has investigated. </para></talk.start><para>The report gives a very solemn picture of the operation of the McCaskill board, which was dominated by Mr Col Dorber, the CEO. The October 2002 annual general meeting confirmed that the shareholders of AWI were not happy with the existing situation. They were concerned with corporate governance, how the compulsory industry contributions were being spent and how the federal government's R&amp;D contribution provided under the MOU was also being spent. It is on the basis of these apparent irregularities that the Senate inquiry was set up. The new board elected in 2002, headed by Ian McLachlan, has systematically addressed the problems of corporate governance. The evidence of prior incompetence was not a pretty sight, and I do not think that there is any good point in bringing those irregularities to public attention again, as they have been well addressed and are well known through the rural media's coverage of the Senate inquiry. They are identified in the Senate report.</para><para>The priority now is to build the best foundations for Australia's great primary industry, the wool industry. There are 60,000 growers out there. They are spread right across the sheep and wheat belts of Australia. It is a primary industry that probably has the greatest influence on regional Australia. Why? Historically, farmers have found that if the wool industry is strong it takes pressure off the grain market and it takes pressure off the beef market. It tends to be the industry that spreads its tentacles the broadest right throughout regional areas. Of course many of the small towns that rely substantially or partly on wheat to keep them economically viable very often were towns that started because of the spreading wool industry.</para><para>It is now time to look to the future because this is still an important industry; it is a very large export earner. And the McLachlan board is looking to the future. It has appointed a new CEO and new management and it has conducted the 2003 Wool Poll to determine the wool grower contribution. As you may be aware, Australian wool growers pay a research and development levy which is two per cent of the sale price received for shorn greasy wool. In 2002-03 wool growers invested just over $62 million in wool research and development. The federal government matches wool grower investment in R&amp;D projects capped at 0.05 of the industry's gross value of production. In 2002-03 the federal government contributed $16 million to AWI's activities.</para><para>Australian Wool Innovation is a company that has a budget of around $80 million a year. It is a very important company. It is owned and controlled by growers; they pay a compulsory levy for it. It has done some fantastically interesting work over the years. The priorities that have been set by Ian McLachlan, his board and his new managing director indicate that there is a lot of enthusiasm for the task ahead. I commend the new board and the new management. I make the final point that as of 30 June last year approximately 200 projects were active, ranging from small feasibility studies to major projects. The R&amp;D portfolio is well balanced, with an equal split of expenditure between on-farm and textile research. All projects have been chosen on the basis of their ability to provide a return on investment to wool growers and the industry, and that is the real key to it. There is a lot of money involved in these projects and they are selected on the basis of their ability to provide a return on investment to wool growers and the industry. It is an important industry. It is very important to Australia, to the people who work in it and to communities in regional Australia. This Senate inquiry revolves around a rather sorry time in the history of the AWI and the finalisation of a particularly bad period for the industry in terms of their prices and returns. But we are talking about the future and enthusiasm for the future, and we are going to get that enthusiasm from suggestions that come out of the Senate inquiry. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUDGET</title><type>Budget</type><page.no>20182</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration by Legislation Committees</title><page.no>20182</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Additional Information</title><page.no>20182</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>20182</page.no><name role="metadata">Heffernan, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator HEFFERNAN</name><name.id>C16</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn behalf of the chairs of the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation committee and the Environment, Communication, Information Technology and Arts Legislation Committee, I present additional information received by the committees relating to the supplementary hearings on the budget estimates 2003-04.</para></talk.start></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>20182</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission</title><page.no>20182</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>20182</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para></motion><para>I wish to take note of a statement to parliament, pursuant to section 43 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act, lodged by Senator Vanstone and tabled by the Clerk. Senator Vanstone's office was good enough to allow me to become aware of the contents of the statement prior to tabling and I thank her and her office for that courtesy. I must say that having read the statement I wonder why it was not available to be tabled on Monday. The consequence of tabling that now is that this matter will continue effectively until near enough the end of Marchâa matter which is quite destabilising for the ATSIC board, the board that administers Indigenous matters on a national basis for Indigenous Australians. I query the reason for its delay until so late in the week, the effect of which will further delay the consideration of this matter and the procedure which has to be followed in relation to the suspension before this parliament.</para><para>One thing that must be noted from the statement is that Minister Vanstone conceded in the statement that the first suspensionâthat is the suspension of Mr Clark put in place by Minister Ruddock on 13 Augustâwas no longer appropriate. That is probably because the appeal process which had followed the original Clark conviction had rendered that suspension inappropriate and probably invalidâbut I guess that is a matter for the courts to determine. Mr Clark has been suspended since 13 August. The implication of the continuation of the suspension is that ATSIC will continue to be denied certainty in its leadership until at least the end of March. If Mr Clark's appeal succeeds, the implication of the minister's grounds for the new suspension are that she will continue the suspension nevertheless. That is, there are three alternative grounds for the suspension, only one of which is the actual conviction. So, if Mr Clark's conviction is overturned, in the minister's terms his conduct in obstructing police and/or his commission of the offence of obstructing police may well be relied upon to continue the suspension.</para><para>In the circumstances, I invite the minister to clarify her intention because she has advised Mr Clark that she would not act to proceed to termination pending his appeal process, yet the suspension document has the actual conviction as only one of three grounds for the suspension. I am concerned that the minister appears to pretend, in those circumstances, to be concerned about the outcome of the appeal. I would ask the minister to clarify that matter. Will, for example, she commit to the revocation of the suspension if Mr Clark's conviction is overturned or if the already moderate penalty for the offence is further moderated on appeal? </para><para>The only other thing I would propose to say at this time is that, if the minister is not prepared to give that assurance, she ought to commit to proceeding to the next stepâthat is, to proceed to dismiss Mr Clarke from office immediately the requirements of section 40(3) of the act have been met. If there is no intention to lift the suspensionâor even if the conviction is overturned and she intends to rely on other grounds to continue the suspensionâthat would be extraordinary because, if those grounds disappear, I would have to say the grounds for the minister's action appear to be very fragile. Indigenous Australia deserves to have this matter resolved quickly to allow its national body to get on with the job under its legislation, with restored certainty about its leadership.

I was at least able to get 12 pages of informationâit is a little bit more detailedâso I was able to look at the claims and counterclaims that made up this deal. What always worried Labor about this deal was that it was going to be rushed. As those who have been involvedâand I am not someone who has been involved in a lot of trade dealsâadvised me, most trade deals take up to two years on average. They usually involve about 12 rounds of negotiations.</para></talk.start></continue><para>When you have a situation like we had here, where the deal was rammed through in just on 12 months with only six rounds of negotiations, you have to start to worry that a few corners have been cut, a few bushels have been dumped and that a few avocados are going to rot on the vine because they are not going to be able to get into the US, except when they tell us we can send them. So you have got to worry about something that has been rushed through in this period. What we discovered upon reading even the pathetic attempt at spin by Minister Vaile is that he has not delivered a free trade agreement. He has not actually delivered free trade, particularly for those constituentsâand I know you care about these, Senator Macdonald, and occasionally you do, Senator Heffernanâin the farm community, the agricultural community and their products.

You have got to admire his hide; you have got to admire these cockies and their hide. Really! So where have we got to? We have got back to the $4 billion. Why did the government walk away from the $4 billion? Why are they now not trying to pretend there is a $4 billion benefit in this deal? Is it because Senator Boswell has gone in there, knocked them over and said, `Just a minuteâwe can get a better deal.' No, it certainly is not that. It is because the man who authored the study that produced the `up to $4 billion' figure has actually gone public and said, `Well, actually I modelled it on 100 per cent free trade.' That would be 25 per cent more free trade than you have delivered in this deal. Then you look at some of his other assumptions in the financial services sector, which has had minimal protection previously and little change under this deal, and you find that even he has said there is a whole series of unders and overs that you have to look at and recalculate to get any sensible number on that US agreement. We really should get away from that $4 billion estimate: the author of the $4 billion estimate has dumped it; no wonder this mob have had to dump it. </para></talk.start></continue><para>An alternative model was done and the government tried to suppress it. The government commissioned two studies, not just the one that you have heard about. Then they spent three months trying to suppress that one because they could not afford it to get out, because the author of the other study, Mr Greg Cutbush, said this. This debate is easily fixed. Why don't the government get their modeller, CIE, to do it again? I can tell you it would be very embarrassing. If you get the government's favourite modeller, who produced the $4 billion figure, and you let it plug in all those dodgy assumptions that it plugged in last time and you say, `Here's the FTAâgo and model that,' what will you get? It is easyâjust do it. But Ross Gittins has said that, assuming the deal goes ahead, you will need a microscope to see the difference it makes to our economy, as the Howard government's own studies show. So much for the significant benefit, the huge bucksâa microscope will be needed to find them.</para><para>Interestingly, when you want to talk about agricultural productâand I am glad Senator Boswell, Senator Heffernan and Senator Macdonald are still hereânote what David Bassanese says in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>: </para><quote><para>One big worry is that the agreement suspiciously opens up exactly those areas where America stood to gain the most and it keeps closed those areas whereâ</para></quote><para>you guessed itâ</para><quote><para>we stood to gain the most.</para></quote><para>That is right, because this mob lost their nerve and delivered a free trade agreement for 75 per cent of agricultural products and left 25 per cent outâ <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>20188</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>NATS</party><role>Leader of The Nationals in the Senate</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOne of the things that defeated Mr Crean is that if we said `right' he said `wrong', if we said `left' he said `right' and if we said something was good it was automatically opposed.

No deal is ever perfect but you must ask the question: overall is the deal better than not having any deal at all? Overwhelmingly it is. We have hooked up with the biggest economy in the world and we have access to 75 per cent or whatever the number is of their agricultural products. If the Labor Party continue to do this, they are going to be right back where they were in the polls, and I will give them about six weeks.</para></talk.start><para>Everyone in agriculture who has put out press releases has said that it is a good deal. Even the sugar industry, which did not do wellâI am the first to acknowledge it and I do acknowledge itâhas come forward and said, `We don't have a dog in the manger attitude; we know overall it is a better deal for Australian agriculture and we're not saying if we can't have sugar we should have nothing.' That is a very generous statement from the cane growers. They know that Australia and agriculture are overwhelmingly better served with this trade deal.</para><para>You can never go into a debate on trade or get a trade deal where you get everything 100 per cent right. It just does not happen. Senator Cook might tell you that. He has been on the road to Doha for the last 20 years and he has advanced about half an inch. So we have cut through the red tape and got a very good deal with the Americansâthe largest economy in the world. What were we to do with industries such as aquaculture and seafood? We have made a fantastic dealâ$20 million just on the tuna industry alone, which is one part of the seafood industry. We had a plus for the horticulture industry and the removal of the tariffs on quota in the beef industry.

We had a 378,000-tonne quota and immediately the five per cent tariff comes off. That is a huge win in itself. We have never filled that quota, bar once, but we may fill it now because the quota does not have a tariff on it. Were we to dump the cereal industry, the packaged fruit industry, the peanut industry and the dairy industry? We could not say, `If you don't give us everything, we'll take nothing. We'll dump on all these industries.' The dairy industry is in dire straits, probably in just as much strife as the sugar industry, but you want to walk away from the dairy industry, the fishing industry and the horticulture industry because we did not get 100 per cent.</para></talk.start></continue><para><inline font-weight="bold">Opposition senator</inline>âAnd the lamb industry.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>YE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name></talker><para>âAnd the lamb industry and the sheep meat industry.

I got the tariffs on when the embargo was lifted. I stood by the sugar industry when the Labor Party tried to remove the tariffs. I got and maintained the single desk. I have stuck with them all the way through and I will continue to stick with them. I know the bitter disappointment that they are suffering over this. I understand that. I feel for them.

There are towns that depend on this industry. There are 25 mills in Australia. Many of those mills form the towns: Proserpine, Sarina and the mills down in northern New South Wales. He knows that we just cannot go and buy sugar growers out of the industry because there will be no critical mass. He understands that the industry must be sustained but not unprofitably sustained. We do not want to keep people in poverty but we want to give them a fair break.

At the present price I am marginal but, looking at the spot market, it will be $160 a tonne next year and the year after.

The group's press release says, `Sugar welcomes PM's restructure commitmentâenergy crop transformation the key to revival.' He says that they can no longer grow sugar; they can no longer grow sweeteners. They can no longer stay there. They have to get into by-products to generate renewable electricity, transport biofuels and ethanol. I agree with him. The Prime Minister agrees with him.

I want to address these issues in my remarks but I also want to take the opportunity to speak about the trade deal and the Senate's approach to it more generally. Obviously, we have an interesting period ahead of us once we finally get to see the text of the agreement. Only then can it be analysed and assessed to determine whether on balance it is in the national interest. </para></talk.start><para>The term `national interest' is thrown about willy-nilly in this debate. The government claims to be acting in the national interestâeven with the so-called `tough decisions'âand the opposition screams that it has been sold out. The bottom line is that we really do not know what has been decided. It has been laughable that every day this week in parliament we have heard ministers coming in time after time trumpeting the values of this deal and not one of them, as Senator Hill mentioned yesterday, has read the text of the agreement. So they do not know what is in it. A lot of it is speculation, a lot of it is based on the rhetoric that is put out by this government and certainly by the trade representatives of the United States, and there is a vast gap between what is being said in all of the press statements. So determining what is in Australia's national interest, in my mind, is going to require careful and thorough examination of the terms of the agreement, extensive consultation with the key groups and the stakeholders and, I think, a balanced and a reasoned assessment of the likely risks and benefits that the agreement might bring to our country. I think it is critical to remember that the national interest has to be much more than merely economic considerations, and that is about the only thing we have heard this week. Wide-ranging trade agreements such as the FTA will of course have an effect on every facet of our economic, social and cultural framework, so we have to be careful about weighing up what has been given away against what has been won.</para><para>The focus of the ALP and the Greens this week, in my mind, has been wrong. Carrying on in a hysterical fashion about the FTA, swearing to veto it at the first opportunity, is not a constructive way to approach this debate. I think we need to keep our heads and fulfil the essential role that the Senate plays, and that is to facilitate scrutiny, debate, careful analysis and decisions made in the best interest of the nation. I think we should also keep this debate in perspective. Others in this place will go on and on as much as they like but the simple fact of the matter is that we do not have an opportunity to vote the agreement down in its entirety. </para><para>The Democrats wish that were different. We firmly believe in the importance of parliamentary approval of treaties and we have believed in that for many years. My former Senate colleague from New South Wales Senator Vicki Bourne repeatedly called on the government and the ALP in opposition to support us in our bid to have greater parliamentary involvement in the treaty-making process. This is where the Democrats have demonstrated that we are the only party with a properly reasoned approach to this issue. We have consistently maintained that we are not anti free trade per se but we are mindful of the need for fair trade. We will be applying the fairness test in this particular case. We have consistently argued that the parliament should have a role and we will seek to exercise it. We are also mindful of the need for a careful balancing of the different objectives that will arise out of this major agreement. </para><para>There are of course areas of particular concern. Whilst there has been a lot of propaganda and misinformation in this debate over the past week, what has been made clear is that the agreement has fallen far short of the government's original list of key objectives. By their own admission we do not have as good a result as they had hoped. In particular, the question of better access to US markets for Australian farmers has produced a disappointingly mediocre result. I want to speak briefly about agriculture later in my remarksâand my colleague Senator Allison will talk about the issue of the sugar industryâbut before I get to that there are several areas that we are concerned may have been compromised in a desperate attempt to secure a better deal for our farmers. </para><para>The Democrats have been on the record consistently throughout the past year speaking out in support of a need to protect essential social policies that have seemed at risk as the government pursued its single-minded mission of securing a good deal for agricultural trade. Areas such as public health and pharmaceuticals, the protection of Australian content in our media, quarantine and environmental protection, and the provision of essential public services must be maintained. But very little of the debate is being devoted to those areas of concern other than to the PBS. The government needs to prove that they will be maintained. Coming in here and talking about the rhetoric and not showing the detail is simply not enough. We cannot take the rhetoric seriously without the detail, particularly given the grave inconsistencies between what the government is telling us and what the Americans are saying. There has to be concrete reassurance that these essential social policy areas have not being compromised in order to give farmers greater access to the US market.</para><para>If there are compromises, there has to be a very good reason why we should accept them. There has been extensive discussion over recent days about the outcome the government has achieved with respect to agriculture in this agreement. What was supposed to be one of the primary motivating factors for this agreement in the first placeâbetter access for Australian farmersâhas not been achieved if you simply look at the rhetoric that the government has been promoting. Numerous agricultural lobby groups have expressed their disappointment this week, and the sugar industry, of course, has been entirely excluded from the deal. It is not enough to turn around and say, `Let's come up with some industry assistance package to assist the farmers,' as some sort of sweetener. To me that sounds a little bit like those diet pills you take: they are not really getting much in the process. It is not really going to fatten up the industry; it is just something to quieten the argument that is going on. The modest improvements for beef and dairy and the increased access for horticulture, sheep meat and wool do not seem to justify the government's joyous declaration that it has secured a great deal for this country. This was supposedly such a critical factor in the negotiations, for which we are now expected to consider it is worth making sacrifices in other areas. The balance of the national interest will depend upon whether these apparently modest gains justify what we will have to surrender elsewhere.</para><para>The thing that tells the story the most is an article I read yesterday saying that the free trade agreement with the United States barely rated a mentioned in the US. I think it may have come up as a small item in the business papers, but certainly in Florida it did not appear at all. If that is the state that was so concerned about the sugar issue, why wasn't it worth mentioning in the US press? At the end of the day, we have to understand that our contribution to their economic growth is really a drop in the ocean because of the size of their market.</para><para>The final thing I want to say is that there is a range of different issues that will require careful analysis once we see the text of the final agreement and are faced with the consideration of legislation that is going to be introduced to give effect to the terms of the agreement. These decisions will also have a critical impact on our national sovereignty more generallyâthat is, our capacity to legislate in the Australian national interest. We owe it to ourselves and the Australian people to be vigilant to ensure that the terms of the agreement do not affect our ability to regulate freely in the national interest in the future. </para><para>The months ahead shall be critical ones and we have to focus on careful and analytical consideration. That is why the Democrats have supported the establishment of a Senate select committee. I think it comes down to one very simple thing: protecting the national interest now and into the future.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>20194</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAs indicated by Senator Ridgeway, I wish to speak in this debate about the sugar industry. It is very clear that if one sector was left completely out in the cold over the so-called free trade agreement with the United States it was the sugar industry. I think the cane growers must in fact be starting to realise that the federal government is not worrying about what it promises to this sector. It has promised the earth but has then turned around on so many issues and done the complete opposite. So cane growers must be really disappointed by the FTA announcement. Liberalisation was supposed to mean $440 million a year to the sugar industry but, as a result of this failure, they will get nothing.</para></talk.start><para>The government failed to break through the current quota accessâthat is 87,000-odd metric tonnes of sugar for 2004âbecause the sugar lobby managed to prevent any trade liberalisation at all in the United States. I think this calls into question our own government's intelligence on the strength of that lobby. We talk about intelligence on weapons of mass destruction, but maybe we should be questioning the sort of advice the government was given that led ministers to say that it would be un-Australian to come out of a deal without making gains for sugar. Apart from that being pretty silly and making them look rather foolish at this end of the process, one wonders how it is that we did not recognise how difficult it was going to be in going into those talks in the first place.</para><para>The problem for cane growers and the sugar industry is that they were already at desperation point with the two major parties only too happy to sink the boot in on ethanol, which has resulted in a massive loss of confidence in that industry. The government has failed to come to sugar's defence on ethanol. It could have provided growers, refiners and ethanol producers with another very much neededâas it now turns outâincome stream. It could have softened the blow of the FTA; it could have made a big difference to the income of cane growers in particular.</para><para>The sugar industry had thought that there was great potential to add value by processing sugarcane waste into ethanol. We all thought the federal government recognised that, with the Prime Minister's promise that there would be a target of 350 megalitres of ethanol being produced each year by 2010. The sector certainly had pinned its hopes on ethanol. Mr Beattie's Queensland Labor government recognised that and so did the opposition leader, Mr Lawrence Springborg. The coalition in Queensland also came forward with support for the ethanol industry, based on the production of sugar in Queensland, and saw the benefit of this by-product. In fact, Mr Springborg announced that a key plank of the coalition's election platform was the mandating of 10 per cent ethanol in unleaded petrol.</para><para>I think it is a great pity that while our trade delegation were in the United States they did not ask around to find out what was happening in that country with regard to mandating ethanol. I think if they had done that they would have discovered that quite a few states in the United States are already doing that. It has been a great boon to cane growers and to other primary producers such as sugar producers to know that there is another source of income that they can rely on. </para><para>Ethanolâessentially alcoholâhas many applications. We have been making ethanol in this country for a long timeâcertainly since way back in the fifties in North Queensland. But the important issue for this debate is that it can be added to petrol so that it becomes ethanol blended transport fuel. Ethanol is used to oxygenate petrol. It increases the oxygen content within the fuel, producing a cleaner burn and reducing emissions, including particulates. Very tiny particulates enter the human respiratory system and contribute to respiratory diseases such as asthma and lung cancer.</para><para>The government dealt another mighty and damaging blow to the fledgling ethanol industry last year by announcing in the May 2003 budget that it would impose an excise on ethanol for the first time and that this would start in 2008. Just before the 2003 budget announcement, the government gave a commitment to the industry not to apply an excise to alternative fuels. In fact, as has been said many times in this place by me and by others, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Warren Truss, gave a commitment to the industry in writing saying that excise would not be applied to ethanol. On the basis of that commitment, potential producers prepared business plans to establish ethanol plants. They worked out what investment would be required and sourced the finance, and many of them went ahead with their projects.</para><para>When this was announced in the May budget, industry entrants pointed out that they needed an excise-free period of at least seven to eight years from the start of production in order to get their plants off the ground. That is not seven to eight years as of the budget announcement but seven to eight years from the start of production. As we all know, these things do not happen overnight. You need to spend a lot of time at the bank persuading them that this is a going concern, and then the process of permits and so forth can take a very long time indeed.</para><para>The industry also said that the excise rates that were being proposed, effectively the same as for petrol, were impossibly high and would ruin the industry before it even got off the ground. We understand that this message has finally got through, at least to some extent, to the government, and late last year it was announced that the rate was likely to be about half that amount. If it is, and I sincerely hope it is not the case, the prognosis for sugar as a source of ethanol for transport fuel is still not looking good; in fact, it is looking very sick.</para><para>Treasury took a very hard-headed, economically irrational approach to this, insisting that alternative fuels had been getting away with paying no excise for far too long in this country and that they must be taxed, and that was the end of the matter. Of course, if no ethanol is produced for fuel transport, there is not going to be much revenue flow into the Treasury coffers as a result, but that seemed to bypass those who were making this decision. I think that inflexible approach will result in no revenue at all being collected from ethanol because, as I said, we simply will not have an ethanol industry. And we may not have a sugar industry; who knows?</para><para>Then there is labelling. This week the minister tabled the new warning label for ethanol blended petrolâE10, as it is called. I say `warning label' advisedly because, apart from having images on it, it is a bit akin to the warning labels you get on cigarettes. That is the product that kills around 20,000 people in this country every year. So despite its great benefits to the human respiratory system, ethanol now has a label on it that is akin to the label on tobacco. The minister did that under great pressure. He did that because the auto lobby said that it was very dangerous and that motorists needed to know whether or not there was ethanol in the petrolâdespite the fact that for some years we have had an ethanol level of 20 per cent in some petrol in parts of New South Wales and nobody has been able to demonstrate that it has done a single bit of damage to autos. But that is by the by. </para><para>So we have this new warning label for ethanol. It is certainly not attractive. It certainly reads and looks like a message to motorists saying, `Go as far away as you can from this petrol pump because, if you stay here, you are going to get ethanol and we all know that's not good for anybody.' The government had the opportunity to see that this made a positive statement and that it accorded with everything we know about ethanol blendsâthat is, they improve air quality and they are better for our respiratory system. The list of benefits from having ethanol in petrol is very long, and the government could have spelled that out. The government could have indicated that ethanol was in fact a worthy fuel for people to use and it could have helped to extol the virtues.</para><para>The government also could have insisted that there be labels on other fuels. The Democrats suggested that there should be a rating scheme in place which would allow motorists to look at various fuels. When I go into petrol stations now there is often an offer of at least two and sometimes three different kinds of petrol. If you do not know what you are looking for then you do not know what is useful to buy or what is likely to be best for the environment, best for air quality or best for the human respiratory system. It could have been a simple matterâand we have had this debate beforeâto rate all fuels, and I would be very confident that ethanol blended petrol would get the maximum number of stars when compared with other petrols. But, no, that is not what we have; instead we have a warning label.</para><para>This means yet another nail in the coffin of the sugar industryâand not just the sugar industry. Obviously the grain industry and a whole range of agriculture will be the disbeneficiaries, if you like, of this approach. It is not going to improve the uptake of ethanol, and that in turn reflects on the sugar industry, which, as I have already indicated, has been dealt a massive blow this weekâyet another one. This is yet another example of a government promising to take action to improve the economic lot of both cane growers and the communities in which they live, yet another promise that has gone down the drain. A whole industry is likely to be very disappointed, very upset. Quite frankly, I would not want to be a member of The Nationals in any of those sugar electorates. They bear the responsibility for serious economic disadvantage as a result of the events of the last couple of months, not least of which were the label this week and the FTA last week.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>20196</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âFirstly, may I respectfully correct Senator Ridgeway. The ALP will decide its attitude to this agreement when we have seen the text of the agreement and had a chance to examine it and evaluate it from the perspective of the national interest. When that process has been completed, we will make our decision as to how we will vote on this package. That has been made clear by our leader, Mark Latham, and there is no doubt about that position. If there is any doubt in anyone's mind, they should go to the report of the committee that I had the privilege to chair, <inline font-style="italic">Voting on trade</inline><inline font-style="italic">,</inline> which was tabled in the Senate chamber in November last year.</para></talk.start><para>From Mr Howard we had coined the new political phrase `core promises and non-core promises'. To that we can add an additional phrase: `sugar promises'. We now have core promises, non-core promises and sugar promises. What is a sugar promise? A sugar promise occurs when you reassure a key constituency of yours that you will look after their industry and then you rat on them. The lexicon can now have those three promises from this government. </para><para>The government justifies this package as the best deal it could get. It has said that it is not perfectâit wanted more but it had to close the deal and this is the best deal it could get. Key commentators have said, `Give it 1Â½ cheers.' Other commentators have said the government has dudded Australia. No-one is saying, `This is brilliant.' There is, however, a scam hereâand we should not fall for it. This package could have been much better. If the government had listened to the Labor Party it would have been much better. The government has deliberately and cynically put its electoral interests ahead of the Australian national economic interest. It has closed a trade deal in circumstances which guaranteed that it would be an inferior package and it has done so, as I have said, cynically, manipulatively and for electoral purposes.</para><para>The fact that they have dudded their own constituency in the process seems to be a matter they are prepared to overlook. How have they done that? It is quite simple. Last year the Prime Minister met with the United States President at Crawford, Texas, at the President's ranch. They agreed that they would close this deal by the end of the calendar year 2003 with a possible spill-over of negotiations to January, or early February at the extreme, this year. They imposed on themselves a deadline that guaranteed that, on the US side, the President had no wriggle room whatsoever to close the deal I suspect he wanted to. The reason he had no wriggle room is that he was jammed up against the US presidential election campaign.</para><para>We know that the main sugar state in the United States is Florida, the state of the President's brother Jeb Bush, the state of the hanging chadsâthe state that in the last presidential election was the decisive swinging state in the union. We know that dairy is also a hot topic in some of the other borderline states and that beef is too. By agreeing to accept a deadline that meant the Americans had to engage in a political consideration of this package and not disappoint key constituencies, the Australian Prime Minister guaranteed that he would get an inferior deal. So let us cut this cant about this being the best we could have got.</para><para>The sensible thing would have been to have closed this package after the US presidential elections when an incoming President was free to negotiate with a mandate and when a new Australian Prime Minister was equally free to do this deal properly. Jamming it up against the US presidential election timetable, when the differences between the Republicans and the Democrats are narrowing to a sharper contest, guaranteed that the US said no to Australia on agriculture. We all know that. The Prime Minister knows that but he did it, and he did it for the reason that he wants an agreement. It does not matter what sort of agreement or the quality of it; he wants an agreement to wave around saying, `I'm the only one that can do a deal with the United States.'</para><para>What difference would it have made to beef producers if they had waited another nine months when they are phasing in their quotas over 18 years? What difference would it have made to Australian sugar producers if they had waited another nine months with a very real chance of getting a deal in congenial negotiating circumstances? What difference would it have made to the dairy producers and all of the other agricultural producers to wait for a time at which Australia could negotiate effectively? </para><para>Let us not pretend that this is the best that could have been done. This is the worst that could have been done and it was done in the worst negotiating climate imaginable. It was done for political purposes, not for the purpose of our national economic interest. This government should never be able to get away with it. This deal is the equivalent of the `children overboard' argument. This deal is the equivalent of the weapons of mass destruction argument. This deal is the equivalent of the ethanol scam. No member of the coalition should believe otherwise, because it is a simple matter that the Prime Minister did agree to close this package at a time when it was electorally uncongenial for an outcome that would be useful to Australia.</para><para>There are a number of very important questions that need to be asked about this deal. First of all, we do not know what it contains; we only know what the government says it contains and what the US government says to its constituency it contains. Several speakers today have compared and contrasted the two releasesâthe US one and the Australian one. There are gaping holes in the explanations on both sides, leaving a big question mark over what really was determined here. We cannot decide what was determined here until we see the source text. The source text is being, to use the jargon, `legally brushed' at the moment and it will be another two weeks or more before it is available for us to look at. When it is, let us examine it properly. When it is, we will be in a position to judge for ourselves by looking at the black letter of the undertakings that the government has agreed to.</para><para>In the meantime, a number of other very important questions need to be asked. The government should be in a position to answer them. The government is not in a position to answer them. The fact that the government is not in a position to answer them and has declined to answer them makes it either incompetence on their behalf or cynical in trying to manage public perceptions about this deal. Let me go to the first question that needs to be asked and answered authoritatively: what is the value of this deal to the Australian economy? The government cannot tell us the answer to that simple question. It cannot tell us.</para><para>The Minister for Trade said today at the National Press Club that he would remodel the deal to see what the outcome was but could not state the value to the national economy of this package. How incompetent is that! In a negotiation, doesn't the government do some scenario modelling privately, for its own information, to see what the value to the national economy the different types of packages and scenarios it models might be? If it closes a deal without knowing the benefit, what is the criterion for judgment about how good this package might be? The fact that the Minister for Trade cannot authoritatively tell us, because he does not know, how good or bad this deal is means that he does not want to tell us and is afraid of the facts, that he is just ignorant or that he is a sloppy negotiator.</para><para>Let me go to another key question that needs to be answered: what will this package do to the trade deficit between Australia and the United States? We all know that Australia has a massive overall national trade deficit. We all know that the biggest single bilateral trade deficit that we have is with the United States. All up, the deficit is about a third of the total volume of trade between Australia and the US. It is the biggest single trade deficit. Is it not a germane argument in this debate to be able to say whether this package will close the deficit or widen it?</para><para>At the National Press Club today, the minister was asked whether this package will narrow the deficit or blow out the deficit. Was the minister able to answer that rudimentary question? No, he was not. He said he did not know. He hoped, and he went on to express a fond hope, that it would do better. I join him in that hope. I hope it does, if it ever goes through, because we do not want to see that deficit worsen. But the fact that the minister does not know whether the deficit will get worse or better as a consequence of this package is a terrible indictment of his negotiating approach. How do we measure and weigh and value this package if we do not know whether it will narrow the deficit? </para><para>The other salutary concern in this debate is the modelling that the Centre for International Economics did prior to the government moving into these negotiations, which assumed the market would clear on both sides and we would have a package of that levelâa wild assumption, it is true, but one that they made for the purposes of modelling. When you looked at the value to the American economy and the value to the Australian economy, the deficit in trade we have with the United States got larger. It got larger under the government's preferred model. There is nothing to lead us to believe that it will not get larger under this package. But can the government answer that question? No, it cannot. I say again that it does leave you with the question: on what criteria did the government make the judgment that this is in the national interest?</para><para>The other question which is vital to consider, particularly in this chamber given the view of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee in its report <inline font-style="italic">Voting on trade: </inline><inline font-style="italic">the General Agreement on Trade in Services and an Australia-US free trade agreement</inline>, tabled in the chamber last November, is the investor state clause. We have been toldâand it is true in terms of the government publicityâthat there is no investor state clause in this agreement. What we do know from information seeping out and from information in the United States is that, whilst that is true, there is work going on between Australia and the United States on an investor state arbitration provision. An investor state arbitration provision sounds to me like an investor state clause under another name. Certainly there are considerable interests in the United States that want such a provision in all bilateral trade negotiations.</para><para>The minister has said, and it is true, that no state government wanted it and that the ALP does not want it. In a majority reportâto be fairâto this parliament last November we as a joint committee said we did not want it. What does an investor state provision do? If included it would enable private companies to litigate in US courts and compel Australian companies or governments to comply with their decisions. That is what it would do. We know that this government sneaked one in at the 11th hour in the Australia-Singapore free trade agreement. I suspected at the time that it was to create a precedent for having one such provision in the Australia-US free trade agreement. We do know that work is continuing and that working parties are trying to develop such a provision now, so the issue is not dead and one has to be on alert about it.</para><para>A further question that needs to be asked is: what does this outcome do with respect to our World Trade Organisation negotiating position? The minister said at the Press Club today, and he is rightâI am glad that the government has made this admissionâthat in a bilateral trade negotiation you cannot remove subsidies to US farmers. The grotesque subsidies being provided by the US Farm Bill cannot be touched and are not touched by this agreement. The only way to do that is multilaterally in negotiations through the World Trade Organisation. So when the tariff wall or the quotas get larger under this agreement, if it comes into force, for Australian exporters into the United States market, bear in mind that Australian producers who are unsubsidised are competing with subsidised American producers and that it is still not a level playing field. </para><para>In order to get the best deal for Australia you have to tackle the tariff levels, the quota system and the removal of the subsidies, and the only way you can do that is through the World Trade Organisation. Does this agreement aid our ability to do that, or does it weaken it? It is too soon to call as a general proposition because we do not have all of the detail of this agreement. But if you look at the negotiating position we put in the lead-up to the Cancun ministerial, where the WTO round broke down, and if you look at the tabled offer of the United States as to the furthest it was prepared to go, which arose out of the ministerial discussions at Cancun, it is reasonable to see that in this agreement we have settled for a lesser standard. That means we have undercut the best available levels of outcome that we could have got.</para><para>If I am right about that, that is a shocking indictment of these negotiations. The other thing is that Australia is not just a country acting in the World Trade Organisation on its own, it is the chair of the free trading agricultural countries of the worldâ26 nations committed to freeing up agricultural trade. If we as the chair of that very impressive and strong negotiating group settle for a standard that undercuts the position of the entire group, we bring the whole negotiation of that group crashing down and we weaken the opportunity for us at a multilateral level to do anything significant here.</para><para>By doing a substandard bilateral deal with the United States we also bring ourselves to a level at which the Europeans, in protecting their infamous common agricultural policy, say, `Ha! Australia talks big about what it wants but it settles small in the outcome, and Australia is to be dismissed in terms of an effective negotiating force when it comes to the European Union's common agricultural policy.' When it comes to the issue of Japan, who run a highly protected rice industry, we are equally diminished. So selling out in a bilateral trade deal with the United States on our agricultural sector sells us out not only to the US but also to the Europeans, to the Japanese and to any other country that has high protection for agriculture and wants to deny its own citizens lower prices for quality merchandise from Australia. At first look, that is what has happened here.</para><para>If the pace picks up for the multilateral round, Australia will be without credit and will be a much diminished power in terms of maintaining a credible position. The cause of agricultural trade liberalisation will be put back, which I as a member of the Labor Party concerned about the world situation think is bad not only for Australia but also for every developing country in the world that wants access to the protected markets of Europe, North America and Japan in order to trade their way into a greater degree of prosperity. If we blunt this issue of agricultural trade negotiation, as this substandard package does, we blunt the cause right across the world and we guarantee that more people live in povertyâand that is also a shocking indictment.</para><para>I want to conclude on one point of politics that has intruded into this debate. I heard a coalition spokesman yesterday say that the Leader of the Australian Labor Party, Mark Latham, is anti-American because of his attitude on this package. Nothing could be further from the truth. That is an absolute joke and it should be put down right now. Let me explain why it is a sad calumny on the interests and ambitions of Mr Latham.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name></talker><para>âAt least he's not un-Australian. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name></talker><para>âAnd he's not anti-American either. The reason is that he wants Australian sugar in the American market, which would mean every product containing sugar would be cheaper to every American consumer. He wants Australian dairy products in greater force into the American market, which would mean every dairy product would be cheaper to every American consumer. He wants more Australian beef into the American market, which would mean every beef based product would be cheaper to every American consumer. That means every American household would be better off if Mr Latham's ambitions were realised. That is not anti-American; that is pro-American. That is pro American consumers. A lot of American consumers would be pleased to acknowledge that Australia at least has their interest at heart.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>20201</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe members of the Howard government this week have had increasingly red faces as they have tried to answer questions in question time about what is in this trade agreement that has been reached between Australia and the United States. We have seen Minister Vaile and the government bring into force all the spin that they can to try to sell to the Australian public something that is now being recognised for the dud that it is. Even the government recognise a bad deal. We are seeing them have to put on the spinâthey delayed the announcement until after the Queensland electionâbecause they know they have been duped by George Bush and the United States when it came to negotiating a free trade agreement.</para></talk.start><para>This trade agreement was supposed to be the backhand favour that was going to be given by George W. Bush to Prime Minister Howard after he led Australian men and women into an illegal and immoral war on Iraq. This was supposed to be the backhand favour that was coming at the end of young men and women from Australia being sent off to be involved in Iraq, where there continues to be enormous devastation and suffering not just for the Iraqi people but now also for coalition troops who are in that arena. This trade agreement was supposed to say, `Thanks for coming to war with us. Here's your payback.' If this is what the Howard government think is payback when it comes to their negotiations with the world's largest superpower, the United States, they should think again.</para><para>We have seen the government become increasingly red-faced this week during the question times when they tried to explain the deal that had been done. None of the ministers in here seemed to give any indication that they had even seen the text of the deal. We heard Minister Hill at the beginning of this week saying that he had tried to get a copy of the agreement, that he had tried to find the information. If the Leader of the Government in the Senate has to apologise to the Senate and the Australian people that he has not been able to get access from his mate Minister Vaile to what is in this trade agreement that has been signed with the United States, why on earth should any of us on this side of the chamber, or the Australian public, believe what this government has to say about the supposed benefits in this agreement for Australian people and for Australian industry, trade and agriculture? It is absolutely shameless to have, one after the other, government ministers standing up trying to defend a piece of legislation that they have not seen. They do not know what is in it, and they cannot with any credibility argue that it is in Australia's national interest.</para><para>As the text of this agreement is finally revealed, I think we will see the red faces here becoming a lot of beetroot heads. They will become even more red, even more embarrassed, as the Australian community and the Australian Senate come to see what damage they have done to Australia's national interest, how they have sold off Australia's interests, whether it be in agriculture or protection of our public servicesâa whole raft of different services are included in this agreement. We will continue to see a grilling of this government, and we will see those beetroot faces on the front benches of this chamber and the other chamber as the final text of this agreement comes out onto the table. </para><para>There has been analysis by commentators and the public as this information has come out. One day after the newspapers announced the detail of what was in this trade agreementâor the detail we had so farâwe saw some commentary in the newspapers. There was an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Age </inline>newspaperâit was also in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>, where I read itâby Ross Gittens. I think he sums up what has happened in this trade agreement when he says:</para><quote><para>What mugs Honest John takes us for.</para></quote><para>What absolute mugs Honest John takes us for! Those were Ross Gittens's words in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning</inline><inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> on Wednesday this week. Well, the Australian Greens will not be taken for mugs on this one. We do not need to send this issue off to an inquiry to be able to determine that this is a bad deal. This is a bad deal for Australian farmers, who were told there would be wins in agriculture. This is a bad deal for sick Australians, who do not want to have to pay more for their medicines. This is a bad deal for Australians who are working in our cultural industries. It is a bad deal for young Australians growing up, who want to hear Australian voices, in the coming new media, telling them the stories about the history, heritage and culture of this country. This is a shocking deal that the Howard government has caved into.</para><para>Later I will go into some detail about the commentary that has come out of the US industry sector because they, too, have recognised that the Howard government has been duped on this one. In fact there was a comment in Wednesday's newspaper from a former US trade negotiator who was quite blunt in what he said. Rather than Australia getting a trade deal, he says:</para><quote><para>Instead you're sending a message to the world that the agriculture lobby in the US is still so powerful that even a close ally like Australia gets stiffed. They must really be laughing in Tokyo.</para></quote><para>Those are the words of a former US trade negotiator in his commentary on the deal that this government has signed off on and that Minister Vaile has signed off onâhe has not given a copy to other ministersâand that this government has tried to defend over the last week since this information became available. In the words of the former US trade negotiator, the Australian government got `stiffed' in the deal.</para><para>The deal that has been cooked up by the government in Washington this weekend is neither a free trade agreement nor a good result for ordinary Australians. In fact, it is the Howard government serving up the Australian economy, Australian society, Australian culture and the Australian environment on a plate to US big business. Of course, we still do not know the detail of the agreement because the government are refusing to come clean as to what exactly they have traded off, what rights they have given away, what important protections they have torn up, and what sectors of the society and economy they have sacrificed in return for their dubious claims about benefits for Australian businesses.</para><para>More detail is coming out and we now know that the figures that the government have been relying on are based on inaccurate estimates and assumptions. They are based on a deal on sugar that has proven to be false. The government, leading into these negotiations, got a range of different groups to do costings for them as to what the future would be and what opportunities there would be as a result of this free trade agreement with the United States. They got one costing done; that is the famousânow infamousâ$4 billion that we were supposed to be getting out of this trade agreement. It was based on a set of assumptions that were absolutely ludicrous. They were false at that time. They were pie in the sky ideas from the Australian government that they would get all tariffs removed from agricultural sectors in the US. Even going into the negotiations, to get costings done on the basis of all barriers being removed was a ludicrous idea of the Australian government. But that is the modelling they did and that is where we got the infamous $4 billion that this government continue to try to tout both here and in the public. </para><para>The government had another study commissioned. That commissioned study said, `There could be some benefits; there could be some losses.' That is the information the government got before signing off on the deal. The US government are now saying that they will get $2 billion out of this deal. If, out of a negotiation between the world's greatest economic superpower and Australiaâan economy which is the size of the state of Pennsylvania by comparison with the USâthe US government reckon they are going to get $2 billion, I do not know how any government minister can keep a straight face and try to continue to claim to the Australian public and parliament this week that Australia is going to get $4 billion. How, in negotiation with the United States, the world's largest superpower, is Australia, a tiny pimple on the bum by comparison, going to get doubleâ$4 billion; not $2 billion as the US are claimingâas this government have continued to claim in this chamber this week in trying to defend the dud deal they have done with the United States?</para><para>Already the public are expressing their outrage and concerns about the deal. As more information comes to light in the coming weeks and months, such opposition will grow. We will see exactly how much damage the Australian government has done to Australia's national interest. Just let me give you an example. Here is what one member of the public had to say in a letter to the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on 11 February, this week:</para><quote><para>According to John Howard, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme has been âprotectedâ under the proposed free trade agreement. According to the office of the US Trade Representative, however, the two parties have agreed to establish a medicines working group âthat will provide for continued dialogue between the United States and Australia on emerging health care policy issuesâ.</para></quote><para>She continues:</para><quote><para>I'm sorry, but since when was Australian health care policy a matter for the determination of the US? What right does it have to any such âdialogueâ?</para><para>Mr Howard is more than aware that the US pharmaceutical industry resents the Australian PBS but will not stand up to this outrageous bullying to do anything about it.</para></quote><para>Those are the words of Kirsty Machon from Marrickville who wrote in to the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> earlier this week.</para><para>The Australian public do know what is going on. They have not been duped by this government and its spin and the spin of ministers in question time today and during the week. The public education campaign that has been run in the lead-up to this free trade agreement by groups like AFTINET, the Australian Fair Trade and Investment Network, Tradewatch and, of course, the Australian Consumers Association, and the work that the Greens and others have been doing around the country, mean that the Australian people are seeing through the Howard government's smokescreen on free trade, as on so many other issues. But it is a sad indictment of this government, and strong evidence of how it is trying to spin this deal, that we know more about this deal from the statements of the American government than from Minister Vaile. It is a unique position to be in, where we have people on this side of the chamber saying, `We trust more the words that are coming out of the US administration when it comes to what is in this deal than we do the words coming from the Australian government.' </para><para>Let us have a look at the impact of this deal. As I just said, we know the most not from the statements of the trade minister in Australia, Minister Vaile, but from the office of the US Trade Representative. Let us look at the Foreign Investment Review Board. The Foreign Investment Review Board will remain, but its role, its responsibility, has been gutted. US investment in new businesses will be exempt from screening. The threshold for national interest screening of proposed US acquisitions has been raised from $50 million to $800 million. The US Trade Representative estimates that, had the $800 million threshold been operating over the last three years, 90 per cent of US investment in Australia would have fallen outside the screening scope of the Foreign Investment Review Board. So the capacity of the government to control and regulate the takeover by US big business of Australian industries has been dumped, and it is now open slather for the global corporations to monopolise key sectors of the Australian economy.</para><para>Let us look now at manufactured goods: 97 per cent of Australia's manufacturing exports to the United States will be duty free from the date of effect of the free trade agreement with the United States, as will 99 per cent of US manufacturing exports to Australia. Manufactured goods account for 93 per cent of total US exports to Australia. US manufacturers estimate the export gains to them as a result of the free trade agreement to be $US2 billion per annum. This government claims there will be gains for Australian manufacturing. But what about all these goods flooding into the Australian market? How is this going to affect manufacturers? How many jobs will be lost?</para><para>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade states that tariffs on textiles, some footwear and `a handful of other items' will be phased out by 2015. This is despite the thousands of jobs already lost in the textile, clothing and footwear industry. Questions remain about the antidumping measures: will the deal adequately prevent the products of the world's sweatshops being shunted through the United States and onto our shores? Tariffs on car components and commercial vehicles will be eliminated from the date of effect of the agreement and tariffs on Australian passenger vehicles will be phased out by 2010. The government have been fantastical in jumping around the questions about where the jobs will be lost from. Where will the jobs be lost over the medium term in manufacturing opportunities for Australia? Will it be in Adelaide at the vehicle manufacturing plants? Where will it be? Will it be the componentry plants in Melbourne? Where will the job losses occur over the coming years, thanks to the trade agreement that this government think they should be given a pat on the back for?</para><para>Let us look at audiovisual servicesâthe film and television industryâand Australian culture. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade states that the free trade agreement protects local content requirements, including the capacity to set requirements for new and emerging media and to go beyond existing measures for subscription television formats such as drama, children's programming and documentaries. However, according to the US Trade Representative, the deal: </para><quote><para>... contains important and unprecedented provisions to improve market access for U.S. films and television programs over a variety of media including cable, satellite, and the Internet.</para></quote><para>Who should we believe in this instance? If the United States, as the world's largest economic superpower, believe that they are going to have unprecedented opportunities for Americans working in this industry to get their product into the Australian marketplace, what does that mean for the Australians who, because of current quota arrangements, have been able to work on movies like <inline font-style="italic">The </inline><inline font-style="italic">Matrix</inline> that are being made in Sydney and to be involved in these American productions, learning skills and having the opportunity to participate in US films being made here in Australia and also in Australian films being made here? If these unprecedented opportunities are going to be available for the United States to get their product into Australia, ipso facto there will be fewer opportunities for Australians working in our cultural industries to continue to provide Australian stories to the generations of young Australians growing up in this country.</para><para>Let us look now at affordable medicines. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade states that, while the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme procedures will be changed to provide for greater transparency, speedier decision making and more opportunities for input from corporations, the price of prescription drugs will not increase as a result of the deal. The US Trade Representative states that the parties have agreed on the importance of innovation, research and development in pharmaceuticals; the need to recognise the value of innovative pharmaceuticals; and the need to have procedures that appropriately value the objectively demonstrated therapeutic value of a pharmaceutical. To implement these principles there will be provision for a so-called independent review of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme determinations of product listings, and there will be other changes to enhance the transparency and accountability of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Schemeâa review that is likely to be held behind closed doors and one that will allow US corporations to overturn the decisions of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Under the direction of Mr Grant Tambling from the other place, this government looked at this proposal for a review in 2000 and rejected it outright as not being in Australia's interests. In the four years since that review was carried out and so resoundingly rejected by this government, what has changed so that the government now believes this in Australia's interest?</para><para>There continues to be a range of issues for which we are not seeing the detail, whether it be government procurement, quarantine or environmental regulations or which services have been listed and opened up in this negative agreement where, if you do not stipulate a service and exempt it from the free trade agreement, it falls within the ambit of all the provisionsâwhich we are yet to seeâof this agreement. There are hints there for us; we need to be concerned and we need to look into the future but we will not know until we see the final text of this agreement, exactly how much the Australian government has sold out farmers, has sold out our public services and has sold out sick people who need to be able to access affordable medicines, or how much the Australian government has served up Australia's national interests on a platter to the Bush administration in the United States. We will not know until we see the final detail, which this government is refusing to show us, just how much damage has been done.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>20206</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator FERRIS</name><name.id>5L6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âLet us go back to Senator Conroy's notice of motion today, which in part was that the Senate: </para></talk.start><quote><para>	(b)	notes that:</para><para>	(i)	the expected gains from the trade deal with the United States of America (US) are based on unrealistic assumptions ...</para></quote><para>Senator Conroy knows, Senator Nettle knows and other speakers today know that the assumptions will not be known until the document is released.

The bigger the brim, the smaller the brain. Senator Conroy's only connection with agriculture is that he was once described as a rooster in a chookyard.

He has no relevance in this issue.

I am looking forward to hearing the evidence of those people, because South Australian businesses and the South Australian agricultural community know that that is what this trade agreement will deliver. It will deliver opportunities for small and large businesses in industry, agriculture and commerce. Opening the door to a community of 300 million people when we are 20 million people is an opportunity that we on this side of the chamber excitedly look forward to. But, tragically, those on the other side of the chamber are sitting around carping, whingeing, whining, opposing, admitting they do not have the detail, admitting they do not know what will really happen but nevertheless deciding to oppose it.

The wet tropics World Heritage area is a magnificent part of my home state of Queensland. It is in the Far North. The development and implementation of this World Heritage area was quite controversial, but it is an area whose ecological values and indeed Indigenous heritage values, which are not properly recognised as yet, are unquestioned. The real concern that the Democrats have, and we have voiced this repeatedly, is that those magnificent, quite unique and literally world-class environmental values are at risk. That is not because of the Wet Tropics Management Authority but because of the impossible situation, in many respects, that the authority has been put in and the lack of a genuine commitment, in some respects, by both state and federal governments to build on the foundation that the wet tropics World Heritage area provided.</para></talk.start><para>The idea of declaring an area World Heritage is not so that you can then say, `Well, that's itâit's all fixed. It's wonderful. Let's all just look at it and praise it forevermore.' You need to manage it, which is of course why there is a management authority, but it is a foundation to be built upon. It is also an area that needs to be protected from having those values degraded. Many of the values of the wet tropics area are at risk of degradation and the difficulties in the structure and funding of the Wet Tropics Management Authority exacerbate that situation. The Democrats make a strong call to the federal government that there is a need for extra resourcingâconsistent, permanent resourcingâof the Wet Tropics Management Authority to enable more coherent, long-term budgetary planning. </para><para>In recent years the authority has been funded through the Natural Heritage Trust and has had to apply annually for grants. The Natural Heritage Trust is spoken about a lot in various commentaries. It has quite a large amount of money and there are lots of assessments about how effectively or otherwise it has been spent, but I do not think anybody would think or suggest that it is appropriate for it to be used for the general annual funding of an authority that was already in place, like the Wet Tropics Management Authority. It makes it impossible for the authority to predict what its situation is going to be from year to year in terms of staffing and finances. It makes it impossible for it to do the sort of cohesive long-term planning that you need to do when you are managing and trying to enhance an area like the wet tropics World Heritage area. There is a clear need for the federal government to provide extra resources in this regard.</para><para>A specific part of the wet tropicsâits most well-known partâis the Daintree rainforest. It is a magnificent area. I thoroughly recommend anybody in Australia or around the world who has not visited it to do so. There is a lot of focus on forests and there is a lot of talk about forests in various parts of Australia, and that is as it should be. But there is an area of the Daintree rainforest that is not protected and that needs protecting, and the Democrats believe that we should not lose our focus on that fact. There are people, particularly local people, who are doing a lot of work to try to ensure that there is clear, solid, firm protection for many parts of the Daintree rainforest that are not contained within the World Heritage area. They need support and assistance, and they need acknowledgment. I would like to particularly acknowledge the work of the Douglas Shire Council, which has tried to do everything to ensure that pressures on this area are not such as to reduce and destroy the values of the Daintree rainforest. I believe the federal government can do a lot more to reinforce that. If we are spending money on the Wet Tropics Management Authorityâas we should beâwe have to make sure that the area that it is supposed to manage is literally able to be protected from destruction in the long term. So it is about getting value for the money that we are already putting in, and the federal government needs to do more. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>20208</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would also like to briefly make a comment on the report of the Wet Tropics Management Authority. Firstly, I congratulate the authority and its officers and employees on the great work that they do. It is not always an easy task, but the authority does a great job for the wet tropics and a great job for Far North Queens-land. The wet tropics are something that all Queenslanders are proud of, as we are of the Barrier Reef. We believe that a lot of credit comes to Queensland from the fact that the rainforest meets the reef and it is a huge attraction to tourists not only Australian but international.</para></talk.start><para>One of the things that I particularly appreciate about the approach of the authority these days, as opposed to the days when it was first formed under a previous government, is that it has now taken the attitude that although this is a very valuable resource it should be available for all Australians to have a look at, to experience and to feel. Unfortunately, under previous governments, it seemed content to lock it up and allow it to be accessed only by those who could tramp through the forest for three weeks at a time not having to bother about working or children wanting to come in and have a look. I do think the authority has done a great job in allowing all Australians to have a look at the very special forests that are up in Far North Queensland. </para><para>I note Senator Bartlett talked about extra resourcing. The Commonwealth makes a very valuable contribution to resourcing this authority and other environmental authorities. In fact, I think it is becoming increasingly well recognised that the Howard government is the most environmentally conscious government in Australia's history. I wonder why the Democrats and the Greens are not quite as shrill about calling upon state governments to support the management of many of the lands which they declare as reserves, usually just before an election, I might say. They get all the political kudos of declaring reserves and then do not put any resources into them. I am very critical of state governments who do that. I would ask that the Democrats might direct some of their energiesâI would not expect the Greens to, because they are a very left-wing party who always support Labor; the Democrats are more balancedâto putting some pressure on the state governments around Australia to properly resource the reserves that are created, as I say, usually before election time.</para><para>I also want to join with Senator Bartlett in congratulating other shires who are involved in the Wet Tropics Management Authority area, such as the Johnstone Shire Council and Councillor Barry Moyle, who is a very good mayor up that way and very environmentally conscious. I certainly wish him well in the local authority elections that are coming up very shortly. Similarly, Eacham is another very environmentally conscious shire that does a lot of very good work on its own behalf but also in conjunction with the authority, and Councillor Mary Lyle is a very good mayor up there. Whilst not actually in the Wet Tropics Management Authority area, Cairns City Council is certainly the centrepiece for that authority. The authority is of course situated in Cairns and I know does work very cooperatively with the Cairns City Council and the mayor, Kevin Byrne, in its operation. So I say congratulations to all those involved; it is another good report and a year of good achievement from that authority.</para><para>Debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Great Barrier Reef Marine Park           Authority</title><page.no>20209</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Consideration resumed from 30 October 2003.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>20209</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para></motion><para>The area of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is one that I take every opportunity to highlight, partly because it is a magnificent asset to my home state of Queenslandâa place with extraordinary and unique environmental valuesâand partly because it is of enormous economic value to the people of Queensland. It is an areaâto repeat somewhat the theme of what I said on the wet tropicsâthat really suffers from under-resourcing.</para><para>As this report shows, the total budget for the authority for the last financial year was around about $31 million. That might sound like a lot perhaps but, if you think about how large the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park area is and the enormous amount of use that it is put to, you will see it is not just an empty, large area. It has an enormous amount of boat traffic through it, from huge oil tankers to the smallest tinnie with an outboard motor. There are all sorts of fishing pressures: risks of illegal fishing, the crown-of-thorns starfish, coral bleaching and the quality of the water that flows into the marine park from the mainland. We have tourism usages of all sorts. It is an area that is huge in size and quite significant in terms of the various challenges involved in maintaining its ecological values whilst enabling adequate and appropriate access and use by all parts of the community. </para><para>It is of course a World Heritage area and, towards the end of last year, it was significantly and comprehensively rezoned. It will probably sound as if I am saying this because of the comments Senator Macdonald made but I was about to note that the contributions made by the Queensland government to the Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority are in my view far too small. Fifty-two per cent of funding comes straight from the Commonwealth department plus another 70 per cent from a special appropriation of the Commonwealth. Only 13 per cent comes from the Queensland government. I think that is a sign of the lack of seriousness of the Queensland government about this.</para><para>I must say that in many respects the attitude of the Queensland Labor government towards many of the issues to do with the Barrier Reef have not been terribly impressive on the environmental side of things. I do not know if the Queensland Liberals, particularly in the Far North of Queensland, want to be adjudged as more environmentally attuned towards the Barrier Reef Marine Park than the state Labor government, but there is no doubt that in terms of that rezoning they demonstrated that. I know there was some internal opposition within the federal Liberals from those who wanted to back the commercial fishing lobbyists so they would be able to continue to do as they wishedâand I am not dismissing the fact that there is an impact on those families and businessesâbut the fact is that, in terms of economic value, over 90 per cent of the jobs generated by the marine park are in the tourism and related industries. Less than five per cent are from the fishing industry. By allowing inappropriate fishing in inappropriate areas you put at risk the whole tourism potential of the marine park. So the economics are pretty clear in relation to that.</para><para>But it should be noted that, whilst the Democrats are not 100 per cent happy with every aspect of the rezoning that occurred towards the end of last year, it is a huge leap in the amount of protection for most parts of the marine parkâfrom less than five per cent as fully protected areas up to over 30 per cent. That cannot be ignored as a very significant achievement. Credit must go to the authority and its chair, Virginia Chadwick, in particular for going through what was a very arduous process. There is a range of issues that need more attention in relation to the marine park, not least of which is resourcing, particularly now that there is a larger number of protected areas to oversee and manage. I cannot talk about them in the time available to me tonight; therefore, I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>20210</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI join with Senator Bartlett in congratulating the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority on a very significant and successful year. I am delighted with the work they have done. I do not always agree 100 per cent with everything they decide, but they have done a fabulous job this last year in very difficult circumstances in addressing the reef plan and the rezoning of the Great Barrier Reef. It has been a year of enormous activity by the authority. I know that not only the board members but also very importantly and very obviously the staff have been involved in an enormous amount of consultations, work, meetings, travelling, submissions, more consultations, preparing plans and again more consultationsâsome of them very difficult consultationsâand I know a lot of the staff have attended public meetings, which have got quite heated over certain aspects of the rezoning, but through all of it the staff have been polite and very able public servants in the real sense of the term. I believe they have done a fabulous job. </para></talk.start><para>I pay particular credit to the Hon. Virginia Chadwick, the chair of the authority. She has really excelled in this capacity. I know she has a very distinguished public record in many fields, but she will certainly go down in the annals of the Barrier Reef as one of its great champions. All credit to her for the work she has achieved as chair of the board. I also want to pay tribute to the board generally, particularly Fay Barker, one of the members of the board, who I know has been a great advocate for the marine park and everything it does and who has worked very cooperatively, ably and enthusiastically with other members of the board to achieve their aims. I will also mention John Tanzer, the CEO of the authority, and all of his staff, who of course I cannot mention individually but they all deserve recognition for their ability, for the enthusiasm with which they have undertaken their work and for the great science and learning they have brought to many things they do. I hasten to add, as I said before, that I do not always agree with the outcomes or conclusions they have come to, but certainly they have been very diligent in the work they have done in this past year in very difficult circumstances.</para><para>Senator Bartlett mentioned the crown-of-thorns starfish and how that certainly is a problem. I was delighted just last week to announce at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority headquarters a further Commonwealth government investment into the crown-of-thorns starfish elimination program of an additional $500,000. Both the Queensland government and the Commonwealth government had sometime last year committed $1.5 million to this project to send divers down to take off crown-of-thorns starfish. Mr Beattie made his announcement with an election in mind, as he usually does, with great fanfare about how great an environmentalist he was.

The area of refugee decision making is one that has been very contentious and very much debated in this chamber and outside in the community, and the Democrats have played a central role in that debate. The reason I am speaking to these two reports together demonstrates the quite extraordinary disparity between the outcomes from the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal. I should note for those of you that are not aware of it that the principal member of these two tribunals is the same person, Mr Steve Karas. It is not as if they have totally different regimes or a totally different culture that might explain this discrepancy.</para><para>The Migration Review Tribunal report looks at the number of decisions finalised in the last financial yearâ9,714, a pretty big sample. Out of those, 43 per cent of all cases were set aside. That means that 43 per cent of all appeals to the Migration Review Tribunal had an outcome different from the original decision made by the immigration department. That is a pretty big figure, I would suggest. That indicates to me that there is a lot of sloppy decision making being made at the primary level, the departmental level, that people have to try to get fixed up at the tribunal level. That is not good enough. It is particularly not good enough when people have to run the risk of paying a $1,400 fee to get that decision reviewed, and it is particularly not good enough when, as this report shows, the average time for reviewing those cases is pretty much right on a yearâ362 days. That is down a little bit from the year beforeâand I suppose this a plusâbut the time taken from lodgment to finalisation is 362 days. Over 4,000 people in the last financial year on average had to wait a year and had to run the risk of a $1,400 fee to get the right decision on a migration area. </para><para>In some areas it is worse. The worst area is visa refusal for partners where 63 per cent of decisions were overturned. In the area of visitor visas, 64 per cent of decisions were overturned. They are only the people, remember, that took the trouble to appeal. When you are talking about visitor visasâsome of the ones I deal withâpeople have applied to come to the country to go to a funeral or a family wedding or to a particular event. By the time they have appealed the event is over. I had a well-known case of the person who set himself on fire at the front of Parliament House. That was in relation to his refugee situation and his not being able to have his family join him. His daughter applied to come here simply for the anniversary of his death. I sponsored her to come here, guaranteeing that she would hold to the conditions of her visa and leave, and her visa was still refused by the department. There was no point in her appealing. It would have taken so long that the anniversary would have been over. That is just not satisfactory.</para><para>What is even more ironic and quite curious when you look at the Refugee Review Tribunal report is the set aside rate of 5.7 per cent. Why is it that all the decision makers in the migration department on all other visa areas get it wrong 43 per cent of the time but suddenly in the refugee area there is a massive improvement in their skill and ability and they only get it wrong less than six per cent of the time? There are the same big numbers. There were 6,200 decisions finalised in that year. I would love to see the explanation for that. Are there a huge number of skilled people just in the refugee area and not in the rest? If it is trueâand I would wonderâthat would suggest to me that there is a misdirection of resources. Whilst refugees might be the political priority, the number of applications per year is quite small, I would suggest under 10,000, although I stand to be correctedâthere are probably fewer than that. The number of visa applications in other areas would be in the millions. We should be fixing all these geniuses in the refugee assessment and moving them across to all the other visas, because that is where the mistakes are. It is very hard to think it is not political pressure and lack of independence in the Refugee Review Tribunal that makes people less keen on overturning those primary decisions, particularly when it has gone down from 12 per cent in 2001-02 to less than six per cent. Suddenly the department's primary decision makers have got twice as good in this area. I find that hard to believe because there has been no shift in all the other visa areasâ44 per cent set aside to 43 per cent. It is very curious and very hard to explain. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Department of Finance and                  Administration</title><page.no>20213</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Consideration resumed from 4 December 2003.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>20213</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para></motion><para>I note this document relating to former parliamentarians' travel paid by the Department of Finance and Administration for last year in the context of the current debate about parliamentarians' entitlements. Obviously, parliamentarians' travel, which is covered in another document from the Department of Finance and Administration that has also been tabled, is an area of significant public expenditure. It is one that the Democrats have focused on from time to time as needing greater scrutiny. In significant part, it is because of the pressure applied by the Democrats that we have material such as this now tabled for the public to see the detail of the expenditure of all our travel. I say that as someone who is, I think, reasonably high up in terms of expenditure on travel last year, so it is not something I am trying to hide.</para><para>I note the issue in relation to former parliamentarians' travel and the gold cardâthe gold card being, in this context, a right for ongoing travel by former parliamentarians after a certain number of years of service. I think it is 20 years service for general MPs, fewer years of service if they have been ministers and fewer again if they have been a prime minister. This is an area of entitlement the Democrats believe should be curtailed as well. We do not begrudge some degree of assistance for former parliamentarians, and there has been some movement in this regard, but we believe that more should be done in relation to that.</para><para>The broader issue of parliamentarians' entitlements is one that has been focused on this week. I must take this opportunity to say that the Democrats are surprised but pleased with the Prime Minister's rather unexpected announcement less than an hour ago, I think, that the government would be legislating to wind up the federal parliamentarians superannuation scheme and replacing it with a contributory scheme of nine per cent, bringing it into line with that for many other Australians. Out of all parliamentarians' entitlements, there is little doubt that parliamentarians' superannuation is the one that has stuck in the craw, and still sticks in the craw, of the public more than anything else because it is so removed from the entitlements and general community standards that everybody else gets in relation to superannuation. It is also a problem in a purely economic sense in being unfunded and in that sense, as well, it is a welcome shift. </para><para>The Democrats started this week by writing to Mr Latham, the opposition leader, congratulating him on his announcement of proposing to do the same thing after the next election. We suggested to him that he should immediately move such legislation in the Senate and that the Democrats would guarantee we would support giving it priority for debate so that it could be passed by the Senate. That, I assessed at the time, would then put very strong pressure on the Prime Minister to agree to pass it through the House of Representatives. Within the space of a day, Mr Latham made his broader, more specific, announcement, which we welcomed, and I again urged him to bring it on for debate in the Senate before the election rather than waiting until after the election in the hope that he winsâand we would hope that he kept his promise. It is interesting to see that the Prime Minister has now decided to do thatâto commit to legislate now before the election. The Democrats' support for Mr Latham to do that obviously extends to the Prime Minister to do the same thing.</para><para>That is a very positive development and shows that, if it had been passed by the Senate, the Prime Minister would have found it impossible to resist the pressure. He has obviously found just a few days of public pressure on this issue impossible following Mr Latham's initiative, to bow to it before legislation had even been passed by the Senate. That is a good sign. It is a good sign about leadership in general. The Democrats have been pushing for this for years. We needed a major party leader to show leadership on it, and the pressure that that has caused has caused a shift in the Prime Minister, and that is a great thing. It should be acknowledged all around.</para><para>I think it is also important to emphasise that yesterday person after personâI think all of them were Liberal parliamentariansâwas saying, `Politicians aren't paid enough; what are you talking about?' I think that probably stuck in the craw even more, with people saying, `Don't these guys get it?' So I am pleased to see that the Prime Minister as got itâat least in relation to superannuation. That is only one part of the entitlements. There are other issues for debate, and the Democrats look forward to movement in those areas as well. There are others issues and we will continue to raise them. Hopefully we can get more pressure through further debate leading up to the election. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women</title><page.no>20214</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 10 February, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stott Despoja</inline>:</para><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>20214</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âFinally, I would have to say, after asking for this document for 2Â½ or maybe three years at Senate estimates, we now have the government's response on how they are implementing the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, commonly known as CEDAW. This document is Australia's fourth and fifth report on that convention. Actually, it is not the fourth report or the fifth report because, in fact, this government is so far behind in reporting to the United Nations that they have combined the fourth and fifth reports. In fact, this government has not filed any report with the United Nations since 1997. </para></talk.start><para>In the introduction to this document I have in front of me, the government says that this combined fourth and fifth report takes into account the findings of the Commonwealth government's review of Australia's engagement in the UN treaty committee system. You might notice that some 18 months ago this government announced that it was going to undertake a review of the UN treaty system and this government's participation in it. I find it hard to believe that that is the reason this report has taken so long to be cobbled together and finally produced and tabled. In my reading of this report, I do not see anything that reflects the review of Australia's engagement in the United Nations committee system. I cannot see anything in here that would clearly give the international arena any suggestion that there is some link with the review of what they have done and what is in this report. It remains a mystery to me.</para><para>This report is fairly interesting for what it does not tell the Australian community, but more so the international community, about what is happening with women's affairs in this country. It is pretty much a <inline font-style="italic">Travels with my Aunt</inline> document, a fairly cursory glimpse at what this government has attempted to do. It goes into some detail about what the states and territories are doing but provides very little background detail about what this Commonwealth government is doing for women. Let us take an example. It talks about the Prime Minister's Partnerships Against Domestic Violence initiative, which it says has implemented a wide range of measures aimed at early intervention and preventionâand we all know thatâas well as improving and expanding services for victims, including children. I am not entirely aware that that is the case. My understanding is that Partnerships Against Domestic Violence is based on looking at best practice and best practice research.</para><para>This document does not tell the international community, for example, that this is the government that took $10 million out of the Partnerships Against Domestic Violence money to pay for their terrorist fridge magnet campaign last year. It does not tell the international community that that is the situation, that the government took money out of a bucket of funding targeted directly at preventing domestic violence and used it in its antiterror campaign and its scare campaign to boost its arguments in relation to national security. It took money away from preventing violence against women and children to pay for fridge magnets. It does not tell the international community that it pulled the plug on another phase of its domestic violence program prior to Christmas, a program and an advertising campaign that was aimed at preventing verbal abuse. It does not tell the international community that that is what it has done with its domestic violence programs.</para><para>There is very little time tonight to go into all the details of this documentâwhich is why I would seek leave to continue my remarks laterâbut it is a travelogue, really. As I said, it does not tell the full picture of what this country has done to women's issues, it does not tell the full picture about the impact of this government's policies on women in this country and it fails to reveal the true story when it comes to what this government is doing. Changes to HREOC, for example, are not mentioned, yet the words `gender mainstreaming' are. An increase in the number of women in work is mentioned, but it fails to say that they are mainly in casual and part-time employment. But this report has finally been tabled and it is long overdue. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </para><para>Leave granted.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>20216</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to comment briefly on the report before the Senate, <inline font-style="italic">Women in Australia</inline>. This combined fourth and fifth report on the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women does provide comprehensive information on the status of women in Australia, their key achievements and the areas for improvement by all governmentsâincluding, I might add, the state and territory governments.</para></talk.start><para>It is worth noting the major advances in the status of women in Australia since the last progress report in 1995. There has been a general upward trend in women's participation in the labour force. Between March 1996 and December 2003, there was an 18.3 per cent increase in the total number of women employed. I will not claim that that is as a result of the election of the Howard government in 1996, but it does indeed show that the Howard government does support women in their achievements and goals.</para><para>In that same period, there has been a 380 per cent increase in new apprenticeships for women. That is not bad either; in fact, it is very good. In 1999, female graduates in medicine outnumbered male graduates for the first time. I think that is another great achievement. There has been a 50 per cent reduction in the number of deaths from cervical cancer in the last 10 years. Interestingly, in 2003 women held 34 per cent of Australian government board positions. I might add that the women in those positions get them on merit, not because of some sort of artificially imposed quota like the one that one political party in this chamber seems to have to rely upon. There is no concern about merit; it is in the quota so it has to be there.</para><para>I think it is important that the United Nations has acknowledged that Australia has an excellent record in providing comprehensive reports on the status of women, including Australia's reports on the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. I do not want to further delay the chamber today, but just in passing I want to mention an issue that I always think should be given greater publicity in Australiaâthat is, Australia's involvement in Afghanistan. It was opposed by many people, and I particularly remember the Greens ultra-left-wing party opposing it.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name></talker><para>âIf you say that, Senator Bartlett, I could agree with you. I seem to remember that some people in Australia did oppose it. But some people might remember the very repressive regime of the Taliban in Afghanistan towards women. Whilst people may argue about the purpose of entering into the conflict in Afghanistan, I for one always feel proud that Australia was part of the coalition of nations that was prepared to go in and get a better regime for the people of Afghanistan, but particularly for the women of Afghanistan. I think it is well documented how, under the Taliban regime, women in that country were very much second-class citizensâand perhaps even lower than that.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The treatment of women under the Taliban is something that should have been commented on before. The people you hear going on about women's issues in Australia regrettably seem to forget those sorts of things that this nation was part of overcoming in the change of regime in Afghanistan. It is occasionally worth while to reflect on how Australia's involvement in the conflict in Afghanistan made things much better for women in that country. That action for women never achieves the recognition that I think it perhaps should. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>20217</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am interested to have this matter remain on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice </inline><inline font-style="italic">Paper</inline>.

In its executive summary the committee admitted that it remained uneasy about the policy fundamentals of the government package. It said that the implicit message in the Medicare Plus package remains primarily that the role of Medicare is as a welfare system, not one giving equal benefits to all Australians irrespective of income. Considering the proposals for new safety nets, the committee first identified the underlying need for change to the current arrangements. It was made clear that, under existing arrangements, there is potential for out-of-pocket costs to mount up to levels which are unaffordable for many Australians.</para></talk.start><para>However, the safety net proposal before the Senate is a problem for a number of reasons, which I will outline. At a basic level, the separation of the proposed safety net into two thresholds creates a substantial divide in the health area. The universality of the Medicare program was to ensure that divides between the affluent and low-income earners would not be an issue in health care. The committee has concerns about this. It demonstrated those in outlining its recommendations on the safety nets listed in the bill. It is also evident that both the $500 and $1,000 thresholds are too high to deliver meaningful benefits to any more than a tiny handful of Australians each year. While the proposal certainly would benefit a few recipients, the safety net would do nothing for the majority of Australians.</para><para>The committee reported on the falling levels of bulk-billing and the rising gap charges and found that thresholds were set too high to effectively tackle the significant costs of accessing basic health care. The financial hardship faced by many Australians could mean a decrease in the number of people seeking medical assistance on non-urgent matters which may later become life threatening. This government refuses to acknowledge that many in the community are not as well off as some in here. These people are low-income earners with mortgages and families to care for. I quote from the report:</para><quote><para>The Committee ... finds that the two categories chosen by the government for receiving the lower thresholdâconcessional status or receipt of the Family Tax Benefit (A)âare each poor measures of need. In particular, too many working people on low incomes and chronically ill individuals have a struggle meeting health costs, but do not qualify for concession cards.</para></quote><para>To be clear about thisâand it is a little trickyâthe government has floated the idea of linking the lower thresholds to concessional status or receipt of family tax benefit A. What it has done in its proposal is link these to the family tax system. The government seeks to link a vital health issue to a system that failed many thousands of people last financial year. The government wants to link its threshold to a payment that has failed hundreds of thousands of Australians and forced them into waiting for tax time to retrieve a top-up payment. </para><para>In the government's wisdom, in proposing this method for lower thresholds it did not even stop to consider how flawed its family tax system is. Did it check with the Minister for Family and Community Services whether the system was good enough to base health care access on? I doubt it. Did it check the figures on how many people opted out of the family tax system because of the flaws, thus losing the valuable concession card the government wants to link the safety net to? I doubt it. The minister has said on many occasions that people who incur debts should overestimate their income and get a top-up at the end of the year. Did the government stop to consider that the advice given by its own ministers in relation to the family payment could raise a person's income above the low threshold it has proposed? I doubt it.</para><para>The alternative suggested by the minister was to wait until tax time to get a lump sum, rather than trust the system to work with fluctuations in the income. You would have to say that that in itself is absurd. Why should members of the community have to wait until the end of the financial year to seek assistance under the lower threshold because they may earn a few extra dollars? Do we trust something as vital as our health care to a system that is fundamentally flawed? I do not think we should have that link and it seems that the committee agreed with me on that point.</para><para>A further problem with the proposed link is discrimination against those with dependent children. The flip side of the family tax benefit A income thresholds for those with dependent children is the very low cut-off levels for those without children. A single person without children would endure the $1,000 threshold on an income of less than one-quarter that of their neighbour on $80,000. This means that a low-income single person with a chronic illness who remains in the work force would have to spend $1,000 in order to receive assistance with health care, as I understand it. As well as being patently unfair and discriminatory against single people, this deepens the poverty trap for many Australians. It is a shame that the government could not turn its mind to restructuring and increasing the bulk-billing rates and to doing far more than simply pursuing the bill and using the report to highlight from the government side some of the things it thinks will work. I have tried to demonstrate here this evening that it will not work, that the government's model is flawed and that it should be abandoned.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title> Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade     References Committee</title><page.no>20220</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title> Report</title><page.no>20220</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 27 November, on motion by<inline font-weight="bold"> Senator Cook</inline>:</para><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the report.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>20220</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak about this particular issue because it gives me an opportunity to address the issue of sugar being left out of the free trade agreement. In the report of November 2003, <inline font-style="italic">Voting on trade</inline><inline font-style="italic">: The General Agreement on Trade in Services and an Australia-US free trade agreement</inline>, brought down by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee, the issue of what would happen in the free trade negotiations was canvassed at length. Before I make a few comments on the outcome of those negotiations, it is worth while looking at what was put before the committee and what appeared in its report, which was obviously ahead of the conclusion of the negotiations. At page 136 of the report the committee noted:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The Committee sought to determine a clear sense of the position of Australia's major agricultural interests with respect to the US FTA. The following is typical of the quite categorical views that were expressed: </para></quote><para>And the quote in the body of the document reads:</para><quote><para>The National Farmers Federation will support the negotiation of a US FTA, on the condition that agriculture is at the heart of the negotiations and the final agreement. What does at the heart mean; what are we seeking? [T]he US is an important market, but we do face several restrictions into the US for several of our commodities. The NFF seeks the elimination of tariffs and tariff rate quotas on agricultural exports to the United States. We seek this elimination upfront when the agreement is signed not subject to long time lines.</para></quote><para>Of course, that was said well in advance of the negotiations and, of course, the government were aware of the NFF view. What they put to the committee, and what ultimately has come out, was not delivered as part of the negotiations. But one should look further at what was said by Australia's lead negotiator, Mr Deady, who I understand performed that role before the negotiations were taken over by the minister himself. On page 136 it is recorded that Mr Deady said to the committee:</para><quote><para>We need a significant, immediate improvement in access into that market and we need to be looking at the elimination of all border protections, tariffs and quotas on Australian exports of agricultural exports into the United States. That package has to include those elements: significant and immediate improvements in the transparent process leading to the full elimination of tariffs and other quotas on agricultural products into the US market.</para></quote><para>So it was to include all agricultural products. Nothing was excluded. If one looks at the back of the report one can see that we went to the Australian objectives, which are listed in appendix 3. It is made quite clear at the second dot point under the heading `Trade in industrial goods and agriculture' on page 168, which said:</para><quote><para>Seek the removal of tariff rate quota restrictions on Australian exports to the United States, including those affecting exports of beef, dairy products, sugar, peanuts and cotton.</para></quote><para>So the list was quite specific. If it had not been quite as specific, one would not have thought that sugar would have been a problem. But my particular complaint about what has happened, without going into the whole of the agreement, which we have not had the ability to canvass at this stage, is in relation to sugar. Last week in Queensland we had an election. Of course, the vote in the sugar seats was very important indeed. I happened to be in the federal seat of Hinkler, which encompasses the Queensland seats of Bundaberg and Burnett.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name></talker><para>âYou didn't do very well.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name></talker><para>âWe won Bundaberg, Minister, you might note.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name></talker><para>âYou lost Burnett.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name></talker><para>âWe lost the seat of Burnett. It would have been good if the federal government had been honest about where things were with sugar and if they had been up-front with the electors in Queensland, particularly those sugar cane growers, such that they could have made up their minds in the full knowledge of what was happening in the FTA. But of course that did not happen. Silence prevailed over the fate of sugar in the FTA. Contrast that with what was being said throughout the period of the negotiations. For example, early on in the process Minister Vaile told the Channel Nine <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline> program, on 16 March last year:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>Some might term it a `free-er' trade deal, that's on its way to a free trade agreement. Of course we're going to pursue as much liberalisation as we can, and as I say, it may be progressively introduced. We've seen that in other negotiations, but we need all sectors addressed, and we need to be moving ahead in all sectors. </para></quote><para>It is worth repeating Minister Vaile's last comment:</para><quote><para>... we need all sectors addressed, and we need to be moving ahead in all sectors.</para></quote><para>On Australia Day this year Minister Vaile, from Washington, appeared on the Channel 9 <inline font-style="italic">Today </inline>show. Minister Vaile said:</para><quote><para>Well I suppose it's fair to say that these talks are now reaching the final stages. To put it in cricketing terms, we're probably in the 50th over of a One Day Match or the ninth innings of a baseball game. They go like this and it gets toughest at the end. We've continued to say that this deal must be comprehensive to be acceptable. It must include agriculture and sugar must be part of the deal.</para></quote><para>There was clearly no doubt in what Minister Vaile was saying as late as Australia Day this year: sugar had to be part of the deal on agriculture. If it was not to be part of the deal then those voters in the state of Queensland should have been apprised of the situation prior to them casting their vote last Saturday. But they were not. Again we saw this government in its mean, sneaky and tricky mode. They were not telling people the facts of what was going on.</para><para>For the coalition and particularly their partners, The Nationals, last week in Queensland, it may have served their purposes well in the short term. But in the long-term the loss will be that they will not be believed when the federal election comes around. Of course that is good for Labor. Clearly the sugar industry had been reassured that they would not be left out of the FTA with the US, but they were. The reaction, as expressed by some of the cane growers, came out in the <inline font-style="italic">Bundaberg News-Mail</inline> on 10 February after the Queensland election and after the announcement that sugar had been excluded from the FTA. What do we find? The heading on that day in the <inline font-style="italic">Bundaberg News-Mail </inline>says `FTA deal leaves growers angry'. The first couple of paragraphs make interesting reading indeed:</para><quote><para>BUNDABERG district cane growers are predicting a backlash against the federal government after sugar was excluded from a Free Trade Agreement with the US yesterday. </para><para>Canegrowers Isis chairman Joe Russo said he had been fielding calls all day from stunned and angered growers.</para></quote><para>So they were both stunned and angered. They had an expectation that sugar was going to be delivered in the FTA. He says:</para><quote><para>âFor the last fortnight they have said sugar was going to stay on the table,â Mr Russo said.</para></quote><para>So they felt abandoned by the coalition, who had assured them over a long period of time that sugar was to be included. Then this article goes on to an analysis, which says:</para><quote><para>National's Member for Hinkler Paul Neville said he disagreed with colleague De-Anne Kelly, who warned the decision could mean she lost her seat of Dawson at the federal election. </para><para>âI don't think my seat is at risk because I'm going to fight for the cane growers as I always have,â he said. </para><para>Mr Neville said the decision made him more committed to getting a better deal for the sugar industry from the government. </para></quote><para>Mr Neville, that is a very poor statement indeed, because you and your government clearly deserted the sugar people in the seat of Hinkler, and clearly they will take their revenge on you when the time comes.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>20222</page.no><name role="metadata">Marshall, Sen Gavin</name><name role="display">Senator MARSHALL</name><name.id>00AOP</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI also rise to speak on this report, <inline font-style="italic">Voting on trade: the General Agreement on Trade in Services and an Australia-US free trade agreement</inline>, tabled by the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee. I should say at the outset that in my relatively short time in the Senate I have been constantly amazed at the incredible talent and support of the secretarial staff of the Senate committee structure in assisting the senators in putting together these reports. I certainly want to thank all of the secretariat, in particular Brenton Holmes and Saxon Patience, for their very good work in the final preparation of this report. The report went to the free trade agreement with the United States. In some respects it was a very difficult report to write because we were actually inquiring into something that had not yet taken place. It has now taken place and we have seen the debate really pick up this week. I think the report has given those members of the committee a very good grounding to participate in this debate in a very constructive way.  </para></talk.start><para>The debate so far in the Senate has really been around what our access has been into the United States. Clearly, from what we understandâeven though we have not seen the final text of the agreement; we have not seen the black letter of itâthere have been some gains. Certainly those of us on this side of the house welcome those. I am rather concerned that the beef arrangement has institutionalised a quota and tariff system for the next 18 years. Even at the conclusion of 18 years, if the price of beef in the US drops by a mere six-odd per cent, tariffs and quotas will be reintroduced. This is not free trade. This is not a free trade agreement. While again I accept there have been some gains, there are also some very large disappointments in this agreement. At the end of the debate it will be a matter of balanceâthat is clear. We will not be able to determine that balance until this report is examined by the select committee set up by the Senate to do that task. The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties will also do an investigation into the report.</para><para>The other point which has not been talked about, as I pointed out earlier, is that trade is a two-way street. There has been very little debate about access to our markets from the US. In particular something that concerns me is manufacturing, being from Victoria, which is the heart of the manufacturing base of this country. I just want to quote the summary of the agreement from the Office of the United States Trade Representative with respect to manufacturing. They say:</para><quote><para>This is the most significant immediate reduction of industrial tariffs ever achieved in a U.S. FTA, and will provide benefits for America's manufacturing workers and companies. U.S. manufacturers estimate that the elimination of tariffs could result in $2 billion per yearâ</para></quote><para>that is US dollarsâ</para><quote><para>in increased U.S. exports of manufactured goods. There will be immediate benefits for such key U.S. manufacturing sectors as: </para><para>--Autos and auto parts -- Chemicals, plastics, and soda ash -- Construction equipment -- Electrical equipment and appliances -- Fabricated metal products -- Furniture and fixtures -- Information technology products -- Medical and scientific equipment -- Non-electrical machinery -- Paper and wood products.</para></quote><para>All of those industries already exist in Victoria so when the US has $US2 billion worth of importsâthat is their predictionâa lot of those will come into Victoria and compete with Victorian and other Australian industry and jobs. Where is the econometric modelling to determine what impact those imports from the US into Australia will have on our industries, on our jobs and on the regions where a lot of these industries are based? There has been none, and that is part of the mix that has to be in the balance. We have to look at these things in their totality.</para><para>There is another area, which is a procedural process of these agreements, which has not been raised in the debate. I have not got time to go into all the matters that concern me. I am sure we will be doing that over the coming months in this debate on trade, which is going to be with us for some time. This US free trade agreement has been developed on what we know as the negative list approach. Under an agreement using the negative list approach all trade in services and investment is regarded as automatically free apart from any items that are specifically excluded from liberalisationâthat is the negative list. Governments normally achieve this exclusion by taking out reservations with respect to certain services, thereby retaining their right to regulate or amend policies regarding those services into the future. These reservations are normally spelled out in annexes to the main agreement. </para><para>One annex will be a standstill, where we have a measure that is inconsistent with our obligations under a free trade agreement but where we effectively agree to be bound. We agree not to make that measure any more inconsistent and have it become any more trade restrictive than at the date of entry into force of the negotiations. So arrangements we have in place stand still but we cannot increase any protection, government subsidy or industry assistance. That is the value of those bindings.</para><para>Another annex to the negative list allows us to carve out whole sectors from the obligations in those two chapters of services and investment. That means the government maintains full flexibility to introduce new and more restrictive measures in relation to those sectors. Unless these sectors are carved out at the time of negotiating the agreement, there is no further opportunity to add to the list. So if you do not get it right and if you do not include those areas you want carved out, under the negative list approach you cannot add later. Again, until we see the detail we do not know what the government has carved out in the negative list.</para><para>I certainly agree that a negative list approach is inherently more liberalising, and acknowledge the use of annexes to reserve or carve out certain specific services from the universal coverage of the agreement. However, it is the very universality of the agreementâcovering present and yet-to-emerge services, and binding governments into the futureâthat is, in my view, very problematic. The primary problem with a negative list approach is that all future services that have not yet been createdâhave not been developed, or have not yet evolvedâare automatically liberalised with a negative list approach. I find it difficult to understand the logic of precluding the regulatory options of future governments for future services whose dynamics and needs are not yet known. At least with a positive list approach, whilst there may well be some arguments about what should and should not be included on the list, you are not foreclosing the future for future regulatory needs in the interests of our community.</para><para>The other problem with a negative list approach is that with your existing service sector you have one opportunity to get it rightâthe first timeâin deciding what provisions need to go in that annex that retain the ability to introduce new trade restrictive measures, and what sectors need to go in the annex that only allow you to maintain your existing trade restrictive measures. They are the two concerns I have with that structure.</para><para>The negative list approach raises several issues of accountability and responsibility that must be weighed against the argument for the inherently liberalising effect of the negative list. As parliamentarians we have a special duty of care under these circumstances. We have a responsibility to the citizens that we currently represent to ensure that any commitments undertaken serve our constituents' economic and social interests. We also owe a duty of care to future generations who may have to live with the adverse consequences flowing from commitments made. </para><para>For example, an agreement struck some years ago without foreknowledge of the advent of the Internet, may have led to commitments in electronic communications that prevented later governments regulating to control pornographic content on the Internet. Clearly, if this agreement was made 15 years ago, we would have been prohibited by that treaty from legislating for any trade restrictive matter to fulfil our social responsibilities to our constituents. Another good example is the trade in genetic materials. If we had made this agreement under the negative list only five years ago, before we understood stem cell research and trade in genetic materials, we would have been forbidden from restricting trade in those materials with the United States. We would not have been able to do that. </para><para>Parliamentarians of the future, too, will have to grapple with any issues that may arise if undertakings implied by the negative list approach deny them the capacity to regulate for desired social policy outcomes. Parliamentarians and ministers cannot see into the future. Therefore, the negative list, in my view, is a lazy and dangerous approach to trade agreements and trade negotiations and we abrogate our responsibility to our constituents by conceding a negative list approach. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration</title><page.no>20225</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following orders of the day relating to committee reports and government responses were considered:</para><quote><para>Corporations and Financial ServicesâJoint Statutory CommitteeâReportsâ</para><para>Money matters in the bush: Inquiry into the level of banking and financial services in rural, regional and remote areas of Australia </para><para>ATM fee structure</para><para>Motion of the chair of the committee (Senator Chapman) to take note of reports agreed to.</para><para>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References CommitteeâReportâThe (not quite) White Paper: Australia's foreign affairs and trade policy, Advancing the National Interest.

I have a great deal of time for the work of the Australian National Audit Office in the majority of its reports. I looked at this report in particular because it is a follow-up audit and it also follows on from investigations that have been made by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee of this parliament on at least two occasions. I happened to be a member of that committee back in June 1997 when the report of the committee about helping Australians abroad was brought down. It was a review of the Australian government's consular services, and I note that two of the people involved in that particular inquiryâSenator Forshaw, who was then the chair of the committee, and Senator Troeth, who was the deputy chairâhappen to be in the chamber now. That inquiry tackled some very difficult issues indeed and some real advances were made as a result of the report of that committee.</para><para>The ANAO has done an inquiry into consular services, and I am going to particularly look at the issue of travel advisories because that is so important to us in the post September 11 environment and also the post Bali environment. Travel advisories, on which so many Australians depend when they travel overseas, need to be accurate and to reflect the circumstances that may well face Australians when they travel. So the follow-up audit by the ANAO is welcome indeed. It should be pointed out that there is a current inquiry before the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee on the Bali experience and the travel advisories that existed at that time. That report is not due to be handed down yet but I am sure that it will further stimulate changes in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I think it is worth noting some of the things that appear about travel advisories in this ANAO report. On page 48 it states: </para><quote><para>The ANAO found that DFAT has substantially implemented part (a) of Recommendation 2.</para></quote><para>Recommendation 2 was:</para><quote><para>... that DFAT strengthen its management of travel advisories to ensure that it is able to provide adequate assurance that Australians are appropriately advised of travel risks by: </para><para>a) systematically applying procedures for assessing the need for travel advisories, and appropriately documenting the assessment; and</para><para>b) ensuring that travel warnings in travel advisories are highlighted, and their severity clearly explained.</para></quote><para>This might not have been such a concern a number of years ago, but with the advance of international terrorism, of course, this now weighs very much on the minds of people as they travel throughout the world. So the ANAO have found that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have substantially implemented recommendation 2. </para><para>In going through the report I note that travel advisories, which used to be reviewed at six-monthly intervals, have now been brought back to at least three-monthly intervals. I note later in the report that somewhere in the vicinity of 87 per cent of these reviews take place within the required three months, and that is a pleasing figure indeed. Only seven per cent were more than four months old and no travel advisories were more than seven weeks out of date, so that is a vast improvement even on what existed at the time of the 1997 inquiry. The ANAO further noted:</para><quote><para>... a sample of travel advisories ... found that, generally, the new procedures for review of travel advisories are followed and documented. There was also a higher level of interaction between posts and DFAT compared with the previous audit. Posts provide regular situation reports on local incidents and security concerns. A heightened level of liaison was also noticeable between DFAT and partner governments ...</para></quote><para>So the report confirms, not only in the minds of senators but also in the minds of the travelling public and the people of Australia, that the bodies that are in place, whether they be Senate review committees or the Australian National Audit Office, do have a function, do have a role and do ensure that, in this important area, things are on the improve, that there is a close scrutiny and that the Australian people are benefiting.</para><para>I am not saying by any stretch of the imagination that all is as one would totally like in the area of travel advisoriesâI would have to await the outcome of the current inquiry of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee post the Bali experienceâbut it does certainly give one a little bit of confidence reading this report, the follow-up report by the ANAO, that things are definitely improving. This is seen particularly at page 53, where at figure 4.5 the ANAO outline changes to the warning levels for travel advisories. It is interesting to note that the warning levels prior to June 2003 were four in number and were fairly constrained. I will go through these briefly. The first one was `Exercise care'. The second one was `Maintain a high level of personal security awareness'. The next one was `Consider deferring holiday or non-essential business travel'. The last was `Defer all travel'.</para><para>Post June 2003 that has been expanded by at least another three points. They are now: `Exercise good personal security awareness', `Be especially alert to their own security', `Exercise caution and be aware of developments that might affect their safety', `Exercise a high degree of (or âextremeâ) caution', `Defer all non-essential travel', `Defer (or avoid) all travel' and `Not to travel and, for Australians in country, to depart immediately by whatever means available'.</para><para>That might not seem a great deal but it certainly has highlighted the fact that the warnings that were available for travel advisories prior to June 2003 needed some upgrading. They have been upgraded, but you will find when you get further into the report that even those are not necessarily seen to be sufficient in themselves, because when they appear in travel advisories the language that ultimately is used can be a mix and match of all of the various warnings that are there. The ANAO calls for greater clarification and better use of clear language to ensure that routine travel information does not get mixed up with some of the important messages that are available in these travel advisories for Australians travelling overseas. I commend the report to the Senate and I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned. </para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration</title><page.no>20228</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following orders of the day relating to reports of the Auditor-General were considered:</para><quote><para>Auditor-GeneralâAudit report no. 10 of 2003-04âPerformance auditâAustralian Defence Force recruiting contract: Department of Defence.

The visit to Sri Lanka was the first official visit by an Australian parliamentary delegation for eight years. One of the focuses of that visit was on the progress of the peace process in Sri Lanka, which has been tumultuous. There is a lot of interest in Australia in that, because there are over 100,000 people from Sri Lanka currently in Australia. Tonight I wish to comment on several developments affecting the peace process since our visit.</para></talk.start><para>At the time of the visit, a cease-fire between the government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elamâoften referred to as LTTEâhad been holding for 19 months. This was the longest cease-fire in almost 20 years of conflict. The cease-fire had provided an important respite for the country and its people from the violence and security restrictions that had been the norm for the past 20 years. As a result of the peace process, the economy had improved significantly and a degree of normality had begun to return to the country.</para><para>The delegation discussed the peace process in a range of meetingsâwith the Prime Minister and other representatives of the government, representatives of the opposition, Tamil and Muslim groups, the military and civil society. We noted that the conflict in Sri Lanka reflected many longstanding and complex issues. It had continued for almost a generation, and many people in the country had little experience of a country at peace. There are a range of interests and many are mutually exclusive. The Sinhalese and Tamil communities are separated by language and, to an extent, geography. There are many and significant grievances on both sides, and there was considerable distrust.</para><para>The separatist insurgency, which began in 1983, has claimed more than 60,000 lives. The delegation recognised that, in this situation, it would be extremely difficult to advance the peace process, despite it being in the national interest and in the long-term interests of all parties. The peace process suffered a setback not long after our visit ended in November 2003, when President Ms Chandrika Kumaratunga sacked three cabinet ministers on the grounds that the government had jeopardised national security and took direct control of the defence, interior and information portfolios herself.</para><para>Under the Sri Lankan constitution, the president is the head of state, government, cabinet and the armed forces. The previous elections, in 2001, were marred by hundreds of incidents of violence. Many saw the results as an indication from the electorate of its desire for the two opposing parties to work cooperatively in the peace process. Certainly, many in the business community had wanted the two parties to find ways to work together. Sri Lanka has been in the invidious position whereby the president and the prime minister have actually come from opposing parties, making cohabitation almost impossible at times. The Tamil Tigers claim that the power struggle between the two has crippled the government and destabilised the peace process. Many observers believe that the peace process has been further jeopardised by the president's recent actions in dissolving parliament almost four years before the next general elections are due and calling a snap election, to be held on 2 April. The peace process and the country's economy are issues that are likely to dominate the election campaign. </para><para>It seems from the president's decision to call a snap election that she is confident of her party's success. She has, controversially, formed an alliance with former leftist revolutionaries from the JVP, the People's Liberation Front. It is expected that the new party, the United People's Freedom Front, will appeal to the nationalism of the majority Sinhala community by highlighting the failure of the LTTE to abide by the human rights clauses contained in the cease-fire agreement. If the present prime minister is returned, then it is likely that the power struggle with the president will continue. On the other hand, if the president wins there are deep concerns about the intrinsic differences between her party and her leftist allies over the peace process. In the past the JVP has criticised the role of the Norwegian mediators, as it is opposed to the devolution of power to the LTTE as a means of resolving the ethnic conflict. Added to this, the LTTE's past relationship with the president could only be described as hostile, evidenced by the assassination attempt in 1999 which resulted in the president losing sight from one eye.</para><para>A significant factor for the country has been the international community's pledge of funding of $US4.5 billion in loans and grants for Sri Lanka's reconstruction and development over the next four years. However, following the LTTE's suspension of its particular participation in peace talks with the government, aid funding largely stopped flowing to the country. This was a tragedy for the country and its people. There is, indeed, a compelling irrationality in the country. On the other hand, I must commend Australia for its continuing financial commitment despite what has happened. In light of the most recent events, there is now grave concern about the $US4.5 billion in foreign aid pledged. Much of the aid was conditional upon progress at the peace talks, which were due to resume in January 2004. There are fears also that the election campaign will reduce investor confidence. For example, on the first day of trading following the announcement of the election, the Colombo stock exchange dropped in value by over 10 per cent.</para><para>Australia has listed the LTTE as a terrorist organisation whose assets in Australia can be seized. Australia has not considered softening its position. I believe that all responsible senators and others would urge the LTTE to return to the negotiating table to resume the peace talks and to do so in a spirit of concession and compromise. The people on the ground in the north-east have very real needs, and aid funding needs to begin to flow now. In its report, the delegation urges the government and the opposition of Sri Lanka to work together constructively for the good of the country and its people. Despite their many differences, the fundamental positions of the two major political parties on the way forward for peace appear somewhat similar. </para><para>A secondary focus of our visit related to economic issues including opportunities for increased trade and investment for Australia. We also visited and assessed the performance of projects funded under Australia's aid program, which were indeed very significant. A visitor to Sri Lanka is struck by an impression of a country to an extent frozen in time. Sri Lanka's economy has largely been static for the past 20 years or so. If the cease-fire continues and if the LTTE returns to the peace talks, enabling major aid funding to begin to flow, the economy may be able to begin to take off. As a result, there are many potential opportunities for further expanding trade and investment links between Australia and Sri Lanka. However, without greater certainty about the prospects of peace and the continuation of the cease-fire, there are significant risks for foreign investment in Sri Lanka. The whole process is in limbo until the elections have been held.</para><para>The parliamentary delegation visited the Jaffna peninsula, where we saw some of the worst of the conflict of the past. We saw the widespread destruction as a result of the conflict. There are many needs on the ground, not the least being those of the large numbers of people displaced by the conflict who have now returned to the peninsula. We visited aid projects in Jaffna that Australia funds. Australian development assistance to Sri Lanka in 2003-04 is estimated at $16.2 million. This represents a 50 per cent increase in Australian aid since the beginning of the peace process. In increasing its aid, Australia has recognised the important link between development and peace and the importance of rebuilding the country's north and east. The delegation noted that, unlike the large international donor pledges, Australia's aid is flowing to the country through NGOs and multilateral organisations. I wish to take this opportunity to pay tribute to all the great volunteers and workers who work for AusAID. These are the real unsung heroes of Australia. Australia's aid is making a real difference on the ground. I would also like to recognise the contribution made by the Asian Development Bank, which is also significant, particularly in opening up the highway between the north and the south. They used the expertise of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Arts: ScreenSound Australia</title><page.no>20230</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>20230</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is my pleasure tonight to address a very pressing and current issue not just for Canberra but for the nationâthat is, the future of ScreenSound Australia. Many already know that this is a world-class institution. The National Film and Sound Archive, or ScreenSound as it is now known, is one of the world leaders in collection management, particularly converged collection management, for both film and sound anywhere in the international scene. Its attributes and ability to lead by example indeed set it apart from many of the comparable institutions overseas.</para></talk.start><para>It was with great pleasure that Labor was able to announce its policy today relating to the future of ScreenSound in the context of ongoing attacks including an undermining by the Howard government of ScreenSound Australia through the proposed changes being managed by the Australian Film Commission. Labor announced today that a future Latham Labor government will establish the National Film and Sound Archive as a statutory authority to ensure that it remains a vital and independent part of Australia's cultural heritage.</para><para>Just to provide a bit of background, the Howard government effected the merger through legislation on 1 July 2003. The support of this parliament was forthcoming but it was conditional. Labor's support at the time was conditional upon the promises to preserve the independence, integrity and identity of ScreenSound Australia. However, following the merger we have seen a series of discussion papers and more recently a very controversial directions paper, released last December. There has been a great deal of uncertainty around the future of ScreenSound as a result of these attempts by the AFC to impose a restructure that went far further than the promises that we received at the time of the merger. Those promises were of a genuine partnership rather than one that was perceived very much as a hostile takeover by the Australian Film Commission of the National Film and Sound Archive, or ScreenSound. </para><para>One of the particularly important issues in relation to the discussion paper and the reason the controversy erupted was that there were several very specific problems with it. These problems included a number of positions being abolishedâfor example, the position of deputy director, collection and technical services and deputy director, corporate services and public programs. The position of a senior manager of sound was to be created in Melbourne and then other positions were to be created in Sydney. This meant that ScreenSound was going to be pulled apart. There was even an outrageous comment at the time that ScreenSound could somehow be more national if it had different operations in cities other than Canberra.</para><para>One of ScreenSound's greatest achievements is its ability to reach out into the community with its exhibitions, and it has been a flagship in demonstrating how not to wait for people to come to it as an institution but to put its collections out making them more accessible for Australians. The upshot of the directions paper and the recommendations it contained was that ScreenSound was to be cherry picked, if you like. Some of the good bits were to be moved to other major centres and the AFC would be able to exert complete control over the future direction of the institution and break it up in a way that they saw fit.</para><para>Needless to say the staff at ScreenSound at the time, with the support of their union, the CPSU, rallied strongly. It was the beginning of quite an extraordinary community campaign and not just here in Canberra where there are many people who have got to know the institution very well over a number of years. Right around the country and internationally people rallied to preserve the integrity, independence and identity of this wonderful institution.</para><para>The reason that this directions paper was such a breach of confidence and of trust between staff, stakeholders, the union, certainly the Labor opposition and everyone in this chamber who supported the merger on the back of those promises was the fact that the directions paper clearly articulated for the first time a breach of those promises. When the dispute erupted and the community rallied on 17 December last year, my Senate colleague Gary Humphries said, `It's okay. The jobs won't go; nothing will change.' Despite those assurances, the fact that this directions paper remains the core of the consultation that the AFC is continuing to conduct for ScreenSound tells me that there is still an agenda in play.</para><para>What we now know of course, if you look at the history of ScreenSound and the merger, is that it all stems back to the cultural institutions review initiated by the Howard government in 2002. On more than one occasion I have identified this particular review, which has remained secret and unscrutinised certainly by this parliament, as the essence of the war on culture that the Howard government is perpetrating in this country at the moment. ScreenSound is but one of many national cultural institutions that has been put under extreme pressure or have been subject to political interference. </para><para>The National Museum is a standout example of how the Howard government can combine both financial and budgetary pressure on an institution to get it to toe the line and indeed however it can combine that with political interference through the operation of the board, in my view. There is a fit there with this pressure and attack on our cultural institutions by the Howard government. I can only assume that it is really about the Howard government trying to exert the views of the Prime Minister about how Australian cultural history should be portrayed. It is absolutely outrageous that the Prime Minister of this country and the Howard government have taken this attitude. How dare any government interfere with the independence of our cultural institutions in representing Australia's cultural heritage? The people that run these institutions are there supposedly because they are the best of breed in their profession, because they have that experience and understand the sensitivities and importance of the work before them and they are doing that important work on behalf of all Australian citizens.</para><para>As the controversy has continued we have formally asked the minister to delete the aspects of the directions paper, subject to ongoing consultation, that propose breaking up ScreenSound. We are yet to receive advice from the minister. The Labor Party national conference, which was held in Sydney just recently, moved a very strong motion in defence of ScreenSound Australia and condemned the Howard government for their war on culture, which affects, as I said, not just ScreenSound but many other national institutions as well.</para><para>The preparation of our submission to the formal consultation process gave me an opportunity to contemplate whether there was a way out for the institutionâwhether there was a way forward in this merged environment in the context of the proposals in the directions paperâwhich caused me to speculate where the AFC could take it. The bottom line was that there was nowhere that the institution could go that preserved its integrity, its independence and its capacity to continue its fine work.</para><para>It is on that basis that Labor are very proud to pursue a policy of undoing that merger and of moving, if we are elected, to make that organisation a statutory authority. Stakeholder submissions for the consultations close next Monday, 16 February. I do urge anyone out there who is contemplating making a submission to do that. I am pleased to say that we have well over 1,000 signatures on a petition to save ScreenSound, which is due for tabling in the Senate at the earliest possible opportunity. All in all it is an extremely timely response to a significant challenge that Labor have put forward here. I would like to honour and acknowledge the role of the Archive Forum, which has been instrumental in garnering the depth of understanding that has inspired so many people's passionate protection of this institution. Labor are very pleased to be part of that campaign. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Australian Defence         Industries Site</title><page.no>20232</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>20232</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak about an issue that has existed for over a decade now in my state of New South Wales. It is an issue that surrounds the former Australian Defence Industries site in St Marys near Penrith. One of the parts of my role as a senator that I thoroughly enjoy is being able to work with community groups who are committed and passionate about achieving a particular objective. </para></talk.start><para>There is a tremendous group of people, which includes a whole range of different members of the community of Western Sydney, who for over a decade have been part of a strong community campaign to try to protect this land formerly owned by Australian Defence Industries from development and to preserve it for parkland for the people of Western Sydney. I have had the great fortune of being able to work with those people over many of those years and to be inspired by the passion and commitment that they have shown towards protecting this land for the people of Western Sydney. They have done the hard yards.</para><para>It has been a very different campaign to be involved in from some shorter campaigns that have occurred in the east of Sydney around the saving of White City, the tennis site, where there were a whole range of individuals who had the resources to access marketing firms and PR and to pour money into a campaign which was quickly resolved, and the site was saved. It is a very different scenario from that of the people in Penrith in Western Sydney around the St Marys site, who have struggled and done the hard yards for well over a decade in trying to protect this parkland for the people of Western Sydney.</para><para>It has been a long-running battle to save one of the last untouched areas of Sydney's wilderness. It was dealt a bitter blow just a couple of weeks ago by the federal government's decision to sell off the land at the rock-bottom price of $165 million. They sold this land to Lend Leaseâa private developer. If each of the 5,000 lots for housing on this land were sold at $250,000, which is a conservative estimate that has been supported by five local property valuers, this would deliver Lend Lease a windfall of $1 billion. This is a public asset owned by the community and held in trust by the federal government that, just a couple of weeks ago, was given away at the price of $165 million to Lend Lease, who have been regular corporate donors to the Liberal Party.</para><para>We are now seeing Lend Lease with just the ADI site looking at a $1 billion profit. For the $165 million that Lend Lease paid they did not just get the ADI site at St Marys near Penrith. They also got two industrial sites along the river in Melbourne near Maribyrnong. Just from the ADI site developments, based on a conservative estimate supported by five local property valuers, Lend Lease is looking to make a $1 billion windfall. That is an absolute mismanagement of a public asset held in trust for the people of Australia and the people of Western Sydney by the federal government. The community members who have been working on this campaign are driven by their passion for this area that is renowned not only for its enormous environmental values but also for the values that it provides for the people of Western Sydney.</para><para>The site is a biodiversity hotspot. It contains 110 bird species and more than 140 plant species, many of which are rare and found only in the ADI site and in the nearby Cumberland state recreation area. There are also seven distinct ecological communities that are found in the ADI site. It is one of the last remaining homes of the endangered golden bell frog and it contains the only wild emu and kangaroo populations in the Sydney basin. It is quite incredible. What other city of four million people has wild kangaroo and emu populations in an area of bushland, such as in this last remaining remnant of Cumberland woodlands? It is a piece of our heritage that tells us what the area of Sydney used to be like before the development of the urban city that we now live in. The National Parks and Wildlife Service calls it one of the `core biodiversity areas in Western Sydney'. The Australian Heritage Commission describes it as a priceless asset. In short, it is a Sydney icon, a time capsule of what Sydney was like prior to European settlement. </para><para>So how can the government justify selling off this priceless asset for a paltry $165 million, that is, $35,000 per lot? Was there a public tender process for the land? No. How many property evaluations of the land did the government get? Just one. The government sold the land, almost no questions asked, to its mate and regular Liberal Party donor Lend Lease. A litany of questions remains about the government's handling of the ADI development. Throughout the process, the government has thwarted attempts by the community to access details of the agreement with Lend Lease, at every point hiding behind commercial-in-confidence excuses. Just two months ago, in response to my question in the Senate about any indemnity arrangements between the Commonwealth and Lend Lease, Senator Minchin stood up in parliament and refused to release any details, claiming: `As soon as I have something that I can report both to the parliament and to the public, I will do so.' Given that the land was sold just a mere two months after Senator Minchin made this statement here in the chamber, the minister clearly possessed a great deal of knowledge and information about the sale. He was just not prepared to put it on the public record for the Senate and the Australian community to see.</para><para>This disregard for the rights of the community to have their say on the disposal of the ADI site is characteristic of this government's approach. The federal member for Lindsay, Jackie Kelly MP, has long tried to hedge her bets on this particular development at ADI. In 2001 she assured the residents of Western Sydney that she would ask cabinet to stop the development. We can all now see how well that went. She also promised to protect all 900 hectares of the National Estate listed land that remains on the site. Another undertaking that has failed!</para><para>In a recent press release Senator Minchin said that the sale `represents a very good outcome for the people of Western Sydney'. I do not know how much Senator Minchin knows about the people of Western Sydney but, having worked as a community worker in that area, I would like to ask Senator Minchin just exactly how much of the $165 million the government got for this sale is going to be returned to the people of Western Sydney in the form of infrastructure? I think that we will find the answer to that question is a big zero. None of that money is being returned to the people of Western Sydney and yet their priceless land and asset is being taken away from them. People would throw their hands up in horror at the thought of Centennial Park or the Sydney Harbour foreshore being sold off to private developers. But yet the ADI site is just as valuable as these other Sydney institutions. Conservative valuations aside, in an area that is already feeling enormous pressure from housing density, the open space that the ADI site provides is desperately needed in Western Sydney.</para><para>We know that the Liberal Party has been prepared to sell out the people of Western Sydney when it comes to this particular development. What about the position of the opposition? Mr Latham seems also to be hedging his bets on the issue. In a recent interview he said that the $165 million price tag seemed a `bit skinny'. He also described the lack of the tender process for the land as `sinister'. Yet his reservations about the development do not seem to be shared by Labor Party friends in local and state government. Decisions have been made recently by Blacktown Council and decisions have consistently been made by the New South Wales government not to protect this priceless piece of land and the wild kangaroo and emu populations that exist on it. Mr Latham needs to come out and be clear about the position of Labor on this land. Will they join the Greens in calling for the site to be saved or will they join the Liberal Party and local and state Labor governments in selling off this asset of the people of Western Sydney? </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Wool Innovation</title><page.no>20235</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>20235</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator FERRIS</name><name.id>5L6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âEarlier today the Chair of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, Senator Heffernan, tabled our committee's report into the Australian Wool Innovation inquiry. The inquiry was established last year to look at the administration and operation of AWI's statutory funding agreement and the expenditure of funds paid to AWI under that agreement. This inquiry has been long and complex. The committee had hoped to table the report late last year but unfortunately, as a result of the intricate nature of some of the issues that were raised during the inquiry, the tabling was delayed until today. The committee took the view at the time that it was more important to take that extra time to ensure that the inquiry comprehensively dealt with the matters before it, and there is no doubt that the report tabled this afternoon does just that.</para></talk.start><para>I said in this place in September last year that during the course of this inquiry I had seen evidence of one of the greatest abuses of corporate power by the former management of AWI. With the report having been tabled today, I can sadly say that I was correct in making that statement last September. The former managing director of AWI, Mr Colin Dorber, seriously abused the power given to him when the former board of AWI appointed him and he was responsible for the extensive misuse of wool growers' money throughout his tenure as managing director. It was at a time when the Australian wool growers were suffering through the worst drought in a hundred years.</para><para>AWI was created as a subsidiary of Australian Wool Services on 1 January 2001 following the privatisation of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation. On 30 April 2002 AWI demerged from AWS and since 1 May 2002 it has operated as an independent company. A statutory funding agreement was entered into between AWI and the government that established the funding model for AWI and also set out the way in which AWI could spend wool growers' money. At the time the wool tax, which had previously been collected by the Taxation Office, was replaced by a wool levy collected by AFFA and remitted to AWI. This wool levy is compulsory, enforced by Commonwealth law, and stands at two per cent of wool growers' gross value of production. Under the statutory funding agreement AWI was funded by the wool levy and matching federal funds.</para><para>It was not long after the establishment of AWI that problems started to emerge. One of the earliest signs was the resignation from the board in June 2002 by Professor Andrew Vizard, who said at the time that he held serious concerns about the corporate governance practices of the AWI board. Another warning sign was the announcement by Mr Dorber of a donation by AWI of half a million dollars to the Farmhand appeal in October 2002. The Red Cross later refunded this money when it was found that the donation may breach the statutory funding agreement.</para><para>Evidence provided to the committee's inquiry revealed a series of expenditures by AWI and corporate practices that breached both the statutory funding agreement and accepted standards of corporate governance that are required under the Corporations Law. The report's executive summary says: </para><quote><para>A number of transactions in 2002, particularly in the second half of 2002, caused particular concern. They have been the subject of a `forensic review' commissioned by the new (post November 2002) AWI Board. This review identified a significant number of unusual or poorly substantiated payments, payments which may be inconsistent with the SFA, and project management issues.</para><para>On the weight of evidence the Committee concludes that concerns about AWI management and corporate governance, especially in the second half of 2002, were completely justified. The examples, especially in the second half of 2002, show a pattern of behaviour in breach of good corporate governance standards.</para><para>The Committee notes particularly that in the leadup to the October 2002 election of directors, AWI campaigned on behalf of sitting directors at company expense. In the Committee's view this was most improper. The Committee notes advice from the Australian Government Solicitor that it was probably a breach of the Corporations Act.</para></quote><para>This leads to the committee's first recommendation, which was to question whether AWI used company money to campaign for sitting directors during the 2002 board election in breach of Corporations Law. The committee has recommended that this issue be referred to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. The report goes on:</para><quote><para>The Committee notes Mr Dorber's view that AWI may spend its independent income freelyâincluding, for example, on agri-political activity. In the Committee's viewâ</para></quote><para>which was substantiated by othersâ</para><quote><para>a levy-funded body like AWI should not be allowed to spend any money, however sourced, on agri-political activity.</para></quote><para>I could stand here all night and reel off the number of expenditures made by Mr Dorber that were questionable, improper, or completely inappropriate. I will not do that; I will mention just a few.</para><para>It was the committee's view that the previous board of AWI authorised improper expenditure on a campaign to assist the re-election of sitting directors.</para><para>The internal `forensic review' by PricewaterhouseCoopers highlighted six `unusual or poorly substantiated payments', three payments `which may be inconsistent with the statutory funding agreement' and four payments `regarding projects which were poorly documented, or exhibited weakness in standard controls and procedures'.</para><para>The six `unusual or poorly substantiated payments' included the payment to Mr Dorber of around $25,000 in ShearExpress directors fees, which appeared to be contrary to ShearExpress board minutes. This money, I am pleased to say, has subsequently been returned by Mr Dorber. They also included termination payments to Mr Dorber's two children, together totalling around $130,000 gross. Mr Dorber had employed his two children, and then subsequently terminated their employment, within 15 months, in the case of his son, and eight months, in the case of his daughterâan absolute disgrace.</para><para>The three payments which may be inconsistent with the SFA included $100,000 to Charles Sturt University towards the establishment of a museum to house the Sommerville fossil and rock collection and $4,033.20 worth of Shakespearean plays to Cromer High School, which I understand is the school that Mr Dorber's children attend. These payments were made when wool growers were being compulsorily levied two per cent of their meagre income in the worst drought in 100 yearsâan abuse of power.</para><para>Lastly, I would again like to thank and applaud the actions of a few brave individuals who were responsible for initially exposing the gross maladministration that was occurring under Mr Dorber's and Ms McCaskill's control of AWI. I am very sorry that Ms McCaskill twice declined to appear before the committee to explain some of the actions of the board and to answer questions about the board, on both occasions claiming that the date did not suit her. </para><para>My attention was first brought to the extent of the problems within AWI when, in 2002, I received in my office a brown envelope containing a number of deeply disturbing allegations which unfortunately turned out to be true. Chapter 1 of the report highlights that one of the focuses of the inquiry was to discover whether the committee's original concerns about the corporate governance of AWI were justified. Sadly, those concerns were justified; they were absolutely correct.

Owing to the unique requirements of the Submarine Escape and Rescue Centre, Defence provided the Commonwealth built Submarine Escape Training facility, the submersible <inline font-style="italic">Remora</inline> and the deployable re-compression chambers and suite of ancillary rescue equipment as Government Furnished Equipment. Defence also put in place a transition plan which included the possibility of assistance to the successful tenderer for the continued operation of the <inline font-style="italic">Remora</inline> capability during the transition to the new contracted service.</para><para>(b)	The value of the Government Furnished Equipment is difficult to quantify.

The aim of Black Carillon 2003 was to provide the RAN's capability to rescue personnel from a distressed submarine using the new submarine escape and rescue contractor. This was successfully achieved. The operation of <inline font-style="italic">Remora</inline> in general was assessed as satisfactory overall albeit with some aspects requiring improvement in future.</para><para>(c)	Yes. Safety is always a major concern of the RAN. During the first training activity conducted by the new contractor there were some concerns over deck handling on the support vessel. A subsequent independent safety audit conducted on behalf of Defence Maritime Services and the RAN prior to Black Carillon 2003 identified that any previous shortcomings had been addressed.</para><para>(10)	Yes.
