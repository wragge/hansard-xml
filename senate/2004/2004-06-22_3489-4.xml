As Senator Murray indicated before we adjourned last night, the Democrats want to insist on the amendments which the Senate has made in respect of the schedule dealing with gift deductible recipients. He also indicated that we will be opposing the amendment moved by Senator Sherry in respect of the Constitution Education Fund. The amendment I am foreshadowing is to add nine councils of social service to the list of gift deductible entities.</para></talk.start><para>The reason why we are doing this is that we need to make a point to the government over the course of the next couple of days that the government's response in respect of the whole issue of definition of charities has been quite inadequate. One of the other bills on the list for debate today is the <inline ref="R2056">Extension of Charitable Purpose Bill 2004</inline>. This bill is all that is left of the government's response to the charities definition inquiry, which reported in 2000. That inquiry, the chamber may recall, was formed as a result of discussions between the Treasurer and the Democrats about the need to properly define what a charity was and to ensure that the 400-year-old definition of `charity' was brought up to date.</para><para>One of the areas that pretty much the entire charitable sector disagreed on was the appropriate definition of a charity for the purposes of political activity or lobbying. It is worth noting just how out of touch the government has become on this issue. Indeed, in terms of its original draft charities bill, which came out of part of its response to the charities definition inquiry, the government has thought to curtail the activities that a charity could engage in in lobbying, research and advocacy activities. It was part of what had been a consistent view by government over many years that it did not regard advocacy and research as a legitimate charitable purpose.</para><para>The particular approach the government adopted was in complete contrast to a more modern understanding of what was a charity for the purposes of tax law. In fact, it is worth noting that the charities definition inquiry, which was headed by Justice Shepherd, made it quite clear when it said:</para><quote><para>The Committee recommends that charities should be permitted to engage in advocacy on behalf of those they benefit. Conduct of this kind should not deny them charitable status even if it involves advocating for a change in law or policy. Submission from both charities and governments have demonstrated that charities are increasingly asked to represent to governments the interests of those they seek to benefit and to contribute to the development and administration of government policies. The Committee considers that the definition of a charity should not prevent these developments as they represent an effective means of delivering outcomes for individuals, charities and governments. </para></quote><para>That was its recommendation, and it is most unfortunate that the government chose not to follow that recommendation through. It is not just that but, in dropping its own charities bill, which was announced in the budget, now there will be no reform at all in this area and charities will be required to continue to rely on an inadequate and ad hoc approach by the Australian Taxation Office.</para><para>The Democrats are seeking to move to add to the list of gift deductible entities the most important advocates on behalf of the poor in this country, which is the Australian Council of Social Service and its constituent bodies. It is, in our view, absolutely disappointing that the government has for so long sought to resist the recognition of ACOSS and its constituent bodies as charities and as gift deductible entities. I think it is perfectly reasonable and totally consistent with the view taken by the charities definition inquiry that this parliament should recognise the fact that the work that the Australian Council of Social Service does, and its various constituent bodies, is of a charitable nature. It is work that is for the advocacy of the most poor and disadvantaged in our society. Our parliament should recognise that. It should recognise that those purposes are worth promoting. If the bulk of its expenditure ends up coming back in terms of lobbying on behalf of those people into this place, then that too is worth promoting, because I think we need to be reminded in this place, time and time again, of our responsibilities to ensure that policy is in line with advantaging the poorest and most disadvantaged in our society.</para><para>I should also point out that the government's view on advocacy and research is increasingly out of line with what is coming out of the courts. It is worth noting, for example, the case in October 2002 in the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal dealing with the tax status of the Australian Conservation Foundation, where Mr Gibson determined that the Australian Conservation Foundation was a charity for the purposes of Victorian taxation law. He made it clear that it is time for governments to come up to speed on these particular issues. He said:</para><quote><para>It will I think be obvious that it cannot be said that a charity ceases to be a charity if its activities are predominantly said in some unspecified sense to be âpoliticalâ. But if the central object of an organisation is to procure a change in the law, at least in a field that is not otherwise charitable, then this object does not fall within any of the four headings of charity that the law recognises and accordingly the organisation cannot be seen as charitable.</para></quote><para>He made it quite clear that the evidence showed that because the purposes of the ACF were consistent with national legislation in terms of protecting the environment, obviously it was an organisation which was pursuing purposes which were charitable. I think that approach could certainly be said to apply to ACOSS.</para><para>The Democrats commend this amendment to the chamber because we think it is important that this chamber completes the work that the government has failed to carry through, which is to start bringing our definition of `charity' up to date with what it needs to be in the 21st century. We are currently operating off a definition of `charity' which is now some 400 years old. It is time to recognise that times have moved on, the courts have moved on and the whole nature of the work that charities are doing has moved on. Certainly it is time for the government to recognise that its long and consistent campaign to downgrade the importance of research and advocacy in promoting the needs of the poor and disadvantaged in our society needs to end. We need to ensure that the Australian Council of Social Service and its very important work on behalf of the poor and disadvantaged is recognised and that Australians who make contributions towards its work are in themselves recognised through it having deductible gift recipient status. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>24475</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to comment on the Democrat amendments that have been circulated on sheet 4278.

Then they were proposing to put in the Australian Republican Movement and the Real Republic Ltd. Turning to the Democrats' second amendment, the Australian Council of Social Service and its state bodies perform an important role as peak bodies for welfare groups in their respective jurisdictions. Whilst ACOSS is principally a lobby or research group, its primary objective is to highlight issues affecting the most vulnerable in our societyâarguably a charitable purpose. If providing relief to the poor is considered charity then it is not too much of a stretch to say that arguing for that relief is also charitable. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The fact that the review into the definition of charities and other organisations recommended extensions to the definition of `charitable purposes' to include organisations such as ACOSS and its state bodies adds weight to providing it with specific listing as a DGR in the tax law. We agree that the Australian Democrats have made the point on a number of occasions, in response to the minister's claim, that we have some 400 years of tradition here and it is time to update the 400 years of English law in the Australian context. That 400 years of law, whilst it might have stood the test of time, was established before even Australia was established as a nation, so there is some updating required. Labor understand the government's concerns that ACOSS may not meet the public fund requirements. Labor consider that this is an administrative issue which can be resolved without the need to oppose the Democrat amendment. Therefore we will support the Democrat amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>24476</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âACOSS made an application for DGR status in a letter to me dated 19 May 2004. That application is proceeding in the normal way and is being given appropriate consideration, as you would expect with any serious application for DGR status. Given that the government is currently considering ACOSS's application for specific listingâand I had in mind advising the organisation when a decision is made on the issueâmy current view is that it is not appropriate to simply have it listed until it has satisfied the various parts of the application that every other DGR applicant must satisfy. The provisions for becoming a DGR deliberately constrain DGR status to a closely targeted subset of charitable and other not-for-profit organisations and, given the targeted nature of the gift provisions, the government's general approach has been to list an organisation specifically only where it does make a direct contribution to the public interest. My colleagues who have made remarks about that may well be correct in that ACOSS does contribute to the public interest, but that is part of the general consideration of the organisation's application.</para></talk.start><para>In addition, as a matter of process and, may I say, good tax administrationâsomething that is constantly urged upon the governmentâan organisation is generally specifically listed only after it has satisfied the Commissioner of Taxation that it meets certain integrity standards known as the `public fund requirements', which is a process that is very important. It is not just administrative, with due respect; it is integral to ensuring that there is some integrity in the framework of how DGR applications are processed. I am certainly not aware that the commissioner has come to a view about ACOSS. I must say that I have an open mind about whether ACOSS should have DGR status. I am very mindful of the advice I receive, but sometimes I accept it and sometimes I do not, depending on other matters that may be brought to my attention, including submissions made by the organisation. They have made a sound one and quite a comprehensive one.</para><para>However, at this stage and for the reason that this very important process has not yet run its courseâand when I say `process' I am not talking about ticking boxes; I am talking about the consideration of whether the public fund requirements are metâwe are unable to support the Democrat amendment at this time. But we will obviously undertake to consider the matter taking into account the fact that there is Democrat support for this and in fact support from the opposition as well. Obviously I will seek to try to have this matter finalised as soon as possible, but given the way in which it has actually come into the debate I am unable to agree to it on behalf of the government at this time. I would certainly appreciate its not being pressed at this time for those reasons. We will be having a very full debate about the response to the charities inquiry in the course of consideration on that bill; so, although there were some matters raised by previous speakers in relation to charities more generally, I will save my comments until the debate on the later bill. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Ross (The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN)</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Lightfoot)</inline>âThe question is that Democrat amendment (2) on sheet 4278 be agreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Question agreed to. </para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN, The</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>âThe question now is that the committee does not insist on its amendments disagreed to by the House. </para></talk.start><para>Question negatived. </para><para>Resolution reported; report adopted. </para></interjection></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>24477</page.no><id.no>R1580</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>24477</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 10 February, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vanstone</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>24477</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn behalf of the Australian Labor Party, I am speaking on the <inline ref="R1580">Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2003</inline>, so-called. That is my description: the so-called choice of superannuation fund bill. Once again, the Liberal government has introduced a piece of superannuation legislation that, if passed in its current form, is destined to make our superannuation system more difficult for consumers to understand and navigateâmuch more difficult than the Liberal government has already made the current superannuation system. This is a bad piece of legislation in its detail and construction and particularly in its safeguards to protect consumers that will, for many Australians, negatively affect their retirement savings. The government has carried out this deal with those habitual deal makers and publicity seekers, the Australian Democrats.</para></talk.start><para>This piece of legislation continues a pattern followed by the Liberal government since its election of introducing legislation in a very confused and ad hoc manner in this area, the result of which has been to make the superannuation system even more complicated and more expensive to consumers. You would need a finance degree to understand the Australian superannuation system. This legislation, at least for many Australians, will require them to make so-called choices without the advantage of having a finance degree to carry out what are very important decisions. The principle and concept of choice sounds great, it seems fine when the choices are clearly set out and when they are understood, but this legislation fails because it is unsafe choice. It is deregulation without the necessary consumer safeguards, and choice without the necessary safeguards does not serve the interests of either consumers or the superannuation industry.</para><para>Firstly, I acknowledge that for many fund members choice already exists. The so-called choice legislation that we are considering will apply only to employees under federal industrial law and not to those under state industrial law. So when the government talks about choice it is a choice that is being allowed only for federal industrial law employees, and even here it is restricted. The government is allowing the restriction of industrial agreements and workplace agreements. We know that most people have so-called choice when they retire. When they get to retirement they are able to take their lump sum and to pick a provider if they choose to invest that money in an income stream product. </para><para>What we also know is that, within a current superannuation fund, at least 80 per cent of fund members are able to pick an investment choice within that fund. When this general description of choice is used there is some confusion. A considerable majority of Australians can choose an investment within the superannuation fund that they are in at the present time. They can pick a high-growth or high-risk fund, overseas shares, Australian shares, bonds or cash. They have the ability to pick the investment. Most of them do not do it, but they have the ability to do so. But we are talking about the requirement that a substantial proportion of Australiansânine million peopleâwill have to pick a superannuation fund to be a member of.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>âThat is better than forcing them into one.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>âWe will get to that in a moment, Senator McGauran. We are talking about the failure to safeguard consumers, about what the Labor Party believe are shortcomings in protecting consumers, particularly from fee rip-offs that occur and we argue will occur more widely, and about the evidence of what happened in the United Kingdom when this approach was tried. A so-called free market, an unregulated market, places huge demands on consumers. They need to have high levels of financial literacy to be able to make an informed choice. Of course, the fact that superannuation is compulsory in the first place is an interesting illustration of market failure. If the market were perfect, then 100 per cent of Australians would have superannuation. The fact is they do not; they never did. At best, the coverage was 40 per cent. We have had to make it compulsory for them to pick up superannuationâa clear market failureâso that some 88 per cent of Australian workers are contributors to superannuation funds. The remaining 12 per cent are under the cut-off point.</para></talk.start></continue><para>One has only to look at those consumers who invested in Commercial Nominees. That was a superannuation fund. Where consumers chose that fund as their preferred fundâbecause some people do have so-called choiceâthis was the biggest case of theft and fraud in a superannuation fund in the last 10 years. While they may be the minority, there are, nevertheless, many funds that have very significant exit fees of up to thousands of dollars. If the government were consistent in its ideological position in wanting so-called choice, why does it permit exit fees? They are a barrier to exiting. Most people will not exit a superannuation fund if they have to pay thousands of dollars in penalty exit fees, even if there is a negative return. They will not do it because the penalties are so high. The government will not take up one of the fundamental protections, which is to ban exit fees. They should not be permitted. On the other hand, there are many who do not exercise the right to choose a fund because they do not have the necessary financial literacy to navigate the complexity of the superannuation system or, as I have said, they are trapped by excessive exit fees.</para><para>The Liberal legislation that we are considering is unsafe because it is so complex and it does nothing to reduce the bureaucracy and the problems people have in trying to navigate the Australian superannuation system. What will happen is that the millions of Australians who are required to choose a fund will be given a product disclosure statement. They are given the information: it is a 60- to 80-page document. Within that 60- to 80-page document that millions of Australians will now need to read in order to understand how to choose a fund, the fees will be buried somewhere. So Australians will get a 60- to 80-page PDS and, in order to make an informed choice, they will need to understand it. </para><para>Labor argue that there are many Australians who, in the absence of having a finance degree, will find it difficult to understand the PDS document. They will also find it difficult to identify fees, because we do not believe the fee disclosure pages that will be in this 60- to 80-page document will be adequate. And what will be the behavioural response?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>âYou say, `Force them into a fund they don't understand and leave them there.'

You are still allowing employers to force employees into a fund under AWAs. You are not allowing total choice. If you were consistent in your ideological position, you would not allow employers the right under an Australian workplace agreement to say, `You can't have choice.' You allow an employer a veto within your own choice bill. You are not consistent.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let us deal with the problems that will occur when millions of Australians cannot understand a 60- to 80-page product disclosure document and identify all the fees and charges that are in there. What will they do? Many of them will do nothing and be in a default fund. That is fineâthere is provision there for a default fundâbut many of them will think, `I had better get some advice on this; I'll go off to a financial adviser.' This is where we have significant problems with our current system. What the government is proposing will increase the problems that will occur. All the international evidence suggests it will cause significant problems. </para><para>The government are saying that people reading these PDSs and switching from one superannuation fund to another, as they choose, is going to put `downward pressure on prices'. Notice the wordingâ`downward pressure on prices on fees and charges'. If the government were fair dinkum they would come in here and guarantee that fees and charges will go down. Why won't the government guarantee that fees and charges will go down as a result of the market competition they argue will flower as millions of Australians choose a superannuation fund? Because they know that in the United Kingdom when so-called choice was introduced by the Thatcher Conservative government it was an utter disaster. Like Australia, millions of consumers had to choose a superannuation fund and they found it very difficult to understand the information. Certainly one point that Senator Campbell makes is correct: our disclosure documentationâalbeit we think inadequateâwill be greater in the Australian jurisdiction than it was in the UK system. But there will still be a significant number of Australians who will find it hard to understand the PDS documentsâ60 to 80 pagesâand they will need to go to an adviser. </para><para>What happens when you go to an adviser in the Australian system? You are charged an additional fee over and above that which you pay at the moment. Labor's contention is that many Australians will pay an additional fee for the advice that they will need to understand the 60- to 80-page document. And that additional fee in the Australian system is usually in the form of a commission payment. Labor has significant concerns with commission based payments and advice. Not only does it add to costs, not reduce costsâbecause there is an extra cost to the system that is tacked on when you pay for the adviceâbut commissions are a fundamental conflict of interest. Superannuation advisers are paid out of the commission. Many Australians do not know that. It will be disclosed certainly, there is no argument about that, but disclosed somewhat inadequately. </para><para>What will be the behavioural pattern of the adviser? If the adviser is getting a commission of one per cent on a particular superannuation product and only half a per cent on another product, what are they going to recommend to the consumer? They are going to recommend the product they get the highest commission on. We know they do that at the moment to some extent. I do not suggest that all advisers behave in that wayâthey do notâbut it is a fundamental conflict of interest for commissions to exist in this way in the superannuation system.</para><para>That is exactly what happened in the United Kingdom. Whether or not people got full disclosure documents and whether they understood the system, they were advised by commission-driven selling. They found it difficult to understand the superannuation system in the UK, as many do in Australia. They went to an adviser and the adviser said, `Come into this fund, this is a good deal for you,' set it out in writing and the consumer believed them. Of course, the adviser was getting a commission paymentâan add-on cost and a fundamental conflict of interest. This is not safe.</para><para>In Australia we have a compulsory superannuation system. There are not many like it in the world. The assets of superannuation moneys are certainly considerable, they are for retirement and they are long term. There are not many compulsory financial products. It is not compulsory to have a bank account. There are not many products as complex as superannuation. It is not easy to return a superannuation product five or six years later when you suddenly discover you may have been stung on the fees and charges and commissions. You cannot return the product. You have lost your money; you have been stung. It is a unique financial product: it is for retirement. Knowing the failings of the current system and looking at the evidence overseas, Labor argue that we have to ensure very tough safeguards to have a safe choice regime.</para><para>Looking at the comments by Senator Cherry, he said, paraphrasing him, `Look, it doesn't matter; consumers will never understand the disclosure documents.' If Senator Cherry believes that it begs the question: why did they agree at all to this piece of legislation? One of the problems with fee disclosure in the government model is that it does not show the impact of fees over five, 10, 20 or 30 years. If you showed that, you would seeâand this is essential for any so-called competitive marketâthat your fees would add up to $20,000, $30,000, $40,000 over the long-term life of a superannuation product. Labor argues that it is essential for consumers to see that. I think a lot of consumers would say: `I'm going to be paying $40,000, $50,000 or $60,000 in fees over the next 20 or 30 years. I am going to have a really hard look around to make sure that the long-term impact of the fee that I am paying is as low as I can get it.'</para><para>I notice the Democrats' Senator Murray says that this cannot be done, it is too hard and that to project forward the impact of fees is just too difficult and confuses people. It is one of the critical failings of the disclosure regime. I do not know whether Senator Murray is listening, but it can be done and it can be done very simply. IFSA, the investment funds association, have argued it cannot be done. In the United Kingdom, where they have just introduced universal projections over the long term, IFSA's counterpart body there has helped develop the compulsory projection of fee model. Yet they argue it cannot be done here. Senator Murray is just plain wrong, and he should have looked around a little harder, particularly at the United Kingdom, with respect to long-term projections of the impact of fees. It can be done simply. It can be done safely. </para><para>I have made some comments about the lack of financial literacy levels and that you do need a finance degree to understand superannuation. The government's own chair appointed to their financial literacy task force, Mr Clitheroe, in reference to this super choice legislation and the regulations, made the point that a substantial proportion of Australians cannot swim between the flags on the beach of superannuation. They cannot even find the beach. This is the environment in which the government are proposing to deregulate superannuation. It needs to be done safely. We also know from the ANZ financial literacy results that, on average, even though the population has a reasonable mathematical skill, applying those skills to the comprehension of financial statements presents some challenges and that the understanding of basic investment fundamentals is very poor. Yet here today in this bill the Liberals and the Democrats are saying: `Go and make these decisions. We know that financial literacy levels are low, but you are going to have to make these decisions.' Hence my argument that many people will do nothing or they will seek the services of an adviser and pay extra in fees and charges. They will pay more, not less. Sure, you can attempt to educate consumers. But, seriously, between now and 1 July next year when this legislation commences are we going to comprehensively make nine million adult Australians in superannuation funds financially literate so that they can understand the 60- to 80-page documents? I suggest that we have got a very big job ahead of us giving everyone in Australia a financial planning degree between now and 1 July next year. It just will not happen.</para><para>I have mentioned the exit fees. The Labor Party in a specific amendment will be proposing to ban outright exit fees. They are barriers that should not exist. We believe that commissions should not be permitted in respect of the compulsory nine per cent superannuation guarantee. We think there is a very strong argument they should not be permitted for compulsory superannuation. If the argument from the government is that fees and charges will come down, let us have comprehensive reporting of all the data on fees and charges and commissions so that we can actually see whether the fees and charges come down for every Australian who has got superannuation. I do not believe that claim, but that is what the government is holding upâthat all the fees and charges will come down. The financial planners are saying: `We will reduce all our fees and charges. Trust us.' IFSA have made a commitment on behalf of their constituent organisations that, with competition: `All our fees and charges will come down.' The banks have also said itâa rather incredible claim. Let us have every fund in this country report the level of fees, charges and commissions for reporting. With respect to the requirement of reporting of fees, I move my second reading amendment:</para><quote><para>At the end of the motion add âbut the Senate is of the opinion that a reporting system should be established by the regulator, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), requiring:</para><para>	(a)	that all superannuation funds report to APRA:</para></quote><para>	(i)	all fees, charges and expenses charged in relation to each individual account paid on super-annuation guarantee contributions, </para><para>	(ii)	all commissions charged in relation to each individual account paid on superannuation guarantee contri-butions,</para><para>	(iii)	all fees, charges and expenses charged in relation to each individual account paid on non-superannuation guarantee contri-butions, and</para><para>	(iv)	all commissions charged in relation to each individual account paid on all non-superannuation guarantee contributions;</para><quote><para>	(b)	that APRA report on a quarterly basis on the APRA website:</para></quote><para>	(i)	the total level of superannuation guarantee contributions,</para><para>	(ii)	the total level of non-superannuation guarantee contributions, and</para><para>	(iii)	the average level of fees and charges per $500 of superannuation guarantee contributions for each individual provider; and</para><quote><para>	(c)	that APRA establish a register by provider name, of all superannuation products managed by that provider with a record of all fees, charges, expenses and commissions charged in relation to each product.â</para></quote><para><inline font-style="italic">(Time expired) </inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>24482</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Democrats will be supporting the <inline ref="R1580">Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2003</inline> to establish superannuation choice of funds. It has been a very long journey. I should acknowledge the presence of Senator Kemp in the chamber today. From my previous life as an adviser to Senator Lyn Allison, I know Senator Kemp and Senator Allison had innumerable meetings to try to get this legislation forward. Before I go into the details of the bill I will recap some of that history because I think it is very significant. This legislation first came into the parliament in, I think, 1997 and at that stage the Democrats took a position of saying the choice model would need to be extensively amended for it to be acceptable to us. It was reintroduced into parliament in 1999, at which stage there were extensive discussions between Senator Kemp and Senator Allison. Those discussions were incorporated into the bill which was introduced into the parliament in 2002. It is worth pointing out some of the agreements which were made at that stage. However, since then, there has been a further Senate inquiry. Senator Coonan brought forward amendments which were incorporated into the bill as a result of discussions with employers last year, and there have been further amendments moved by the government as a result of discussions with the Democrats over the last couple of weeks.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>âThat is not quite the full history.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00A9C</name.id><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name></talker><para>âIt is a very long history and it goes back much further, Senator KempâI accept thatâbut I thought going back eight years was far enough. Over the course of those very long and detailed discussions a whole range of concerns which the Democrats have had with the original choice of funds model have been largely allayed. I think a lot of the concerns which Senator Sherry spoke about, which we have shared at various times over the course of the last eight years, have been largely put to bed. I think at this stage, rather than saying this is an unsafe piece of legislation, we can say with a reasonable level of confidence that we have made it as safe as it can be to trust Australians with their own savings. That is really what it comes down to: at what point do you trust Australians with their own savings?</para></talk.start></continue><para>The point is you trust Australians with their own savings when you ensure they have the tools to actually make informed decisions and you ensure that their employers or their unions are appropriately regulated not to be able to improperly influence those decisions. You trust Australians to make their own decisions when you ensure that the regulatory scheme is as solid as you can make it. You make sure that the employee has complete control over what happens to their funds, rather than being influenced in any way by improper or irresponsible advertising. </para><para>I note that Senator Sherry, in his contribution, referred to the experience of the UK. It would be foolish of Australia not to actually learn from the experience of the UK. One of the interesting things about the UK experience which will not be replicated here is the fact that their pensions and superannuation industry has largely evolved from the life insurance industry. One of the key incentives in that particular program for encouraging the various life agents to encourage people to shift around was that they continually got new commissions for people shifting from fund to fund. One of the key things with which they were encouraging people to shift from fund to fund was in fact long-term projections about what their investments would be in those funds. It is rather ironic, given the criticisms we have heard from Senator Sherry and from others in respect of the fee disclosure regime last week, that one of the concerns which was constantly raised was this issue of projections.</para><para>What we are trying to ensure here is that we pick up a scheme which actually works for all workersâand workers are in different situations and circumstances. I believe that workers who are in an award based industry fund are probably better off staying in that fund in most cases, although not all. I certainly remember that, when I was researching superannuation in Queensland, the hairdressers award fund in my state had delivered negative returns for each of the previous 10 years that I had reported on. I think the hairdressers in Queensland would have been much better off out of that award fund. Similarly, for many years the transport workers fund in Queensland delivered negative returns, and those workers would have been better off out of that fund. That is replicated by the recent advice from Super Ratings Researcher last week which showed that, by and large, the not-for-profit funds are delivering better products than the for-profit funds. But they have got to be held accountable for that and they are held accountable by ensuring that, where they are not delivering, workers can move out. I think that is very important. That would have ensured that those hairdressers or transport workers in Queensland who were not getting a good deal out of their fund had a place to move to.</para><para>When you look at the way that our work force has developed, you see that about 40 per cent of workers are under certified agreementsâand, by and large, a certified agreement determines where their superannuation will go. Under the amendments which the Democrats negotiated with the government, a choice by a workplace through a certified agreement is recognised as a valid choice, and that is recognised by legislation, so essentially a collective choice of fund by a workplace recognised by a certified agreement will in fact pick up those 40 per cent of workers who have already chosen what fund they want to go into through their certified agreement. About 20 per cent of workers in Australia are currently covered by a mixture of federal and state awards. Under this legislation, those employees under federal awards will now have the right to choose where their superannuation goes. If they fail to choose where their superannuation is to go, it will default to stay in the award fund. I emphasise that in 2000 the Democrats insisted on that as a key requirement. The government's original ideological proposal to remove superannuation clauses from awards has been trenchantly opposed by the Democrats over the last eight years. </para><para>The third category of workers is the 40 per cent of workers who are award free. At the moment we do not hear much from the Labor Party about this particular group of workers because, being a union based party, the Labor Party constantly forgets about the 80 per cent of workers who are not in unions.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AOU</name.id><name role="metadata">Wong, Sen Penny</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00A9C</name.id><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name></talker><para>âYou do! At the moment and at law the placement of the superannuation of the 40 per cent of workers who are award free is determined by the employer, and that is the actual key issue that we need to deal with. In this legislation we are giving those workers, for the first time, the right to choose their superannuation fund. I think that is a very positive development.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In terms of the other changes which actually try to ensure that this is a safe piece of legislation, as I indicated before, for award based workers the award will be the default fund. That is a very important concession that we won. It also ensures, in the amendments which the government is moving, that a default fund must have a mandated level of minimum insurance cover. This issue has arisen time and time again in the Senate committee hearings. We are trying to ensure that there is a reasonable level of insurance cover for workers, particularly in terms of default funds and particularly as people shift around funds. The Democrats strongly support that. Those amendments are being moved by the government and we thank the government for doing that.</para><para>It should also be noted that, in the model that we are developing here today, before employees make a choice, they will be given a standard choice form which will provide them with a clear explanation of what choice is about, what they should look for and where they get further information. It is vitally important in terms of this whole community education program that, as we go through this, we provide as many warnings as we can to consumers about how to avoid the pitfalls which have been problems in other states. The standard choice form, the establishment of a superannuation consumer information centre, the $40 million of education and the simple fee disclosure requirement are all tools which ensure that workers can make an informed choice that actually benefits their retirement savings. The Democrats recognise we have to provide as much protection and assistance to consumers as we possibly can in all of this, but at the end of the day it is still up to the consumer to actually follow that through. The standard choice form, which we insisted on, is a very important part of that education process. </para><para>In addition to that, under the amendments which we are moving today, there will be an absolute prohibition on employers and unions signing up workers to a particular fund. In our view, this is very important because we do not want to have a situation where employers or unions are accepting kickbacks for shifting workers into one fund or another. It is important that as much as possible the choice be left to the employee to make, not to their employer or, in very rare circumstances, their union. I should also note that, under the financial services regulations, anybody other than a registered financial planner giving advice to an employee on superannuation matters is already prohibited. I hope that will be reinforced to both unions and employers as a result of the education campaign. I think those amendments are particularly important.</para><para>The amendments will also deal with the issue of monitoring fees and charges raised by Senator Sherry. This is a very important issue and I think it is essential that, in the development of the choice model over the next five years, there is quite detailed reporting and monitoring of fees and charges against the ASIC template. We need to know whether the government's claims that the market can control fees and charges are valid or whether the ALP's claims that fees and charges will go through the roof are valid. The only way to test and validate those claims is to monitor the fees and charges themselves. The government has agreed to do that, and that was announced by the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Coonan, yesterday. Legislative amendments to achieve that will be introduced in a subsequent piece of legislation. It is not in this particular piece of legislation because there is the matter of sorting out which is the best regulator to do it, but I accept the government's assurance that that legislation will be brought forward to ensure that that monitoring does in fact occur before 1 July next year. I think it is very important. </para><para>There are two other issues on which we sought agreement from the government, as a result of getting the choice bill up to this stage in the Senate. The first was that of the simple fee disclosure, which was resolved between Senator Murray and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Mr Ross Cameron, last week. That is something which, from going back through my notes, we first put to the government back in 1997. Getting that simple fee disclosure model up has been a very long time coming. How simple is simple is something which there has been a huge argument about and something which I think there will continue to be an argument about. The Democrats adopt the view that simple should be simple and that simple should be as simple as it simply can be. We know from all of the consumer comprehension testing that the more numbers you put on a piece of paper, the more riders you put on it and the more assumptions you put on it the less consumers will understand it, which is why we have gone for the simplest model to give people the information to compare.</para><para>I cannot see how adding onto a simple fee disclosure a five-year projection, a 10-year projection and a 30-year projection, plus a first-year projection and a second-year projection, fits within that definition of `simple'. I think it is an oxymoron to suggest that you can have four different scenarios for what `simple' actually means. You lose the notion of `simple' in doing that. That is why, at the end of the day, having looked at the various models and at all the information, the Democrats came to the view that it was best to show a first-year and a second-year cost of a superannuation fund, to give in bold a warning on the simple fee disclosure statement saying that consumers should be aware of the impact of fees over the longer term and to give the tools to ensure consumers can calculate thatâreferring back to the ASIC web site and to the fees calculators on other web sites as well. That would ensure that consumers would have the tools to follow those issues through. At the end of the day, you can lead a horse to water but you cannot make it drink. You can warn consumers, you can put in place as much disclosure as possible to tweak their interest, but ultimately a consumer has to follow through themselves. That is one thing that we know, at the end of the day, we are letting go a bit in this place.</para><para>Superannuation under the previous Labor government was a very paternalistic business. It was the unions and the government telling workers what was best for themâand by and large industry funds have delivered a good product for workersâbut at the end of the day I think the sophistication of the Australian work force has moved on just a little bit, and we have to recognise that. The measures we are putting in place today are part of a logical evolution for the Australian work force in giving them a bit more choice about what happens to their superannuation, a bit more control over what happens to their superannuation and, hopefully, a bit more interest in what happens to their superannuation. Trying to get more accountability for the delivery of funds back to members is what this is all about. That is an important development. </para><para>The other thing I note this will do is give employees the right to put their funds in ethical investment. Senator Sherry makes great play out of the fact that 80-odd per cent of funds are now providing investment choice. I looked at the investment choice offered by my fund, and there is usually a fairly simple and arcane choice between low risk, medium risk and high risk. There is not investment choice for me to not have my funds invested in a way which is not ethical. This model will give workers the chance to say: `I don't like the approach of my superannuation fund at all. I want to put my money into an ethical fund.' That is a particular benefit. I note the statement put out yesterday by George Pooley of Australian Ethical Investment. People with long memories would remember that he was involved with the old Insurance and Superannuation Commission. It is worth quoting the statement in the time I have available. Mr Pooley said:</para><quote><para>Prior to the historic change announced today, though Australians were forced to save, they had no guarantee they would have any say as to how their superannuation monies would be invested. Those old arrangements could be summed up as followsâyou must pool your savings with fellow workers who might have entirely different savings needs and ethical concerns. You must entrust your super savings to persons required by law to act in a manner satisfactory to the Australian Government. If they act in a manner contrary to your personal, financial or ethical interests, you could do nothing.</para><para>Until this announcement, though Australians were free to vote for the party of their choice at the ballot box, they had no similar right in regard to investment of their superannuation monies.</para><para>Australian Ethical Investment welcomes this change, which will enfranchise millions of Australians with respect to investment choice of fund. With the passage of this Bill, those Australians will be able to express their ethical concerns with their superannuation monies, as well as with their vote.</para></quote><para>That statement from Australian Ethical Investment highlights the fact that, in moving to a choice of funds regime, we also say to superannuation funds right across the board that ethical investment is now out there as a significant market factor and a market determinant. I think that should be welcomed by those people who want to see the growth in that very vibrant part of the funds management industry.</para><para>In winding up, I note for the record that the amendments the government is bringing forward today also include for the first time the recognition in Australian superannuation law of interdependent relationships. This, again, has been a long-term Democrats campaign, going right back to Senator Sid Spindler in 1995, and I am very pleased to finally see it recognised at law. The interdependent relationships definitionsâand I will speak to them in the committee stageâare drawn fairly broadly from New South Wales relationships law and recognition with respect to property. They will ensure that the legal problem of not providing choice to same-sex couples as to where their death benefits go is finally resolved. At the moment the law allows complete choice on death benefitsâthat is, tax-free choice on death benefitsâfor superannuation to pass to a person's spouse or to their dependants, and the definition of spouse includes a de facto heterosexual spouse. The Democrats have argued for a long time that that is a piece of social engineering that is too narrow. It is outrageous that the tax office was determining who could and could not get a person's superannuation under the threat of a 15 to 30 per cent tax impost. </para><para>We have argued this case long and hard in this placeâI should acknowledge the contribution of my colleague Senator Greig in that regardâand I am pleased that the government has finally accepted a proposal to ensure that interdependent relationships will be recognised. The term `interdependent relationships' will not be one which many people are familiar with, but it is a term which has been recognised in migration law for many years in allowing recognition of same-sex couples.</para><para>As I have said, the wording that we have used is drawn from the New South Wales relationships in property law, so it is well recognised also in state law. It ensures that a de facto heterosexual or same-sex couple will be treated on the same basis for the purposes of superannuation and the taxation of superannuation death benefits. That is an enormous achievement in terms of not just human rights but also economic rights, something which I am personally very proud of and which we have worked very hard to get.</para><para>I should thank Senator Coonan for the work that she has done to get this amendment to this point. I should note that it does not go far enough, as often reforms do not. You do negotiate; it is not full recognition on the same basis as a married spouse, but that is a matter that we will deal with when we deal with the Marriage Act later this week. I should also note that this reform needs to be extended into other areas of law and we will discuss that in the committee stage. But it is an important reform that will mean that, when this bill gets royal assent, the 15 to 30 per cent tax impost imposed on same-sex couples will be removed and access to death benefits and the choice as to who will get the death benefit from a superannuation fund will be on the same basis as heterosexual couples. That is something that the Democrats are very pleased that we have finally achieved with this bill.</para><para>In closing, I thank a number of people. I thank Senator Lyn Allison for the long, hard work she has done on the choice legislation bill on behalf of the Democrats from 1997 through to 2001. I should also acknowledge the work of Senator Coonan and Senator Kemp, who is still in the chamber, in terms of the significant changes they have made to the model over the course of the last seven years. I should also acknowledge the work of our various Democrat advisersâMr Ley is sitting behind meâwho have worked very hard to get the fee disclosure stuff to a point satisfactory to us and the people who have been advising us. I commend this bill to the Senate. It is a very significant advance for workers on a social and economic basis and it shows what can be done when the Senate holds its line and works constructively with the government of the day.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>24487</page.no><name role="metadata">Wong, Sen Penny</name><name role="display">Senator WONG</name><name.id>00AOU</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIf I had not noticed where Senator Cherry was sitting I might have thought he was actually speaking on the <inline ref="R1580">Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2003</inline> as a government senator and as a member of the Liberal Party.

It is simply indicative of the government's political agenda, which is now apparently also the Democrats' political agenda, that they are referred to only as union funds.</para><para>I turn now to the bill before us and the agreement that the Democrats have now made with the government to pass this legislation. Choice can equal exploitation unless proper safeguards are in place. I think that is well understood in this chamber. It is why, previously, the choice legislation put forward by this government has been voted against by the majority of the chamber. What is needed to ensure that choice is not an equivalent to exploitation is a strong consumer protection regime and a regulatory framework that prevents or minimises exploitation. This legislation fails those tests.</para><para>Surely, in the area of superannuation, the primary public policy objectives we have are to ensure the maximisation of the retirement savings of Australians. Surely, that is the primary issue. Unfortunately, the government and the Democrats appear to have lost focus on that primary objective and what we see in the legislation before us is a triumph of ideology over reality. I think the question most Australians are entitled to ask is: why would the government put in place a regime that could lead to a lessening rather than a maximising of people's retirement incomes? Why has the government proceeded down this path? Is it because they think this will really increase retirement savings in this country? Is it because they really think that this will lead to maximisation of people's savings and incomes on retirement? </para><para>No, the government's agenda on this has always been clear: they have always wanted to pander to a certain end of the superannuation industryâto the retail fund endâand they have always wanted to reduce the membership of industry funds. It has been a political agenda from start to finish, not a policy agenda aimed at trying to increase and enhance the retirement savings of Australians. </para><para>I would like to deal with a number of furphies which appear to be both explicit and implicit in some of the contributions of Senator Cherry and also the government's statements on these issues. Firstly, there seems to be an argument, particularly from the other side of the chamber, that this choice of funds is a good thing because it will lead to people getting better returns on their investment. As I understand it, the argument is that people will be able to invest in funds which provide better returns than the industry fund they are in.</para><para>There is almost no evidence that that is the case. In fact in the published data over the last four years comparing the returns of funds in different sectors of the industry there appears to be almost no advantage to be gained by going into a retail fund or master trust. Rather, what you do see is an incredible imbalance when it comes to fees and charges. For many of the funds that the government say people should go into there is no increased benefit in terms of increased return, but there is a negative in terms of higher fees and charges. So the argument that this somehow improves people's ability to maximise their savings, on the evidence we have today, is entirely unsupported. The reality is that most industry funds have had comparable or even better returns than many of the other funds in the market at substantially lower cost.</para><para>Secondly, the government's position is that fees will go down. As I understand it, their position is that this regime will exert downward pressure on fees. This is simply not borne out by the evidence. In the unregulated sector, particularly the retail sector in this area, we already have higher fees and charges than we do in the industry fund sector. If we look at experiences overseasâand Senator Sherry mentioned the United Kingdom after the Thatcher reforms, where there was a deregulation of this sectorâwe see that this led to a massive increase in fees and charges. Of course the problem with fees and charges is not just people paying fees and charges this year; the problem is the effect that has long-term effect on their retirement savings. This is something that many Australians do not yet understandâthat is, what a one per cent, two per cent or three per cent annual ongoing fee or commission will cost them in terms of their final payout when they retire.</para><para>Another area the government have failed to regulate, an area that ought to have been regulated if they were serious about a safe choice regime, is exit fees. These are fees charged when a member seeks to take their money out of one fund and put it into another. The superannuation Senate select committee report last yearâor perhaps it was the year beforeâlooked at the portability regulations. There was one submission to the committee which listed an example of excessive exit fees. These range from nine per cent to 93 per cent of the balance in the account. What is the public policy objective in allowing those sorts of exit fees to be retained? There is none. The public policy objective ought to be to ban such exit fees. If the government were really serious about choice and really serious about allowing people to move between funds then they would regulate those fees which act as an effective barrier to portabilityâthat is, exit fees. But the regime in the legislation that the government are putting forward contains no such regulation. The position of the Labor Party, as articulated by the shadow minister in his speech, is that we would ban such exit fees. </para><para>I now want to look more broadly at the whole issue of fees, charges and commissions. I hope those of us in this chamber know that an annual ongoing fee or a percentage based fee can have an extraordinary effect on the income that you receive at retirement. A one or two per cent annual fee can reduce your final retirement income by between 22 and 40 per cent. A five per cent annual fee can reduce it by a huge 60 per cent. One would have thought that, if we were serious about enhancing the savings of Australians and if we were serious about ensuring that they are not exploited by the financial sector, we would do something about regulating these fees to ensure that Australians are not potentially exposed to being ripped off to that sort of extentâa 60 per cent reduction in their final retirement income savings.</para><para>I turn now to the issue of financial literacy. Senator Cherry argues that we are going to educate consumers. The unfortunate realityâand we would all probably like it to be differentâis that Australians are not particularly good at understanding a lot of information about financial decisions in this area. We have referred to the ANZ survey which found that 56 per cent of people with superannuationâthat is, a majorityâdid not have a good understanding of the fees and charges associated with their investment. Also, 40 per cent of people who had invested in managed funds did not have a good understanding of the fees and charges associated with their investment. The Australian Consumers Association, which gave evidence to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, made the following statement:</para><quote><para>We know in Australia, from ASFA-commissioned Ageing Agendas research and from the ANZ financial literacy survey, that consumers struggle to understand fees and commissions on many investment and superannuation products. When ACA and ASIC conducted the financial planning survey, even our panel of experts found it difficult in many cases to try and unravel the fee and cost structures of the plans and investments they were presented with as part of their assessment process.</para></quote><para>So the consumer body is telling us that even their experts who were assessing the appropriateness of some of the financial plans presented to them found it difficult to understand fees and charges. The available literature shows that the majority of Australians do not understand this. Yet somehow the Democrats and the government say, `We'll spend a bit of money on literacy and then they'll be able to understand it.' This is tied in with the Democrats' position that the fee disclosure model they have agreed with the government is sufficient. As Senator Cherry himself conceded, it does not look at long-term projections. It does not say to the mums and dads of Australia, `If you go into this fundâwhich has a one, two or three per cent annual fee on it over the rest of the life of your involvement with itâthis is the effect on your payout.' That is not information consumers will have before them. We already knowâfrom some of the statistics I have spoken about and other surveysâthat most of them will not understand that anyway, but we are allowing them to be ripped off by some unscrupulous sectors of the market.</para><para>Finally and in closing, I want to make some reference to the interdependency amendments that the Democrats have got up. I note that Senator Cherry spoke about this having been around in the immigration area. It certainly has. Again, it is something that was introduced by a Labor government, so I am glad to see the Democrats are yet again building on some of Labor's reforms. The issue of interdependency is an important one and this amendment is an advance but, just because you get one aspect of the bill extracted as your price for doing a deal which could potentially leave many more Australians out of pocket and in a worse financial position, does not mean you should support the legislation. In many ways I think it is too high a price to pay for a victory in one area to allow this piece of legislation to proceed. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>24491</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1580">Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2003</inline> today because, like Senator Wong, I was a member of the former Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. This issue has been around for a substantial period of time. More importantly, the deal that has been done between the Democrats and the government today allows people who are typically called snake oil salesmen to get their fingers into the pie of superannuation, which they desired to do back in the eighties, when superannuation was not the flavour of the day with the government or the Democrats. At that time, of course, government members, when they were in opposition, bitterly opposed the introduction of superannuation for a broader group of people out there in the work force who for a long time had been denied any access to a reasonable expectation not of a comfortable retirement but of a retirement where they could live with any dignity at all.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Wong covered the issue of literacy and I am going to come back to that because that really goes to the heart and the nub of the problem that many people will be facing out there in the community when they are faced with the issue of choice. But they will be under great pressure from those people who are euphemistically called snake oil salesmen to tumble into products which promise a lot but at the end of the day deliver nothing but despair to people in their retirement. That is not what superannuation is about. Superannuation is about giving people some sort of certainty and dignity in retirement. If the government were genuine about doing something for peopleâand we are talking about low-income peopleâthen it would have cut the contribution tax rather than cut the superannuation guarantee surcharge to high-income earners in this country. That would have been a positive step for low-income earners. We are talking about the funds that are held in many superannuation funds and currently in many industry funds by low-income earners. It is their one chance to have some sort of dignity in retirement, and that should be protected at all costs.</para><para>In casting my mind back, it is interesting to note that some of the points that I have made on this issue have been made for a substantial period of time. Nothing that the Democrats or the government have done here in coming to an arrangement on this issue has changed the substance of the debate. The substance of the debate has not changed at all. If there is to be choice there has to be informed choice, and that has been conceded pretty much across the industry, from my recollection, in the inquiries that have taken place. I want to refer briefly to the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation hearing of Thursday, 19 February, held in Sydney. A witness before us, Mr Rankin, who at that stage was the Executive Director of the Institute of Actuaries, said:</para><quote><para>... if choice is not properly exercised, there will be no net benefit to the individuals trying to accumulate savings for their retirement, and no ... benefit to the nation.</para></quote><para>This is about a net benefit to the individual in their retirement and a net benefit to the nation. If there is poor choice operating then there will be no net benefit to this nation or to individuals at all. He went on to say: </para><quote><para>If choice is poorly exercised, individuals and the nation will both be the losers. There is plenty of evidence to suggest that, without the capacity to make informed choicesâthat is, without addressing this asymmetry of information problemâpeople are likely to make poor choices.</para></quote><para>It is not that they will not make choices; they will make poor choices, and making poor choices will affect their hope and aspirations to retire with some reasonable dignity. He went on to say:</para><quote><para>They will make choices which are either too conservative for their personal circumstances or too risky for their personal circumstances.</para></quote><para>So if the government and the Democrats are serious they need to be serious about the problems that confront people in terms of choice. At the same hearing in Sydneyâand it was a very useful hearing indeedâMr Lockery of Towers Perrin gave evidence to the committee. It is interesting to note what he had to say. Talking about the so-called benefits of choice, he spoke about `greater competition leading to improved investment returns and lower administrative costs'. He said:</para><quote><para>Indeed, some members of smaller funds may achieve these benefits. On the other hand, we submit that such economic benefits will not be achieved for the vast majority of employees in large employer based or industry funds. Instead, in aggregate such employees are likely to suffer a net economic loss as a result of greater individual choice of superannuation fund.</para></quote><para>So, contrary to what the government and the Democrats are trying to do, the introduction of choice is not necessarily the panacea that it is being painted to beânot at all. There is no doubt that, where choice has been available to people, it has not necessarily been accessed very greatly at allâbut I will not spend a great deal of time on that.</para><para>Superannuation is a retirement benefit and it is a benefit, as I said, that was hard fought for and won, particularly by the trade union movement back in the eighties, which, with the cooperation of the then Hawke government, saw the introduction of superannuation on a more universal basis. I well remember when superannuation was being introduced back in the eighties because at that time I was the secretary of a branch of a major trade union, the SDA, in Queensland. The fighting that went on to get an industry fund up on that occasionâand we ended up with four funds for people to select from in the state of Queenslandâwas absolutely incredible. People came out of the woodwork to get every dodgy fund that they could recognised by the industrial commission on that occasion. The commission, to their credit, excluded a large number of funds that sought recognition under the award system and left one major industry fund and, at that stage, four minor funds. The commission understood that at the end of the day the superannuation benefit was for the retirement of low-paid workersâit was for their benefit and no-one else's benefit.</para><para>The argument that was not really waged in those days but that went to the essence of what the debate was about was that people wanted to get their hands on the huge amounts of money they knew would become available when superannuation became universal in the work force. That is what the people out there who had less than good intentions, as far as I am concerned, wanted. They eyed off the money and determined that there was a real pot of gold waiting for them to get their sticky fingers into. They were excluded. This now looms as their second opportunity to get a share of the pie that they missed out on such a long time ago.</para><para>As far as I am concerned there is an overriding moral obligation for those entrusted with the money of those people paying into superannuation funds to try to maximise their return. That is not always possible. However, choice is not or should not be about lining the pockets of some individuals or corporate entities by the use of high management charges, management fees, exit fees and the like. When it comes to the choice model, I have real doubts that those people who are confronted with the necessity of making a choice will be able to make, or will be allowed to make, an informed choice or a real choice, particularly if there is some prodding and pushing because the employer might be getting an advantage out of them being in one fund or another. People say that those things do not happen, but in the real world they do. </para><para>Choice should be about making an informed choice. However, as my colleague Senator Wong alluded to, many people do not have the literacy skills to make such an informed choice. I recall that, when we were doing the inquiry into the choice of fund legislation back in 1998 and earlier, it came out that there was an ABS survey about aspects of literacy. It was on assessed skill levels in Australia in 1996. One could say that this might be a little bit out of date. It may well be, but it is not going to be so much out of date as to be totally useless in this debate. The survey ranked literacy on a basis of levels 1 to 5. There were 2.6 million people who were found to be at level 1 at that stage, which meant that they had very poor literacy skills. Forty-seven per cent of the population surveyed were at levels 1 and 2âthat is, they had some or considerable difficulty using many of the printed materials encountered in daily life. That is the problem. These people do not have the skills necessary to make the informed choices. As Senator Wong alluded to, there are those who cannot even make a choice in the proper sense at all because they do not have the skills that are required or are necessary to deal with complex forms. These are people who are deemed to be quite literate people in the first instance.</para><para>In an article by Robyn Hartley titled `The social costs of inadequate literacy', a report to an international literacy year symposium in 1989, the author talks about the social costs of the lack of literacy skills. In her article she says:</para><quote><para>Even highly literate people have trouble understanding some documents and forms. Those with inadequate literacy skills have no chance of understanding them. Documents which are based on legislation often tend to be particularly obscure.</para></quote><para>In the same article, she goes on to say:</para><quote><para>However, much still remains to be done. Re-design of forms may well help the majority of people, but those who cannot read will still be unable to cope without assistance.</para></quote><para>So we have a real challenge in the choice format that is being brought forward to us because it advocates substantial reading material that people will need to understand such that they supposedly can make a choice. But it is a fact of life that people do not have the skills, capacity and ability to understand the material in the first instance so that they can make an informed choice. Hence they run the risk of putting one of their greatest assetsâtheir superannuationâat the mercy of those people who would like to plunder it for their own financial purposes. This is completely untenable as far as I am concerned and shows just what a shabby deal the Democrats and the government have entered into.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name></talker><para>âYou don't believe that, Senator Hogg.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name></talker><para>âI certain do, Senator Abetz, and I am glad you are here.

Does the minister support the concerns raised by Lieutenant Colonel Muggleton and has the Australian government made any formal representations to the United States government about the abuse of prisoners in Iraq to underline those concerns? In particular, has the government impressed upon the US the need for the current investigations into abuses to be comprehensive and thorough?

I will refresh my memory but I think that that is the case. In relation to abuses, it is true that they came to the attention of US authorities in January this year as a result of internal information, basically with a military police person bringing forward this information. Investigation was immediately commenced. Shortly thereafter, certain personnel were suspended, an investigation was completedâI should have said that, when they commenced this process, they announced it publiclyâand prosecutions have followed. In other words, proper process has promptly taken place after the allegations were brought to the attention of the appropriate authorities. It is therefore the position of the Australian government that the US is handling this matter appropriately and, as I said yesterday, that it certainly does not need lectures from us on the matter.</para></talk.start></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>24494</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMr President, I ask a supplementary question.

Wednesday, 30 June will mark a significant milestone in the transition towards a fully representative elected Iraqi government. Iraq will regain its full sovereignty and the interim government will have full responsibility for Iraqi affairs. Already we have seen the restoration of essential services, a revitalisation of economic activity and the rebuilding of institutions. The Iraqis have welcomed our contribution. The newly appointed Minister of Human Rights, Dr Amin, recently thanked Australia for our role in removing one of the world's most ruthless dictatorships, he said, since the Second World War. Obviously, security remains a key issue. The Iraqi Prime Minister, Dr Allawi, said this week that the international community can contribute to security by providing Iraq with training and equipment. This is where Australia and the Australian Defence Force are playing a crucial role. As the government has said many times, Australia remains committed to remaining in Iraq until the defence task is completed.</para></talk.start><para>Contrast this with Labor.

He was quite specific in saying that all ADF personnel in Iraq would be withdrawn. There were no qualifications to it. But Mr Rudd has been back-pedalling on that stance for the last few months, saying that Labor would leave a significant number of Australian troops to protect Australian diplomats. Mr Latham is still not bothered to get an operational briefing from the ADF on what our forces are doing in Iraq. Why won't he take the time to learn about the great work that our troops are doing in Iraq? Mr Latham's policy on the run will force the closure of the Australian Representative Office in Baghdad.

The only problem is that the speech will be given under the Chatham House rule. As the flyer states, neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker may be revealed. If this speech continues the nonsense put forward so far by Labor on important issues such as Iraq, I can understand why Senator Evans does not want to be associated with it. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Federal Police: Investigation</title><page.no>24496</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>24496</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI direct my question to Senator Ellison, the Minister for Justice and Customs.

I have said a number of times in this chamber that economic management is not a fluke, it does not just happen and it is not an accident. When you are getting unemployment rates of 5.5 per cent, the lowest in 23 years; when you get interest rates below six per cent; when you get inflation below three per cent; and when you reduce a debt, that you have inherited from a Labor government that was profligate in its spending, of $96 billion by repaying $70 billion of it and saving almost $6 billion in interest, then you are running the economy in a way which is strong, and you can return a social dividend to families and carers in our communityâfamilies with children in particularâwho are the backbone of our society.</para></talk.start><para>The budget is about giving families choice and about giving families opportunity. The new family assistance measures which were announced in the last budget will provide an additional $19.2 billion over five years. It is the largest package of assistance ever by an Australian government to families. Around two million families with 3.5 million children will benefit. By the end of today, two million families will have received an average payment of $1,200, because most families have two children, into their bank accounts. An eligible family with four children will receive $2,400. This is a bonus which is tax free and will not be taken into account when assessing eligibility for family tax benefit as income. So here we have a bonus to families, and it is a result of strong growth and good economic management by the Howard government. That is what has allowed us to deliver the extra financial support that families deserve. </para><para>Senator Eggleston asked me: are there any other alternative policies? Labor has repeatedly refused to guarantee that Australian families will be better off under Labor. Mr Latham had two opportunities on the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report </inline>a couple of weeks ago to make a commitment that families would not be worse off under Labor, and he failed to guarantee that. He failed to say to Australian families that they would not be worse off. What is more, Mr McMullan, the finance spokesperson for the Labor Party, has said that they will not guarantee the $600 increase per child in the family tax benefit beyond next financial year. I do not believe there is an alternative policy. Mr Latham said we would see it after the budget. Labor spokespeople have said they will give us their tax and their family policies after the budget. It is now well after the budget and Australian families are still waitingâAustralian families who have now got in their bank accounts $600 per child as a bonus to families, as a social dividend.</para><para>In addition, we have carers who are on carers payments receiving $1,000 and those on carers allowances receiving $600. That is what you can do when you have a surplus. Labor were borrowing against the futureâin the last year they were in government they borrowed $10 billion from future children and grandchildren. When you run the economy well, when you run the economy in surplus, you can afford to give a social dividend to families. They are receiving that by tonightâ2.2 million families with 3.5 million children will benefit from the way in which we run this economy.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Federal Police: Investigation</title><page.no>24497</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>24497</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is directed to Senator Hill representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

I have read of that terminology being used about detainees who might be placed in the management unit for a period of time. There are clear guidelines available to indicate to the management of the centre the circumstances under which that is appropriate. Threats of self-harm, for example, would make it appropriate. I think that the advice I had was that the rooms are in accordance with the specifications required in the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody so that people who are at risk of harming themselves can be under surveillance. I have seen stories that there are cameras in the showers and the bathroom facilities, but that is not correct. There are half-walls or walls that protect the privacy of people in that respect.</para></talk.start><para>If people are there because of some type of violent outburst, they may then be shifted from there to one of the units in the centre and graduate gradually back into the normal community. I do not regard that as a punishment regime; it is a proper management of people who are at risk. You would expect them to be watched. If someone threatens self-harm and we were not watching them 24/7, you would ask why. It is a proper duty of care that is being exercised. When people become violent and damage Commonwealth property or are at risk of damaging other persons, that has to be taken into account as well.

People who have any concern about it have access to a range of complaints if they think there is a justifiable complaint they want to make. They can do that through their legal advisers, the Red Cross, the UNHCR, the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the human rights commission. This is the most scrutinised program in the Commonwealth. I do not have a complaint about that. I probably agree that it should be as scrutinised as it is. Might I point out, Senator, that your use of the word `isolation' is convenient.

When the bonus goes out, as it has done since last Wednesday and will until tonight, families receive $600 per child. I have been advised by Centrelink that only customers eligible for the one-off bonus have been paid. They have advised me that these payments have been made to families currently in receipt of FTB A. It is up to families to inform Centrelink if their circumstances have changed.

In that sort of case, they have committed fraud against the Commonwealth and are not eligible for the $600 bonus. But in any situation where a family have, bona fides, applied for their family tax benefit and have recorded the right number of children they have received the $600 payment which has gone into their bank account, and it is theirs. If there is any case of fraudâif the person has misrepresented their situation to the Commonwealthâof course it would only be proper for us to take that back, and that happens.

I have said a very small numberâalmost handful in terms of the two million families who are being assistedâhave not always been honest about the number of children they have or about their circumstances. It is a very small proportion of families. The rest who are entitled to FTB A have got their $600. People who are eligible for a carers payment have got it. Some people are calling because they do not realise it is a benefit for people who are on carers payment or carers allowance. There will be some people who think they should get it.

He has not suggested yet how to do that. I have a responsibility for this when it comes to road safety because he has not addressed how you might blindfold children as you drive past a McDonald's sign or whether we have golden arches that fall down as young children are driven past.

Senator Harradine, if I recall correctly, referred to tobacco and alcohol misuse. The Commonwealth through the public health outcomes funding agreements, which are being finalised at the moment, is providing record funding to all the states to invest in campaigns in relation to the reduction of harm and informing people of the risks of alcohol abuse.

I understand that the alcohol industry has worked very assiduously over recent months in particular to look at the issue of, for example, prepackaged and premixed drinks. I know that Trish Worth, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing, has worked very hard on this issue and that the alcohol industry have responded in a way that brings credit to them in ensuring that those premixed drinks are marketed in a way that do not make them available to younger people in the community.

I am informed that the consistent instruction from the ASC and Cycling Australia to their lawyers was to handle the case as expeditiously as possible. My understanding is that a number of issues arose. The two major issues that took some time to process were the two-week period when the matter was referred to Lausanne by CAS for jurisdictional approval and a further two-week period when the parties were not able to agree on an arbitrator. So I have received an assurance, Senator Lundy, that the ASC did not at any time attempt to delay the process. Similarly, with regard to the allegations that the ASC lawyers did not mark the matter as requiring urgent attention when lodging papers on 10 March 2004, I am assured that this did not represent a delay. This debate will continue but the basic principle of all people involved here is that delays are not acceptable; that would be my view. I do not think, in light of what has now happened, that we should go back over this in great detail, to be quite frank, but I would be very concerned to make sure that any lessons that could be learnt from this are learnt and that the procedures of both the ASC and CAS are such that these types of delays do not occur in the future.</para></talk.start></continue></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>24504</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMr President, I ask a supplementary question.

Off she wanders into the wilderness again. Here we are debating something that we debated last week, and will no doubt debate again before parliament rises for the winter recess. The fact remains that this opposition have been in the opposition chairs for eight long yearsâand it has not been long enough, let me tell youâand they still have not released a policy.</para></talk.start><para>Today, by way of interjection, Senator Collins screeched, `Two weeks!' Well, let us see whether it is two weeks. The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Latham, said to us long before the budget, `Wait until the budget because we don't know what the books look like. After budget week we will release our policies.' That was five weeks ago and there are still no policies. So let us see whether Senator Collins is right when she screeches, `Two weeks!' I cannot believe that for eight years this opposition have been so bereft of policy that they cannot even come up with a family policy.</para><para>Last night on the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report </inline>Mr Latham could not defend their inability to come up with a family policy. He said that it was still being doneâstill being thought about and still being contemplated, after eight years in opposition. That is in vast contrast to this government, which has provided around two million familiesâwith 3Â½ million childrenâwith a benefit. By the end of today, about two million families will have received an average payment of $1,200 in their bank accounts. And what happens? The mob on the other side grizzle about it. That is all they can do: complain about it. Why? Firstly, because they did not think of it; and, secondly, they would never be able to afford it because they would never be able to run an economy whereby it was in a strong enough position to return a dividend to Australian families. </para><para>Let us take, for example, an eligible family with four children. They will receive $2,400. And all the opposition can do is say, `There's a problem with it and you shouldn't be getting it.' Why didn't they ever deliver such a policy in 13 years of government? In eight years of opposition they could not do it. This bonus is completely tax free and it is thanks to a strong economy. If this economy had continued the way it was going under Labor, with $96 billion of debt and growingâinstead of it being reduced by this government by $70 billion and decreasingâthen nothing would have happened for families. They would not have gotten any return whatsoever. This budget is about giving families choices and opportunities. All we hear from this carping opposition is criticism after criticism after criticism.</para><para>The new family assistance measures will provide an additional $19.2 billion over five years, and yet the opposition criticise them. It is almost breathtaking how this mob criticise everything while offering nothing as an alternative. One would have thought that, when they have had eight years to contemplate their navels and sulk about being in opposition, by nowâX number of weeks or months out from an electionâthey would have presented an alternative. But, no, even Mr Latham last night continued to say, `We're thinking about it.' I have to say that this is the largest package of assistance ever offered by an Australian government. That makes it even more amazing that the opposition can only sit there and criticise.</para><para>If they think that it is inherently wrong for families to get $1,200 then let them come out and say so. If they think they have a better alternative, let us hear it. But let us hear it today. Do not put it off again so that families still do not know what the policy is. After all, it is already five weeks late, seven years late or six years late. Let us hear what your alternative is today. Do not just come in here and criticise in the way that you have for weeks, because it is getting a little bit tiresome and tedious for the Australian people. They actually enjoy getting a dividend from a good government that has managed the economy well.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>24510</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âLet me remind Senator Knowles and other senators that it was the Hawke Labor government that introduced the system of family allowance and family allowance supplements. When it introduced those payments, the Hawke Labor government gave a massive boost to Australian families. So when Senator Knowles stands up and alleges that nothing was done about family payments, family allowances and so on during the term of the Labor government she is totally wrong. We actually created the system which has since been replaced by the family tax benefits A and B.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Knowles asks, `Where are your policies?' Let me tell you about the policies of this government. What they have done for the last seven years and eight or nine months is rip billions of dollars off the Australian taxpayer. They are the highest taxing government in the history of this country. They have ripped billions out of health, education and so on. Then, a few months before an election, they bring down a budget where they seek to give some of that money backâand they seek to do it in a very rushed manner. This week Australian families who are entitled to receive family tax benefit A are having payments of $600 per eligible child credited to their bank accounts. However, in their mad rush to get this payment into the bank accounts of families so that they can then call an election, hoping to ride in on the back of this, they have actually stuffed it up. Anyone who attended the estimates hearings would have heard the department itself acknowledge that it was going to have massive problems coping with the demand placed upon it administratively to get that money out so quickly. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AON</name.id><name role="metadata">Johnston, Sen David</name><name role="display">Senator Johnston</name></talker><para>âThey've done it.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name></talker><para>âThey have done it, Senator Johnston says.

We now know that there are many more situations where the payments being made to families are incorrect. When I asked Senator Patterson a specific question today about this issueânot about whether they should get the $600 but about what the government is going to do in situations where it has actually paid more into the accounts of families than they are legitimately entitled toâwhat was her response? She stood there and accused Australian families in that situation of committing a fraud, of not telling Centrelink of changes in their circumstances.

We now have situations where families are being paid more. What we want to know is: why has the situation been allowed to occur where, instead of just getting the $600 so-called bonus, families have had a further debt created for them? That is the question that Senator Patterson refused to answer. You cannot answer that question by trying to shift the blame onto those families, as if it is somehow their fault or their mistake. It is not their fault; it is not their mistake. The minister should get onto her department and get it fixed. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>24511</page.no><name role="metadata">Johnston, Sen David</name><name role="display">Senator JOHNSTON</name><name.id>00AON</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is this: what on earth are the opposition on about when the Australian government are so successful that we can deliver a family tax benefit of $600 and maintain a budget surplus? This is the fundamental question that the opposition simply want to choke upon. We have done the job of providing for the people of this nation so wellâwe can provide them with a family tax benefit like they have never had before and maintain a surplusâthat the opposition are absolutely jaundiced, because they could never do it as a result of their blatant and obvious mismanagement. That is the problem the opposition suffer. Here are families with dependent children being paid a reward and being assisted, and all the opposition can do is say what a terrible, shocking thing it is. </para></talk.start><para>The psychology of the Labor Party is that, when an overpayment is made, when a miscalculation of income is made, when someone gets a payment to which they are not entitled, they should blame someone else. That is the psychology behind the Labor Party's move here. They cannot come to terms with the fact that good economic management has delivered a dividend. Senator Collins called it a bribe. People who need assistance who have dependent children can benefit from a payment that will assist with all manner of things: schooling, transport, schoolbooks, clothingâyou think about it. This is a bribe according to the Australian Labor Party. I say this is a reward to the Australian people for electing a very good government. It is as simple as that, and the opposition are simply choking on the fact.</para><para>The More Help for Families measures will provide an additional $19.2 billion in assistance over the coming five years. This is the largest package of assistance ever put in place by an Australian government. Let me say that again: this is the largest package for families with dependent children ever put in place by an Australian government. What a good government it is. How did we do it? We did it through good, sound, strong economic management in the face of huge adversity: the Asian downturn, the US and European downturns and the SARS virus. You name itâwe confronted it and beat it. This is the More Help for Families package. Of course, the opposition do not understand what families need. The opposition have no concept of what benefits this will deliver to families. We are helping families with the cost of raising children. What could be wrong with that? We are improving rewards for work for most families and helping them balance their work and family responsibilities. This package builds on the significant reforms to family assistance undertaken by the Howard government in the new tax system, inaugurated in the year 2000, and the Family Tax Initiative, announced way back in 1996 by this very good government.</para><para>Around two million eligible families will receive a one-off payment of $600 per child for the family tax benefit part A and for other eligible children before 30 June 2004. As Senator Forshaw has already indicated, Centrelink are delivering on that promise. As I stand here today, the government has been true to its word. The money is going into the bank accounts as I stand here now. What a good cause and what a good payment it is. Eligibility for the new one-off $600 per child payment will be linked to: receipt of the family tax benefit part A on budget night for Family Assistance Office instalment customers; a confirmed entitlement to family tax benefit A on budget night in respect of the 2002-03 income year for lump sum claimants; and receipt by parents and nominees of dependent youth allowance for 16- to 17-year-old children, as mentioned on budget night. From 1 July 2004, there will also be an ongoing family tax benefit part A supplementâ <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>24512</page.no><name role="metadata">Webber, Sen Ruth</name><name role="display">Senator WEBBER</name><name.id>00AOT</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe only problem with what Senator Johnston was talking about is that it does not seem to be adequately linked to families that were in receipt of family tax benefit part A on budget night. As far as I am aware, there are no families with 22-year-old children that are eligible to receive family tax benefit part A, never mind the one-off $600 bonus that the government unveiled in its budget. So we need to get this straight. This is a massive systems failure. It is yet another systems failure on top of the fact that the system currently traps thousands of Australian families into debt in other ways. The other thing we need to understand very clearly is that, unlike what those opposite would have people believe, the Labor Party does support hardworking Australian families. The Labor Party supports returning to those hardworking Australian families the money that this government has clawed back from them over the last eight years. </para></talk.start><para>As I was saying, the fiasco of the implementation of the budget night one-off bonus, soon to be followed up by another one, highlights the current system and the problems within it. The current system actually penalises those who can least afford it. It penalises those families at the bottom end of the system who have the greatest difficulty in estimating their income. They are already penalised. To then receive extra payments they are not necessarily entitled to in units of $600 forces those families into massive debt. Australian families, especially hardworking, low-income Australian families, deserve a lot better from this government. As it is implemented, the current family tax benefit system is ill-conceived. Through no fault of their own, families, particularly those with 22-year-old children or those who have received $600 for children they do not actually have, find themselves as debtors to the Commonwealth.</para><para>This is a system where 30 per cent of recipients end up making incorrect estimates of their income. Surely that does not mean that 30 per cent of recipients are fraudulent, as the minister would have us believe, or incompetent, as other members of the government would have us believe; it means that the system is too complex and that it traps these families in debt. Let us take, for example, a family that gets its income estimate wrong by $1,800 per annum. That is $34 per week. That is not a rort; it could just be that the income earner in that family forgot about the extra one or two hours of overtime they work every now and then. That family will then end up with a debt of $1,400 to the Commonwealth. Let us hope that they do not get any of those extra $600 one-off bonuses that the government seems to be popping into people's bank accounts, whether they are eligible or not.</para><para>So what does this government do? Its response to the fiasco of the family tax benefit payment system is to blow millions of dollars on advertising. I suppose that is actually useful for the families that are suddenly discovering they are getting this payment when they are not eligible for it, so they will actually understand why their bank accounts are going up by units of $600 when they were not expecting any payment at all or were expecting a lower payment. But we need to ask ourselves: what else could that money have been spent on? It could have been spent on fixing the system that administers the family payments. It could have been spent on providing increased support for those hardworking, low-income families. It could have been spent on repairing the damage caused by the decline in bulk-billing, for instance. But, instead, this government blows millions of dollars on advertising, gives tax cuts to the big end of town and, through its own ineptness, is going to force more families into debt.</para><para>It is ironic that this government is championing the fact that it is cracking down on debt for Centrelink customers. They are having a debt crackdown, apparently. Yet, at the same time, this government is forcing a whole raft of new families to become debtors to the Commonwealthâfamilies who probably never before in their lives had problems with the family tax benefit system but who through no fault of their own are being paid in units of $600 for children who are 20, 22 or who knows how old, for children who do not exist or for three children when in fact they have two. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><petition.group><petition.groupinfo><title>PETITIONS</title><page.no>24514</page.no></petition.groupinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1</name.id><name role="metadata">The Clerk</name><name role="display">The Clerk</name></talker><para>âPetitions have been lodged for presentation as follows:</para></talk.start></interjection><petition><petitioninfo><title>Education: Funding</title><page.no>24514</page.no><no.signed>453</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>XE4</name.id><name.id>009D2</name.id></name.ids><names><name>Senator Bolkus;Senator Buckland</name></names></petitioninfo><quote><para>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</para><para>The petition of the citizens of Australia undersigned shows:</para><para>A well funded Public Education system is vital to the maintenance of a fair and democratic Australian society.</para><para>We need our public schools to be well resourced.</para><para>This requires the Federal Government to provide a fairer model for funding Australian schools.</para><para>Your petitioners therefore request the Senate to: </para><para>Ensure that the funding policies of the Commonwealth Government are reformed to provide increased and fairer funding for public schools.</para></quote><presenter><no.signed>202</no.signed><talk.start><talker><name role="display">Senator Bolkus</name><name.id>XE4</name.id></talker><para>Senator Bolkus (from 202 citizens) and</para></talk.start></presenter><presenter><no.signed>251</no.signed><talk.start><talker><name role="display">Senator Buckland</name><name.id>009D2</name.id></talker><para>Senator Buckland (from 251 citizens).</para></talk.start></presenter></petition><petition><petitioninfo><title>Education: Funding</title><page.no>24514</page.no><no.signed>32</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>009D2</name.id></name.ids><names><name>Senator Buckland</name></names></petitioninfo><quote><para>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</para><para>The petition of certain citizens of Australia undersigned draws the attention of the Senate:</para><para>A well funded Public Education system is vital to the maintenance of a fair and democratic Australian society.</para><para>Legislation that will allocate the share of federal funding going to government and non-government schools will soon be debated in Parliament.

The IPU now is the international organisation of the Parliaments of sovereign states. Its assemblies foster dialogue and parliamentary diplomacy among legislators. 140 countries are members of the IPU and over 120 countries send delegations to the IPU assemblies.</para><para>The IPU has six core areas of activity and these are:</para></quote><para>	The promotion of representative democracy;</para><para>	International peace and security;</para><para>	Sustainable development;</para><para>	Education, science and culture;</para><para>	Human rights and humanitarian law; and</para><para>	Women in politics</para><quote><para>The IPU addresses these and other issues primarily through its three standing committees. These committees debate issues of international significance, appoint drafting committees that sit for many hours formulating draft resolutions which are in turn considered and adopted by the plenary session of the IPU. </para><para>The Australian delegation always makes a strong contribution to the work of the IPU committeesâthis is perhaps not surprising given our considerable experience with committees in this parliament. It is interesting to note that over the last three years, the IPU has referred about fourteen matters to drafting committees and Australia has been elected to eight of them and has chaired three. I don't think many countries could match this level of participation. </para><para>In Mexico City, delegates attended and participated in the work of the three committees. Additionally, Ms Maria Vamvakinou, the Member for Calwell, did outstanding work when she was elected to the drafting committee on an emergency agenda item on the situation in Israel and Palestine that was added to the IPU's agenda.</para><para>It should also be noted that Senator Ferris was elected to the co-ordinating committee of women parliamentarians and that I was elected as a Vice President of the IPU's Second Committee which covers Sustainable Development, Finance and Trade.

Delegates discuss matters of mutual interest as set out in an agreed agenda. Formal resolutions are adopted on the agenda items and the report provides the text of these 25 resolutions.</para><para> Australia has been an active participant in the Forum since it was established in 1993 and many Senators and Members have now attended the annual meetings. We were fortunate this time in that all four delegatesâmyself, the delegation leader Mr Jull, the Member for Oxley, Mr Ripoll and the Member for Stirling, Ms McFarlaneâwere seasoned APPF delegates. This provided us with an understanding of the rules and practices of the forum which allowed us to make a sound contribution to a number of aspects of the meeting. </para><para>The subject matter of the forum included political and security issues, economic issues, an agenda item called âcooperation for the stability and prosperity of the regionâ and the future work of the APPF.</para><para> Australia prepared four draft resolutions covering </para></quote><para>	the political and security situation in the region</para><para>	combating international terrorism</para><para>	protection of the Pacific Ocean's biomass including relevant multilateral agreements and</para><para>	cooperation on the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. </para><quote><para>All our drafts were eventually adopted following negotiations and amendments suggested by other countries, three of them being jointly sponsored with other delegations. </para><para>The item entitled âfuture of the APPFâ was a particularly significant one at this meeting. After thirteen years service to the APPF, His Excellency Yasuhiro Nakasone resigned as Presidentâfollowing his retirement as a member of the Japanese House of Representatives. Mr Nakasone, a former Prime Minister of Japan and the founding President of the APPF, leaves a great legacy. </para><para>He was honoured by a unanimous decision to invite him to continue his association with the APPF by becoming Honorary Chairman. In this role he will advise the Executive Committee and provide continuity and leadership into the future. On behalf of this delegation and previous Australian delegations to the APPF, I would like to place on record our gratitude to Mr Nakasone for the great contribution he has made to the Forum. We wish him well for the future. </para><para>The search for a replacement APPF President failed to identify a candidate who would agree to take on the role for the three years provided for in the APPF rules. Accordingly, the rules were altered to provide for a rotating President. For the future, the host parliament of the next annual meeting will nominate both a President and a Chairman of the annual meeting, to serve for a year. The Parliament of Vietnam will provide the first annual President.</para><para>The APPF provides an important opportunity for Australian parliamentarians to press Australia's interests. This is done formally through our draft resolutions. We also promote Australia's national interests during speeches in the plenary and in bilateral meetings with other delegations. In addition, APPF delegations have the opportunity to encourage other parliamentarians in our region to understand Australian policies and priorities through the numerous informal occasions which arise throughout the meeting. </para><para>In relation to activities other than those which took place in the plenary session, I would like to particularly mention the role played by the Member for Stirling in her leadership of the Technological Working Group. This is the second year in a row that Jann McFarlane has chaired the group, taking over the role from the Member for OxleyâBernie Ripoll. The Beijing meeting of the Technological Working Group was significant for preparing and having adopted by the plenary, a statement of its aims and objectives. The work done by the group in keeping a watching brief on the APPF website will be most valuable in the future because in the absence of a permanent secretariat, the website is the contact point for information on the APPF. </para><para>Delegation leaders met privately with President Hu. The President told Mr Jull that he was overwhelmed by the hospitality he received during his visit to Australia last October, particularly from Senators and Members following his address to them. He was very optimistic about future relations between China and Australia.  </para><para>The Australian delegation enjoyed a successful bilateral meeting with the Indonesian delegation. These meetings have become a feature of APPF meetings and the opportunity to have a frank discussion with our near neighbours is much valued by both delegations. </para><para>The delegation wishes to thank the organisers of the meeting, especially His Excellency Wu Bangguo, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Mr Lu Congmin, Chairman of the Organising Committee of the meeting and all the staff who did an excellent job of organisation. </para><para>We also thank those who supported the delegation in practical and policy advice matters including staff from the Parliamentary Library and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Our particular thanks go to Larissa Ashwin from the post in Beijing who helped us in matters practical and diplomatic. Ms Brenda Herd from the Parliamentary Relations Office was characteristically efficient and helpful and we thank her also.</para><para>Finally, I would like to thank the leader of the delegation, Mr Jull and my fellow delegates. We worked together as an effective team to represent and promote Australia's interests. </para></quote><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BILLS RETURNED FROM THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>24525</page.no><id.no></id.no></debateinfo><para>Message received from the House of Representatives agreeing to the amendments made by the Senate to the following bill:</para></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (NO. 1) 2004-2005</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>24525</page.no><id.no>R2037</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2004-2005</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R2040</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 2) 2004-2005</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R2036</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 5) 2003-2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>24525</page.no><id.no>R2041</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 6) 2003-2004</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R2042</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>EXCISE AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COMPLIANCE MEASURES) BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R2003</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS AMENDMENT (DIRECT DEDUCTIONS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R2005</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (INTERCEPTION) AMENDMENT (STORED COMMUNICATIONS) BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R2061</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>24525</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bills received from the House of Representatives.</para><para>Senator IAN CAMPBELL (Western AustraliaâMinister for Local Government, Territories and Roads) (3.41 p.m.)âI indicate to the Senate that these bills are being introduced together.

However, movement of excisable goods for exportation may occur under the existing provisions without permission of the ATO. Accordingly, the ATO is unable to apply to these goods the usual compliance and revenue protection measures that it is able to apply to all other movement of excisable goods. </para><para>The amendments in the bill ensure that ATO permission is required for delivery of excisable goods for exportation. The bill extends to the exportation of excisable goods the provisions that enable the duty equivalent to be called up where a person entrusted with excisable goods fails to keep the goods safely or cannot satisfactorily account for them. </para><para>Under this bill current provisions that regulate the movement of tobacco leaf will be extended to tobacco seed and plant and permissions relating to movement of these goods for exportation will be required. </para><para>This bill also extends the criteria that enable immediate destruction of seized forfeited goods. Currently goods must be perishable and a danger to public health. However, in most cases seized excisable goods and tobacco seed, plant or leaf do not satisfy both the perishable and danger to public health criteria. The seized goods may be perishable only without special storage arrangements, or may not be perishable but do not meet any relevant standards that would enable them to be returned to the market. </para><para>The amendments enable seized goods to be destroyed immediately where they are perishable or a danger to public health or safety or do not meet any applicable standards. The amendments provide for the use of evidentiary certificates in proceedings relating to those goods and extend the compensation provisions to include where the Court is satisfied the grounds for disposing of the goods did not exist.</para><para>Finally, the bill amends the confidentiality provisions of the Excise Act to enable information about licences, permissions and remission of duty arrangements to be made available to a second person dealing with, or proposing to deal with, the goods covered by the licence, permission or remission documents. </para><para>The present confidentiality provisions prevent such information from being disclosed to a second person dealing with the goods.

Parts of this Bill will also align the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 with social security law in relation to the deeming of certain income and assets, the income and assets treatment of superannuation benefits and compensation recovery provisions.</para><para>Currently, direct deduction arrangements are available for recipients of the service pension or the war widow's/widower's income support supplement. Such arrangements allow veterans and war widows/widowers to have deductions made from their benefits for regular payments such as rent to State housing authorities.</para><para>These arrangements are not currently available for disability pensions or war widow's/widower's pension. This Bill will extend the direct deduction provisions to allow these pensioners to arrange such deductions from their fortnightly payments.</para><para>This Bill will enhance the allowance paid to our two surviving recipients of the Victoria Cross. The Victoria Cross allowance is currently $2808 per year and is paid annually in advance. Under these amendments, the allowance will be increased by 15 per cent to $3230 per year, and it will be subject to annual indexation in line with movements in the Consumer Price Index. These amendments reflect changes in the allowance provided to British VC recipients by the British Government and recognise the special place held by Australia's Victoria Cross winners. The amendments will also make minor reforms to the provisions for decoration allowance.</para><para>Amendments in this bill will enhance support for veterans' partners who received the social security age pension or wife pension through my Department.</para><para>On the death of a veteran, where the veterans' death is accepted as being related to their service, the partner becomes eligible for the war widow's/ widower's pension. However, they currently are required to lodge a formal claim to receive the war widow/widower's income support supplement.</para><para>This Bill will provide automatic eligibility for partners in these circumstances to receive the income support supplement, removing an administrative burden from widows/widowers coming to terms with the loss of their partner.</para><para>In a further measure of support for veterans' partners, the Bill will ensure eligibility for the partner service pension includes certain partners who are resident in Norfolk Island. These amendments correct an anomaly in the provisions that meant certain partners resident in Norfolk Island were not eligible for the partner service pension.</para><para>Many of these amendments represent relatively small changes to our repatriation legislation. However, this âfine-tuningâ of the Veterans' Entitlements Act is important to those members of the veteran community who will benefit from these changes, and the Government sees this legislation

question time I was speaking on the <inline ref="R1580">Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2003</inline> about the issue of literacy and the difficulties that many people will face when it comes to choice of funds, given that they do not have the required literacy and numeracy skills to be able to read the type of key feature statements that will be presented to them. In many instances they will be forced by some very slick operators into making quite unwise choices about the thing that is most important to themâtheir retirement benefit, which will give them dignity in retirement. None of what I have heard the government or the Democrats say in coming to an agreement on this bill has overcome that major difficulty. One of the major difficulties that face this bill is the fact that many people do not know how to cope with the information that they will be bombarded with in seeking to move from the fund that they are in to another fund. Whilst choice might seem all well and good in theory, the practical reality for some people will be that they will have a great deal of difficulty in dealing with it. </para></talk.start><para>One would say that there is an option for them to do nothing. That is quite true, but in some instances they will be presented with a very slick salesperson who will do their utmost to sway them out of the fund that they are in into an inferior product where there could well be higher charges, and the person will be none the wiser. It may take them some substantial period of time to discover the error of their ways. However, though, that may well be too late in some instances because they may be close to retirement and the accrual that they could otherwise have earned out of a sound fund will have dissipated in their case. There are real concerns also that a number of slick salespersons will hop into this area and avail themselves of the opportunity to take down people who are most vulnerable. Until the government really had addressed that issue, they should not have proceeded with this legislation. Whilst it was always going to suit those who are skilled in the area of investment, those who do not have the skills are going to be the people who suffer the most.</para><para>I am sure that my colleague Senator Sherry will deal with this at length when it gets into the committee stage. Undoubtedly, it is not a good deal for a number of people in the Australian work force where their funds have been fairly well protected up to date. They will now be exposed to the prospect that their superannuation could be dissipated by dodgy funds and dodgy investment practices to boot. I believe that I have said enough on this bill, and the sooner it gets to the committee stage the better.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>24531</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Australian Greens will not be supporting the <inline ref="R1580">Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2003</inline> for the reasons that have been outlined very clearly by previous speakers. We would have been happier to get from the government better consumer protection in such things as the cost of getting into new funds, the return when the person making the payments is in the funds and the cost of an exit fee, if they are unhappy. All of these things should be easily quantifiable to the consumer.</para></talk.start><para>The Greens will be supporting many of the amendments that Labor brings forward, but we recognise the weight of numbers as the government and the Democrats will be able to get the bill safely through. The Greens were very happy to look at choice and consumer safeguards. However, the Democrats have been able to negotiate with the government to come to an arrangement they think is satisfactory. We do not believe that that is the case. A lot of people without great riches may well get their savings purloined by organisations which have multimillion dollar budgets, for example, simply to advertise their wares in the retail sectorâfunds which ought to have been going back to the consumer in their retirement.</para><para>These things worry us a great deal. We are in favour of choice but we believe consumers cannot exercise that choice unless it is presented simply. We believe it is up to government to find the prescription that makes it easy for consumers to know what is best for them in the jungle of competing concerns in this huge and very lucrative business. We also believe that, for instance when it comes to ethical investment, consumers should be guided and know that they are being safely guided by the information they get. There should be a choice for people to not invest in funds that are wood chipping Tasmania's forests, that are mining for uranium in Kakadu or that are involved in the live animal export trade or in genetically modified crops, for example. Those things are very important, and they are going to become increasingly important. However, we foresee that this legislation will be back in this parliament in a few years time with some pretty sad stories to go with itâand they will have been unnecessary. </para><para>It is up to the parliament to protect the consumer, and one of the best ways of protecting the consumer is to ensure that information is simple and trustworthy. That is not spelt out in this legislation; therefore it is unsatisfactory. We can understand why the Australian Consumers Association believes that better legislation should have been forthcoming. When it comes to ending the discrimination against same-sex couples or people living in another form of arrangement of dependency, we are totally in favour of that part of the legislation and we will be supporting the amendments to the legislation that will bring that into being.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>24532</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt gives me great pleasure to sum up on behalf of the government on this very important, indeed, landmark <inline ref="R1580">Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2003</inline> that provides for choice of superannuation. The government have been committed to the idea that workers should be able to decide where their superannuation goes since, as I understand it, the mid-1990s. Choice of fund was an election commitment of the government in 1996. We believe that it is an unassailable proposition and indeed a fundamental democratic right that people should have a say in how their own money is managed. This is a right that has been denied to employees for far too long, with seriously adverse consequences for workers. But choice is about more than workers' rights; it is also about good retirement incomes policy. It is about creating a competitive environment that ensures superannuation providers are working as hard as possible for the retirement incomes of all Australians.</para></talk.start><para>Choice is sound policy and this is a good bill. In summary, it gives people the basic right to control their own superannuation. It will encourage employees to take a greater interest in their retirement savings. It will promote competition and place downward pressure on fees and charges. It minimises the costs on employers. It comes into effect after the introduction of a robust, comprehensive and world-class consumer protection regime. It will come into effect after the introduction of a new fee comparison model that will assist people to shop around. It is vitally important that employees are involved in decisions that affect their super. Choice of fund not only will empower workers to make decisions but it will also allow them to have a better connection with their superannuation savings. Lack of choice cements the current set and forget mentality and the general apathy that many Australians have towards their retirement savings and goals.</para><para>One of the biggest winners from choice will be part-time and casual workers and those working multiple jobs. Many of these people are low-income workers in Labor heartlands who seem to have been forgotten by the Labor Party. Choice will allow those working multiple jobs to consolidate their super into one account and avoid paying multiple account fees, which can devastate and completely eat away retirement savings. Choice is expected to lead to a genuine increase in retirement incomes for such people. I lost count a long time ago of the number of letters I have received from workers locked into underperforming or expensive funds, pleading for the right to be able to change funds. Many workers are provided with a choice but, for those who are not, it can result in a grave disadvantage because they are shut into a one size fits all model and they are really, in many ways, shut out from the process of saving for their own retirement. It is no coincidence that there are currently $7 billion and 4.6 million accounts on the Australian tax office's lost members register. There is a serious disconnect between workers and their money. </para><para>The choice of fund initiative will be supported by a substantial education campaign. The government committed long ago to $14 million for the ATO to run such a campaign. Contrary to the dire warnings from naysayers, the campaign will be responsible. Subject to the views of an independent advisory committee, the campaign will encourage employees to take an interest in what is being offered, as different options, of course, suit different people. It will make it clear that there is no need to change funds and that a person's best option may be to stay where they are. That would be the choice. I will be moving amendments to the legislation later in the debate. These amendments will broaden the range of people eligible to receive superannuation death benefits and will provide greater certainty to people in interdependent relationships. The amendments will specify that employers must pay superannuation contributions to a fund that offers life insurance if employees do not exercise choice. The amendments will also prohibit superannuation funds from providing kickbacks or benefits to an employer or union on the basis that one or more of their employees are members of the super fund.</para><para>I do warmly welcome and commend the Democrats' support of choice, and I particularly thank Senator Cherry for his efforts. I am sure that the Democrats recognise that this bill is, overall, good for Australian workers. I think it is disappointing that, despite many years of debate about this matter, Labor's position on choice does not seem to have moved very much. Let me start with Labor's first major furphy, that choice is unsafe, and just look at the facts. I think the facts are pretty straightforward. Choice has been operating successfully in Western Australia since 1998. ASFA estimates that 32 per cent of Australians already have choice; this equates to millions of Australians who already have choice. So where is the evidence of unsafe practices? I do not think Labor has produced one iota of evidence. There is a fundamental contradiction to the arguments of the Labor Party that choice is unsafe, when so many people can already choose and the sky has certainly not fallen in.</para><para>Despite this fearmongering, I firmly believe that overseas experiences in the United Kingdom and Chile will not be repeated in Australia. The reason I believe this is that we have been mindful of those very unhappy practices and events and have done something to prevent them. First, Australia has a robust and comprehensive consumer protection regime that is world's best practice; second, Australia has an experienced and active consumer protection regulator in ASIC; third, super funds are heavily regulated under the SI(S) Act; and, finally, millions of Australians, as I have said, already have choice and there is no evidence of this type of behaviour.</para><para>It is difficult to understand how Labor can continue to oppose a fundamental right and a policy that will substantially boost retirement incomes on such flimsy, lightweight and unsubstantiated evidence. If you extend the unsafe argument, Labor would deny Australians the right to choose their bank account or home loan or indeed health cover. Labor clearly think Australians are either too uninformed, too stupid or too inexperienced to be trusted to make decisions for themselves. They would rather employers make these decisions for us. Australians should never accept such policy in respect of their banking or home loan and they certainly should not accept it in relation to their superannuation. </para><para>Labor speaks of risk and Labor speakers have spoken of risk in the second reading debate, but what about the countervailing risks? No-one has said a word about the risk of leaving employees in underperforming funds or funds that simply do not suit their particular needs. What about the risk that superannuation funds will become complacent if members cannot leave? What about the risk to retirement incomes of forcing people to maintain multiple accounts? I think that Labor's approach to this ignores these risks. I think there is a worrying authoritarian streak creeping into the Labor Party's approach to policy not only in respect of superannuation but even in respect of kids doing homework. Labor wish to deny Australians the basic right of self-determination. They oppose good policy on the basis of flawed logic and unsubstantiated arguments.</para><para>Labor has talked about complexity. Those in the Labor Party would know a great deal about complexity because what Labor has said about superannuation policy appears to be littered in red tape, regulation, complexity and prescription. The choice bill is relatively straightforward. Affected employers give their employees a standard choice form produced by the ATO. If employees want to make a choice, they provide the relevant details to their employer. This is really not rocket science.</para><para>Another furphy is that choice is an attack on industry funds. I do not see any evidence of that; in fact, it is quite the opposite. I refer to the evidence given by industry fund Cbus to the Senate committee in 2002. Cbus acknowledged that choice in Western Australia had led to an increase in their own membership. I also note comments by REST Chief Executive, Neil Cochrane, in March this year that super choice would result in more people moving to industry funds. In a more competitive market, industry funds may well be the winners. Again I think the Labor Party has used both flimsy and unsubstantiated arguments that simply do not amount to real evidence.</para><para>We do know of course that on the odd occasion when the guard is let down even those opposite have occasionally supported choice. I actually came across a comment by Senator Conroy to the Senate on 24 March this year, when he said:</para><quote><para>The choice of a superannuation fund is one of the most important investment decisions that any Australian will make.</para></quote><para>I wholeheartedly endorse that comment. Senator Conroy acknowledges the importance of choosing a super fund, and I would hope that he would stand up to his caucus and support the government's legislation and allow Australian workers to take what he recognises as a very important decision.</para><para>There has been a lot of talk about disclosure. The government recently announced a single fee-comparison model. It contains a single figure that consumers can use to compare funds. What is the Labor Party's alternative to this? It appears to be complex projections over a number of years that would add pages to disclosure documentation and be likely to confuse and mislead rather than being simple. Sixty to 80 pages is overwhelming, but about four different projections would add even more detail. You do not need a projection to identify the cheapest fund; you only need a simple fee-comparison table. It is one-page long and it is simple, as Senator Cherry said. That is what was aimed for and that is what we ended up with.</para><para>The irony of Labor's position is that they claim to favour disclosure and want people to know the fees they pay, but they will not let consumers do anything about it. We do need to tell Australians about the fees they pay. Some Australians, unfortunately, are in high-cost funds. We need to take every step to highlight this point. Australians should be equipped with the ability to do something about this and to understand it. It is a recipe for maximum frustration to have choice but no ability to understand what you are choosing between. </para><para>Exit fees have been put up as a barrier to choice, but once again it is a bit of a straw man. Exit fees are not the barrier to choice. The only barrier to choice is, indeed, opposition in this place. Labor wants to ban entry and exit fees. For some time industry has advised that high exit fee products are no longer marketed on current superannuation products. It is true that high exit fee products were prevalent during Labor's watch in the 1980s and 1990s and those people who suffer high exit fees on old life insurance products not only deserve some sympathy but can thank previous Labor inaction for the fact that that is what they face.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>âThey had been around for 40 years.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>2M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name></talker><para>âYou did nothing about it, Senator Sherry. Banning exit fees will do nothing to lower overall fees. You do not have to be very perceptive to realise that, if you ban one kind of fee, funds will simply raise another fee to compensate. The approach to fees is akin to locking the window to keep the burglars out while leaving the back door open. Focusing on fees indicates a focus on the symptoms rather than the problem. The problem is a lack of competition and a superannuation environment that in some respects exhibits monopolistic characteristics, but high fees are a symptomâa symptom of inadequate competition. Those who suggest that if you regulate exit fees you fix the problem are really just looking at a symptom. The only effective way to reduce total fees is competition. The evidence is everywhere, and Labor knew this back in the 1980s and 1990s. For example, Labor introduced choice in the telecommunications markets. The result? Dramatically lower call costs. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I also refer to some comments on this issue by the now Labor leader, Mr Latham, who appears to acknowledge the great benefits of competition. I think it is worth recording Mr Latham's comments on this. He said:</para><quote><para>I have always believed in competition as the best way of motivating companies to upgrade their products, skill their workforce, move forwardâyou know, competition is the discipline, the driving force, to get productivity, and that is the essence of growth.</para><para>There aren't too many lessons around the world if you wind back competition and go to monopoly that you end up with a growing economy.</para></quote><para>Yet despite these comments, Labor, at least in the Senate, opposes procompetitive policies in the Australian superannuation sector in favour of what has been clearly demonstrated to be ineffective regulation and red tape. I think it demonstrates the hypocrisy of Labor's position on choice that has been sustained at least since 1996.</para><para>Australians want choice. Australians deserve choice. The evidence against choice is flimsy and does not stack up to even half-baked scrutiny. The opposition to the government's position on choice is based on scaremongering and mistruths and a blatant disregard for the retirement aspirations and outcomes of ordinary Australians and Australian workers. The opposition to choice is completely out of touch with the needs and desires of ordinary Australians. I believe that the Labor Party is out of step on this one. I am very pleased that the Democrats not only have seen the light but have worked very hard and diligently with the government to get to a position where we now offer a much improved bill and one that will meet the needs of Australians to be able to exercise choice. The legislation gives employees the basic right to be able to choose where their retirement savings are invested. It will improve the efficiency of the superannuation system and increase individuals' connections with their retirement savings. I commend this important bill to the Senate. </para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the amendment (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sherry's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>16:14:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.</para></division.header><para>(The PresidentâSenator the Hon.

Where an employee does not choose a fund, an employer must choose an eligible choice fund into which to make contributions on behalf of that employee. The amendments will require the employer to choose an eligible choice fund that satisfies the requirements to offer life insurance, as prescribed in the regulations. An employer will have to provide a new standard choice form to their employees if they change the fund they contribute to on behalf of their employees.</para><para>Amendment (4), which relates to conduct relating to fund membership, inserts a new subsection into the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 to prohibit a trustee of a regulated superannuation fund or an associate of a trustee fund from providing or withholding benefits to a person on the basis that one or more of their employees is a member of the superannuation fund. That is the so-called kickback amendment. Amendments (1) and (5) relate to the extension of definition of dependant. Schedule 2 of the bill amends the definition of dependant in the Income Tax Assessment Act, the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act and the Retirement Savings Accounts Act to include people in an interdependency relationship. The amendments will prescribe that dependency will exist where two people have a close personal relationship, live together and where one or both provides financial support, domestic support and personal care. An exception is also provided so that where, due to a disability, people have a close personal relationship but are otherwise unable to meet the other criteria, they will still fall within the definition of a dependant. The government has in mind that, for instance, two people could be injured in a motor vehicle accident and be so disabled as to be unable to live together but otherwise retain a close personal relationship.</para><para>These amendments enable death benefit superannuation payments to be received tax free by a wider range of people. Regulations will also be allowed to assist in the application and interpretation of these provisions. The reason for that is that it is simply impossible to imagine every circumstance that may arise, and regulations will allow some flexibility to respond to instances that may arise. These amendments commence on royal assent. Item 1 of this schedule also amends the definition of dependant in the Income Tax Assessment Act to improve its readability. This is just a stylistic change and does not of itself change the meaning of the definition. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>24541</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have a number of specific questions, and I think this is the time to deal with them. Firstly, I point out to the chamber and to those who are listening that a second reading amendment moved by the Labor Party was just defeated. That amendment, if it had been carried, would have required the establishment of a system whereby all fees, charges and commissions payable on superannuation were reported to the regulatorâin this case the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. APRA, as it is known, is to commence a new data series of information, I understand, from 1 July and it is collecting some data on the expenses of funds. However, my understanding from information provided at Senate estimates is that it will not include commissions. Commissions are, at least on some superannuation products, an important element. The Labor amendment would have required, if it had been passed, a report of all the fees, charges and commissionsâof which there are many different typesâto be reported to the regulator. Then the regulator would have been required to report in its data series all of the fees, charges and commissions. We believe that in a so-called choice environment the competition is supposed to thrive. The government claims it will thrive. It is necessary to know what is happening with all of the fees, charges and commissions.</para></talk.start><para>Secondly, for consumers to maximise the opportunity to pick a fund, we were proposing to require the publication every quarter on the APRA web site the provider nameâand I think this is technically feasible as a reporting requirementâtogether with the reporting of all the fees, charges and commissions. That would be the name of the life company or, in the case of retail funds, the industry fund or the corporate fund. There are thousands of funds. We were proposing the reporting by the provider to APRA and APRA putting up on their web site a record of all fees, charges, expenses and commissions so that if a consumer wished to see what a particular fund was charging then they could go to the APRA web site and see the fees that were charged. We would be able to see the fees that in real life were being charged by these providers to the consumer. We believe this would be of significant assistance to the consumer. For those who are eligible under this bill, it would provide an additional element of price pressure.</para><para>Regrettably the amendment was defeated. I read in press releases from the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer and the Australian Democrats that there is to be some sort of mechanism for the reporting of fees by funds to the regulator, but I do not see it in the amendments, nor is it contained in the original bill. I think the deal makers, in this case the Australian Democrats and the minister, should inform the committee about what is to happen with the reporting of fees, charges and commissions so we can track their level over time and track what is exactly happening with them.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>24541</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI can give a commitment on behalf of the government that the Commonwealth will collect and report information on the quantum of superannuation fees and charges. Details of which agencyâthat is, of which regulator: ASIC or APRAâshould undertake this task are currently under consideration. There are arguments that it really should be ASIC, as the market regulator. On the other hand, APRA already does collect some data. We are currently examining which is the appropriate agency to undertake this task. We are also looking at, depending on which is the appropriate agency, whether they already have the power to do what we would be requiringâthat is, to collect and report on the quantum of super fees and chargesâand whether any legislative changes are required. That will be resolved as soon as possible. I should say in defence of the agreement with the Democratsâand in defence of the Democrats I am sure Senator Cherry will add to these commentsâthat that was not overlooked, that that was accepted as something that was appropriate. The difficulty is in finetuningâworking out which agency is appropriate and what legislative changes might be necessary. The precise content as to how we will require this will be resolved as soon as possible. There is a clear commitment that the government will undertake to do this. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>24542</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Democrats strongly view it as essential that there be full and comprehensive monitoring of fees and charges over the next five years minimum to get an idea of exactly what is happening in the marketplace.

I would think, though, that the fees and charges would be publicly reported. Exactly what is publicly reported and how it is reported is something that will obviously be subject to discussion. I have to say that I am not in a position to be giving any unequivocal statements about the precise content, and I would not do so because I do not want to mislead the chamber. What I have unequivocally said is that we have a genuine commitment to ensure that we can devise the most appropriate way to disclose fees and charges and to have them properly reported, and to do it in a way that identifies the agency that can do it most appropriately. </para></talk.start><para>In response to Senator Cherry I can say that we will be doing this as soon as possible; we will not be waiting until June next year if we can avoid it.

That obviously includes commissions in all their various permutations. I will be advocating very strongly to the minister that the ASIC template should form the template for the reporting of fees and charges. The Democrats are of the firm view that it is essential that we keep maximum pressure on fees and charges, and the best way to do that is through proper monitoring, proper disclosure and making sure that consumers have an understanding of fees and charges. That is something that we have taken very seriously throughout these negotiations. Senator Sherry would be well aware of the extent of the work that ASIC has done in identifying the key fees and charges in the product disclosure templates. I imagine that would form a very reasonable basis for a reporting mechanism.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>24543</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI certainly hope we see that. I am not 100 per cent assured by the response Senator Cherry has given. If commissions are omitted for any reason there will be a massive hole in the reporting of superannuation total fees and charges. I also want to make a point about the issue of exit fees, Senator Cherry. I notice the minister referred to entry and exit fees in her speech. Our concern is not so much that there have been entry and exit fees on so-called `old products', which we acknowledge have tended to disappear. Labor's concern is that exit fees will spread.</para></talk.start><para>Our contention has been that, in a so-called choice environment, where people move superannuation from one fund to another, for whatever reason, the product provider will seek to lock people in through an exit fee and then exit fees will spread very quickly. Let's say you are a commission based adviser and you convince an individual to come into a super product, you are getting commission in some cases and your income as an adviser is dependent on the commission. You do not want the person whom you have convinced to sign up to the product to leave, because you will lose your income. That was the basis of the old exit fees. So we do want exit fees, again, reported to the regulator.</para><para>Finally, on the reporting issue, Labor also believe that it is critical that the information that is gathered is not published just in the aggregate but available for public scrutiny via the web site in the microâin other words, we know what particular funds are being offered. People can say, `Go and check Rainmaker'âand there are a couple of other survey companiesâbut there is nothing better than genuinely independently gathered data from a government organisation. I think private organisations have a place and do a good job, but an individual should be able to go to a government web site and see that fund A is charging half a per cent administration fee and that it might be charging up to one per cent commission. As much as Labor are sceptical about the so-called competitive pressures, if you are going to have any sort of competitive pressures that information is vital.  </para><para>I want to raise a second issue with the minister. Minister, can you confirm that the bill will apply to employees under federal awards in the federal industrial commission and will not apply to employees under state awards in the state industrial jurisdiction?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>24544</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âFirst of all, in relation to exit fees, I can understand how Senator Sherry is sceptical about competition and the downward pressure on fees and charges. But I think it is difficult to conceive how higher competition will lead to higher exit fees. We know nowâleaving aside the old productsâthat currently exit fees either do not exist or at least are not very high. We obviously have to take a monitoring position and keep an eye on it. But I do not think the exit fees present such a problem that they would be in any way prohibitive to people moving funds, if they wished to do so. Certainly, that is not the intent of this legislation. If the legislation does not achieve its outcomes, obviously we will have another look at it. That is certainly far preferable to simply banning exit fees. We do not know what effect that would have where these imposts are passed on to those who might remain in the fund. I think we are better off to let the regime run and just keep an eye on it, in case there is any issue with exit fees.</para></talk.start><para>I am sure that if consumers do not want to pay exit feesâexit fees must be disclosedâthey will certainly not choose a fund with an exit fee. One issue we have is to get those people who want to move out of a fund to do so without large exit fees and, if they are out, they certainly will not go to one where there is a high exit fee and that fact must be disclosed. In relation to Senator Sherry's earlier question, yes, it applies to federal awards only and not to state awards.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>24544</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âLabor have an amendment on entry and exit fees and I will make some further comments when I move our amendment. I am glad that the minister has confirmed that this so-called choice in respect of super does not apply to state industrial awards. Could the minister confirm that my understanding is correct that, in the federal industrial jurisdiction, so-called choice will not apply in respect of industrial agreements and Australian workplace agreements?

The government and, indeed, the Democrats have claimed in their media releases that this is about choiceâabout allowing individual consumers, employees, to choose a fund. What we have heard from the minister is confirmation that in fact that will not exist. This is one of the furphies in this debate. The mantra is choice but the government itself, through its own so-called choice bill, is putting limits on choice. Firstly, we know it will not apply to state industrial jurisdictions. Secondlyâand I think more importantlyâin the federal industrial jurisdiction where this bill will apply there will be no choice at certain workplaces. There will be no choice at workplaces covered by certified agreements, by Australian workplace agreements and, I understand, by industrial agreements of some other nature. We do not have full choice in the federal industrial jurisdiction where the government claims it is implementing it, so the government's claim about choice is wrong.</para></talk.start><para>I will make one prediction. Quite a number of retail master trusts have a deal with an employer with respect to AWAs and other industrial agreements that binds the employees to that retail master trust. That is a matter of fact; we know that. Those deals are apparently to continue. If the government is introducing choice in the federal jurisdiction, there is a bit of a contradiction when it allows some employees under industrial awards to exercise choice but does not allow employees under other industrial arrangements in the federal jurisdiction to exercise choice. It is a fundamental conflict. If you believe so passionately that choice is a good thingâthat employees should be able to chooseâin the federal industrial jurisdiction, why is it limited? Why are industrial agreements excluded?</para><para>If the minister is able to justify the position, well and good. But the problem the Liberal government has is that its claim to be overcoming the problem of multiple accounts is therefore shot down. The claim is that the problem of multiple accounts will be overcome by a portable account whereby, no matter where you work, you transfer your fund from one employer to the other. We now know that this cannot happen in the federal industrial jurisdiction. If you work for employer A where you are in a particular fund and you leave that employer and go to employer B with a workplace agreement and say to that employer, `I want my superannuation money paid into the fund that I'm already in,' they can quite legally say, `No, we're not going to pay it.' If you move from employer A with your fund and go to employer B who has the right to say `no choice' and does so, you are in two funds. What makes it even messier is that you might then move to employer C with wages and conditions determined under a state industrial jurisdiction and end up in a third fund.</para><para>There are two critical points here. Firstly, this is not choice. The government repeats the mantra of choice but this is not choice; it is restricted. It is restricted by virtue of state awards and by virtue of the government's own decision not to apply it to certain industrial provisions in the federal jurisdiction. So it is not choice. Secondly, I make a prediction. Those who have been pushing the choice concept are mainly the retail funds, the financial planners and IFSA. They wanted choice. The argument, `We want choice to apply to employees under industrial awards but not to apply under certain industrial agreements whereby we have a deal with the employer in respect of a retail master trust,' is hypocrisy. My prediction is that whatever happens with this choice bill in the future, no matter who is in government, the exclusive arrangements retail master trusts, in particular, have with particular employers under industrial provisions that are not covered by this bill will inevitably cease. Inevitably there will be pressure on the government of the day. People will say: `You've got part choiceâhow can you have part choice? You either have choice or don't have choice. You can't have a fundamental contradiction in your position.' Inevitably the provisions that prevent a new employee from requiring the employer to put the money into the fund they have been in with the previous employer will fallâthey will end. That is my prediction. </para><para>I do not think these retail master trust providers or these planners, some of whom have particular agreements with individual employers, have thought about this much. Once you have choice it will inevitably spread and those exclusive agreements will cease at some point in time. Employees are not going to cop being told, `Choice is here; this is the brave new world,' having choice at one workplace and then moving to a new workplace to be told by an employer, `No, choice does not apply here,' because they have some sort of certified agreement or workplace agreement. That will not continue. That is my prediction. It is hypocritical, it is contradictoryâit is a major contradiction in this billâand it is the reason why, although the minister claimed in her second reading speech that it solves the problem of multiple accounts, it does not solve the problem of multiple accounts.</para><para>The minister says that there is a problem with multiple accounts, which Labor accept. We have another solution to thatâautomatic consolidation of multiple accounts. The minister claimed that these small multiple accountsâand most of them are smallâare eaten up by fees. That is not right. We have what is called a member protection regime with respect to small amounts. The small amount is member-protected to $1,000. So that claim by the minister is not correctânot in full, anyway. There are a lot of accounts around that amount. </para><para>I would like the minister, if she could, to respond to this fundamental contradiction. We have part choice in the federal industrial jurisdiction; we have not got full choice. Perhaps the minister can explain, or perhaps the Australian Democrats can explain, why we have ended up with part choice in the federal industrial jurisdiction and not full choice. What are workers who are in a fund with employer A going to do when they leave that employer and go to a new employer who says: `Tough luck. Choice doesn't apply. We've got an industrial provision here that prevents choice, and you will have to accept it. You will have to join the fund that applies at this particular workplace and you will obviously end up with multiple accounts'? An exit fee might even apply. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00A9C</name.id><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Cherry</name></talker><para>âYou are making it up.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>âWe will find out about that.

Is he contending for the fact that choice is a good thing or that choice is a bad thing? I understood that the Labor Party's position was that they did not support choice, and yet Senator Sherry seems to be critical of what he sees as some limitation on choice. Talk about contradictory positionsâthis is like the pot calling the kettle black. </para></talk.start><para>I want to reiterate briefly a couple of points on the federal industrial jurisdiction. I cannot see how the agreements to allow employees to directly negotiate the super fund into which their contributions will be paid are inconsistent with choice policy. Collective agreements are consistent with choice. I think there would have been a riot if they had not beenâthat is, workers can have a vote on the collective agreement. To my way of thinking, that is a fairly effective, collective choice that is being exercised. </para><para>As we have always said in the numerous debates that we have had on these matters: portability complements choice. If an employee moves to an employer where the super fund is specified in a certified agreement, they can certainly use portability to consolidate their accounts. So I do not see that any of these so-called barriers, glitches or hitches really detract at all from the policy that this government espouses, which is that there should be choice. I believe that the way in which these agreements operate certainly allows choice, and the way in which portability operates certainly allows consolidation of accounts.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>24547</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn his contribution, Senator Sherry has seized on one of the more significant changes to the choice model from that which was introduced by the government back in 1996âthat is, its treatment of industrial instruments. Senator Sherry would recall that, when this legislation was first introduced into the parliament in the first term of the Howard government, it included a proposal to strip superannuation clauses out of awards and for the choice of funds regime to completely override award clauses. The Democrats, through discussions with Senator Kemp and subsequently Senator Coonan, have persuaded the government to shift away from that position. That is a very significant change in this particular model. </para></talk.start><para>Senator Sherry would be well aware that the industry funds by and large deliver a very good product to their members. I think it is not unreasonable for us to ensure that, through the certified agreements process, the workplace as a whole is able to decide that the industry fund or some other fund is the way it wants to go. If the industry fund is not delivering for that workplace, then it can decide as a workplace in its next certified agreement to go for another fund or to go for completely unrestricted choice of funds. I think it is reasonable, as the minister has said, that the workplace as a whole, through a certified agreement on which it votes, is able to make those sorts of choices. It will ensure that there is some reasonable certainty, at least for the industry funds, and that some of the advantages that we have in terms of the industry funds are allowed to continue.  </para><para>The most recent data from the Parliamentary Library show that about 40 per cent of employees in Australia are employed under certified agreements. That suggests the ability of that group to make a choice of fund collectively and that will ensure that their arrangements will be very little unchanged by this legislation. If, like the transport workers or the hairdressers in Queensland, they are in an industry fund that is a dud fund and not delivering they will be able to move out of that fund. They cannot do that under Labor's model of having the award as the sole determinant of where their superannuation goes. </para><para>The other group which this legislation is of significant benefit to is the 40 per cent of Australians who are currently award free, according to the data I have from the library, and that percentage is rising year by year as the unions are not doing their work in unionising the non-unionised sector. As Senator Sherry would be well aware, when the Labor Party introduced, with Democrat support, the superannuation guarantee proposals, the Labor Party left the choice of superannuation fund for that group to the employer to decide. Under this legislation, from 1 July next year that 40 per cent of workers will have the right to choose where their superannuation goes.</para><para>We are also extending that right to federal awards, with the fallback to the default award fund. As the minister said, there are constitutional problems with its applying to state awards, and that is something that has to be dealt with through discussions with state governments. I would hope that most state governments would follow in some form, because I think this is a reasonable package with options that provide a reasonable balance between collective choice and individual choice and employees being able to hold their industry funds to account. I am very pleased with the position we have reached on the linkage between collective versus individual choice. I am surprised that Senator Sherry would question that as a matter, particularly given that the Labor Party has always so strongly supported collective bargaining and collective decision making in the workplace. I would be interested to see whether this is a matter of simply raising questions for the sake of raising questions or whether the Labor Party does intend to get rid of the notion of collective choice for workplaces to decide where their super will go.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>24548</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAs you well know, Senator Cherry, I have no problem with collective agreements or awards or otherwise, and I think Senator Coonan knows this. What I am highlighting here is that the government claims the mantra of choiceâthat individual workers can choose their superannuation arrangementsâbut the bill does not deliver it. I think it is important to understand this. Let us take a workplace of 50 workers who have a collective workplace agreement of some kind. Although a new employee's wages and conditions may be okay when they join that work force, there may be difficulties if the worker wants their contributions to go into a super fund that they want to bring with themâthey know the fund, and they have identified the characteristics and the fees of the fund. As a new employee, they would not have been involved in the collective negotiations that may have happened two, three or four years ago and, when they start their job, they are told they cannot bring their fund to the workplace because of a collective agreement that they had no say in. It becomes a problem when there is an existing superannuation fund. I have no problems with awards and collective agreements and the like, but I am highlighting the Liberal government's claim of choice for workers to pick a fund versus the reality that is being delivered in the legislation. </para></talk.start><para>I am genuinely trying to highlight the issues. I do not want to take a long time on this. We know the outcomeâthe Democrats and the government have done another GST type deal, which they grandly announced yesterday. I just want to highlight the problems with this approach. I gave an example of a worker who is covered by a particular fund with employer A under the federal industrial jurisdiction going to work for employer B and finding out that some sort of collective choice of superannuation applies and they have to join that fund. They have no choice. A year or two later they may go to another employer and come under a state industrial award where this particular legislation does not apply, and they then have to join a third fund. These problems exist. The point I am making is that this is not `choice' as the government and the Democrats have claimed, nor is it a solution to the problem of multiple accounts. The system needs significant simplification to resolve the multiple account problem.</para><para>The minister moved amendments (1) and (5) on interdependency relationships and spoke to them. The Labor Party support these and we will be voting for them. I am not sure whether Senator Cherry will recall, but there was a Senate committee report some years agoâand it is years ago nowâin the context of the terminally ill. Under the current early access provisions, a person who is medically certified as terminally ill is not able to claim their superannuation before they die, which I think is pretty tough. If you are certified as terminally ill, and you are going to die in whatever space of time, you cannot take your superannuation out early. Obviously when you die it passes to your estateâto your partner if you have one. The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation recommended that an individual who has medical proof that they are terminally illâthey might have six months or a year to goâshould be given early access to their superannuation without a tax penalty. I think that is a pretty reasonable proposition. </para><para>My recollection is that there has been no response from the Liberal government on the issue of a terminally ill person having early access to their superannuation, but it is relevant in the context of the government's amendment on dependent relationships. There is a lot a couple could do with the money from their superannuation when the individual is terminally ill and in the last months of life. It would be a big help for them to get that super earlier rather than having to wait until they die, when their partner can access it but obviously they cannot. I would like to know what the government is going to do about the Senate committee recommendation that those people who are medically certified as terminally ill be allowed to access their superannuation before they die.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>24549</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âSenator Sherry, I deal with early release of superannuation and I am not aware of there being some outstanding response from the government in respect of that. There may be; I will check it. It certainly does not fit in this billâit is not about early release of super. You certainly can get access if you are permanently disabled, and you would be very familiar with the quite stringent but nevertheless well-defined criteria that enable early access to super. There may be a good case, depending on the evidence, to have some access to it. `Terminally ill' is something that can be very difficult to identify. One only has to recall the late former Senator Colston to know that certifications about imminent death do not necessarily mean that someone may not happily live for a number of years. I will check to see whether there is any outstanding response of the government. I would have thought that the current criteria would allow someone who is permanently disabled and terminally ill to get early access in appropriate circumstances. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>24550</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI point out that it is the announced policyâone of the manyâof the Labor Party to provide for the terminally ill to be able to access their superannuation. I think it is in the context of this dependent relationship issue; it is relevant and should be dealt with. I have one more general question which concerns the minister's claim and again it is a mantra. They are using the term `place downward pressure on fees and charges'. That is a consequence of this billâto place downward pressure. I notice that the financial planners, IFSA and even the banksâI must say the banks are pushing the bounds of credibility a touchâhave now adopted this terminology. I would like an undertaking from the government, and from the Australian Democrats for that matter, that there will be lower fees and charges as a result of this legislation and that no people will be disadvantaged because their total fees and charges go up. I would like that assurance. That is the basis of the underlying philosophical approachâcompetition. I would like a guarantee that that is what will happen.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>24550</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThat is a nice try, Senator Sherry. It is very important to understand what the government is doing with the choice legislation. It is putting in place a framework with a robust disclosure regime that will in all likelihood produce an effect amongst those institutions providing servicesâthat they had better be competitive about fees and charges or they are likely to find that investors will walk. That is what the rationale is all about. The government is not in the business of providing guarantees; the government is in the business of providing a robust framework and legislation that in all likelihood will deliver those outcomes. With effective disclosure, we will all be able to see those who want information being able to get it and the appropriate reporting that we have talked about. We are not completely in the dark with these kinds of outcomes. We know that where there is competition people who offer products with lower fees and charges are likely to be attractive to investors. That is indeed the outcome that this government expects.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>24550</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI draw to the attention of those who may be listening that this is a really important issue. The minister is very careful; she says `in all likelihood'. There is the language; there is the qualification: `In all likelihood fees and charges will come down' and there is the term: `place downward pressure on fees and charges'. We will be holding this government accountable to this claim that fees and charges will drop. We will certainly be holding IFSA and its constituent members, the banks, and the financial planners accountable to the claim that the fees and charges are going to go down and not up. I think they will go up in some cases. We will hold them accountable. The Labor Party, as I have said earlier, does not believe that there are sufficient protections to prevent people, in some cases, being ripped off through excessive fees and charges. We will hold these organisations accountable. Every example of an excessive fee, charge, commission or exit fee that comes to our attention we will be publicising. We will be drawing fee rip-offs to the attention of the public. I do not want to be too emotive about it but we will bring these to the attention of the public. </para></talk.start><para>Apparently, if you are bound to an employer by a certified agreement or some sort of collective choice agreementâwhatever that means; it is a bit of a contradiction in terms in the context of superâyou cannot do anything about it because you are stuck in that fund. An example of a workplace agreement in the mining industry has been brought to my attention. I will bring a copy of the agreement to the chamber next time we sit. It is sitting on my desk in Devonport. The agent had done a deal with a retail fundâan employerâthat locked them into the particular superannuation retail master trust and, under this law, Minister, they cannot get out of it. There were five fees and charges. They were disclosed, I have to say that. Do you know what these fees and charges on compulsory super guarantee totalled? They totalled 9.9 per cent. Apparently this will be legal under this legislation. </para><para>I do not pretend that this is common. I am not one who goes around using examples like this and saying the whole industry are doing it because they are not. It is an unusual and a fairly extreme example but it certainly exists. I do not think their fees and charges will come down because there is no legal opportunity for these parties to get out of this particular arrangement where the agent has done the deal. I have spoken to the planner and he argues that this is a good deal. He argues that he gives lots of service, that he is available to give advice on call and that he needs to be paid. He claims that the total fees and chargesâhe gets a proportion of them; he certainly does not get them allâof over nine per cent are justified in these circumstances. But under this law people cannot get out of that arrangement.</para><para>I did not think the minister would be giving us a guarantee that the fees and charges would come down. I did think we would have the hedge or the fudge, the likelihoods and downward pressures. This is the language that the Thatcher government used in the 1980s when they introduced so-called `choice' in their much more limited coverage of pension funds; it is not compulsory to have it in the UK.</para><para>Minister, you referred to so-called kickbacksâ`third line forcing' is perhaps a less emotive termâand you have brought in an amendment to outlaw them. Will that apply to current kickback arrangements? In other words, will it be retrospective? Where a financial institution has done a deal to provide a cut-price loan to an employer and in return the employer, under a workplace agreement, has compelled the employees to be part of a particular retail fund, will it apply to existing kickback or third line forcing arrangements? Will it apply where there is some sort of contractual agreement that applies at a particular workplace?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>24551</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe regulation of kickbacks or benefits paid by superannuation funds to unions and employees will be prospective. I think the amendment says it will be effective from 1 July 2005, so they are certainly not retrospective. The regulations will be able to specify exemptions to ensure there are no unintended consequences. It is not difficult to imagine that there could be something that might come within a definition that might otherwise be acceptable conduct. I think the principle that, as part of this legislation, we address this issue is very important because it would be entirely inappropriate to leave it unregulated.

We do not agree with that, but the facts of life are that the law is going to be changed and this legislation will not outlaw such a practice.

I submit that where a financial institution may do a deal with an employerâit might be perfectly legitimate in terms of a retail master trustâat a certified agreement, legally a commission would be paid in some circumstances to a planner. From what you are saying, the financial institution could not offer a cheap loan to the employer and could not offer discounts on other financial productsâor inducements of that sortâbut I think it should also include the indirect payment. A financial institution makes a payment in the form of commission to the planner and the planner then makes a payment. This should include so-called soft dollar payments. </para></talk.start><para>This reminds me that the Australian Democrats have never actually responded to the ASIC report on soft dollar and what they propose to do about it with respect to the legislation we are considering. Senator Cherry might like to indicate whether they would ban soft dollar or at least restrict it. Soft dollar payments are where inducementsâan incentive is a word that other people would useâare used to entice a planner: overseas trips, discount loans or conferences which they attend for two hours and spend four days on a golf course at some exotic international location. ASIC's report outlined some quite interesting inducements. Can the Democrats indicate what they propose to do about soft dollar inducements in the context of this legislation? I have not seen any proposals from the Australian Democrats with respect to soft dollar beyond the simple issue of disclosing it. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>24553</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI will respond briefly to that, and then I will speak to the amendments to the <inline ref="R1580">Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2003</inline>. The Democrats are well aware of the ASIC report on soft dollar payments. One of the deep concerns we have is that a lot of these things fall outside the disclosure regime that ASIC has put in place. I note, as Senator Sherry would be aware, that ASIC's disclosure regime includes the mandatory use of the ASIC fee template and product disclosure statements. This ensures all matters of feesâboth exit fees and commission paymentsâare included in the mandatory product disclosure statements and also in periodic statements. Senator Sherry would also be aware that my colleague Senator Murray insisted that all fees in product disclosure statements and periodic statements should also be included in dollar terms, because all financial literacy reports make it quite clear that consumers better understand dollar figures rather than percentage figures. That is something we have pursued very hard. I acknowledge the work of Senator Murray and also Mr Cameron in getting those matters successfully resolved.</para></talk.start><para>I want to briefly speak to the amendments which have been moved by the government. These amendments arise directly out of discussions I have had with Senator Coonan over the last couple weeks, and they are very important. We have been discussing for a short period the kickbacks provision. This is based on a similar provision in I think section 78 of the Retirement Savings Accounts Act. It was put in there to add an extra level of emphasis to the need to ensure that employers are not influencing employees' superannuation decisions. There are already provisions in the financial services regulations which make it quite clear the employer is not allowed to offer financial advice unless they are a licensed financial advisor. </para><para>That is something which one should see as a parallel to these provisions. We make it quite clear they cannot offer advice and they cannot accept an inducement. It is a civil liability clause, but it can certainly give rise to significant costs. As an educative device in the development of choice, I would hope the choice consultative committee would be emphasising quite clearly to employers the very significant civil liability they could be open for under this clause if they actually proceed with inappropriate action. It is an important provision; it is important protection for employees. We want to get to a stage where it is employees who are making real decisions rather than their employers.</para><para>The other amendments we are moving today ensure that default funds have a mandated level of insurance cover. That will be dealt with by regulation as a result of further discussions, but I thank the minister for acknowledging this is a very important issue. It was raised in all of the Senate committee inquiries we had on the choice of funds bill. One of the great benefits of the award based industry fund system is the provision of a death benefit, which is often the only death benefit that some workers will actually have. Mandating that across the board for default funds is an important part of ensuring that we maintain the benefits of our current superannuation scheme in the brave new world we are moving into, as well as emphasising the bits where we need to improve our superannuation scheme.</para><para>The other significant amendment the minister has moved recognises interdependent relationships in the superannuation taxation law for the first time. This is a very important amendment, and one which the Democrats have pursued in one form or another since 1995. Once again, I should acknowledge the work of Senator Coonan in getting this amendment accepted by the government. The amendments are broadly based on the provisions in the Property (Relationships) Act of New South Wales as well as those in the Migration Act that deal with interdependent couples. It will ensure a same-sex couple will be treated on the same basis as a heterosexual de facto coupleâthat is, where they can establish there is a close relationship, they are living together and they are providing personal and financial support for each other, they are recognised as a relationship for the purposes of superannuation taxation law.  </para><para>With this amendment we are several significant steps along the way of getting the Taxation Office out of the bedrooms of Australians in determining whether tax will apply to death benefits. That is something which the Democrats feel very strongly about. The Taxation Office and the tax act should not be engaging in social engineering as to who can and cannot get a tax benefit by determining who they can and cannot give their death benefits to. Senator Sherry and others who are listening would be aware of cases in tax law where a mother can leave her superannuation benefit to her son when she dies but not vice versa without potentially attracting a significant tax impost. Under these provisions the relationship will be recognised where they are living together as mother and son, Garry McDonald style, and the superannuation would flow through.</para><para>When I discussed this issue in earlier Senate debates, I gave the example of a family owning a delicatessen whose child, who had been living with them, died and the death benefit could not flow back to the family without a significant tax impost by the tax office. These provisions will deal with that situation in addition to the very serious discrimination which has existed for a long time against same-sex couples.</para><para>The Democrats are very pleased to see these amendments coming forward. A very important part of our human rights agenda is that same-sex couples should be recognised on the same basis as heterosexual couples. We are pleased to be putting these amendments into legislation today. I also thank the minister for her commitment to remind other portfolio ministers that this is now government policy and that their statutory funds need to be amended accordingly. I am putting the government on notice that we will be pursuing their progress with those letters in the coming months. I will expect to see those amendments coming forward from portfolio ministers, particularly the finance and the defence ministers, very soon.</para><para>The other amendment which is not dealt with here, but which was discussed in some detail earlier, is the issue of the reporting of fees and charges over the next five years plus. The minister has given us an assurance that those amendments will be brought forward fairly soon. The Democrats are very pleased about that. We think it is important that we do monitor fees and charges in a very comprehensive form, looking at the range and the quantum that are being charged so that consumers can get even further information to compare whether they are right and proper fees and charges with what else is out there in industry. All that information is very important to ensure that consumers make informed choices. </para><para>ASIC has been doing some very good work in this area. The ASIC fee template provides a very good model on which we can start developing what fees and charges should be monitored, how they should be reported and how the information should be presented to consumers. Comparing the debate at this stage to where we were when we first looked at the choice bill back in 1997, it is extraordinary just how far the debate has shifted, even in fee disclosure and what is being required of superannuation funds and providers through the financial services regulations. The Senate and its committees have done an enormous amount of work in improving those legislative proposals brought forward by government. We are a long, long way from where we were when we started seven years ago, and I think it is time to get on with it. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>24555</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have indicated we will be supporting amendment (5) to schedule 2 in respect of same-sex couples.

I have one question about amendment (4) to do with civil liability and the so-called anti-kickback provision. Why is it limited to civil liability? It seems to me that a kickback is a bribe. I am not a lawyer. I know the minister is, so I am sure she can explain. Certainly some forms of bribery would attract a jail sentence, not just a civil liability. Why do we have a civil liability and not the ability, in the case of bribery on superannuation, for a person to be sent to jail or at least the option for the judge to determine that that is an appropriate penalty in extreme circumstances?</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>24555</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI should clarify an earlier response I made in respect of the Senate report on early release.

Ultimately it is a matter of judgment as to what you do about consequences of infringements. Why we chose civil liability in this case is that it is consistent with the RSA provisions on which it was modelled following the Democrat negotiations. That is what we have endeavoured to make it consistent with. I should say to Senator Sherry that, whilst criminal liability for egregious behaviour might seem to have some appeal, it is often extremely difficult to establish, whereas civil liability will probably address this appropriately and will be consistent with its companion provisions in the RSA.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>24556</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âYou mentioned that this will be confined to the provision of the default fund.

I think you should have both options. I would not suggest that, where you have got inducements in respect of soft dollar commissions, you would send a person to jailâI think generally that would be a bit tough. But, if you had a very clear case of bribery or an outright case of a very serious matter, let us not forget who ultimately pays for these inducements. The fund member pays for it via a lower retirement income. They have effectively paid for it. It is a very serious matter when it occurs in those circumstances.

A lot of it will be the ATO taking advantage of existing relationships with employers and employees to educate them about choice of fund initiative. I am sure it will increase the number of people it will attract. The ATO has access to that kind of information. It does not necessarily mean you have to go and advertise on television. We have agreed that we are going to have an independent committee to advise in respect of the key messages. It is needed. I take issue with Senator Sherry calling it government propaganda.

It does not necessarily mean that messages get heard or that education reaches its targets. I think it is very cynical of Senator Sherry to be suggesting that this is propaganda. If these policies are to work, people have to be informed about them. They do not just automatically know. I think it is well acknowledged that superannuation is a complex product, and it is entirely justifiable that people need information.

This government seems to have refined these advertising campaignsâpropaganda campaignsâdown to an art form, both in terms of the obvious political propaganda and in terms of the massive quantities of money, the like of which we have never seen in this country. I can recall sitting over there being regularly criticised as part of the government. I do not think Senator Coonan was here then. But Senator Short, Senator Alston and Senator Bishopâwe all remember Senator Bishopâwere railing against these advertising campaigns. They were criticising us. There were questions and motions about the education campaigns of the previous Labor government. So it is no wonder I am a touch cynical about these propaganda campaigns.

The more choice you have in a market the better off you are, because there is competition. But essential elements to competition are an informed market and informed consumers. They need to have knowledge of the product. I pointed out earlier in my speech in the second reading debate the difficulties consumers have in understanding super. These are difficulties that have been well established through a whole range of surveys. You would need a finance degree to understand many aspects of superannuation. Education of consumers to improve financial literacy about superannuation is important. But what hope do we have of making nine million Australians financially literate to that degree between now and 1 July next year? </para><para>I am not saying that we should not try to improve levels of financial literacyâwe should. But nine million Australians at some point in time will be affected by this legislation, depending on whether they are working under a state or federal award or are covered by an industrial instrument, a certified agreement or whatever. Are we seriously suggesting that we are going to educate them between now and 1 July next year so that they will all be financially literate enough to make the informed choices that the competitive market requires? To that extent I am critical of the level of money being spent on the education campaign. We can try, but I just do not think it is going to happen. We can try in the schools. I talk one-to-one with many people about super and I have to say that in a lot of cases their eyes blur. Those are our concerns about the government's so-called education campaign.

I think one of the significant untold stories about the impact of this legislation is the impact it will have on small business. If we look at this legislation, we see that there are bureaucratic requirements on the employer to comply with this proposed new act that we are considering. I noticed that the minister was very careful in the words she used in her second reading speech when she referred to minimising the costs to the employer. It is pretty careful to use that form of words. The bottom line is that this bill means a substantial additional administrative workload for the employer. </para><para>I will highlight what will occur with respect to the employer. Let us remember that currently an employer pays into only one superannuation fund, and that fund is usually determined by the industrial instrument, determined in turn by an independent industrial commission. A large part of this bill relates to additional paperwork and administrative requirements on the employer. Let me go to some of the provisions in this bill. Employers are required toâthey mustâoffer each employee a form to effectively select a fund. That is new. At the moment employers do not have to do that but, if they are covered by this bill, they will have to do it for each and every employee. So it is a new form. The employers will then collect the forms or the notifications that the employees give about the fund to which the employers are to make contributions. I know what the penalties were in the previous act if employers failed to comply, but the bill states in proposed section 32N of division 6âstandard choice forms:</para><quote><para>(1)	An employer must give a standard choice form before 29 July 2005 to each employee employed by the employer on 1 July 2005.</para><para>(2)	An employer must give a standard choice form to an employee within 28 days of the employee first commencing employment with the employer.</para></quote><para>That is new employees, presumably. Then the employers will need toânot just in the initial hit stage, if you like, in Julyâact on those forms. If the employees do not give back the standard choice form then there is the default fund. The standard choice form includes a statement that the employee may choose any eligible choice fund, the name of the fund, other information that is required and, if the employee is a member of a defined benefit scheme, information in relation to that scheme that is required, under the regulations, to be included.</para><para>This may be acceptable to medium and large business, but this is a very significant change and additional paperwork for small business. We hear a lot from this government about small business and not increasing paperwork requirements and red tape, but the fact is that this is very onerous for small business. Once the employer has gone through this paperwork, he must then pay those funds. If an employer had 19 employees then there could be 19 different funds that the employer will be legally required to pay moneys to. This might not happen initially; it is more likely to happen over time. So you could have a small business employer required by law to pay into 19 different superannuation funds. It is perfectly feasible that that could happen.</para><para>Not just that, the employer has to forward the contributions. The funds will change, of course, when new employees come in. They will not be the same 19 funds. There is a high likelihoodâalmost a certaintyâthat there will be different funds. So the employer is going to be required to pass contributions on to different superannuation funds, and these funds will change with the new employees. New employees might have a different fund that the employer has never paid to before. There are thousands of superannuation funds. There is no lack of superannuation funds. I think there is a high likelihood that the employer will have additional paperwork and red tape requirements.</para><para>I have seen the documents. Generally they are electronic today, but not always. The employer certifies the name of the employee and the contribution amount in a particular column electronically; some do it by hand. They then send this informationâsometimes monthly, but usually quarterlyâto the superannuation fund along with the money. Often this is still done by cheque. Many small businesses still operate by cheque. Some operate by cash, but that is another story. In this case it could be a cheque or an electronic transfer. I know that the electronic transfer method is increasing, but I also know that many small businesses still pay by cheque. They have to write out 19 different cheques and 19 different reports or documents with the level of contribution detail for 19 different superannuation funds. They may do this by electronic transfer, but it is still additional paperwork, whatever form it takes. It is certainly far worse if they do it by cheque. It is additional paperwork, additional complexity and additional red tape. </para><para>The Labor Party policy is that we support a safe choice regime but we do not support it being applied, certainly in the first instance, to small business. We think that is inappropriate. I am trying to think of a more complicated paperwork burden. I think this would be worse than the GST. At least in the case of the GST the moneys are being paid and the forms are being sent to one point: the tax office. In the case of this so-called `choice' legislation, in many cases the paperwork will have to be sent to 19 different superannuation fundsâ19 different points of collection. I cannot think of a more serious increase in red tape as a consequence of regulation or legislation that this parliament has considered in recent times, and I include in that the GST.</para><para>I think there will be a lot of unhappy small businesses around the place, frankly, when they have to comply with this in July. I notice that it is after the election. How often do we get these sorts of impositions on business, in this case small business, after the election? I think there are going to be a lot of unhappy businesses around when they have to comply with this legislation in July next year.</para><para>I commit to alerting small business to the additional administration and red tape. I will give a commitment to the chamber that the Labor Party will be informing business about the extra red tape and administrative requirements. Between now and the election, whenever that is, we will do our best to let small business in particular know about our position on this. I would have thought it more appropriate for the government to adopt at least a phased introduction in consideration of the interests of small business, but that is not happening.</para><para>I wanted to highlight why the Labor Party want to exclude small business from this. It may be that in five or 10 years time you would include small business, but it is an increase in cost to the employer. Even the government concedes that. The statement of the minister refers to `minimising the cost to the employer', so there is additional cost to the employer, which will obviously vary from employer to employer. My question to the minister on the Labor amendment is: what are the penalties for breaches by the employer where they fail to notify employees and carry out the various procedures that are required under this legislation?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>24560</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWhat we have just heard from Senator Sherry is quite an extraordinary position on the part of the Labor Party. They are suggesting that just because you are an employee of a small employer you do not get to have any of the benefits of this legislation. You are just stuck and it is just your bad luck if you happen to be employed by a small businessâthat is, one with 20 or fewer employees. It is an extraordinary position for the Labor Party to be advocating that ordinary workers should be penalised and discriminated against by not being able to access arrangements and provisions that, if you happen to belong to a medium sized employer, would flow to you. </para></talk.start><para>The government's policy is very clearly to allow employees to choose, including small business employees. We do not say that just because you work for a small business, `Bad luck. On your bike; you don't get it.' We say that employer costs can be contained. I have consulted very widely on this legislation. There has been significant amendment to accommodate the concerns of business that were expressed in an earlier version. I certainly hope that Senator Sherry is not going to be misinforming small business about what the burdens are, but just in case Senator Sherry is tempted to misinform small business I do want to run through the arrangements.</para><para>The government has been and is very conscious of the need to keep employer costs to a minimum in providing this very good public policy position on choice. Where an employee does not choose a fund, the employers will continue to make contributions to the same fund as they do now, provided that fund offers a minimum level of insurance cover, as we have discussed. I am advised that the vast majority of super funds already offer life insurance, which is going to take care of that.</para><para>This is essentially a status quo model. It does overcome difficulties with the previous model, which required employees to monitor the default fund or face the risk of significant penalties. That was not appropriate and that is why the government made the amendments it did. Further, when an employee makes a choice selection, he or she will have to provide the employer with information to demonstrate that the chosen fund will accept contributions, which relieves another burden. An employer will not have to accept the chosen fund if the employee fails to provide this information, so it is a status quo model that should absolutely minimise that burden on business.</para><para>I am surprised that what Senator Sherry seems to presage the great risk of this arrangement is that somehow or other employees might choose 19 different funds. If they do, with advances in software that is quite cheaply available, electronic transfers make it easier for business to contribute to more than one fund. People do not all have the same bank accounts, yet businesses and payrolls manage to cope very effectively with making payments to 19 different bank accounts. I am advised that MYOB software provides employers with the ability to implement choice with no additional workload burden and potentially lower costs. Employers can send all superannuation contributions to employees' funds direct from their MYOB software. Whether they have one fund or many funds, the contribution process is identical. The service has already been proven effective and is growing rapidly in usage, particularly in Western Australia, where choice has been a reality for some time.</para><para>Even where employees have to make contributions to multiple funds, the market is already responding and developing clearing houses, which allow employers to pay to multiple funds at little or no additional cost. This has also been the experience in Western Australia. An employer will make one payment to the clearing house, which will then distribute the contributions to the employee's chosen fund on the employer's behalf. I am aware of superannuation funds that intend to disburse superannuation benefits to other funds on behalf of employers free of charge, provided of course that the fund is the default fund. That might be one of the carve-outs that might be necessary in respect of looking at the arrangements we were talking about a little earlier. I am confident that the market will respond and continue to develop to meet the need to minimise employer costs.  </para><para>The other important thing to emphasise is that employers can satisfy their obligations by entering into a certified agreement or AWA, as we said earlier. Employers who also make contributions in compliance with a state award are not covered. Otherwise, employers will have to give their employees a standard choice form, which will advise employees of the important matters they should consider before they exercise choice. The Australian Taxation Office will have charge of developing this form. As I said a little earlier, where an employee does not choose a fund, employers will continue to make contributions to the same fund as they do now. It is not inconceivable that a lot of people will not make a choice.</para><para>However, the government will consult with industry about the insurance obligations that we also mentioned a little earlier. I will come in a moment to the penalty provisions. Occasionally, ideological positions that are taken by the major parties in these kinds of issues are interesting. We seem to be swapping sides. It is quite ironic that the Labor Party seem to be exercised about small business costs, when they oppose what small business have wantedâindeed, have screamed from the rafters as wantingâwhich is some exemption from the unfair dismissal laws. I think that has been debated about 23 times and yet somehow Senator Sherry and his colleagues tend to disregard the enormous burden that is on small business to comply with the unfair dismissal laws. It is an absolute bane on their life and productivity.</para><para>Turning to the penalty provisions, the penalty is 25 per cent of the contributions paid to an incorrect fund. For example, if an employer pays $1,000 to an incorrect fund, the penalty would be $250. The penalty has been capped at a maximum of $500 per employee, with an ATO discretion to reduce it to zero. Those amendments came in on my watch, Senator Sherry, following consultation with business, and on my clear acknowledgement that this government would not be part of any regime which would significantly increase the cost to business without getting some commensurate assistance. Indeed, I have been very careful to look at what is available to minimise those costs. That is why I have used the words I have in my contribution tonight, after having taken those matters on board and after having, in consultation with industry groups and small business, developed a response that they will be able to manage without incurring significant costs.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>24562</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI think Senator Sherry should consider whether to withdraw this amendment. The amendment changes the definition of `employer' in the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992. It goes much further than he intended in his speech. The Democrats will oppose this amendment for two reasons. One, we do not believe that the definition of `employer' in the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 should be changed. We think it is absolutely essential. When we supported the introduction of the superannuation guarantee back in 1992, we put in place a longer phase-in period for small business employees to deal with superannuation guarantee. That phase-in period is now complete. We would not now want to put in place a new set of different rules under the superannuation guarantee for small business employees, as opposed to larger business employees. I am very surprised that the Labor Party would be bringing forward an amendment that would have the intention of changing the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act with that outcome. </para></talk.start><para>The other reason why the Democrats will be opposing this amendment is that it is completely inconsistent with the view we have taken in other areas, particularly in other parts of workplace relations law relating to the treatment of employees of small business. We have always held the viewâand I think the minister has encapsulated it, and I look forward to using the quotes in subsequent debatesâthat employees of small business should have the same industrial rights as employees of larger business. We have adopted that view on unfair dismissals in rejecting that piece of legislationâI have forgotten the number; I think it was debated 23 different times. We will adopt that view when the government brings forward its legislation to try to exempt small businesses from the redundancy provisions, and we will adopt the same view today that we believe that small business employees should have the same industrial rights and obligations as all other employees. From that point of view, the Democrats think it is important to have consistency, and I am a bit surprised the Labor Party has brought the amendment forward, particularly given the unintended consequences of pulling small business out of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1982 completely. I suggest to Senator Sherry that he consider whether he wants to push this amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>24563</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI do not accept it has that consequence.

I did a direct mailing to small business in Tasmania on this issue about a year ago with my colleague Mr Sidebottom, our very good memberâa fantastic memberâfor Braddon. We sent a direct mail letter out to small business about the requirements that needed to be met under the old legislation. I accept that the government have changed the provisions under the new legislation, but there is still a significant administrative burdenâand a new burdenâon small business.

This is one of the critical weaknesses of this so-called choice bill, Senator Cherry. What is an employer going to do? I think that there is going to be a significant behavioural shift, understandably, on the part of the employer. Employers will not want to pay into more than one fund. I saw some interesting polling research on this. Small business employers do not fancy the prospect of paying into more than one superannuation fund, and the minister has suggested a solution. </para><para>Minister, you detailed the penalty for paying into an incorrect fundâI think that was the terminology you usedâbut what are the penalty provisions in respect of the other requirements?

What contributions are we talking aboutâthe contributions that were made in the previous quarter or the contributions that are required to be paid in the next quarter? This is pretty important in the context of literally millions of forms, I suspect, being handed out by employers between 1 July 2005 and 29 July 2005.

Senator Sherry asked about the penalty if a standard choice form is not provided. To meet their choice of fund obligations, an employer must make contributions either to a chosen fund of the employee or, if one does not exist, to an eligible choice fund that meets the insurance requirement. An employer must provide a standard choice form before an employee actually makes a choice. If they do not provide this form, any contributions to a fund would not be regarded as meeting their obligations until they have provided the form. Therefore the employer would be liable for a penalty of 25 per cent of any contributions made to the fund during the time that they have not provided a standard choice form. As I indicated, the penalties are standard.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Sherry also asked about the impact on employers.

I will not go into the detail of Labor Party policy, but one of our minimum service obligations is that an investment choice, as it is called, should be offered by all superannuation funds. Contrary to claims that there is no choiceâthat is not right; I have already talked about it in the context of membership of a fundâabout 80 per cent of superannuation fund members have what is called investment choice. In other words, they can pick a different investment option from the standard trustees option. It is usually things like investment categories, international shares, Australian shares, bonds, cashâI would not recommend those two in the long termâand property. You can change the mix around, and that is what is called investment choice. This has been a major innovation to superannuation funds over the last 10 to 15 years. It is widespread. The last stats I looked at showed that about 80 per cent of fund members can pick from a menu different investment options.</para><para>It was with some interest that I noted that Senator Bartlettâprobably more so than Senator Cherryâemphasised that this bill will lead to an increased take-up of ethical investment. That is not true. I think that is Senator Bartlett latching on to some desperate cover at the press conference to explain his party's deal, which we are dealing with here tonight in the chamber. If we pass this legislation, it will have no impact at all on ethical investment. I notice that Senator Cherry has a bit of a smile. He knows that that is right.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00A9C</name.id><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Cherry</name></talker><para>âI'll read you the statement.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>âYou can have all the statements you like. There is not going to be a change in ethical investment as a result of this bill. The Labor Party has introduced via an amendment its minimum service obligation and one of those minimum service obligations is an investment menuâall funds should offer investment choice. Included in one of those options should be an ethical fund. We are actually making it compulsory to offer it. You do not have to take it up but we are making it compulsory to offer it. Compare that to this really weak and wimpy Democrat Senator Bartlett approach. I have been pretty tame in my criticism of other senators in this debate because it is late and it could be the last week before an election, but I really do think that this is one of the real furphies that the Democrats have used for cover in supporting this legislation. If the Democrats are keen on investment choice, as it is known, and keen on ethical funds then here is their chance to make sure that every fund has to offer it. You do not have to take it up. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00A9C</name.id><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Cherry</name></talker><para>âEvery fund should do it.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>âYes, they should do it. That is what we are proposing through this amendment, Senator Cherry. We are making the funds offer it as an option. We are not forcing individuals to take it out, but if it is offered then we know that there will be a much better chance of a take-up, particularly as knowledge of ethical investment spreads. That is our rationale for this amendment. I hope the Democratsâit is probably a vain hope; the deal is done and wrapped up and we know there is never a deviation, even on sensible amendments like this that reflect the Democrat claim in their press releaseâwill support it because I think it is sensible. It is Labor Party policy and it is a good way to go in terms of encouraging more ethical investment in this country.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>24568</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is a pity that Senator Sherry did not to listen to my speech in the second reading debate because he would have heard me read out in full the statement by George Pooley, the chairperson of Australian Ethical Investment Ltd, who was welcoming this legislation. I will quote it again for Senator Sherry's assistance:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Australian Ethical Investment welcomes this change, which will enfranchise millions of Australians with respect to investment choice of fund. With the passage of this Bill, those Australians will be able to express their ethical concerns with their superannuation monies, as well as with their vote.</para></quote><para>The key thing is that it is best to go and find an ethical investment fund rather than an option because what is ethical investment for one person might not be ethical investment for another. That is why it is more important to give people choice of fund, so they can go out and find a fund that is doing their business. I do not particularly want to see superannuation funds offer some sort of vague ethical investment token option. I want to see all superannuation funds move towards ethical investment. In the UK there was a significant change when a couple of big funds decided they were going to stop investing in particular forms of corporation. That had a significant impact immediately on shareholder behaviour, on fund behaviour and on company behaviour. That is the sort of approach we need in this country. It should not just be a token investment option. It is something we should be encouraging as a part of the general corporate behaviour of superannuation funds.</para><para>I do not know whether Senator Sherry noticed this last week, but the simple page disclosure will require superannuation funds to disclose the extent to which they offer socially responsible investment as an option. It will be there on the first page of their disclosure document. I am very pleased that Senator Murray managed to get that amendment to the simple disclosure page. It is also there in the amendments we have made to the Corporations Act in terms of requiring funds to disclose the extent to which they are engaging in socially responsible investment. We will continue to push that through a number of different channels. The combination of the simple page disclosure on ethical investment and the fact that choice of fund will be broadened gives people an opportunity to compare very quickly and very easily on their simple fee disclosure statement whether they are talking about social investment or not. That is more beneficial than this particular proposal.</para><para>There is an inherent contradiction in Senator Sherry's contributions tonight, which I will highlight. There is a contradiction between the argument for lower fees and the argument for mandating six investment choices. There is absolutely no question that the amendment which Senator Sherry has put before us will significantly increase the cost of running a fund. There is absolutely no question that that is what will directly flow from it. You cannot on the one hand say that you want the funds to charge lower fees and, on the other hand, increase the requirements on funds which will add to their fee structures. We have to be careful about the extra impost we put on superannuation funds which adds to their cost base. On that basis I do not think the Democrats will be supporting this amendment. </para><para>Investment choice is something that we should discuss further. I must say that the investment choices in the offers of the various funds that I have seen have been disappointing. As I said in my earlier contribution, it is true that 80 per cent of the funds do offer investment choice but, by and large, that investment choice is really the choice of different risk profiles rather than choice of investments. I am yet to find a fund which says they will invest all their funds in Australia, for example, which is an issue I have paid some significant public attention to. From that point of view we should recognise that investment choice at this stage is not delivering the sorts of outcomes which I certainly would have liked to have seen in terms of giving investors more control over where their superannuation moneys goâwhether it is in Australia or in socially responsible investments or whatever.</para><para>From that point of view we will be opposing this amendment. We think that if we are serious about ethical investment we have to start making all funds do it. We should make all funds vote their shares at shareholder meetings. That is a matter we have dealt with in the Corporations Law area. We should make all funds start declaring what their investment policies are. They should not corral this in a token, socially responsible bit at the end of their options menu but make it a core part of their business. That is the approach the Democrats are taking by having socially responsible investment as part of the fundamental disclosure requirements of all funds. That way we allow people to start choosing between funds on the basis of exactly what they are delivering for their society.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>24569</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI do not accept the argument about costs, Senator Cherry. I do not think that is right. If the person has gone for full ethical investment within the fund you can allocate capital to the account at no significant cost. The other problem, Senator Cherry, is this: under your choice model the consumer, if they know about ethical investment, will have to search that fund out.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00A9C</name.id><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>âLet me get to the point. Even though you have a limited choice modelâit does not apply to state awards and there are limits with respect to the industrial instruments we have talked aboutâwe are saying that every fund in Australia should offer a minimum level of service. It seems to us that they should offer a spread of investments including an ethical investment. The fund members will get a document which will talk in a reasonable amount of detail about that fund's ethical investment option. Every fund member in Australia will get information about an ethical investment option. Under your model they will only get it if they seek it out, and we think our approach will be much more effective. You have indicated that you will not support our amendment, and I can anticipate that Senator Coonan will not support our amendment, so I will leave my remarks there. I think this is useful, and it is important that it is offered and that every person who reads their fund information knows that it is there for them to consider if they wish to do it.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>24570</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âSenator Sherry is quite correct in anticipating that the government will not be supporting this amendment. From a personal perspective, I think there can be some merit in looking at how one can better inform people about ethical investments. There is a range of views about what ethical investments are and we certainly would not be in a position to do something about it on the run tonight. However, I do not know whether it has struck Senator Sherry yet that during the debate he appears to have been for more choice and then for less choice. He has been for exempting small businesses and those working in small businesses from choice. He is complaining that some do not get it and then he is carving out others. We are trying to provide a model that will give the best possible choice to the most people under the current arrangements.  </para></talk.start><para>I agree with Senator Cherry that the majority of funds that do not currently offer investment choice are probably corporate fundsâand they tend to have lower fees and charges than retail and industry funds as the employer bears some of the costsâand the requirement to offer five investment options must force those funds, just by dint of activity, to bear additional costs associated with the selection and ongoing monitoring of investment managers. Invariably these costs will be passed on to members, so there are real difficulties in requiring this.</para><para>The choice bill tries to avoid a heavy handed, one size fits all regulation approach. We want to allow employees to choose a fund that is right for them and to have a robust framework of disclosure and education so that people have a better comprehension of the kinds of choices that they can make. If an employee is particularly focused, as some will be, on having a range of investment options available in their fund, choice will allow them to nominate a superannuation provider that can meet this need. I am sure that if there is a demand it will be met. That is the nature of competition. But, for tonight, mandated investment choice will merely impose additional costs without necessarily improving retirement incomes for fund members. I note the view of Mr Pooley, the chairperson of Australian Ethical Investment, who certainly seems to think that this legislation is a welcome addition for the kinds of investors that he might see at Australian Ethical Investment. </para><para>Question negatived. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>24570</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move opposition amendment (3) on sheet 4295:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(3)	Schedule 1, item 22, page 22 (after line 8), after section 32Y, insert:</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">32YA Fund entry and exit fees</inline></para><quote><para>		Where a fund sets an entry fee or an exit fee, the level of those fees shall be prescribed by regulation.</para></quote><para>This relates to banning and regulating entry and exit feesâone of my favourite topics. The minister summed up her approach about disclosure and education. The Labor Party believes that disclosure and education are fine as far as they go, but we have to look at reality and be practical. There are some practices in the industry that are inappropriate or just plain wrong in the context of compulsory superannuation. I have mentioned two with regard to fees: one is entry and exit fees and the other is commission based selling with respect to the compulsory superannuation guarantee. </para><para>I made a prediction earlier. I will make another: whoever is in governmentâwhether it is you, Senator Coonan, in a Liberal government, or a Labor governmentâat some future date we will be back here on the issue of commissions and exit fees. I am absolutely confident we will be back here on that issue, because the market will not work. The market will not work to provide a fair and reasonable outcome and to stop rip-offs in this area. There is a strong argument that there is evidence that the market does not work properly in respect of competition. Where you have anti-competitive practice and conflicts of interest, you need to get in there and give it a good dose of regulation.  </para><para>I do not say that lightly. I am a general believer in market forces and free enterprise, but let us be realistic: the basis of the compulsory superannuation market is not a free market. We compel people to save in super, we force them to save; otherwise the market would fail because the majority of Australians would not do it. That is why I get concerned when I hear from some in the industryâsome of them are good friends of mine; we have these discussions on a friendly basis and they are representing their interestsâwhen they talk about market forces: `Don't touch the fees. Don't do anything. Don't regulate them in any way, shape or form. Market competition, it'll be right.' I point out to them that the majority basis of this industry is because of market failure. We compel people to save through super.</para><para>We have had a good talk about exit fees. They are a barrier. These products are still around today. It is not so much the existing products I am concerned about but the behaviour I outlined earlier. A fund, once it has got a new member and it has got all this money inâwhether the individuals join that fund or they have been convinced by a plannerâwants to keep the business. What is the best way legally to keep the business? Whack on an exit fee. That is how they used to keep business in a voluntary superannuation environment up until 10 or 15 years agoâcompulsory super came in during 1987âbut we have seen the slow decline of these heavy exit fee products. Some of them are still about; they are not a thing of the past. There are certainly those from that time still about. I notice there is one particular companyâI am not going to embarrass it tonightâwhich features very prominently on that Senate select committee list. It has been selling products with heavy exit fees on super in the last few years. Exit fees in a compulsory super environment are unconscionable. They are a barrier. They erect substantial financial penalties in the thousands of dollars. The world of disclosure would be far simpler if they were prohibited as well. Sure, the cost would be amortised over the other fees. This barrier should be removed. Exit fees are anticompetitive. If we want to enhance and improve competition, then we would get rid of exit fees and we would get rid of commissions in certain circumstances.</para><para>Our amendment allows for entry and exit fees to be prescribed by regulation. The intention there is to allow for an entry and exit fee to cover the admin costs. I would trust the government to at least do a survey of what the admin costs are with respect to entry and exit fees and set an appropriate exit fee and get in there and give it a good dose of regulation. Don't be afraid of it, Senator Coonan. The market is not supreme all the time. I am confident, and I make the prediction, we will back in the Senateâwhether it is your government or oursârevisiting and regulating entry and exit fees and certain forms of commission payments some time in the next four to five years. It is such an obvious area for potential abuse and current abuse that we will have to do something about it.</para><para>I have one final point to make. Believe it or not, there is someone listening to this debate who has just sent me an email. He starts by saying, `Hi, Senator,' and he has raised a serious point. I do not know the answer; Senator Coonan might know it. He is listening to the debate and he is concerned that the minimum standard requirements for a choice fund, under clause 2 of the amending bill, refers to insurance with respect to death but makes no mention of disability insurance. He wants to know whether the amendment that has been moved in respect of the minimum condition provision of insurance also allows death and disability insurance as part of the insurance cover. Is it only death insurance or is it death and disability insurance? If that is covered, can you let me know as he wants some reassurance? It is nice to know we can help our constituents so quickly when they are listening in on the radio. Thank you very much. Hopefully the minister has got a positive answer for this query that has been emailed in the last 10 minutes. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>24572</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI think this is taking participatory democracy to extremes when somebody is running interference on the wireless.

While I am on my feet, I do not propose to go over what I said earlier this evening with respect to exit fees as some of this debate is getting tedious and repetitious. However, I think the way you have framed this particular amendment, Senator SherryâI hate to cavil at this and I would not be picky about it unless I really thought there was some basis to draw it to your attentionâmay be unconstitutional. Whether or not we are back here in four years, five years or 10 years time arguing about exit fees and commissions, the Constitution actually is king. Inconvenient though it may be, we still have to comply with the Constitution. The government will not be supporting this amendment, but in the spirit of collegiality I suggest you look at the constitutional point we are dealing with. Superannuation guarantee is levied under the taxing power of the Commonwealth. This amendment goes beyond the taxing power of the Commonwealth. It looks suspiciously like you are trying to put caps on a taxation power, but that is for another day. The government will not be supporting this amendment.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>24572</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIf we are elected to government, and I am always cautious about these things, Minister, you will be over here one day and we will be over there.

There are not many that do not have the disability provision. I thank the person who emailed in. We have raised the issue. I am a bit surprised. If it does not include disability, I think it should. I hope it will be revisited, because it is a standard form of the insurance that is offered by most funds. I am not going to move an amendment on that now.

It does not require disability cover, but it certainly does not preclude it. Our inquiries are that most funds, as Senator Sherry quite rightly identified, do have both.

You cannot observe the superannuation industry over any period of time and not have concerns about exit and entry fees, particularly with any interest in portability. But, at this particular point in time, the indications from industryâat least those that I am receivingâare that, certainly with the newer products coming on stream, exit and entry fees are much less of an issue than they have been in the past. And that is a point that Senator Sherry would almost certainly acknowledge. </para></talk.start><para>We have to keep the pressure up to ensure that that happens. I understand one of the larger life cover companies last week offered a product that actually had fees even lower than most industry funds with no exit and entry fees and no trailing commissions or commissions. That is something to be negotiated directly with the financial planner by the person walking in the door. So there are interesting things happening out there in the market. I have some concerns about how the market will develop over time and how powerful the market will be, but the only way to have a powerful market is to have a well-informed consumer and a robust regulator, in my view. They are probably the two things that we have to focus on. ASIC have very much got their act together now in keeping an eye on these issues, but we have to make sure that they have the tools to do what they need to do. </para><para>At this stage, the Democrats are prepared to go with monitoring and disclosure as the best ways of dealing with these issues, but we do not rule out that at some future time, as Senator Sherry had suggested, the Senate may need to return to these issues. The government itself acknowledged that in its portability paper released last year. So we do not support formal regulation for exit and entry fees, but I do not rule that out for all time. If disclosure and monitoring prove not to be adequate to force market change in these practices, we will have to come back to looking at these sorts of bans. I am always a bit concerned about regulating fees, because the minute you regulate a fee that becomes the fee. That is always a difficulty with regulation. At this stage we are not prepared to support the amendment, but who knows where we will be in a couple of years time.</para><para>On the issue of insurance, I understand one of my colleagues received a similar email from a constituent listening to the debate tonight about the issue of disability insurance. It is an interesting point, and I hope the government considers that issue in developing the minimum standards. Total and permanent disability is an issue that people do not worry about until the last minute, and funds do provide that. If we did an audit of funds today, as Senator Sherry has suggested, virtually all that provide death benefits I am sure would provide total and permanent disability as well. That is something we should consider, possibly for a future amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>24573</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe difficulty with revisiting exit fees in the future is that we are not regulating the level of fee but regulating the type of fee.

Senators would not be surprised by me drawing their attention to the fact that I have for some time been championing this cause. I do not for a moment claim to be the key person behind the changes we are experiencing tonight in terms of going some way towards recognising same-sex couples, but I do not think it is unreasonable of me to suggest that I have played in some part a key role, at least in the last four or five years, in where we find ourselves now. </para></talk.start><para>In about 1994, I found myself in Melbourne where I was contacted indirectly by a person called Greg Brown. I had not met him before, but we agreed to meet and have dinner in Brunswick Street, Fitzroy. He wanted to tell me about his particular circumstances. As I remember it, he was in a same-sex relationship for some seven years. His partner had died from, I think, an AIDS related illness and he had been able to obtain the reversionary pension from the superannuation scheme of his late partner. Shortly after that he took his case to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and ran the argument that he ought to be entitled to his late partner's superannuation benefit.</para><para>Justice Deirdre O'Connor from the AAT ruledâwith regret, I noteâthat his claim could not be upheld because a same-sex relationship could not be regarded in the eyes of the AAT as a marriage-like relationship. He was disadvantaged, discriminated against and offended by that outcome and decided to begin a community campaign which he called `Homo De Factos'. The result we have before us tonight is, for the first time, the elimination of most of the hurdles that many surviving same-sex partners have found in trying to demonstrate a previous relationship with the deceased and, more importantly, all of the death taxes that have applied to lump sum payments.</para><para>In a strange way, that is not what Mr Greg Brown was asking for; he was in different circumstances, trying to achieve the reversionary pension of his partner. It was nonetheless his initial spark of activism and community campaign which found itself evolving into broader campaigns amongst lesbian and gay lobby groups throughout Australia and with the Australian Council for Lesbian and Gay Rights, in which I served a three-year term as one of its co-conveners and spokespeople.</para><para>I have found it very difficult in this place to change attitudes and, more importantly, change laws, but tonight we see some evidence of change. I would like to place on the record my thanks to the minister for her part in helping bring about the changes we now have and to those coalition backbenchers who spoke out in their party room in support of this reform. I would particularly like to thank my Democrat colleagues who have backed me, for the most part, to the hilt in my strategy to bring about this result. It is not a perfect result. It does not go the whole hog. It does not specifically recognise same-sex couples. It does not change the definition of `spouse', but it goes far enough to remove the two most significant and cruel elements of discrimination.</para><para>I would also like to thank my friend John Davey, who, although no longer a member of the Democrats, was for a time a controversial and colourful character on our administrative wing, the national executive, and some years ago played a crucial role in helping bring the lay party towards the strategy and policy position which we have seen for the most part in fruition tonight. So I would like to mark the passage of the super choice legislationâmuch of which I find arcane and the explanation of which I leave to my colleague Senator Cherry, although I certainly understand the key human rights aspects of it in terms of lesbian and gay citizensâin the memory of the work that was started by Greg Brown. I offer my further hope that we will see real and more comprehensive reform in this area and the many other areas of Commonwealth discrimination as attitudes change and law-makers follow those attitudes. </para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a third time.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>CORPORATIONS (FEES) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>24576</page.no><id.no>R1962</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM (AUDIT REFORM AND CORPORATE DISCLOSURE) BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1959</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>24576</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Consideration resumed from 21 June.</para><para><inline ref="R1959">CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM (AUDIT REFORM AND CORPORATE DISCLOSURE) BILL 2003</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Ross (The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN)</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Lightfoot)</inline>âThe question is that opposition amendments (36) to (39) and (64) on sheet 4216 revised be agreed to.</para></talk.start></interjection><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>24576</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI think I was just finishing my speech on these amendments yesterday.

The issue we were talking about was multi chairs. I see my stalkers are with us again tonight! It is good to see that the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants are with us in the gallery. To be fair, they have followed this debate very closely the whole way. It is good to see them coming along to watch the completion of it. What Labor is seeking to do with regard to the issue of multi chairs is not to ban any director from holding two positions. It is saying that, if they want to hold two chairs, the directors of the second company of which they are seeking to become the chair should have a chance to participate. If the shareholders choose to vote to have two chairs of top 500 companies then they are entitled to make that decision. So this is not attempting to regulate the number of chairs; it is attempting to say that shareholders should be empowered. I see that our colleague Senator Murray has joined us, so I will happily defer to the vote.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name></talker><para>âThere are a few things that I forgot to mention in my contribution.

In Labor's view institutions put pressure on companies which far outweighs the pressure of individual shareholders. That is why Labor's amendments require institutional investors to disclose how they vote in relation to the listed companies in which they invest. With most Australians having an exposure to the share market via their superannuation, the importance of shareholder activism in corporate governance becomes clear.</para><para>Labor takes the view that the exercise of ownership rights by all shareholders, including institutional investors, should be facilitated by government and supported by the regulatory framework. The United States have taken the lead on this issue. In the US the Department of Labor is the relevant authority under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, in relation to US private sector pension plans. The department takes the view that the vote is an asset of the plan, which needs to be managed by those plans with the same care and diligence as other plan assets. A policy statement from the department states that voting rights attached to equity investments should be exercised on issues `that may affect the value of the plan's investment'.</para><para>Recently the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, adopted rule amendments that require mutual funds to disclose their proxy voting policies and the actual proxy votes cast. This rule comes into effect on 31 August this year. I reiterate that the original decision to introduce mandatory voting for private sector pension plans was a Ronald Reagan Republican initiative. This is not some left-wing conspiracy. Ronald Reagan Republican policy introduced the compulsion to vote your shares for pension plans. It is quite extraordinary that Australia, some 10 or 15 years later, is still having this debate. I hope that the government will accept that this amendment is important and worth while. I hope that the government are willing, along with the Democrats, to support this.</para><para>The SEC in the last 12 months has introduced this disclosure rule. Let us make it clear again: the SEC has introduced this while George Bush Jr is the President. Again, a Republican administration has introduced this. Therefore, it is extraordinary that Australia continues to lag behind. But this is the opportunity to grasp the nettle. This is the opportunity for the Australian parliament to adopt the world's best practice that is in the US. This is a government that is very keen on world's best practice. It wants world's best practice in every other sector. Why are we not picking up world's best practice in the corporate governance initiatives out of the US? They are groundbreaking. They have led to a substantial shift in participation in the US. </para><para>As I said, this rule that the SEC have just introduced comes into effect on 31 August this year. According to an article by Stephen Davis in London's <inline font-style="italic">Financial Times</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline>newspaper, `the US rule means that the secrecy in relation to how the US institutions vote will stop on 31 August 2004'. That is how he describes it. Conflicts of interest which flourished uncontrolled will be put under the spotlight. Why will conflicts be exposed? According to the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Times</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline>article, if funds know that voting records will be exposed to investors, the funds will be scrupulous in voting in the clients' interests rather than to further commercial objectives. The voluntary statement of principles which is used in the UK has been criticised on the grounds that, because it is not part of the law, it is impossible to overcome the web of conflicts of interest in the industry. Similar considerations apply in Australia. The question is: will the Howard government support Labor to stop the secrecy and overcome the web of conflicts of interest which exists in Australia? This is another big test.</para><para>We have seen some pretty bad public policy in recent times. We have seen IFSA winning hand over fist wherever it wants.

You may have a win todayâI hope not; I hope the government accepts thisâbut ultimately parliament will catch up with you, and the shareholders and the people whose money you are managing will catch up with youâ </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN, The</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>âAre you saying they will catch up with me, Senator Conroy?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name></talker><para>âCatch up with you.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN, The</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>âWhat do you mean by `catch up with you'?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name></talker><para>âPolicy wise it will catch up with IFSA.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN, The</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>âYou said `you'.

This is a test: will the government back powerful institutional investors and their lobby groups and continue to allow institutional investors to act behind closed doors without the disinfectant that full disclosure provides? Exposing conflicts of interest is only one of the advantages of the requirement to disclose voting records. The second advantage of requiring institutional investors to disclose their voting recordsâand this is according to the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Times</inline>, one of the premier economic journals in the worldâis `it would expose those funds that slavishly endorse every corporate management position'. And this is a key issue for the Australian market.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I am not aware of any single board resolution which was defeated during the last AGM season. A couple of resolutions were withdrawn, it is fair to say. A number of people deserve a lot of credit. Even though I am giving IFSA a hard time, members of IFSA deserve credit for their participation in rolling Rupert Murdoch and in rolling Gerry Harvey. But in general, other than those two instances, every single resolution put up by a board to the shareholders was passed. If that is not 100 per cent tick-a-box, I do not know what is. So when the argument comes that some of these amendments will lead to simply ticking a box or getting bad outcomes, I have to say that 100 per cent of resolutions passed. That sounds to me pretty much like a tick-a-box approach to what goes on by fund managers. It is happening right now. Do we seriously believe that every resolution put up by management in the last AGM season in Australia was acceptable?</para><para>Whilst an open dialogue between a fund manager and a company prior to an AGM may produce outcomes and avoid the need for public disagreement, there are instances where Australian investors have simply failed to act. The best example of institutional apathy occurred at the Boral AGM in October this year, where institutional investors voted in favour of a board resolution that removed the right of 100 shareholders to put a resolution for debate at the AGM where the resolution relates to the company constitution. What a massive blow to shareholder democracy. And what happened? Every institution lined up and voted for it. Notwithstanding that the policies they enunciated did not support that position, every one of them voted for it. So they had one stated policy on corporate governance and supporting shareholder democracy but, when the rubber hit the roadâwhen it came to a test of whether they were voting, firstly, in an informed way and, secondly, whether they were going to vote in support of shareholders' interestsâno, they backed the board. </para><para>This outcome highlights the tick-a-box mentality that currently exists. The largest fund managers in Australia voted in favour of a resolution that eroded shareholders' rights, because that is what the board asked them to do. Culturally, many institutional investors have a tick-a-box mentality: if management are in favour of the resolution, it must be okay. The third advantage of disclosing voting recordsâagain, according to the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Times</inline>; another left wing conspiracy on our hands, Senator Murrayâis that the requirement to disclose voting records will provide `an X-ray picture of how funds behave as owners.'</para><para>Labor also want to give Australian shareholders an X-ray picture of how funds behave. We believe that the market should know how institutional investors vote. This X-ray will also assist socially responsible investors who will be able to see whether a fund takes into account issues such as the environment or labour standards. Why should institutional investors, which control billions of dollars of other people's money, be allowed to operate in secret? Australia is being left behind.</para><para>It is not just the United States that has decided to shine the spotlight on the activities of institutional investors. Last month the Canadian securities administrators announced that nearly identical laws to the US rules are to apply from next year. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Times</inline> the UK is considering similar proposals. The OECD principles of corporate governance, which were released earlier this year, call for disclosure of how institutional investors exercise their ownership rights. The OECD report states:</para><quote><para>For institutions acting in a fiduciary capacity, such as pension funds, collective investment schemes and some activities of insurance companies, the right to vote can be considered part of the value of the investment being undertaken on behalf of their clients. Failure to exercise the ownership rights could result in a loss to the investor who should therefore be made aware of the policy to be followed by the institutional investors.</para></quote><para>Accordingly, Labor believes that fund managers in Australia should disclose their voting records and voting policies.</para><para>This is a global issue, and the Howard government is fighting against the global tide. This is the second time that the Howard government has had the opportunity to pass legislation that would require the disclosure of voting records by fund managers. Let us not forget that the first time Labor introduced amendments was in March 2003. Since then we have consulted extensively with industry and we have released revised amendments. Today is the second time that Labor has attempted to bring Australia into line with international best practice in relation to proxy voting by institutional investors. I will sit down at this point as I am sure Senator Murray would also like to contribute. I have a number of other points I would like to make before I conclude, but I will pass over to Senator Ian Campbell.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>24583</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI will put the case of the government in relation to this raft of amendments. Firstly, this government have not sought to replicate world's best practice in this area at all. In fact, we have sought to look at the Australian situation, look at the challenges we face as a nation, look at our capital markets and look at the unique circumstances of our investment community, with its very high number of retail investors. We have a significant institutional investment community for a country our size. You have to give credit where it is due to Mr Keating for introducing compulsory superannuation when he was Treasurer. That has ensured that we have had significant funds moving into institutionsâor pension funds, as they are called in the USâso we have very high levels of private investment in the markets. </para></talk.start><para>There are significant differences between our marketplace and the marketplace in the City of London, for example, which Senator Conroy seems to have become a recent convert to. There is a very big difference with the US market, where there are individual corporations laws and business laws spread across the 50 states; the Securities and Investments Commission, based in Washington; and a whole range of different regulatory regimes spread throughout the states. I think the biggest registry is actually in Delaware, for reasons that were probably bad reasons 20 years ago but are generally good reasons now. They also have the different stock exchanges. You have an entirely different situation to that which you have in Australia.</para><para>We have not sought to say there is world's best practice. There are different situations in Europe, in Asia, in the US and in Great Britain. What we have sought to doâand we have been quite successful, if you look at the way the Australian market has performed, particularly over the last decadeâis something a little bit bolder than have world's best practice: we have sought to define world's best practice. We have done that in Australia in many areas. One of those areas is the Financial Services Reform Act, which has led the world in terms of financial services regulation, with the sort of information that is available to investors and that is required to be given to potential investors by advisers. In many areas we have in fact achieved the goal that I set for us: to define world's best practice.</para><para>In this area we are assisted by one of the world's best stock exchanges: the Australian Stock Exchange. We are supported by a range of institutionsâwhich I claim have grown up because of this government's very active approach to getting it right and doing a lot of policy work in this areaâsuch as the Securities and Derivatives Industry Association, which has grown up over recent years since the demutualisation of the Stock Exchange; IFSA, which Senator Conroy was referring to in semiderogatory terms, because I know he has a lot of respect for a lot of the work it does; the Australian Shareholders Association, to their great credit; and a range of other organisations that have really developed solid participation by their memberships and engaged in what is, I think, generally a very well-informed debate about corporate governance and corporate regulatory issues that we have here in Australia.</para><para>Most other jurisdictions would in fact be very jealous of what we have achieved in institutional voting in Australia. I am informed that the voting levels for members of IFSA have hit 92 per cent over the last year or so. Senator Conroy is saying that we need to bring in a raft of new law that of course will create a cost and a compliance burden. I think Senator Conroy's badly thought out amendments relating to reporting requirements will of course add cost to the institutions. Who will bear the costs of those institutions? It will in fact be the investorsâthe mums and dadsâthe people who rely on their superannuation investment. They will have diminished returns because of this onerous new raft of regulation that Senator Conroy wants to impose on an industry that has an unrivalled record throughout the markets of world capitalsâa 92 per cent voting record of all company resolutions, a significant achievement by Australian institutional investors. </para><para>What astounds me, particularly bringing forward the amendment this week, is that we have the Australian Labor Party saying, `Let's force institutions to disclose how they vote, disclose their voting policies, disclose their voting record,' when their new star recruit for the Labor frontbench steadfastly refuses to say how he voted. Senator Abetz in this very chamber only a few days ago asked: `Could you please do a freedom of information request and I'll ensure that the AEC gives you all your voting records?' We have the next person to get promoted to the Labor frontbench in Peter Garrett absolutely refusing to say how he votes, refusing to let the Australian people look at his records, refusing to let the shareholders and the Australian Labor Party and their paid up subsidiaries in the trade union movement know. Yet Senator Conroy has the gallâI think he is probably embarrassedâto come in here and say, `Let's make it law for every institution in Australia to show their voting records and their voting policies and how they vote.' Yet Peter Garrett, their new frontbencher, has been promised a senior position in a Latham governmentâhe could in fact be financial services minister, and that would be very embarrassing for Labor. I think Senator Conroy shows enormous gall and probably embarrassment at having to impose on everyone else in Australia a policy that Peter Garrettâtheir new star recruit and future Labor ministerâwill not abide by himself.</para><para>If Mr Garrett wants to abide by Labor policy, which he says he will do, and chuck out a decade worth of baggageâstop logging, stop industry, close it down, oppose the United States alliance, oppose defence policyâI suggest that he now comply with Labor policy on compulsory voting, comply with Labor policy on disclosure of your voting record and voting policy and come clean today. Senator Conroy will join with me and ask Mr Garrett to comply with Labor policy, as clearly enunciated in these regulations. And I can only take Labor seriously on these amendments if Senator Conroy will join me in asking for that. </para><para>Obviously these amendments are well intentioned. The government has always said that institutional investors should be voting where it is in the interests of their members to do so. In fact, that is exactly what the US seeks to do. Senator Conroy comes in here and says, `It's law that you have to vote in the US.' Of course it is not. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act sets out the fiduciary responsibilities and, effectively, says that pension plan officials have to weigh up whether voting or not voting is to the benefit of the members of their fund, and that is quite appropriate. That is exactly what institutional investors in Australia have to do. It certainly does not specifically mandate voting. </para><para>What Senator Conroy will not tell you is that all of these wonderful rules, passed under the administration of that wonderful United States President, were the very rules that applied at the time of the Enron collapse, the WorldCom collapse and all of the other major collapses. That is one of the reasons we are here tonight. All of those rules that appliedâand Senator Conroy was giving credit to the Reagan Republicans for their measuresâwere in fact sound measures, because they did not force people to vote. Senator Conroy is taking the Reagan Republican initiative and saying, `Here is a responsibility for you as a fiduciary.' He is making it quite clear that you have to weigh up `Do you vote or don't you vote? Does voting impose a higher cost on your investors or your plan members than not voting' and make a sensible decision. That is what the Australian government says. </para><para>Senator Conroy says that he aligns himself with the wonderful initiative of the Reagan Republicans, but he does something that Ronald Reagan would never have done nor one of his Republicans. He knows that you need to weigh these things up. You do not need grandma in Canberra saying, `You have to do this to be good.' You do not need nanny saying, `Nanny knows best or Canberra knows best,' to do this. The proof of the pudding is in the eating: the members of the Australian institutions have achieved such significant results in terms of their own voting record. Of course, that will be monitored closely. This is certainly an area that does not need the heavy hand of a centralist `Nanny knows best' Labor initiative in the Senate to force people to do this, which will have the clear effect of just adding cost and diminishing returns to the investors who rely on their superannuation investments. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>24586</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to respond to that diatribe. I have a number of points to make. Senator Ian Campbell, you mentioned the Shareholders Association. I want to follow that up first. I am authorised to stand before you today and indicate on behalf of the Australian Shareholders Association and Stuart Wilson, their CEO, that they strongly support this measure. Senator Campbell, I hope Mr Gilbert and IFSA paid for breakfast if those are the best lines they could give you after scouring the world. You have had Treasury scouring the world; we know that they have been hunting around in Paris looking for arguments against this. We know that you have been looking around for some decent arguments to oppose this amendment. We know that IFSA have scoured the worldâand that was the best they could slip you on a piece of paper?

Well, I will give you his phone number and an introduction to him, and you can have a conversation about how this law works and how he intended it to work. He will tell you in no uncertain terms that this, combined with the SEC rules, mandates it. They have to vote. He will give it to you in black and white. The Ronald Reagan Republican appointee to run the Department of Labor, in charge of this area, will tell you exactly what this has done and how it is done. I do not want to put it on the public record but I will give you his phone number. Feel free to give him a ring. He will give you a run-down on this legislation in the US so that we can perhaps get some education going for you.</para><para>IFSA's claim that 92 per cent of their members vote at AGMs beggars belief. It is a debate I have had with Mr Gilbert and IFSA for some time, and I am sure they are embarrassed that you have dragged this hoary old effort up again. Corporate Governance International do a survey every yearâas I think you are aware, Senator Ian Campbell. As we all know, Groundhog Day is approaching again on 28 June. Senator Murray, I have the exact date, as you always like to correct me. Back in 1998 we stood here and had a debate about participation of shareholders. Back then the voting record of institutions was 37 per cent. We introduced a range of measures and hoped that they would be enough. We hoped that, after six years at least, we would see a substantial increase in the level of voting by institutions in this country. After six years of practice we have reached the staggering level of 44 per cent. That is an increase of one per cent a year. By the time you and I have both left parliament, Senator Murray, we might reach the US level, the UK level and probably the Canadian level, given that they are introducing some of these measures as well. By the time we have collectively left parliamentâeven you, Senator Campbell, may have passed onâwe may begin to approach that level if the one per cent increment continues. That is not good enough for Australian shareholders. </para><para>Senator Ian Campbell, the unique thing about your argument and your argument on behalf of IFSA is that they are trying to have it both ways. They tell you, `There's no need for this because they are already voting.' Then they tell you that there is going to be a massive cost if you make them vote. What I do not understand is where the extra cost is coming from if they are already voting. They cannot have it both ways. If they have already got the systems in place and they are voting 92 per cent of the time, on what basis will they be charging fees if they are mandated to vote 100 per cent of the time? It is important to note that this is not what our amendments propose. Senator Campbell, I know it is not your portfolio area anymore but it is important that you understand that we are only asking people to vote on material matters.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>âYou haven't defined that, though.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name></talker><para>âI think `material' in the judicial system and how it is understood is fairly well defined.

I am confident that my colleagues would prefer it if we were to move it along, so I will conclude. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The importance of these amendments should not be underestimated. Whilst Australia lags further behind international best practice on proxy voting by institutional investors, Laborâand I am hoping again tonightâwith the help of the Democrats, is leading the debate in Australia. The amendments which I moved today will have the most profound impact on the corporate governance movement in Australia. We have an opportunity today to make Australia a leader in the field of corporate governance. If the Howard government votes against Labor's amendments, we can chalk up another win for IFSA, the vested interests and the faceless institutional investors who operate in their own private world. </para><para>To the corporate governance movement around the world I give you this piece of advice: do not be surprised if the Howard government votes against greater transparency in relation to the voting activities of institutional investors. When push comes to shove, this government always backs the big end of town, and today I fear it will be no different. To vote in favour of a policy which is opposed by IFSA and the largest institutional investors in this country takes courage, Senator Campbellâa characteristic which is in short supply in the Howard government.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>24588</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThis matter, despite the length of time we have dedicated to it this evening, was covered quite extensively on the first day of debate, from memory. I think that illustrates its importance. It is a very important issue because it is about the most fundamental aspect of corporate democracy, which is the registration of the thoughtful views of shareholders. I suspect most shareholders around the world today invest their shares through institutions. </para></talk.start><para>In my viewâas I have put it previouslyâthose institutions have a fiduciary duty to the beneficial owners of shares to exercise their vote. The substance of our view is not an aspect of contention. Neither the opposition nor the government takes the view that shareholders and institutions that have a fiduciary duty toward the beneficial owner of the shares, which they act for and manage, should not vote. But the question is: `Are they voting?' That is the fundamental issue that Senator Conroy is raising. Attached to that fundamental issue of whether they are voting is whether they are voting thoughtfully and in the interests of their clients as opposed to commercial advantage or responding to some inducement, which may be hidden. That is why Senator Conroy uses words like `disinfectant' to indicate an opposition to secrecy which can allow either thoughtlessness or corrupt voting. It is corrupt to vote for inducements or for considerations other than your clients' interests.</para><para>Where are the Democrats with these amendments? I return to the earlier debate. We said that, firstly, we are supporters of compulsory voting, because we believe it is the duty of institutions that act for or manage shares on behalf of share owners to exercise a vote; and, secondly, we are great supporters of corporate democracy. However, we recognise that there are transitional issues. The issues are: how well equipped are institutions with the systems and the people to move into full disclosure as well as full votingâbecause disclosure is different from voting? It is one thing to vote your shares; it is another thing to set up the web sites, to record those votes and to disclose them in that way. </para><para>Our view was that you have to contest at this stage a basic proposition: do you require votes for the most important aspects of corporate resolutions, or do you require votes for all resolutions? The proposition put by Labor today is that some institutionsâI might say a very substantial and large part of the marketâshould vote for all resolutions. The proposition we put the other day was that all institutions with a fiduciary duty should vote for three main areas: the election of directors, any issue to do with company constitutions and any issue to do with directors' remuneration. </para><para>I had a look at the article referred to by Senator Conroy. It is headed: `United States reform will spark industry revolution' by Stephen Davis, 20 June 2004. It is quite interesting that one of the things quoted as exhibiting one of the most important areas where a vote will count is towards the end of the article. It says: </para><quote><para>N-PXâ</para></quote><para>which is the name for this systemâ</para><quote><para>will expose those funds that slavishly endorse every corporate management position. Then there are the internet's financial chat rooms. Watch them blaze with comments such as `Why on earth did my blankety blank fund vote for Disney Chief Executive Officer, Michael Eisner?'</para></quote><para>That illustrates my point that the election of directors is without doubt one of the mostâin my view the mostâimportant issues on which they should be exercising a vote and telling their shareholders how they voted and, if necessary, why they voted that way. Shareholders have an intense interest in the directors because it is the directors who represent the shareholders and who are responsible for the assets and the health of the company. I think that reinforces both my point and the points made by Senator Conroy. </para><para>The other point, in brief response to the debate I have heard between the minister and the shadow minister, is that earlier in that article it says: </para><motion><para>That secrecy ends August 31, 2004â</para></motion><para>four days before the election, folksâ</para><quote><para>when mutuals representing some 20 per cent of United States equity will have to file new N-PX forms showing how they voted all holdings at home and abroad in the previous year.</para></quote><para>There is an important point there. They say `voting all holdings at home and abroad'. So, those funds that they nameâlike Fidelity, Vanguard, Templeton, TIAA-CREF and othersâwill be telling Australian shareholders how they have voted in our Stock Exchange and in our company resolutions, but our own funds will not. That is the sort of situation that will beg for catch-up.</para><para>The last thing I would say is that the government has a position and it is the minister's job to defend that position. However, I have seen previous circumstancesâwithout reflecting at all on the minister's or anybody else's voteâwhere the minister, or any other minister, has strongly defended the government's position, the Senate has then put through a vote and later on the government has accepted that. So the fact that Senator Ian Campbell, the minister, may feel strongly about this in the debate and express himself very forcefully does not mean to my mind that the government would or should automatically reject the amendments. I say to the government: you have a basic choice. You can refuse my concept on behalf of the Democrats or Senator Conroy's concept on behalf of Labor or leave all as is, and if you do that I think catch-up will occurâI think Senator Conroy is right: the world will come to us even if we do not go to itâor you can accept one of our propositions or you can introduce your own compulsory voting program with transitional arrangements. Any of those would be an advance on a situation where we rely on votes which are apparently made on a unanimous basisâI have not done the research that Senator Conroy has doneâalmost always, it seems. One hundred per cent always vote with companies, they are never recorded and reasons are never given. Those things do not strike me as a proper exercise of fiduciary duty.</para><para>What we know in this chamber is that this bill has to come back. There are other amendments to it. I propose that this is another amendment that the government will have to review in the lower house. They will have to make a decision as to how they react to it and whether they support it, but the basic proposition is very sound. The basic proposition is that this set of amendments from Senator Conroy reinforces and increases shareholder participation and shareholder democracy. They encourage thoughtful voting and I hope they will display on the record the way and the reasons for the votes that are exercised. I think the consequence of that is good for shareholders. I am not at all surprised that Senator Conroy quotes the Australian Shareholders Association, because this is exactly the sort of issue about which they are concernedâthat companies do feel the full force of shareholder opinion. Accordingly, with those fairly lengthy remarksâbut I thought it was an important issueâI record that the Democrats will support Senator Conroy's amendments. </para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>24590</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am very reliably informed that I have to move an amendment to my amendment.

Labor welcomes the government's decision to adopt Labor policy and reinstate a register for the disclosure of beneficial ownership. Labor's guide to the CLERP 9 amendments, which was released on 30 May this year, indicated that Labor would move an amendment to disclose beneficial ownership. I have two amendments to the government's provisions on the beneficial ownership register, which I will discuss when we debate the government amendments.</para><para>In the meantime, I will discuss Labor's amendment in relation to annual reports. In addition to disclosure of beneficial owners in a register, we believe that disclosure of the top 20 shareholders in the annual report should also be improved. Currently companies listed on the ASX are required to disclose in the annual report the names of their 20 largest shareholders. Many institutional shareholders hold their securities through nominee or custodial companies. This means that the disclosure of the largest shareholders in the annual report often results in the disclosure of nominee companies. Now that the government has agreed to require a register of beneficial owners, it seems only fair that such information on the 20 largest shareholders should also be disclosed in the annual report. Accordingly, Labor's amendment says that, where a company has information disclosed to it under the tracing provisions with respect to the real beneficial owners and this information is included in the new beneficial ownership register, the names of the beneficial owners should also be disclosed in the annual report in relation to the top 20 shareholders.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Watson, John (The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN)</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Watson)</inline>âThe question is that the opposition amendments be agreed to. </para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>24591</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI was going to explain why it is just a waste of time.

I was seeking the call as you called for the vote because we believe the ALP amendment would not achieve any improvement in transparency and would, in a perverse way, reduce transparency by adding volumes to annual reports, which many, including the Australian Shareholders Association, would argue are already so voluminous that many shareholders do not bother to read them. Many companies in Australia have enormous trouble getting annual reports into standard available letterboxes. That is why I have been pushing very hard to ensure that annual reports are easily available electronically.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The trigger for disclosure of substantial shareholdings is unrelated to the information to be disclosed regarding beneficial ownership. The register for beneficial ownership is required to be kept regardless of the shareholding. Government amendments already deal with the disclosure of information provided to a company regarding the beneficial ownership of shares and therefore the information which this amendment requires to be disclosed in the annual report is already easily ascertainable. This amendment would therefore be unlikely to improve transparency and the only result would be voluminous information being included in the annual report. We can see no rationale for the amendment. If there is a rationale it is quite unclear. The trigger, as I have said, for the substantial shareholding is entirely unrelated to the information to be disclosed.</para><para>The amendments that have been moved by Senator Conroy seek to amend section 300 of the act, which requires that, where the listing rules require disclosure of substantial shareholding information in the annual report, the list of substantial shareholders must also include the name of the beneficial owners of the shares, which are included in the register of beneficial ownership in accordance with section 672DA. We say it is creating a significant new paperwork burden that does not assist the marketplace to understand the nature of the shareholding. You are basically increasing the amount of paper that exists. I would argue that one of the great problems we have in Australia is that it is hard, particularly for private investors, to understand many of these documents. All we are effectively doing here is saying, `Let us record in yet another place information that is already required to be recorded under proposed and existing law.' We think it is a waste of time and effort which could in a perverse way reduce the quality of information available to the marketplace.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>24592</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âUnless Senator Conroy has a riposte to that, that seems a persuasive argument and I am glad it was made. The intent of the amendment, to achieve greater disclosure, is a good one but after a quick think about the minister's response and the reading of this it would seem to me that if you already have beneficial owners being exposed then going beyond that to what you are suggesting might result in getting a company that owns a company that owns a companyâyou see what I meanâand you end up with large diagrams and attachments to an annual report. This sort of approach would be better exhibited in another form if it was necessary.

Currently, the 20 names of the 20 biggest shareholders are listed. We are saying that where in the beneficial ownership roll, which is separate, there is now one nameâthere are not diagrams; the beneficial owner by definition is the true economic owner of the assetâwe are seeking to take that name and simply insert it where there is one name currently in the annual report, which would be, perhaps, a holding company. All we are seeking to do is take a name that has already been revealed to the company on one roll and have it replace a name that is possibly not the beneficial owner or is just a holding company in the top 20. So there will only be 20 names. I am bemused by the minister's interpretation that there will somehow be something other than that. You have to now reveal beneficial ownership under the law. There will be a roll of beneficial owners. We are simply saying, `Take that name if you have it and put it in the annual report.' Unless something perverse is happening on the roll of beneficial owners, all we are doing is taking the top 20 and inserting them into the annual report.

They can sometimes be similar but they are not always. Substantial shareholders are any entity that holds more than five per cent. If you then use the provisions which expose the beneficial owners of that five per cent then you can potentially be talking about hundreds and hundreds of beneficial owners. That is the reality. Because there is a lack of clarityâour people have been working assiduously trying to figure out the genesis of thisâI would be happy to see the amendment negatived obviously and for our troops to brief Senator Murray while the bill is doing the walk across the hall and back. We think that Senator Conroy does not understand the amount of extra paperwork this will create. There seems to be a confusion between substantial shareholders and the top 20.

I remind those in the chamber who have not heard these remarks before that the amendments are drawn from Lord Nolan's commission of inquiry in Britain. I always regard Britain as a semi-democracy because it does not have a Senate. In Britain Lord Nolan was asked to have a look at the whole business of patronage and he came up with a set of recommendations andâGlory be!âthe government and the parliament of Great Britain accepted them. So this is now standard practice. This standard practice in Britain seeks to prohibit patronage and favouritism. I was absolutely delighted to discover that in our own Australian Federal Police Act 1979 there is a prohibition on patronage and favouritism. It reads as follows:</para><quote><para>The Commissioner, or delegate of the Commissioner, in exercising powers under this Act in relation to the engagement of AFP employees or otherwise in relation to AFP employees, must do so without patronage or favouritism.</para></quote><para>If anyone wanted to amend my amendment and put that in instead, I would be delighted, but it is about time that the procedures for merit selection of government appointments were introduced and became standard practice and that patronage was diminishedâby whichever government and whichever political party. And it is about time that our citizens were assured that nobody could ever be appointed without going through a merit process. Of course I do not mean to reflect on some absolutely magnificent appointments by the previous Labor government over time in all fields, and by this government over time. But there have been some real doozeys which definitely stink of patronage and favouritism. With those remarks, and in the expectation of this going down for the 24th time, I recommend the amendment to the chamber.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>24595</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thought I should respond to your invitation to add to your book, as I know you are keeping a list of the arguments that have been presented against this proposal.

I have already discussed these amendments during the second reading debate. I do not want to go into detail again, given the time. However, I would like to make the comment that the ASX also recently indicated it was concerned about analyst independence. Karen Hamilton, the head of the market integrity division of the ASX, is quoted in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> as saying:</para><quote><para>There is concern that the recommendations of many brokers and analysts seem biased, driven not by an assessment of the investment opportunity but by the lure of commissions or the lucrative riches of the investment banking side of the business ...</para></quote><para>This is a damning comment by the head of the market integrity division at the ASX. Ms Hamilton's comments reinforce the concerns which ASIC raised in their report into analyst independence in August 2003. ASIC's 2003 report said:</para><quote><para>We did observe some systemic weaknesses in the ability of entities to adequately identify, manage and disclose conflicts of interest.</para></quote><para>Labor's amendments will ensure that analysts fully disclose the remuneration and other benefits which might reasonably be expected to be capable of influencing the analyst in preparing the research report. Another amendment based on disclosure is our amendment which requires listed companies to establish a policy concerning trading in its own company's securities. This is not a radical proposal. The ASX's corporate government guidelines already recommend that companies have such a policy. In our view, it should be a requirement in law. </para><para>ASIC's recommendations to Treasury on the original CLERP 9 policy paper state that disclosure is not sufficient in all cases. ASIC recommended that, at a fundamental level, the act needs to prohibit certain activities of analysts where conflicts cannot be effectively managed and that disclosure of such conflicts is not sufficient to mitigate consumer or market integrity risk. ASIC went on to recommend that the following activities be prohibited in the act: trading by an analyst or researcher in products that are the subject of a current research report within a set period and trading by an analyst or its individual researchers against a recommendation or opinion contained in a current research report. The CLERP 9 bill has failed to heed ASIC's recommendations. Instead, the bill inserts a requirement that says licensees are to manage their conflicts. This will be accompanied by an ASIC policy statement. The Howard government has taken a self-regulatory approach yet again, the very approach which ASIC found has failed. In their 2003 report, ASIC found that investment banks had ignored industry guidelines. To quote the report:</para><quote><para>... industry guidelines developed by the Securities and Derivatives Industry Association ... and the Securities Industry of Australia ... have not been adopted as closely as intended and that there is still significant room for conflicts of interest to occur and to remain unmanaged.</para></quote><para>In light of the failure of this self-regulatory approach, Labor's amendments prohibit trading by an analyst in a manner that is inconsistent with a recommendation or opinion contained in a current research report within the prescribed period. This will prohibit trading in securities which are the subject of a current research report within a prescribed period. This will require quiet periods by restricting the publication of any reports for a prescribed period after the analyst firm has acted in an IPO for the company that is the subject of a report. In addition, we require companies to disclose information provided during briefings to analysts.</para><para>The Australian Shareholders Association advised the committee that they endorsed Labor's proposal to require the disclosure of information provided during analyst briefings. If the government persist with their self-regulatory approach, Australian investors will suffer. When both ASIC and the head of the ASX market integrity division raise concerns about analysts, it is clear that problems in industry exist. Labor's amendments will address many of these concerns.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>24597</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âSenator Conroy suggests that the ASX market integrity chief supports the approach of the Labor Party proposed here. In fact, if you read what Karen Hamilton said last week in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> article and if you have heard what she has said to forums I have convened discussing this very issue, you would know that she absolutely and solidly supports the new regulatory approach. It is not a self-regulatory approach; it is absolutely wrong to say that. To call a clear black-letter requirementâa new requirement that not only should firms manage conflicts of interest but put in place arrangements to manage them, and then for the regulator to put in through the policy statement a requirement to show how you do thatâself-regulatory, is absolutely absurd. It is a whole new legal requirement. It is absolutely clear and it is backed up by new licensing requirements under the Financial Services Reform Act, which effectively means people who do not do this lose their licence. It is a very strict regulation; it is a very strict law. </para></talk.start><para>Senator Conroy said earlier the government have not had the guts to take on the top end of town. We are the government who stood up to the trustee industry and brought in the managed investments legislation. Who wimped out on that? The Australian Labor Party. We are the government who brought in the Financial Services Reform Act, which required the heaviest new regulation of financial services in Australian history and hundreds of millions of dollars of new investment by people in financial services, which we have copped enormous flak for out there in the community. That would have been something that Labor probably would have done in their 14th year in power! They absolutely wimped out on financial services and corporate issues for most of their 13 dismal years in power. </para><para>We brought in financial services reforms. We brought in the managed investments legislation. We brought in new competition to banking. We have done all the hard yards on this stuff. We are the ones who have created infringement penalties through CLERP 9 and have copped all that. We have brought in whole new regulation for analysts, after years of work. All Labor have to do is say: `Gee whiz, this government are actually doing all the hard stuff. What will we do to differentiate the product?'</para><para>ASIC reject what Labor are trying to move tonight. Ian Johnson and the crew at ASIC who did the research into analyst independence and analysts in Australia, following the Wall Street collapses, found that the marketplace in Australia was much better regulated than Wall Street and that there were none of the systemic abuses that occurred in Wall Streetâquite the opposite to what Senator Conroy says. ASIC support this model. That is why they have done the policy statement. ASIC think that this way of doing it is more likely to get a result than having a tick-a-box approach which has proved to be a failure wherever else it has been tried.</para><para>The approach that we have taken puts a lot more responsibility where you need it. It ensures that ASIC have the clear legislative power they need to take action where there are conflicts of interest and it gives them the regulatory backing, the legislative backing, for their policies, which are far more comprehensive than this grab bag of ideas that the Labor Party have passed off as a policy.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>24598</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn response to that tirade, let me quote from an editorial of another journal of left-wing conspiraciesâthe <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline>.</para></talk.start><quote><para>Stockbrokers did not go out of their way to dispel their image as the wide boys of the public company securities market, Karen Hamilton, the Australian Stock Exchange's chief integrity officer, said last month.

Amendment (61) relates to section 136(3). This amendment says that any further requirement specified in a company's constitution must not be inconsistent with the Corporations Act. This provision is subject to the exceptions in the regulations. Amendment (62) relates to section 249N. This amendment is very specific. The effect of this amendment is to make section 249N take precedence over section 136(3). This means that any further requirement which tries to modify the 100-member rule in section 249N is void. This amendment is also subject to the exceptions in the regulations. </para><para>These amendments have arisen because Australia's institutional investors turned a blind eye as shareholders' rights were directly attacked by Boral at their AGM in October last year. Despite warnings from the Australian Shareholders Association, Corporate Governance International and the Australian Council of Super Investors, institutions overwhelmingly supported a Boral resolution which erodes shareholder democracy. Now that the resolution has been passed, Boral shareholders will need to have five per cent of the capitalâabout $160 million worth of Boral sharesâin order to propose a resolution that amends the company's constitution. In my view, this is a direct attack on shareholders' rights and runs counter to the spirit of the Corporations Act 2001. Section 249N of the Corporations Act states that 100 shareholders who are entitled to vote at the meeting `may give a company notice of a resolution that they propose to move at a general meeting'. </para><para>Boral has effectively denied each Boral shareholder the right to join with 99 other shareholders and propose a resolution on the company's constitution for debate at the general meeting. These amendments ensure that Boral does not set a precedent for other companies to circumvent the spirit of the Corporations Act. Let us make this clear: what Boral did last year was a disgrace. Boral and its management should be ashamed of themselves. It has attacked its own shareholders. It has turned its back on its own shareholders simply because it did not like some of the issues that were to be debated on the floor of an annual general meeting. It is not good enough. It deserves to be repudiated by the chamber and it deserves to be dealt with and supported by the government.</para><para>In conclusionâand the good news, Senator Campbell, is this is my final contribution for the evening unless you decide this needs to be responded toâif the government votes against Labor's amendments, they are voting against enhanced accountability in relation to audit; enhanced disclosure in relation to executive remuneration; enhanced disclosure in relation to analyst independence; enhanced accountability of analysts; increased accountability of directors; better transparency in relation to the Financial Reporting Council; and better disclosure in relation to proxy voting by fund managers and trustees of super funds. If the government chooses to vote against our reforms which empower shareholders, they will be voting against reforms which will increase shareholder activism in Australia. The Howard government is fighting against a global tide in relation to disclosure of proxy votes by institutional investors. Anyone who owns shares, anyone with superannuation and anyone who has been outraged by obscene salary packages will welcome Labor's amendments to the CLERP 9 bill.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>24600</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI move the remainder of the government amendments together:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Clause 2, page 2 (table item 2), omit the table item, substitute:

The inquiry represented an ideal opportunity for fundamental reform to the charities sector providing greater transparency and certainty. However, the Liberal government has squibbed it on tackling any fundamental reform. It all became too hard for a government that has run out of steam and run out of touchâand, hopefully, will be run out of government.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>âWho wrote this crap?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>âMy colleague Mr Cox assisted in writing this speech, with a little embellishment from me. The draft charities definition bill included the codification of the common law definition of a charity. This would have provided greater certainty to the charities sector, but the complete mishandling of the release of the draft legislation createdâjustifiablyâwidespread fear and confusion. The draft legislation was, rightly or wrongly, interpreted as limiting the ability of charities to participate in public policy debates. The confusion and fear created reflect the lack of trust the charities sector has in the Howard-Costello Liberal government.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The report of the inquiry into the definition of charities and related organisations recommended that the common law definition of a charity be codified. Under common law, to be a charity an organisation must satisfy that two elements exist. They must show that they exist for the public benefit and are within the spirit and intention of the preamble to the Statute of Elizabeth. Let me emphasise that the Statute of Elizabeth is an English statute more than 400 years oldâobviously, it is older than Australia itself. While the government now argues that the common law provides greater certainty to the charities sector, this is a fallacy. There are many impediments to relying on common law. </para><para>First, charities must understand and be on top of almost 400 years of case law to determine whether changes in their activities will affect their charitable status. This creates widespread uncertainty. Charities do not want to have to employ lawyers to get advice on the preamble to the 400-year-old Statute of Elizabeth. The ATO can simply issue a new ruling or tighten its interpretation of the law, and a charity can find itself in uncertain and unknown territory. Codifying the definition of a charity would have provided charities with greater certainty.</para><para>Secondly, judges cannot be in control of cases which come before them. Unlike parliament, they cannot respond to the changing needs of the charities sector. While this bill goes some way towards responding to the changing community perception of what a charity is, it does so in an ad hoc manner. Despite recommendations from its own Board of Taxation on clarifying the draft definition of charity bill, the government simply gave up on these important reforms. We are left with minor extensions to what constitutes a charitable purpose in this bill. This is yet another example of a tired government that has simply lost the drive to take on even the minor battles required to implement change.</para><para>The bill extends the scope of charitable purpose to include the provision of community not-for-profit child care; self-help organisations; and enclosed religious orders. Subject to meeting other common law tests, they would then enjoy charitable status and various tax concessions, including fringe benefits tax, GST and income tax concessions. The provision of not-for-profit child-care services is currently not considered a charitable purpose. Given the inadequate funding and support provided by the Howard-Costello Liberal government to this sector, the fact that they are providing charitable status should be viewed a little cynically. Most importantly, the bill completely ignores the important role performed by playgroups in the development of children.</para><para>Debate interrupted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>24607</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Kirk, Linda  (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Kirk)</inline>âOrder!

I rise tonight to pay tribute to Tasmania's former Premier Jim Bacon. I do so on behalf of all my colleagues, but most particularly my Tasmanian colleagues, Senator O'Brien, Senator Sherry, Senator Mackay and Senator Denman. Such is the affection in which Jim Bacon was held by his comrades in the Tasmanian branch of the ALP that they are too distressed by his passing to speak tonight.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Jim died early Sunday morning after a terrible battle against the cancer which forced him to stand down in March from what he described as the job of his life. Faced with the most harrowing of circumstances, Jim displayed the most admirable of qualities: dignity, determination, courage and optimism. The shocking news of Jim's inoperable cancer propelled Tasmanian state politics to national prominence. For many Australians, probably their first real encounter with Jim Bacon was the grace and dignity he displayed in announcing his illness and resignation. He won national admiration for his determination to fight as hard as he could and to make the most of whatever time he had left. </para><para>His decision to use his own tragic circumstances to warn others of the dangers of smoking I think was moving to us all. A smoker for more than 30 years, Jim had no hesitation in saying that he accepted full responsibility for his illness. He called himself an idiot for smoking and urged others to quit or not take up theâand I quote Jimâ`stupid, stupid habit'. But his frankness, his dignity, his courage and above all his optimism were no surprise to the people of his beloved adopted home, Tasmania, nor to his comrades in the labour movement.</para><para>Jim Bacon was extraordinarily popular in Tasmania, in no small part because of his compassion for his fellow citizens and his determination to do all he could to offer them opportunities to live full lives in a civil and civilised society. Jim had a fundamental understanding that public prosperity was crucial to giving Tasmanians economic and personal security. He knew from his own experience that private prosperity was but fragile protection against changing circumstances. His own middle-class, comfortable childhood was swept away by his father's early death when Jim was only 12. From then on, his mother would struggle to bring up five children on a war widows pension and what she could earn from night nursing. </para><para>Jim was able to continue his education at Scotch College due to a bursary. A Commonwealth scholarship made it possible for him to go to Monash University when he finished school. At Monash he found the radical left highly appealing to his sense of outrage at the established order. Jim was a prominent militant at Monash University during the days of the Vietnam moratorium. His Maoist revolutionary philosophy served him better on the barricades than in the classroom. </para><para>Labouring work on building sites followed, where he found the politics of the Builders Labourers Federation a natural fit. He rose rapidly through the ranks, a loyal lieutenant to Norm Gallagher from 1973 to 1979. Some might now say that loyalty was misplaced. But loyalty was always Jim Bacon's keystone. In 1980 he went to Tasmania as BLF State Secretary, a job that changed his life. Quite simply, he fell in love with the state that he came to describe as a unique `archipelago in the Southern Ocean'.</para><para>In nine years as the Tasmanian State Secretary, Jim came to moderate the radical expression of his ideas, although not his passionate commitment to social justice and equality. His pragmatism was always in means and methods rather than in principles. In 1989 Jim was unanimously elected Secretary of the Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council. In that year as well he joined the executive of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, where he served until 1995.</para><para>In 1996 Jim was elected to the House of Assembly in the Hobart seat of Denison. Less than a year later he took over from Michael Field as Labor leader in a smooth and bloodless transition. Jim had been marked as a future leader from his election. Eighteen months later he led the Tasmanian Labor Party to a resounding victory. In July 2002 he won the first back-to-back outright majority Labor government since Doug Lowe more than 20 years earlier. His personal popularity was such that he polled a record 21,391 votes in Denison. In fact, whenever you talk about any of Jim's electionsâto parliament, to positions in the party or in the labour movementâthe words to use are `overwhelming', `unanimous' or `uncontested' because people just knew that Jim was the man for the job, whatever that job might be. </para><para>But the premiership of Tasmania was the job of his life. It is not an exaggeration to say he turned Tasmania around. He brought optimism back to Tasmania, because his own optimism was so contagious and so relentless. He was sometimes known as `Good News Jim' because of it. And who could ever forget Jim Bacon at the news conference at which he announced he had inoperable lung cancer, pausing and then saying: `The good news is ...'. `Good News Jim' brought good times back to Tasmania. I would like to quote Jim's State of the State address to the Tasmanian parliament last September. During the five years of Labor's majority reign, Jim said: </para><quote><para>... Tasmania has become a different place. There is now a sense of excitement and optimism in the community.</para></quote><para>In no small part, that was founded on the restoration of the state's economy. Maoist revolutionary or not, Jim could make the hard decisions when it came to balancing budgets. But he knew that revitalising his beloved adopted state would take more than budget bottom lines. He knew that he had to make Tasmania a place where people wanted to live. And he knew that the key to that transformation was openness and inclusiveness, a vibrant and welcoming public culture. Jim Bacon led the way in Tasmanian mainstream politics to removing longstanding discrimination against gay and lesbian Tasmanians, taking Tasmania from the most backward state in Australia to the most progressive. His government passed antidiscrimination legislation that has been described as among the most progressive not only in Australia but also throughout the world.</para><para>He will always be remembered for his dedicated and passionate campaigning for social justice for Tasmania's Indigenous community and for the bridges he built between government and those communities. In fact, you could say that he built bridges wherever he went. One of the most enduring memories that the people of Tasmania will carry of him is the regular forums he held in the small towns and suburbs of Tasmania. Government for Jim Bacon was something done with citizens, not to them. He introduced consultative reforms as Premier like Tasmania Together, a community consultative process that sets a series of goals and benchmarks for government as well as formal partnerships with councils, the university and other institutions.</para><para>From student politics to the union movement to the Premier's office, Jim Bacon proved that there is no weakness in wearing your heart on your sleeve. One of the ways that Jim wore his heart on his sleeve was in his very public love and devotion to the woman he called `my darling Honey'. Jim's wife, Honey, has been a constant support to him throughout their marriage and I know most particularly in the last, terribly difficult months of his life. They have always been a close couple, but also a close political partnership. I can honestly say that I do not think I have seen a closer partnership in politics. When Honey said on Sunday that Jim had loved his job leading Tasmania as much as he loved her, all those who knew them understood she was speaking of the greatest possible measure of devotion.</para><para>Our thoughts and our deepest sympathy are with Honey, with Jim's sons Scott and Mark, and his stepson, Shane; with his mother, Joan, and sisters Jenny, Mary and Wendy. The tragedy of Jim's early death will be felt most keenly by his family, but his loss is felt by us allâacross Tasmania, the labour movement and the Labor Party. There are very few people who can truly be said to be irreplaceable, and our friend and comrade Jim Bacon was one of those few. Tonight we mourn his loss. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Bacon, Hon.

I met him very briefly. From memory, it was September last year when I had flown down to Tasmania by invitation to attend the inductionâI think that is the termâof those Tasmanians who were in receipt of Australia Day awards. I remember it being a cold day. It was also a difficult day for me because, while I had arrived in Tasmania, my luggage had not and I had to scramble at the last minute to find suitable attire to attend Government House. But it was a fine day, most particularly because I was delighted to see my friends and colleagues Rodney Croome, Nick Toonen and Richard Hale receive Australia Day awardsâan AM, in Rodney's caseâfor the work they had done for gay and lesbian human rights reform.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Faulkner mentioned in his contribution, in a brief way, some of the work that Jim Bacon had presided over and helped implement in terms of law reform for lesbian and gay people. I want to take an opportunity tonight to expand on that a little more, because the work that was done there was profound and resonated internationally. In doing so I should acknowledge that I am borrowing here from an eloquent contribution from Rodney Croome himself, who posted this on his web site in recent days. I feel it is probably best that I offer that as a contribution, perhaps in a general sense on behalf of the gay and lesbian community but particularly for gay and lesbian Tasmanians. Rodney wrote the following, and I endorse the sentiment:</para><quote><para>Jim Bacon was the best Premier lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) Tasmanians have ever had.</para><para>His Government enacted some of the best anti-discrimination and relationship laws in the world. Tasmania Together, the state blueprint he initiated, commits the island's government and people to reducing levels of discrimination against LGBT peopleâa goal no other society on earth has ever tackled. His Ministers have overseen the development of national best practice sexuality and gender diversity policies in education, health and the public sector. As Tourism Minister he gave the go-ahead for the best gay and lesbian community marketing strategy in the country.</para><para>But Bacon's contribution to sexual equality went far deeper than this. Not long after being elected he became the first Australian government leader to open an LGBT community eventâa photo exhibition in Salamanca Place. When I thanked him his response was that it was nothing remarkable, after all he was Premier for all Tasmanians. </para><para>Through small gestures like this Bacon did something very important, he started bringing LGBT Tasmanians in from the cold and including us as a valued part of the Tasmanian family. There aren't words to describe how important this has been for a community which has suffered brutal legal and social persecution for decades, whose young have been driven out and whose old have lived in fear. In the battle against hatred, fear and exile, in the historic struggle to reconcile being Tasmanian and gay, Bacon played an invaluable role.</para><para>Of course there was disappointment and frustration at the short-comings of the Bacon Government, particularly its decision, apparently with his backing, not to allow same sex couples full adoption rights. But as legitimate and genuine as this anger was and remains, it also highlights how high expectations have risen and how much Tasmania has changed, thanks, in part, to Bacon himself.</para><para>Jim Bacon understood that there was something important at stake when it came to LGBT Tasmanians, something beyond the victories and defeats of parliamentary politics. He grasped that by transforming its attitudes to sexual minorities Tasmania was transforming itself. Shame about a convict past âstainedâ with unnatural vice, disdain for the sexual chaos that once prevailed here, anxiety about being second-rate and worthlessâif Tasmania could learn to stop projecting these traumas on to its LGBT citizens, maybe it would finally face and overcome them. It was no coincidence that, in an attempt to illustrate his vision for the New Tasmania, Bacon's most recent speech to the National Press Club highlighted the fact that Tasmanians are now immensely more tolerant of their homosexual compatriots than they were once believed to be. </para><para>If it is true that we are a genuinely open-hearted people, and without doubt I believe it is, one of the men posterity will honour for this is the late Jim Bacon.</para></quote><para>I share and echo that contribution, which speaks from Tasmania, and make the point that the reforms, particularly the most recent reforms in Tasmania, have been a beacon right around Australia. Many people in the community, particularly gay and lesbian people, deeply mourn his loss and take the opportunity to applaud his achievements and to ensure that the work he did in this area is not forgotten. Clearly, there was more to Jim Bacon than I have spoken of here tonight, but I wanted to be specific in my contribution. It struck me that, in the many pages of worthy contributions we have seenâparticularly in the print media in recent days as they explored the life of Jim Baconâlittle, if any, attention was given to this area and for many people, it was the most important. I offer my sincere condolences to his wife, Honey, and to his children.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Bacon, Hon.

His loss is sad and tragic. His contribution to Tasmania was substantial indeed in terms of not only the economic, social and cultural contributions but the confidence that he instilled in the people of Tasmania. There is no doubt that he instilled hope for all of us. That legacy remains today, and I expect that it will continue. My heart goes out to Honey Bacon and his family, and I extend my sincere sympathy to them.</para></talk.start><para>I had occasional business contact with Jim Bacon when I was a consultant of some 13 years prior to my entry into the Senate. We had our run-ins across the political divide since my time as a Liberal senator for Tasmania. But I do believe that, if a politician earns the respect of both sides of politics, we can ask no more of them. Naturally, I echo many of the tributes spoken in the past week in the public domain in Tasmania and elsewhere. Jim Bacon demonstrated in my view that he was a courageous man, who, in his final months gave a precious gift to young Australians, with his sincere plea to them to either give up or never take up smoking. </para><para>I have a preoccupation with health issues and a special interest in this area. Like all of us here, I despair over our young children who are sucked into the terrible trend of smoking tobaccoâremembering that approximately 19,000 Australians each year die from smoking related causes. Studies in the late 1990s showed that 276,000 secondary school students in Australia were current smokers and that, if they continued with this dreadful habit, a staggering 138,000 would die prematurely. That was in the late 1990s. But the alarming aspect of this is that, while there has been a downward trend in adolescent smoking, this trend has now stopped and is in danger of increasing again. Amidst this tragedy of Jim Bacon's premature death, I sincerely hope and pray that his warning to smokers of all ages will prompt many people to either stop or at least consider their future and the impact their loss would have on their family and their loved ones.</para><para>A member of my staff nearly died from smoking, and I know that it is a source of despair and anguish for him to see teenagers puffing gleefully on cigarettes in public places. I urge parliaments and interest groups across Australia, such as the Cancer Council, to continue the fight against tobacco smoking and addiction. I congratulate the Cancer Council on the work that they do in Tasmania and across this country. To this end, I salute Jim Bacon's courage and the frankness he displayed when he announced his terminal illness to the public. I know that we all share his genuine and heartfelt fears for our young and I applaud him for that. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Bacon, Hon.

Jim Bacon was a formidable political foe. It is for the strength of his leadership, in particular, that he won the respect of Tasmanians and members of the political community across the state and across the country. That respect has been clearly demonstrated over the last few days, since his tragic passing at the age of 54âwhich in anyone's language is much too young. To see a political career such as his cut short in the way it was is not something that anyone on any side of the political divide would like. Some might say that Jim Bacon was lucky to be in the right place at the right time. But to use those circumstancesâto put into place the policies and take advantage of those circumstancesâis what Jim Bacon won respect for. It is all very well to be in the right place at the right time, but you have to use those circumstances in the best possible way.</para></talk.start><para>Jim Bacon's passion for his state is something that will be remembered for a long time and respected enormously by not only those who worked with him within his party but also those who were opposed to him politically. Some people even called him a frontman and said that there were others behind the scenes pulling the strings. I think the reality has been clearly demonstrated since he was forced to leave the parliament early this year. The strength of his leadership and his capacity to hold the Tasmanian government and Labor Party together with that strength of leadership has been clearly demonstrated since then. It has been a completely different ball game politically in Tasmania since Jim Bacon left the political scene. In that respect many people, whether their allegiances are to a Labor government, a Liberal government or some other combination, will sorely miss him.</para><para>One of the things that he brought to the Tasmanian parliament after a difficult time of minority governments was stability. The strength of his leadership and the stability that he brought to the parliament contributed significantly to the rebirth of Tasmania in economic terms and made a significant difference to the confidence of the people and of the business community across the state. It is beyond question that that political strength and leadership are going to be sorely missed. The issues and the topics that he made his own and that he drove include the growth in the tourism industry, which has become a significant driver of the state's economy. In particular, the purchase of <inline font-style="italic">Spirit of Tasmania I, Spirit of Tasmania II</inline> and<inline font-style="italic"> Spirit of Tasmania III</inline>, which<inline font-style="italic"></inline>has seen an influx of tourists and other people into Tasmania over the last couple of years, will be remembered as one of Jim's significant legacies. But I think the most significant thingsâand I have mentioned them several timesâare the strength of leadership that Jim displayed and his commitment to the state.</para><para>It has been mentioned that he was not a native Tasmanian. We Tasmanians can be quite insular in that respectâyou have to earn your stripesâand it takes a long time in some circumstances to be accepted. Jim certainly was and, as I have said, he was respected across the spectrum. I met with some people in the tourism industry over the weekend, and there was absolutely no doubt that they saw him as a significant leader and someone who had made a great difference to their industry. It was one of his main passions, along with things like the arts. He drove those things and made a significant difference to the state. In a political sense, you do not necessarily like to have a political foeâsomeone against you on the other sideâwith the strength of leadership of Jim Bacon. But without question Jim is going to be sorely missed in the political context in Tasmania, no matter what your perspective isâmedia, local public or political. I add to the other sentiments that have been expressed here today and offer my deepest and most sincere condolences to Honey Bacon and to the rest of Jim's family as they mourn his passing this week in such tragic circumstances. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Bacon, Hon. James (Jim) Alexander</title><page.no>24613</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>24613</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI formally add the voice of the Australian Democrats to this debate expressing condolences on the death of Jim Bacon, former Premier of Tasmania. When I was asked at a media doorstop on Sunday, the day Mr Bacon's death was announced, for my one-line impression of Mr Bacon's premiership I quite honestly said that it appeared to me that his very clear and immediate legacy was an enormous increase in the level of optimism and positiveness about Tasmania among Tasmanians, an atmosphere of increased positiveness when you were there and an improved perception of Tasmania among people on the mainland.</para></talk.start><para>Since then, that has been a very common theme. Many people have chosen to focus on his legacy of overseeing the transformation from a state that was seen as being somewhat in the doldrums, with something of a negative perception, almost a dying stateâI am overstating it, but there was almost that perceptionâwith all the young people leaving for the mainland or overseas as soon as they left school and an absence of vibrancy, vitality and dynamism. There is no doubt that that has been turned around in a remarkably short time. I have had cause to visit Tasmania many times since I entered the Senate around seven years ago, and I had already developed that impression between 1997 and now. Obviously there are a range of factors there, but when things go wrong we always point to the government and when things have been positive we should acknowledge those who were in leadership positions during that period.</para><para>His leadership was over a very short period of time. He was elected to parliament in 1996 and, within two years, was Premier, which was a very quick rise. The fact that within that short space of time he was able to be so successful and so dominant in that role is obviously a clear recognition of his leadership skills. I note that under Tasmania's unique and, I might say, very democratic and highly desirable electoral system, Jim Bacon was the biggest vote winner in the history of his electorate of Denison and the third highest vote winner in any electorate at any election since 1909. He was the highest vote getter in Denison and, in the election in 1998, the second highest vote getter in Denison. A clear indication of his popularity is that, under the Robson rotation system, people have the opportunity to vote for a range of different candidates from the one party and, therefore, the personal following or the personal attractiveness of individual candidates is much more clearly determined.</para><para>Mr Bacon, as leader of the Labor Party in Tasmania, championed some policies and approaches that the Democrats strongly opposedâand none more easily identifiable than the Labor Party's approach in Tasmania towards logging of old-growth forests. There continues to be an ongoing need to resolve that issue. But I think the reason why not just Tasmanians feel better about their state but also other Australians feel more positively towards Tasmania is the leadership Jim Bacon demonstrated on other initiatives over the period of his premiership. </para><para>It is an irony that, for a state that was often perceived as being very conservative and backwardâI am not saying fairly perceived, but nonetheless occasionally perceived that wayâit is literally leading the nation in enormous socially progressive reforms, particularly in the area of same-sex relationship laws. My colleague Senator Greig has already spoken about that. Not only were those reforms often seen as courageous but also they were implemented strongly and proudly. They were sold and promoted as desirable, worthwhile and positive reforms.</para><para>By showing that leadership, Tasmania has provided a goal to people around the rest of Australia who are still campaigning to remove discrimination. It has given an indication that changes like that can be made, that the sky does not fall in and that civilisation does not crumble, but rather that civilisation and society is strengthened. To be the leader at a time those laws were put throughâlaws that had to go through an upper house that is still often described as conservative and is not controlled by the Labor PartyâI think again showed his strong leadership. That issue alone is a great legacy and a clear example. People now point to Tasmania and say that it has amazingly progressive innovations and socially forward-thinking and positive initiatives. </para><para>Jim Bacon had a strong record on promoting affirmative action for women. He took a strong approach in speaking out more positively than many in his party on refugees, for example. Whilst in no way would the Democrats pretend that we agreed with his policy approach on all issues, clearly this was somebody who was above average, who was above the crowd, and, to some extent, somebody who was right up in the top rungs of excellence in terms of leadership, in articulating a vision and in being able to share and infuse his community with that vision. That is something that I think anybody would be proud of. I am sure that amongst the great distress of his family there is a lot of pride in what Mr Bacon has achieved. </para><para>Our condolences go to his wife, Honey, and his sons, Mark and Scott, and Honey's son, Shane. Fifty-four is far too young for anybody to die. He has left another legacyâa stark reminder that even the high-flyers can be struck down, and struck down very quickly, by diseases such as lung cancer. Nobody can think it is not going to happen to them. In one sense, even though it is a terrible way to do it, demonstrating that fact I hope will be an extra motivation and incentive to many people to give up tobacco or, hopefully, not to start. That is an area where I think we can and have to continue to do more. For his family, they will be grieving enormously and paying the awful emotional price of that outcome. </para><para>Despite the fact that 54 is a very young age, there is no doubt that Jim Bacon achieved an enormous amount. If any of us manage to achieve close to what he has achieved and leave that much of a mark, even with a far longer life, I think we will be doing very well. It is appropriate to mark his contribution, particularly to his state, obviously to the Labor Party and no doubt to his family and loved ones. The Democrats join in marking Jim Bacon's contribution to political life in this country, his clear achievement in promoting Tasmania and making it a state to be proud of and a state that Australians look positively towards. </para><para>I have mentioned the debate on the future of logging in Tasmania and old-growth forestsâand no doubt that will continue. There is also the promotion of some of the other industries that provide development and economic opportunities and that reinforce and promote the environment in TasmaniaâI am particularly thinking of tourism. That is an area where again some positive steps were taken. I have no doubt, without pretending it is the magic solution for everything, that is the direction for a large part of maintaining a strong future for Tasmania. I am happy at any opportunity to promote and speak positively about the desirability of visiting a beautiful state and a wonderful place. It is also for the many people I know who have moved thereâand it is a growing number of people that are moving there, at some pressure, I might add, because of the price of housingâa great place to live. A lot of that credit must go to Jim Bacon, and the Democrats join in condolences to his family to mark the achievements of his life both in parliament and in broader public life. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Bacon, Hon.

He made a great contribution to the political affairs of Tasmania and was a great humanitarian.</para></talk.start><para>I would also like to talk about the environment. The Howard government has been more committed to, and done more for, the environment than any other government in Australian history. This is demonstrated by the fact that in 2003-04, for the first time ever, environmental spending across all portfolios will exceed $2 billion. Indeed, spending on environmental initiatives in the agriculture and environment portfolios this financial year comes in at just under $1 billion and has more than doubled since the 1995-96 budget.</para><para>A measure of the significance that the Howard government places on the environment is that a sustainable environment has been nominated as one of the government's nine strategic priorities. The Prime Minister chairs the sustainable environment committee of cabinet to ensure a whole-of-government approach to the environment. The centrepiece of the government's environmental commitment is the Natural Heritage Trust. This $2.7 billion program represents the largest ever environmental commitment in the history of our nation. Its object is to conserve and rehabilitate Australia's environment and natural resources. The trust provides funding for projects at the regional level as well as the state and national levels through four programs: Landcare, Bushcare, Rivercare and Coastcare.</para><para>The community component is delivered via the Australian government Envirofund. The priorities of the Natural Heritage Trust include protection and restoration of the habitat of threatened species; rehabilitation and conservation of native vegetation by reducing land clearing and via revegetation measures; the protection and restoration of water resources such as rivers and wetlands; addressing land degradation; the protection and restoration of marine and coastal environments; the control and eradication of weeds and feral animals and other threats to biodiversity; and the provision to landholders and community groups of conservation and resource management skills.</para><para>Over the life of the Natural Heritage Trust, more than 400,000 volunteers have contributed to in excess of 12,000 projects across the country. The trust has funded native vegetation projects on more than 700,000 hectares of land, including the protection of more than half a million hectares of native vegetation, rehabilitation of more than 127,000 hectares of remnant vegetation and the replanting of more than 98,000 hectares of cleared land. An indication of the sheer scale of the work is that it has involved the planting of over 27,500,000 seedlings and the erection of in excess of 36,000 kilometres of fencing. </para><para>The rising tide of salinity, creeping over Australia's land and waterways, is one of the most pressing environmental issues facing our nation. Salinity costs Australia about $3.5 billion each year through lost productivity and damage to infrastructure such as roads and buildings. In Western Australia, my home state, 1.8 million hectares in the south-west agricultural region is affected by salinity, and it is increasing at a rate of one football field per hour. Salinity not only has economic costs; it takes a toll on native plant and animal species. Indeed, it is estimated that, if the rising tide of salinity goes unchecked in the Western Australian wheat belt, up to 450 species of native flora and 250 species of fauna are at risk of extinction.</para><para>In response, the Commonwealth government, in conjunction with the states and territories, has developed a National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality. The Howard government has contributed $700 million, matched dollar for dollar by the states and territories. Under the $1.4 billion plan governments will work hand in hand with local communities to tackle salinity. The plan does not impose top-down solutions but engages communities and involves the development of regional plans and measures that are appropriate to each region. It will concentrate on 21 priority regions and aims to control salinity and improve water quality.</para><para>The government's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 was groundbreaking legislation and represented a long overdue overhaul of the Commonwealth's environmental laws, which dated from the early 1970s. The act represents a vast improvement on the legislation that it replaced, and it has to be regarded as one of the principal achievements of the Howard government in the area of the environment. Natural resource management is a responsibility of the states, but the fact is that environmental issues do not stop at state boundaries. The act provides a national scheme to protect and conserve Australia's environment and focuses on seven matters of national environmental significance: world heritage properties; national heritage places; Ramsar wetlands of international significance; nationally listed threatened species and ecological communities; listed migratory species; Commonwealth marine areas; and nuclear actions, including uranium mining. An action that is likely to have a significant impact on a matter of national significance is subject to an assessment and approval process. The act was a major step forward in protecting the environment of Australia.</para><para>The Howard government has been committed to sustainable forestry practices that provide an appropriate balance between maintaining a viable forestry industry and protecting old-growth forests. The Howard government has undertaken regional forest agreements with the states which have had the outcome of protecting forests throughout this country. There are 10 RFAs in four states: Tasmania, Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia. It is disappointing that the Western Australian Labor government has chosen more or less to tear up the agreement with their state. In their blind pursuit of the deep green vote and for base political reasons and in total disregard for the welfare of timber communities in the south-west, the Gallop government's forest management plan allocates just 131,000 cubic metres of jarrah sawlogs a year. The RFA required an allocation of 286,000 cubic metres per annum. The federal government was willing to agree to an allocation of 200,000 cubic metres on the basis that this is a sustainable level and would have ensured the viability of the forestry industry and preserved jobs, but the Gallop government's allocation falls short of this and showed a disregard for the future of the forestry industry and the workers in it. </para><para>Turning to the Kyoto protocol, the Howard government has made it quite clear that while it will meet the greenhouse requirements of the Kyoto protocol it has no intention of signing this treaty because it is fundamentally flawed in that it is not globally comprehensive. It excludes three-quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions, does not require major emitters such as China and India to meet emission reduction targets and, because it is not globally comprehensive, has the potential to damage the international competitiveness of Australian industry, thereby threatening our economic prosperity and costing jobs. The Howard government is committed to fostering the development of the renewable energy industry through various initiatives such as the MRET scheme and various other programs. In summary, the Howard government has an outstanding record on environmental policy, which no government in the history of this country can match.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Save the Bilby Fund</title><page.no>24617</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>24617</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI seek leave to incorporate my speech in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as followsâ</inline></para><quote><para>Back in September 1999 I gave a speech regarding the efforts of Mr Frank Manthey and Mr Peter McRae, both National Park Wildlife Officers and founders of the Save the Bilby Fund.</para><para>The Save the Bilby fund seeks to halt the decline of the Bilby by establishing a protected breeding colony in the Currawinya National Park in Queensland.</para><para>The Bilby is a threatened native species in Queensland.</para><para>This small, nocturnal, ground dwelling mammal the size of a rabbit with large hairless ears was once found throughout Australia.</para><para>Sadly the only colonies remaining are in the west and northern states of Australia.</para><para>Numbers have dwindled to approximately 500.

Child care is a crucial part of the social infrastructure in Australia, particularly given the rising proportion of mothers who are in paid employment. According to the ABS there were 4,304,900 women in employment in Australia in May 2004. Obviously, many of these women are working mums. It is important to remember that, while the Labor Party opposite likes to characterise this as a financial imperative, for many women it is an issue of choice. Because choice comes into the equationâas it always should and always will under Liberal governmentsâthere is a natural corollary: choice should extend to matters of where parents choose to place their children in care during working hours. </para><para>Child care must be fostered by government policy and contributed to by public fundingâand is, of course. About one-third of all long day care centres were classified as community based in June 2001, that is, centres operated by religious organisations, charities, local and state governments and various community groups. At the same date, more than nine out of 10 centres providing other types of child care including family day care, outside school hours care and occasional care were community basedâin other words, not-for-profit organisations. Over time, more business basedâin other words, profit-seekingâorganisations will move into the field. That is natural. It must of course be regulated, but it also needs to be encouraged.</para><para>On this side of the chamber, we believe that governments should wherever possible facilitate rather than actually run things. That is not the position of the Labor Party, so far as it is possible to distinguish any position of the Latham Labor Party, and it is not the position of the unions. That should be no surprise. Liberals favour freedom and choice; Labor favours prescription and direction. That is the clear political divide.</para><para>There is an industrial campaign under way to raise the wages of child-care workers in the independent sector. As part of this campaign Australians are being regaled with union inspired tales of horror about working conditions and the like. It is true that child-care workers are not highly paid. There are certainly arguments it is feasible to advance in favour of paying them more. But these arguments are generally not the tired old ones that have been put by the unions. The subtext is that the unions do not want private enterprise in the child-care sector. What the unions want is access to a bigger membership pool so they can give more money to the Labor Party.</para><para>The Australian Services Union, according to an interesting item on its web site dated 31 May 2004 and headlined `Why don't governments care for our children?' says that all Australians should have access to equitable and quality child care. There is no-one I know who would argue with that. But the ASU also says that this is what we have paid for through our taxes. A lot of people will argue with that, and so they should. That is the easy line, that is the dumb-down Latham lineâmake everything a meaningless slogan. We pay taxes to fund all manner of things. </para><para>The Howard government has put more into child care than any other Australian government, and there are 44,000 more child-care places in this budget alone. It has outlaid $19.2 billion in extra assistance for Australian families, including an immediate bonus that will be paid before June 30. It has hugely increased support for new mothersâa maternity payment of $3,000 for each newborn from 1 July 2004, rising to $4,000 from 1 July 2006 and $5,000 from I July 2008. The Howard government has done this while keeping the budget in balance and providing tax cuts worth $14.7 billion and superannuation measures worth $2.7 billion. These measures are self-help measuresâmeasures designed to let people choose for themselves.</para><para>We on this side of the chamber trust Australians and believe in their innate commonsense. There is no doubt that provision of services is a critical factor for government at every level. The minister for children says, quite frankly, that in regard to child-care places available the situation is patchy. Governments at all levels need to work on that, but it cannot be done simply on the basis that the federal government throws money. Far better that it be done in ways such as those carried out in Brisbane by a new organisation headed by Mr Chris Buck through the innovative development of new concepts and choices in long day child care. Brisbane City Child Care is a new concept. It provides what I am informed is the largest nursery creche in Australia and a full sized kindergarten. Its managers say it has the potential to cater for extended hours, and even 24-hour care, should demand for that existâfor example, among hospitality or nursing shiftworkers. And they plan similar operations in other Australian capital city CBDs. In short, it is an innovative operation that demonstrates how the dynamics of private enterprise are able to deliver services that people actually want. </para><para>Last month the member for Melbourne Ports made two speeches in the House of Representatives on the issue of child care and specifically against a large and long established private operator ABC Child Care. I want to make some comments on what the honourable member, Mr Michael Danby, said. I preface these comments by saying that I have generally found Mr Danby good to deal with, especially on matters that relate to his special interestâthe Jewish community. However, his unfair and intemperate criticism is surprising.</para><para>ABC Child Care's owner, Mr Eddie Groves, and a director of the company, former Brisbane lord mayor Sallyanne Atkinson, were Mr Danby's principal targets in his assault on the company. He repeated the claims of others that ABC Child Care centres refuse to employ sufficient cleaners, refuse to pay staff a decent wage and require staff to bring their own music to play to children. He unfairly drew Mr Groves and Ms Atkinson, whom he inadequately described as a former Liberal candidate, into a political argument in his home state. He said Mr Groves gave $10,000 to the Queensland Liberal Party in 2002-03 and that in May this year the federal Treasurer visited one of his company's child-care centres in Brisbaneâand he left lingering in the air the malodorous impression that he believed these two events were linked.</para><para>Following this, Mr Groves appeared on the Nine Network's <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline> program on 31 May. The presenter noted that Mr Groves featured in the BRW rich list and he was asked, of his child-care centres business, `Are you just in there to rip out money?' Mr Groves respondedâafter saying that the question was absolutely ridiculous, which it wasâthat while $12 million profit was a large amount, smaller concerns probably made proportionately bigger profits. I draw the attention of honourable senators to the proper perspective he brought to the issue when he said:</para><quote><para>Everybody wants to talk about the $12 million we made, but nobody wants to talk about the $20 million we've put back into centres that we've purchased in the past two years.</para></quote><para>In relation to sporting sponsorship, it is certainly true that ABC Child Care is a major sponsor of the Brisbane Bullets basketball team. Mr Groves is a self-made man. He is an achieverâone of the tall poppies that the Labor Party loves to cut down. Like Australian businesses of all shapes and sizes everywhere, ABC Child Care is a sports sponsor. And everyone should understand the lack of logical connection between sponsorship and staff wage negotiations. These are corporate decisions whose utility the Labor Party and the unions are singularly ill-equipped to judge. Labor and the unions treat private business, even small business, as an arm of the welfare system. It is true that there are some supply problems in private child care. These are generally a result of factors outside federal controlâsomething else that Labor and the unions would like people to overlook. But the solution is not to attack the private sector providers. The member for Melbourne Ports should know that. </para><para>ABC Child Care is a private provider, which Mr Danby himself concedes does a good job. Ms Atkinson is a community leader in Brisbane whose position as a director of ABC Child Care is questioned by no-one. Mr Groves is a businessman who runs a profitable business which is a public benefit. Would senators opposite please note that this is not a crime against the people. Mr Groves and his company are good corporate citizens and they do not deserve to be subjected to unfair abuse in the national parliament.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Bakers Creek Air Disaster: 61st             Anniversary</title><page.no>24621</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>24621</page.no><name role="metadata">Santoro, Sen Santo</name><name role="display">Senator SANTORO</name><name.id>BOT</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have prepared another important speech relating to the Bakers Creek air crash which occurred in my home state of Queensland in 1943. In view of the lateness of the hour, and motivated and inspired by the example just set by Senator Ludwig, I seek leave to incorporate this contribution.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as followsâ</inline></para><quote><para>A year ago in this place, I spoke about the indelible connection between my state of Queensland and the American nation in the context of the Bakers Creek air crash in 1943 at the height of the Pacific war.</para><para>Tonight I want to say a few more words about this event, because after more than 60 years of silence, it is now something that is marked, in an honourable way, on both sides of the Pacific Ocean.</para><para>At this time the world faces new threats, from enemies who do not field formed divisions or conduct war in the fashion of the past.</para><para>These enemies do not declare their hand. They do not attack military targets or troops of the enemy. They fly planes into buildings. They explode bombs. They behead hostages on the Internet.</para><para>Combating them, and beating them, will take a lot of courage. It will require immense fortitude. It will cost a lot of money and it may carry a heavy cost in lives. These are the imperatives of the age of terror.</para><para>It is fashionable in some circles to suggest that the war on terror is an exercise in hyperbole and that those who warn of its real dangers and potential extent are serving their own political ends rather than those of global amity.</para><para>Those who make these statements, even those among them who do so apparently believing them to be true, are the modern equivalent of Lenin's useful fools, those who mistakenly thought that they were fellow travellers with the peaceful purposes of international communism. </para><para>Six decades ago, when the Americans were our active military allies in another dreadful conflict, many thousands of them were based in or transited through Queensland.</para><para>It was at that time that the 1943 Bakers Creek air crash took place. It took the lives of 40 people and remains Australia's worst air disaster.</para><para>The site of the crash, some of the circumstances of it, and the human toll it took, have been the subject of annual memorials in the Mackay district of Queensland for a good many years.</para><para>But it is only very recently that the circumstances of the crashâit was an accident, not the result of enemy actionâhave been fully revealed to the families of the Americans who died near Mackay all those years ago.</para><para>In Washington last weekâon June 14âthe 61st anniversary commemoration of the Bakers Creek air crash was held at the National World War II Memorial in the American capital. It was the first time the accident had been commemorated on American soil.</para><para>At the ceremony, Robert S. Cutler, a George Washington University professor and executive director of the Bakers Creek Memorial Association in the USA, made some poignant remarks to which I should like to refer this evening.</para><para>It is very fitting, I believe, that something of what he said in Washington last week should be recorded in the proceedings of the Australian Senate. </para><para>Professor Cutler, who with his Australian associates has researched the Bakers Creek air crash story and pushed for recognition of this tragedy of the Pacific war, said this at last week's ceremony:</para></quote><para>Last year, two dozen of us, including 12 family relatives of the crash victims, travelled to Mackay, Australia, to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Flying Fortress plane crash that took the lives of 40 American servicemen in World War II. It was the worst aviation disaster in the Southwest Pacific war. More disturbingâmost of their families were not told the facts of how or where their loved ones died in WW II.</para><para>This year, we are in Washington to mark the 61st anniversary of that crash. The event marks the first time this tragic wartime accident is commemorated on American soil. For the past 12 years, ceremonies have been held in Mackay, Australia, at a permanent monument near the Bakers Creek crash site.</para><para>We believe that this newly dedicated National WW II Memorial is also an appropriate venue to pay public tribute, closer to home. We hope this ceremony will help facilitate closure for those casualty families who only recently learned of the hushed-up WW II incident.</para><quote><para>It is useful to recallâas Professor Cutler did in his speech at the Memorial in Washington last weekâthat at the time of the Bakers Creek crash, the world was weary from years of war.</para><para>The Allies had just defeated the Germans in North Africa, and the Battle of Stalingrad ended in a Soviet victory. But here in the Southwest Pacific, the situation was grim and uncertain.</para><para>The Allies had just launched their counter-offensive against the Japanese forces advancing in New Guinea and still threatening an invasion of Australia.</para><para>The fortunes of war bring both victory and defeat. They take lives and they save lives.</para><para>It is the same in any conflict, declared or undeclared.</para><para>The cost is always too high in blood and treasureâbut freedom and independence, human advance and democracy, must always be defended.</para><para>So it was in 1943. So it is in 2004.</para><para>The links that bind the American and Australian nations together are those of heritage, custom, deep faith and an unshakeable belief in the benefits of true freedom, individual responsibility, and the democratic system of self-government.</para><para>Such links are enhanced by mutual interest in honouring the past and the people of the past, both the dead and the living.</para><para>Our links with the Americans span the generations: they are part of our history, and they are our present, and they will be our future.</para><para>That's why Bakers Creek, now at last fully open to public remembrance in both our countries, is so important. It is important also for the families of those who died on 14 June 1943 in the service of their nation and in defence of ours.</para><para>Thanks to the work of many good people in both Australia and America, only 15 of the 40 families who lost loved ones in the crash remain to be notified.</para><para>Over the past year, Bakers Creek Memorial Association volunteers have been able to contact seven families. We wish them speedy success in completing that aspect of their work. </para><para>Last year, it was my privilege to be involved in the visit of the American party to Queensland and to Mackay.</para><para>It was during that visit that the memorial to the crash victims was formally dedicated, at the site that Mackay people had kept sacred through the years. </para><para>It was an inspiration to me howâacross the years and across the world's widest oceanâsuch strong links had been established between the RSL in Mackay and an American group formed in 2000, the Bakers Creek Memorial Association.</para><para>The purpose of the association is to publicise the Bakers Creek air crash story in the United States; to assist the work of the Mackay RSL historian, Col Benson, to locate family relatives of the crash victims; and to raise funds for the placementânow achieved, as of last yearâof a scale model replica B-17C at the Memorial near Mackay.</para><para>As I said earlier, news of the crash was suppressed because of wartime censorship. </para><para>But as Professor Cutler made a point of saying at last week's ceremony in Washington, the editor of the Mackay Daily Mercury managed nonetheless to publish an editorial that, while veiled in its references, expressed public sorrow about the tragedy.</para><para>It particularly affected Mackay people because, during their time in the area on leave from the war, many of the victims had made friends with the locals.</para><para>At the time it seemed to Mackay people almost as if they had lost members of their own families.</para><para>This is what the editorial saidâwritten by the then editor, Harry Moore, and published on 15 June 1943:</para></quote><para>No matter how we might grow accustomed to casualty lists, we can never grow hardened to them. Their poignancy is not in the names and numbers, but in the meaning of the memories ...</para><para>It is our common destiny to take these blows, but it is our common faith also to share the grief of our neighbourâand this we do today.</para><quote><para>Amen to that. Let us always honour and never forget sacrifice in defence of freedom threatened by tyranny.</para></quote></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Roche AO, Mrs Imelda</title><page.no>24623</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>24623</page.no><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator EGGLESTON</name><name.id>4L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI seek leave to have Senator Coonan's speech incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline><inline font-style="italic">.</inline></para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Coonan's incorporated speech read as followsâ</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>24623</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise tonight to acknowledge the achievements of a distinguished Australian. Imelda Roche AO, the co-founder of Nutri-Metics, recently celebrated her 70th birthday in the company of her husband Bill, her family and many friends.</para></talk.start><quote><para>Hers is a remarkable journey. Born into humble circumstances, Imelda soon came under the influence of a strong grandmother who instilled in her an unshakeable belief in her own self worth and an ambition to succeed.</para><para>As with so many Australians her age, Imelda had little formal training having left school in year 10. But this was hardly going to stand in the way of a woman whose grace and determination would see her become one of Australia's most successful businesswomen through the global Nutri-Metics business.</para><para>Nutri-Metics grew out of Imelda and Bill's talents and successes as direct marketers.</para><para>Early in life, Imelda had a diverse range of jobs including, journalism, bookkeeping and secretarial work. While working as a Manager for a staff recruitment agency she met her husband Bill. To increase financial security for their family, Imelda and Bill established a direct selling business in their spare time.</para><para>Before long the limited range of stock sold in the direct selling business had expanded into clothing and Roche Fashions was born. When the decision was made by Imelda and Bill to leave their respective jobs to concentrate full-time on their new business, the reaction from family and friends was mixed. Some believed that they were courageous, but most believed that it was a mistake to leave good stable jobs for an unknown venture.</para><para>Without formal tertiary education, capital or experience, Bill and Imelda worked full-time for their fledgling company. When reminiscing of these times, Imelda noted the one strength that was necessary to succeed:</para><para>âWhat we did have was unlimited youthful enthusiasm and a determination to change our life prospects.â</para><para>Imelda and Bill lived by that famous quote:</para><para>âSome men see things as they are and ask why. Others dream things that never were and ask why not.â</para><para>Over the next 10 years the direct selling business expanded dramatically throughout Australia.</para><para>In the early years Bill and Imelda sold clothes door to door. Of these early years Imelda said, âIt gave me a very strong appreciation of how hard some people have to work for a dollar.â </para><para>In 1968, Imelda responded to an advertisement in the paper from an American Direct Selling Company looking for management to open its company in Australia. Imelda and Bill opened up Nutri-Metics Australia soon after.</para><para>Over the next 20 years, Nutri-Metics grew to become the largest cosmetic company in Australia with the largest direct selling salesforce.</para><para>In 1991, Imelda and Bill, purchased the world-wide interests of Nutri-Metics. The purchase of the international company, which was operating at the time in over 16 countries, after buying into the business as the owner of a national enterprise, is one of the greatest corporate success stories in Australian business.</para><para>Nutri-Metics was sold in 1997 to Sara Lee Corporation. At the time of sale, Nutri-Metics was trading in 20 countries and had a salesforce of over 250,000 people.</para><para>When asked for the secret behind the Nutri-Metics success, Imelda Roche said, âthe simple answer is working with and through others.â Imelda and Bill sought professional advice when they could afford it and concentrated heavily on building relationships with suppliers and staff.</para><para>In 1997, Imelda was internationally recognised as one of the 50 leading female entrepreneurs.</para><para>Those who know Imelda well can be in no doubt that her passion in her life is all about Bill and her familyâher four children and ten grand children.</para><para>Imelda was a woman ahead of her time, successfully juggling a high profile career and the demands of looking after a family.</para><para>But despite her outstanding success and appearance in the BRW rich list, Imelda has never forgotten those less fortunate.</para><para>Throughout her life Imelda has generously given to many charities and institutions. She has also served on a number of Boards and Committees across a diverse range of fieldsâhealth, education, youth, environment, economic, entrepreneurial and sport.</para><para>The most notable of these representations include:</para></quote><para>	St Vincents Hospital</para><para>	Sisters of Charity Foundation</para><para>	Garvan Medical Research Foundation</para><para>	Bond University</para><para>	International Development Program of Australian Universities</para><para>	Macquarie University Graduate School of Management</para><para>	APEC Advisory Council</para><para>	Trade Policy Advisory Council of the Australian Government</para><para>	Committee for Economic Development of Australia</para><para>	World Federation of Direct Selling Associations</para><para>	Centennial Park and Moore Park Trust</para><para>	Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games</para><quote><para>Imelda's untiring contribution to many philanthropic ventures typifies her spirit of community and generosity.</para><para>Imelda's work with charity was done out of a desire to help others and to share, with those interested, the knowledge that she and Bill used to succeed.</para><para>Imelda's work with charity was recognised by the Australian Government in 1995 when she was appointed an Officer in the General Division of the Order of Australia.</para><para>Imelda Roche's dedication to Australian youth is typified in her untiring work for organisations such as the Australian Young Leaders Program and the Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme.</para><para>Imelda's passion for teaching financial literacy to Australian youth mirrors my own recent announcement of the Consumer and Financial Literacy Taskforce. On this topic Imelda is quoted as saying,</para><para>âWe need to teach all children the basics of financial responsibility, investment and enterprise, which encompasses proper preparation for well considered business risk-taking. And it is never too early to start.â</para><para>Imelda believes that the learning of financial skills, greatly enhances the prosperity of the nation. This knowledge also teaches the youth of today to appreciate enterprise and the important role that job creators plays in the broader economy. </para><para>Imelda you are a great Australian and you inspire those who cross your path or hear your story.

At the same time, the immigration history of family members in Australia, or of persons lodging letters of support, is a relevant consideration. By law, if an applicant meets the criteria for the visa sought, they must be granted a visa. Similarly, if they do not meet the criteria, then by law, they cannot be granted the visa. </para><para>The legal criteria for the grant of a visitor visa require, among other things, that an applicant meets Australia's health and character standards, has adequate funds for support for the period of the visit, and intends a genuine visit to Australia. </para><para>In reaching a finding on the intention to make a genuine visit, decision-makers are also required to draw on local experience in reaching a considered view of the level of risk posed by the visitor applicant. Visitor overstay rates, the level of incidence of visitors seeking longer term temporary or permanent residence once in Australia, and local conditions which can contribute to a higher degree of non-compliance with visitor visa conditions form part of this context. </para><para>ATTACHMENT A

to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	The following answer has been provided by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC):</para><para>The AEC conducts a regular Schools and Community Visits Programme which involves divisional staff throughout Australia conducting public awareness sessions in schools and for community groups across 150 divisions. In 2002-03, the Schools and Community Visits Programme provided 146,000 participants with electoral education. </para><para>In addition, the AEC is conducting a national youth enrolment initiative called Rock Enrol throughout 2004. Rock Enrol is a joint initiative between the AEC and Australia's national youth radio network Triple J, designed to raise awareness about enrolling and voting among eligible young Australians and to encourage and facilitate their enrolment. </para><para>The Rock Enrol youth enrolment promotion has involved the AEC having a presence at each of the six Big Day Out concerts held across Australia during January and February 2004 in the form of a Rock Enrol marquee where the AEC engaged with young people and encouraged them to enrol to vote. Young people who did not attend the Big Day Out concerts were still able to enrol to vote via a dedicated Rock Enrol website hosted by Triple J where enrolment forms could be downloaded for completion and return. The Rock Enrol promotion has also involved the AEC's presence at various State-based community youth festivals in early 2004 to increase the involvement of young people in the electoral process by raising their awareness of enrolling and voting and facilitating their enrolment at the Rock Enrol marquee. Over 4,000 new enrolments have been received as at May 2004 as part of the Rock Enrol youth enrolment promotion.</para><para>Data-matching with Road Transport Authorities has also given the AEC better access to young people through targeted enrolment activities. For example, the use of demographic data from the New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority has resulted in the enrolment rate of 18 year olds in New South Wales increasing from 41 per cent in January 2003 to 79 per cent in March 2003.</para><para>The following answer has been provided by the AEC:</para><para>(2)	During the 2004 election, the AEC will conduct an advertising and public relations campaign designed to encourage the participation of young people in the electoral process. Activities to be conducted will include radio and television commercials targeted at youth, information sessions for youth groups and the development of information, stories and events for youth media outlets. </para><para>	Other ongoing outreach programmes targeting the involvement of young people in forthcoming elections involves AEC representatives visiting schools and universities to raise awareness about enrolling and voting and encouraging eligible young Australians to enrol to vote.</para><para>In addition, the AEC's Rock Enrol youth enrolment initiative is currently promoted via the dedicated Rock Enrol website hosted by Triple J, providing young people with information about enrolling and voting. </para><para>The AEC also placed advertising in a range of youth magazines in the middle of 2003. </para><para>(3)	No. The Government has not issued any direction to the AEC which would affect its capacity to maximise the involvement of young people in forthcoming elections.

Defence plans to have the operational-level maintenance of tanks performed by Army staff, and all other maintenance of tanks and major systems will be performed by Australian industry. Defence is still examining whether to manage its own purchasing of spares or to contract out this activity to an Australian company. It is expected that Australian industry will manufacture some spares, similar to those presently provided locally for the Leopard 1 tanks. Interim support from the US Government may be required until Australian industry support infrastructure is established. This would involve an exchange program of unserviceable components for refurbished components with the US Army. Technical support for the tanks will be sourced from within Defence from Australian industry and from cooperative agreement with the US Army.</para><para>(b) The duration of interim maintenance support from the US Army is unknown, but is expected to be relatively short.
