The Bill, which is largely identical to the Bill passed by the House of Representatives and considered by the Senate in June 2004, is part of a major reform of the Australian Government's approach to Indigenous affairs. </para><para>The Bill does one thing. It abolishes ATSIC. The bulk of the Australian Government's reforms to Indigenous affairs are proceeding independently of this Bill.</para><para>In June 2004 the Bill was referred to the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Indigenous Affairs. The Committee was due to report back on 30 October 2004. It will now not report back until 8 March 2005. The delay has already cost the taxpayer over $1 million in Commissioners' remuneration. The further delay will cost a similar amount.</para><para>This unnecessary expenditure of public money continues despite the fact that the Chair of the Committee has said that submissions showed little support for ATSIC. It is also a fact that the Opposition publicly announced on 30 March 2004 that it would abolish ATSIC.</para><para>The Board of Commissioners has nothing to do. During the election campaign the Leader of the Opposition was consulted about whether we should approve additional requests for travel funds and staff. He agreed with my view that we should only provide for those payments for which we have no choice.</para><para>So we are paying wages for no workâaround $100,000 per year for each Commissioner. Around $200,000 per year for the Chair. Every week costs another $65,000 and when the Board is abolished there will be a minimum payout of four months salary for each Commissioner.</para><para>Enough is enough. The Senate has another chance to stop this nonsense.</para><para>The Terms of Reference for the Senate Select Committee are broad.</para><para>The Committee could continue to investigate the administration of Indigenous programmes and services by mainstream departments and related matters but let this Bill pass so that we can honour our election commitment and indeed the commitment of the Opposition.</para><para>Significant changes to the way in which services are delivered to Indigenous Australian people have already been introduced. A quiet revolution has been underway since 1 July 2004, involving a radical new approach which will see Indigenous people empowered and taking control of their own destiny. </para><para>Nothing short of revolutionary reform is required if we are to turn around the appalling indicators of Indigenous disadvantage and the sense of hopelessness that many Indigenous people face every day.</para><para>The amount of money spent can no longer be the benchmarkâoutcomes must be the measure.</para><para>For too long many mainstream agencies were not closely involved in Indigenous issues. Setting up a second rate specialist agency like ATSIC to do their job for them did not work. Unfortunately over time this led to these mainstream agencies becoming unfamiliar with the issues. We have taken the problem head on. We have transferred Indigenous programmes to mainstream agencies and have taken steps to make sure that those agencies will be much more accountable. The Heads of these agencies meet together each month on Indigenous issuesâthis in unprecedented.</para><para>A Ministerial Task Force has been established to lead the change and to improve coordination and accountability. A new Office of Indigenous Policy Coordination will coordinate policy advice across departments.</para><para>Thirty new âwhole of governmentâ Indigenous Coordination Centres will be the Australian Government's presence on the ground. They will offer a simple, coordinated and flexible âone stop shopâ service.</para><para>In the past Indigenous communities would have to shop around for funding assistance. We will make dealing with Government simpler. From now on we will do the shopping aroundâwe will help with solutions rather than creating barriers.</para><para>Some might say that bureaucratic reforms are not the answer. Of course they are not the complete answer but they are an important part of the answer. The community of Lockhart River in Cape York for example has to deal separately with around twenty Commonwealth and State Government departments. There are over fifty separate funding agreements. The community is drowning in a sea of red tape. We want to change to one agreement with the Australian Government. We will ask the Queensland Government to join us.</para><para>This Government has never shied away from the fact that passive welfare has been devastating for Indigenous Australians particularly in remote areas. In our election commitment we said that unconditional welfare must become a thing of the past.</para><para>The provision of special Indigenous funding programmes will be based on the concept of mutual obligation through shared responsibility agreements negotiated with local families and communities.</para><para>In our election commitment we moved to offer more choices to Indigenous Australians by introducing programmes to fund scholarships at the best Australian schools and to provide support for young people to take up apprenticeships and other employment opportunities in the larger towns.</para><para>We have appointed the National Indigenous Council (NIC) to provide policy advice to the Government at a national level. </para><para>The NIC is a far different sort of body to ATSICâwe have no intention of repeating the failed ATSIC experiment. ATSIC elections cost between $7 million and $9 million, annual remuneration for Commissioners alone costs the tax-payer almost $3 million and a further $1 million for travel expenses. No one could sensibly argue that there are not far better ways to spend that sort of money to benefit Indigenous people.</para><para>The NIC is not meant to be a representative body. It is a group of respected individuals with practical experience and expertise. They have their own ideas and a track record of achievement in various fields. </para><para>They agreed to be involved in the Council because they are committed individuals who want to see change. The Government is determined that their opinions will be heard and acted upon.</para><para>They will not be the only group that the Government will take advice from. There are numerous representative bodies and Committees at the national level that will continue to express their views. Other Indigenous leaders will do so alsoâand we will listen.</para><para>At the regional level we are working with State and Territory Governments, Regional Councils and a range of Indigenous organisations and communities to establish new regional representative arrangements. We recognise that different models are likely to emerge to suit different regions and jurisdictions. </para><para>But we do not want these representative and advisory bodies to prevent us from dealing directly with local families and communities. Our approach of shared responsibility agreements based on a 20-30 year community vision will be the vehicle for that.</para><para>All these measures have been put in place independently of the Bill. Most of the provisions of the Bill are consequential to the abolition of ATSIC or put in place transitional or other provisions arising from the abolition of ATSIC.  </para><para>This includes the transfer of the Regional Land Fund to the Indigenous Land Corporation and of ATSIC's Housing Fund and Business Development Programme to Indigenous Business Australia. Other land and property assets will be divested to Indigenous interests prior to the abolition of ATSIC or be transferred to the Indigenous Land Corporation or Indigenous Business Australia for divestment or use for the benefit of Indigenous people.</para><para>The Office of Evaluation and Audit which audits ATSIC programmes will audit the full range of Australian Government Indigenous specific programmes. It will continue to investigate the performance of bodies that obtain funding from Indigenous specific programmes.</para><para>The current Bill includes a few minor changes to the previous Bill in order to take into account the passage of time and to clarify some specific provisions. </para><para>The previous Bill sought to abolish ATSIC on 1 July 2004. The current Bill provides for ATSIC to be abolished on a date to be proclaimed and for the Regional Councils to be abolished from 1 July 2005 or the day after ATSIC is abolished, whichever is the later. </para><para>So, if I can be clear. This Bill does not establish the National Indigenous Council or the Ministerial Taskforce, it does not transfer Indigenous programmes to mainstream departments, it does not create Indigenous Coordination Centresâthese reforms have already happened. The Bill simply abolishes ATSIC.</para><para>I trust that the Opposition will now fulfill the commitment of the Leader of the Opposition to abolish ATSIC and allow passage of the Bill through both Houses of Parliament as soon as possible.</para></quote><para>Ordered that further consideration of this bill be adjourned to the next day of sitting which is more than 14 days after today, in accordance with standing order 111(6).</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUSINESS</title><type>Business</type><page.no>3</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Rearrangement</title><page.no>3</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Senator ELLISON (Western AustraliaâManager of Government Business in the Senate) (9.32 a.m.)âI move:</para><motion><para>That government business notice of motion No. 2 standing in my name for today, relating to a proposal for capital works in the parliamentary zone, be postponed till 6 December 2004.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION (CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS) BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>3</page.no><id.no>S437</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION (CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>S438</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>3</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Consideration resumed from 30 November.</para><para><inline ref="S437">NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION (CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS) BILL 2004</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN, The</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>âThe question is that amendments (1) to (4) on sheet 4424, moved by Senator Brown, be agreed to.</para></talk.start></interjection><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>3</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAt the end of consideration last night, we had established from the Minister for Justice and Customs that the government has a section in the Attorney-General's Department which operates to vet lawyers qualified in Australia, to determine whether or not they are fit people to represent Australians before courts where matters of national security are involved. I asked the minister to tell the committee how many lawyers are currently listed by this section of Attorney-General's and to give the committee the criteria which are used to determine which lawyers are suitable and which lawyers are not suitable. </para></talk.start><para>What we can take from this is that this government has, in a corner of the Attorney-General's Department, a black list of lawyers, vetted by bureaucrats who are not known to the public or to the legal profession, using a set of criteria that is secret and using some unknown parameters set down by the government. This is a government department and the Attorney-General has the final say, so the operation becomes a political one in determining who is or who is not a fit lawyer to appear before an Australian court. The Greens' amendments would change that. They follow the Senate committee recommendation that there be involvement of the court in determining who is or who is not a fit lawyer and, indeed, what is or what is not information that, in the national interest, is to be kept off the public record. I ask the minister for justice: exactly what is this section of the Attorney-General's Department which determines who is or is not a fit lawyer? What is the nature of the list of black-banned lawyers kept by this section of Attorney-General's? And what are the criteria used by the bureaucrats in this section of Attorney-General's to determine who is or who is not a fit person to appear before an Australian court to represent a person who has been charged and brought before that court?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>4</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âFirst, I will just make this clear so that Senator Brown gets the answer and does not have to ask this question again. There is no black list of lawyers. I repeat: there is no black list of lawyers. He mentioned that there is some black list, some list of lawyers that are black listed. That is not true. I make that very clear for the record.</para></talk.start><para>Second, I am not aware of any lawyers that have applied for security clearance that have been refused. It is open for any practising lawyer in Australia who has a practising certificate to apply for security clearanceâany lawyer. I am aware that the process that is involved is conducted in accordance with the Commonwealth Protective Security Manual. Persons are assessed for their suitability to access national security information. The process involves a range of background checks and assessments. The Australian Security Vetting Service, which I mentioned yesterday, is located within the Protective Security Coordination Centre, a division of the Attorney-General's Department. That security vetting process is a confidential process.</para><para>Different processes are applied according to the level of security clearance requiredâtop secret, secret or confidential. So it could well be that, for the issue at hand at the hearing, only a certain level is required. It could require a higher level. It depends on the circumstances of the case. This is not abnormal in security clearances. These different levels have been around for a very long time. They have been applied across the board and they would be applied to those people involved in the trial, not just the defence counsel. I want to make that very clear. The fact that the prosecuting lawyer is a prosecuting lawyer from the DPP does not mean that that person gains instant access to information. They too would have to be security cleared to the required level. That must also be borne in mind.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>4</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThat draws up the question: what about the judges? Is security clearance required for them? Can the minister tell the chamber more about the Australian Security Vetting Service? Who makes up this Australian Security Vetting Service? Who is the head of that section of the department? What is the line of responsibility through to the Attorney-General with respect to the Australian Security Vetting Service? </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>5</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am advised that the judge is not required to be cleared. Counsel are but the judge is not. I would imagine that that is on the basis of the independence of the judiciary. As you know, we have the independence of powers in relation to the executive arm of government and the judiciary. That is no doubt the principle behind that. So the counsel appearing in the trial do have to be security cleared; the judge does not.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>5</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWe are talking here about the independence of the judiciary from political process. That is why the Greens are moving to ensure that the court determines what matter or evidence should be heard in camera. The court should determine who or who is not a fit person to represent a client before that court. The illogicality of the legislation as we have itâthis legislation represents political interference in the court system, which should have independenceâis writ large by the determination that judges will not be vetted but lawyers will be vetted. I asked the minister about the Australian Security Vetting Service. Could he explain: what is this service, how many people are employed by it, who is the head of that section of Attorney-General's and what is the line of responsibility from the Australian Security Vetting Service to the Attorney-General?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>5</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI do not have the annual report with me from the Attorney-General's Department.

I asked the minister: what are those criteria? I ask for the third or fourth time: what are those criteria? Because the government is turning down the recommendations of the Senate's own inquiry, by refusing the Greens' amendments, how will the minister assure the chamber that the Australian Security Vetting Service will not become anything other than a political weapon to use against lawyers whom the government does not think are fit to appear before a court? What assurance is there? What openness, what scrutiny, for example, does the Senate have of the Australian Security Vetting Service? Where is the responsibility and openness of this service? Can the minister tell the committee: who heads up this service?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>5</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOf course, Senator Brown asked me a different question, the answer to which I said would be found in the annual report. As to the vetting process itself, that was not the question, and he is wrong to suggest that it was. He now asks that, and I can advise him that, as I said earlier, different processes apply for the different levels of clearance. The clearance system is based on negative vetting. This aims to identify anything in a person's background or lifestyle likely to pose a security risk. Positive vetting entails an extensive examination of the person's life until suitability for clearance has been established beyond reasonable doubt. That is a system which is generally only required for the top secret level. In the other levels negative vetting is what is required. </para></talk.start><para>A security assessment from ASIO is required for people who require access to national security information. If a clearance is denied the applicant may seek a review of the decision by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and I think that that is very important to remember. If that is denied they can seek redress in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which is an important aspect. The security clearance, of course, is a preventative measure. It is essential in the conduct of the protection of the national security of this country and the process here is one which applies as it would to anyone else seeking a security clearance. This is not a process to prevent lawyers from appearing in a case at all. It is a process to protect the national security of Australia. That is a summary of how it works. The manual itself is a confidential document which, for security reasons, cannot be released.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>6</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI ask the minister for the third time: who heads up the Australian Security Vetting Service? It is a simple question; it should be a simple answer. I go to the document that we have just heard is secret. Obviously, you get to the point where lawyers are going to be vetted according to a secret list of criteria which is not going to be made available to them. The minister says that an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will be open to them. Are the criteria that are being used to vet a lawyer and to prevent her or him from appearing before a court going to be made available in that hearing at the AAT? Are the reasons for black-listing the lawyer going to be made available at that hearing of the AAT? I understand that they are not going to be made available to the court. I would think therefore that they are not going to be made available to the AAT and therefore an appeal to the AAT itself becomes a farce. It should be remembered that we are talking about a government department vetting lawyers and determining whether or not they are fit people to appear before a court on grounds such as lifestyleâand I will ask the minister about that in a moment. </para></talk.start><para>The Greens are saying that this should be determined by the courts. If you are going to have a just determination as to who is or is not a fit person to hear information which, in the national interest, is to be kept secret, the court should make such a determination on the evidence brought before it by the government. What this legislation does is to rip away the ability of the court to make that determination and leave it to politicians, to the government of the day, to the Attorney-General and to this so far secret Australian Security Vetting Service. I have never heard of it before, but there it is in Attorney-General's. I ask the minister again: who is it? Who heads it up? How many people are there in this section of the department? He says that there is no black list. There is a putative one; there is one coming down the line, and when we ask for the criteria used by this secret part of Attorney-General's for vetting lawyers in the future, the minister says that the Senate cannot have it because that is secret, too. So there is a series of questions that I want to have the minister answer before we proceed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>6</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have been advised that Mr Mark Withnell heads the Security Vetting Service. It is not secret; it is in the annual report. I do not think that is very secret; it gets tabled in this parliament. As for the numbers, I will take that on notice and advise the committee. I do not have that to hand but I think that is in the annual report as well. In relation to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, it does have access to all the information. Senator Brown is quite wrong to suggest that it does not. There is a special security division of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal which hears appeals of this sort. As you would appreciate, there are a number of appeals to the AAT which deal with sensitive mattersânot just in the area we are talking about but in other areas. The AAT is no stranger to dealing with these situations. The special security division of the AAT deals with these matters and has access to all the information. So the appeals process is a thorough one. It is a transparent one and one which provides that aspect of check and balance. In relation to the Protective Security Manual, access to that document is restricted. It is one which I understand is being currently reviewed and updated. There is no dark mystery in that; it is appropriate that these things be reviewed, and I give that to the committee by way of information. For security reasons it is not released, and that is the situation. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>7</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWhen the AAT hears the appeal from the lawyer, is the lawyer given the evidence upon which she or he is black-banned?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>7</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAs I understand it, whilst the AAT has that information, it is not always passed on to the person concerned.

It avoids the court being embroiled in decisions on aspects of international relationsâvery sensitive aspects of international relations. It gives some certainty at the outset as to what may or may not be included. But getting back to the AAT, we think that in the circumstances where you are dealing with national security you have to have a check and balance. We think there is sufficient balance in the fact that the member of the AAT has that information and can quiz ASIO on it. The ASIO assessment is not something you bandy around. We think that in the circumstances to restrict it to the AAT member is appropriate. That AAT member can ask questions of ASIO and can look into it, but it defeats the purpose if it is distributed further. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>7</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe minister has just mentioned ASIO. What is the relationship between ASIO and the Australian Security Vetting Service? Who is doing the vetting of the lawyers? Is it the vetting service or is it ASIO? How does this relationship work? I remind the Senate that it was established last night that we are not just talking here about matters of security in the way people might expectâthat is, terrorist matters and otherwise. This is much wider than that. This involves people who might be a worry to the government in some way relating to international or bilateral trade agreements. We are not just looking at physical security, but economic security as well, and an extraordinary widening of the government's ability to determine what information is fit to be brought before a court and who is fit to be brought before a court. I remind the chamber that the process opened up through this legislation is one where witnesses brought to defend somebody who is charged before a court can themselves be refused an appearance before the court because they are seen to be a threat to security, including economic security.  </para></talk.start><para>This is a dangerous process. The Greens are saying that the court should make a determination about what information should be made public; that is built into our amendments. The court can hear evidence in camera but it should make that determinationânot some bureaucrat in Attorney-General's. Likewise, the court should make a determination as to who is or is not a fit person in terms of security clearance to appear as a lawyer before itânot some bureaucrat in Attorney-General's. The government is saying, `We are going to determine it'âthe politicians. Ultimately, the person in the Australian Security Vetting Service is going to be in a close relationship with the Attorney-General and, therefore, the government of the day, and it is the Attorney-General who makes these determinations. Here we have an intrusion of the government into the Australian court system to determine, firstly, what courts may hear and, secondly, who is fit to appear before that court, both as witnesses and as legal representatives. </para><para>No wonder that the Law Council of Australia has misgivings about this, as did the Senate committee itself, and as does Amnesty International. I remind the Senate that President Steve Southwood QC of the Law Council of Australia wrote just over a week ago saying that the bill as proposed would still restrict an accused person's right to a lawyer of their choice: </para><quote><para>We remain concerned by the prospect of defence lawyers having to undergo a government sanctioned security clearance in order to represent clients in cases with alleged national security overtones. </para></quote><para>That is the problem. This is political intrusion into the court system. This is the government of the day reaching out and intruding itself into the court system. The minister for justice says it might be embarrassing to international relations to have our courts make these determinations. What a specious argument that is. What an indictment on the integrity of the Australian courts. On the one hand, it says that we will not have a security clearance for judges. On the other hand, it says the judges are not themselves fit to determine who will appear before the court or what information should be kept from the public record in the national interest. That is what is wrong with this bill. The Greens' amendments rectify that wrong and make sure that politics does not intrude into the courts. The minister says there is not a black list of lawyers. We cannot know that. What we do know is that this bill sets up a black-listing process. There will be a black list of lawyers. People will be banned. That is the point of this legislationâit allows the government to ban certain lawyers from appearing in courts in certain cases.</para><para>A political choice will be made as to which lawyer is fit and which lawyer is not fit, and the courts cannot do anything about it under this legislation. The Greens' amendments are saying that the courts should be able to make that determination; do not leave it to the politicians, to the government of the day. It is a fraught process, and it overturns the whole history of that separation between politics and the courts which is fundamental to our democratic system in Australia. That is why we are not supporting the legislation as it stands. That is why we have brought forward these measured amendments. These are critical amendments to respond to what the legal community itself is saying is a very serious problem with the government's legislation. </para><para>The minister has simply said: `You have to trust us. We have a secret vetting service, we have a secret list of criteria and we will establish a secret list of lawyers who are banned.' I do not like that process at all. I do not think any fair-minded person is going to say that that is good for democracy. I think it is an affront to the Australian courts and to the Australian legal profession, who are fit to make that determinationâmuch better than politicians, including the Attorney-General of the day, whoever that might be. Whatever one might think of the current Attorney-General, this is wide open to abuse by future governments. They can simply use this legislation before the committee today to pick and choose which lawyers will or will not be allowed before Australian courts in certain matters.</para><para>We are left with more questions that we have answers for. The minister has not been able to explain why this system is better than leaving it to the courts to make the determination. That is the essential point missing here. The minister says, `We'll be looking at such things.' This is not just ASIO; this is a determination in Attorney-General's, who will be looking at such things as lawyers' lifestyles. I ask the minister: `What is it in the lifestyle of lawyers that will be secretly vetted by Attorney-General's that may determine that a lawyer is not going to be allowed to appear before a court?

It provides that aspect of certainty which is desirable for everyone involved. I have gone over at length the desirability of having that certainty, especially when dealing with other countries in relation to security matters so that they know exactly where you stand. I do not think the courts necessarily relish making determinations as to what comprises national security. Certainly, as to what constitutes a fair trial is something which is quite different and which in this legislation we have retained for the courts to decide. In relation to the question of national security, we believe you need this certainty so that, at the outset of any proceeding, people know where they stand. </para></talk.start><para>In relation to national security relationships with other countries, where you have a sensitive decision which has to be made a court could find itself having to arbitrate on that very question in relation to something which goes to the heart of a relationship between Australia and another country. That is not something that courts normally do. In fact, those security issues are a matter for the executive government of the day. Time and time again, the special relationship that we have with foreign countries as two sovereign states is recognised internationally as being something within the domain of the executive arm of government in those respective countries. It is something which we believe in this legislation is essential for the operation of national security and the protection of national security, and it provides certainty to all.</para><para>In relation to a security clearance, I would remind Senator Brown that in this particular bill we might be talking about lawyers having a security clearance, but I can tell you that scientists, officials and people who do work for the government, such as subcontractors who may be tradesmenâfor instance, electricians doing work at ASIO headquarters or something of that nature at a Defence installationâneed security clearances because they may be working on a job which is involved in national security. Obviously you are going to have that applying across the board, and to say that we have singled out lawyers is fanciful. What we have done here is applied a security clearance to lawyers who appear in the courts in these instances. We apply security clearances to plumbers and electricians who do work on sensitive installations and we apply security clearances to people who do work in other areas, whether they work for the government, whether they are scientists or even whether they are staff of ministers. To try to conjure up some misapprehension that we are singling out lawyers in some way or that they are disadvantaged in some way because of their profession is totally false.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>10</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe problem here is that the minister cannot distinguish between the political system and the judicial system, and that is quite clear in what he just said. We are not arguing that plumbers who are going to fix up a pipe at ASIO should not get a clearance or that somebody working for a minister should not get a clearance. What we are arguing is that, when it comes to the court system, a political decision should not be made as to who is or is not a fit barrister to appear before a court. The evidence should be brought by the government to the court and the court should make that determination. This is a breakdown of the division between politics and the courts, because the politicianâthat is, the Attorney-General, the government of the dayâis going to make that determination. That is what is wrong with this system.</para></talk.start><para>Let me give you another example. We have just today got the news about the Red Cross finding that the circumstances at Guantanamo Bay are in breach of international law. There has been torture at Guantanamo Bay, but our government denies it because it is embarrassing to say so to the United States government, which is responsible for the torture. That is a political decision. What we do know is that the courts, even in the United States, are finding against the military commission system, which is a breach of the separation between justice and politics in the United States. It is a breach that has been taken aboard by this government, which no longer recognises the difference and is intruding more and more into the court system. Where you get a failure by the body politic to honour the court system, what does it do in the United States under the Bush administration? It sets up its own false court systemâa military commission, a kangaroo court. What does the Howard government do? It says, `We endorse that.' So you have this dangerous breakdown of the division between the judicial system and the political system, where politicians invent their own version to get a better outcome as they see it. What is happening at Guantanamo Bay is outrageous in terms of the Australian and the American system of justice. It has been put at arm's length from the Australian system and the American system of justice by the politicians. It has been found guilty by the Red Cross, in whom we may trust. </para><para>The legislation we have today is a further intrusion of the political system into the court system. It is taking away the court's right to determine who is or is not a fit person to appear before it as a witness, who is or is not a fit person to appear before it as a barrister and what is or is not appropriate information to be kept off the public record in the national interest. It is dangerous legislation. It is a further erosion of the safeguards in our democratic system that the courts will not be intervened upon by political considerations. That is what this legislation does. It allows the politicians of the day to start interfering with the court system in Australia. We should safeguard against that, and the Greens' amendments do safeguard against that while looking after national security. That is why we are so strongly in defence of the amendments we have brought forward. They are not just Green amendments. In fact, they are not Green amendments at all; they take the recommendations of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, the Law Council, several witnesses before the Senate committee and groups who have spoken out in public, such as Amnesty International.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>11</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is timely to bring the debate back a little to the heart of the Australian Greens' amendments (1) through (4), which is closed hearings in court proceedings.

Almost always the admissibility of such evidence would be debated in the absence of the jury and frequently in a closed courtroom. That is a normal occurrence. There is nothing extraordinary about hearings about these matters in a closed courtroom. Given that the court would be likely to make an order for a closed court in any event, we Democrats do not see any difficulty in mandating that in the legislation. We are sympathetic to Senator Brown's point that, as far as possible, decisions about the handling of sensitive information should be left to the discretion of the court. However, the need for a closed court in a limited range of circumstances, we believe, is appropriately enshrined in the legislation.

In its current form the bill provides that if the Attorney-General provides a certificate, either during pre-trial proceedings or extradition proceedings, that certificate is to operate as conclusive evidence that the disclosure of the information is likely to prejudice national security.</para><para>There are a couple of points that we feel need to be made about these provisions. Firstly, it is important to note that in the vast majority of cases the Attorney-General's certificate will be issued prior to the commencement of a trial and therefore the conclusive evidence provision will apply. This provision is not limited to a small number of circumstances but is likely to apply to the vast majority of certificates issued by the Attorney-General. Secondly, although the court will retain its discretion to admit or exclude evidence to which a certificate relates, the court will no doubt be guided by the certificate of the Attorney-General in most cases. As I argued in my speech in the second reading debate, in issuing a certificate the Attorney-General is essentially making a finding of fact without any real opportunity for the defendant to be heard. Given that the court may rely on the certificate in making an order to exclude the evidence, this may have a significant impact on the defendant's right to a fair trial. </para><para>Again, as I have previously stated, the potential unfairness that is associated with the Attorney-General's certificates is compounded by the fact that they are not liable to judicial review. The only accountability mechanism that applies is the Attorney-General's obligation to provide an annual report to parliament. We feel that, taking all those factors into consideration, it is entirely appropriate for the Attorney-General's certificates to operate as conclusive evidence in any circumstances and, accordingly, these amendments seek to remove the conclusive evidence provisions in relation to pre-trial and extradition proceedings.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>13</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThese deeming provisions mean that the Attorney-General's certificate is, as has been said, conclusive evidence that disclosure of the information in proceedings is likely to prejudice national security. I will deal with the issue of unfairness that might burden the defendant in that matter at a later point. But I remind Senator Greig that at any stage the court can determine if it is significantly unfair. I will not go to the bill to read those parts out which say that the court can at any stage discontinue but, in other words, it can say that it is manifestly unfair and come to another conclusion. But I think this amendment does something different, and we can deal with that issue later on. Whilst the certificate is in placeâwhenever that might come into the process, whether it is before or during, because it can be issued in any timeâuntil the court rules otherwise, it is an offence under the act for the defendant or their legislative representative to reveal such information. So it is a way of ensuring that information that forms part of the process is not revealed, regardless of the eventual decision of the court regarding the capacity for its disclosure to prejudice national securityâso it is held at that point.</para></talk.start><para>It is clear that these are onerous provisions that place a heavy burden on the defendant and their legal representative to abide by the terms of the Attorney-General's certificate. They are required to abide by the terms of the certificate until the certificate has been ruled upon by the court. However, the opposition believes that this burden is necessary to ensure that there is no disclosure of information in the proceedings. Disclosure is only made once legal recourse for the Attorney-General or the prosecution to prevent a disclosure has been expended. So it holds it in that position until such time as it is ruled upon. I think this safeguard is necessary to ensure that no irreversible disclosures are made before the legality of those disclosures is fully tested. I think that is sensible. These irreversible disclosures must be made only in such limited circumstances because of the potentially adverse impact that these disclosures could have on our national security. Once they are out there, there is no way to draw them back. That is why these provisions are onerous and do place a heavy burden on defendants.</para><para>The result of adopting the amendment would be to introduce the potential for defendants and their legal representatives to second-guess the findings of the court and pre-emptively disclose information based on their belief that the court would eventually overrule the certificate. So a defendant or their lawyer might come to a position where they have a reasonable belief that information might be able to be disclosed, and they disclose it. Once it is disclosed, it cannot be drawn back. It is designed to ensure that it is held there. </para><para>Modern courts manage their processes. I have no doubt that they would be able to solve that issue relatively quickly. The court can determine when to bring it on. There is always a need for the court to oversee its own processes to make sure that trials are speedy and not drawn out unnecessarily. This is one of those areas where the courts can play a role, do play a role and have been playing a role. I am sure Senator Greig has listened to the questions to the various courts at estimates hearings. They have indicated what their case management processes are and how they ensure that they do not have long, drawn-out cases and that these issues are dealt with. So I think it falls under all of that. The other issue which could come up is that they could be drawn out, or long periods might elapse. In these instances everyone would require and want this issue to be determined conclusively and quickly so that the people who do have a heavy onus placed upon them can be relieved of that onus once the determination is made.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>14</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe government has considered these amendments and does not support them. Senator Ludwig has made some observations about these amendments that the government would agree with. I will quickly deal with each amendment in turn. The first Democrat amendment proposes removing those clauses of the bill which provide that the Attorney-General's nondisclosure certificate is conclusive for all pre-trial proceedings and for all extradition proceedings. The pre-trial process was introduced as a means to ensure timely justice that is not frustrated by endless delays and challenges relating to the admission into evidence of national security information. It is best to have that sorted out in the pre-trial procedures. That gives everyone certainty. Extradition proceedings are also mentioned. An extradition proceeding is not actually a trial of a person for an offence; it merely determines whether an individual should be surrendered to another country to face trial there. The admissibility of evidence is then a matter for the trial in that other state.</para></talk.start><para>The Democrats' second proposal is to delete the introductory words to clause 27(3), which are:</para><quote><para>If a proceeding is covered by paragraph 14(a) (about a proceeding involving a trial) and, under section 26 ...</para></quote><para>This phrase is a technical drafting means of ensuring clause 27(3) applies to paragraph 14(a) proceedings, that is, criminal proceedings. When you look back at the definition of proceedings in 14(a), it does not apply to extradition proceedings. Clause 27(3) requires a closed hearing to be held for criminal proceedings if the Attorney-General has issued a certificate under clause 26. To remove those words would render that proposed section ineffective</para><para>Amendment (3) seeks to extend the application of 27(3) to circumstances where the Attorney-General has given a certificate before the proceeding. We believe it is not necessary to extend this provision. The Attorney-General will issue a certificate if he or she considers that the information is likely to prejudice national security. The Attorney-General will consider that information only after he or she has been notified that such information may be disclosed during a proceeding. A person is required to notify the Attorney-General only if the legislation applies. The legislation applies only if the Director of Public Prosecutions advises that a particular matter may result in the disclosure of national security information. This would occur only once the DPP has been given a brief of evidence after a person has been chargedâthat is, once the proceedings have commenced. Accordingly, the words `during the proceedings' would cover this from that point onwards. There would be no situation of `before the proceedings'. </para><para>Amendment (4) seeks to exclude the provision that the Attorney-General's certificate is conclusive for extradition proceedings. I reiterate that extradition proceedings are not a trial of a person for the offence but merely determine whether an individual should be surrendered to another country to face trial there. It is an administrative action.</para><para>For those reasons the government does not support the Democrat amendments. I agree with the comment made by Senator Ludwig that, although these provisions are onerous, they are there with the relevant checks and balances. We believe that to incorporate these amendments would render the system unworkable. We have a situation where the Attorney-General gives his or her certificate before the proceedings in pre-trial proceedings and extradition proceedings. They are conclusive. Of course, once a trial has started, if a certificate is given, the court can still make an order that overrules the Attorney-General's certificate.</para><para>Question negatived.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>15</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI move Democrat amendments (5) and (6) together:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(5)	Clause 29, page 23 (lines 25 to 28), omit paragraphs (3)(a) and (b).</para><para> (6)	Clause 29, page 23 (line 33) to page 24 (line 1), omit âthe defendant, the legal representative orâ.</para></quote><para>These amendments relate to what is no doubt the most controversial aspect of the billânamely, the potential for a court to hear evidence in the absence of the defendant and his or her lawyer. I spoke on that issue at length in the debate on the second reading and noted the wide range of highly respected organisations which have expressed concern that this will fundamentally compromise the defendant's right to a fair trial. We argue that it is a fundamental element of Australia's criminal justice system that a defendant should have the right to be present during his or her trial. Indeed, it is a right enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. By enabling the court to hear evidence that may adversely affect the defendant in their absence, this bill violates that fundamental right. We Democrats are strongly opposed to these provisions and take the view that they should be removed altogether from the bill, and that goes to the heart of these two amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>15</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAs the Democrats have said, these amendments aim to remove the discretion of the court to exclude the defendant and their legal representative, if the legal representative does not have a security clearance, from the section 31 closed hearing. One fundamental issue that has been missedâor at least glossed overâby the minor parties is that the section 31 closed hearing is not the trial. I think that is important to reflect upon. It is not the trial of the defendant. My advisers tell me the closed hearing is a voir dire in practice. It is a process which is designed to deal separately with these matters of national security. The opposition, as a consequenceâand I will go on to explain a little more as we take up the timeâdo not support these amendments because we fundamentally believe that these amendments would undermine the basic objects of the bill. </para></talk.start><para>The bill aims to create a separate, closed hearing, not a trialâand I tried to explain how that sitsâwhere the court can consider arguments about the disclosure of information; perhaps forum is a word you could use. It is fundamentally necessary that that forum be closed because arguments could be considered within that and then be declared security sensitive by the Attorney-General. There is a requirement that the forum be closed so that security sensitive information can be considered and that consideration cannot of itself lead to the disclosure of security information such as to prejudice national security. We do not want to be in a position where the forum could prejudice national security. What would be the point of having the forum? What would be the point of having the section 31 closed hearing? The whole point of it is to ensure that there is integrity to that system. If the court did not have the capacity to exclude the defendant and their legal representative from the section 31 closed hearing, if the legal representative did not have a security clearance, then the court would not have the capacity to create that intended forum.</para><para>Without that forum, or separate hearing, the whole object of the bill is effectively defeated. It is not the trial of the defendant. I think you have to put that delineation in your mind when you address this national security bill. You have to be able to conceptualise the difference between a closed forum hearing, which is to determine a particular issue, and a trial, which is to determine the guilt or innocence of the person. It is important to note that a section 31 closed hearing, from which the defendant and their legal representativeâif they do not have a security clearanceâcan be excluded is not, as I have said, a trial. If it is not a trial then the decisions that are made in it are about the nature of the security information. The trial may be subsequent to that forum or the forum may be part of the trialâthat is, you could be in the middle of a trial and need a forum because something came up, and that could come up more than once depending on the witnesses. The trial may or may not have started and you may have a forum. At any point in the process the certificate could be issued and you would come out of the trial, go into the closed forum and determine those issues.</para><para>There are also a couple of safeguards, as a few things might pop up. In the trial itself the court does not have the discretion to exclude the defendant or their legal representative. When you are in the trial, the court cannot say, `Because you don't have security clearance, you're excluded.' Due to the amendments to clause 19, the court now expressly has the power to permanently stay proceedings if it concludes that, due to an order it made pursuant to clause 29 about excluding a defendant or their legal representative from a section 31 closed hearing, the defendant's capacity to receive a fair trial has been substantially adversely affected. If you have a situation where in the forum the defendant's legal representative was excluded because they did not have a security clearance, the defendant's legal adviser cannot then be excluded from the trial. If the court determines that because of a decision it made in that forum the defendant may not receive a fair trial because they have been substantially adversely affected, it can stay the proceedings. When you put those two bits together, the bill would be defeated in its purpose if you did not have that process in place. For those reasons we do not support the amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>16</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âSenator Ludwig has outlined the situation in relation to the operation of this bill.

We have had debate previously in this committee on the vetting process for defence counsel. We believe it is appropriate that all things be canvassed during that vetting process and that that not be extended to the consideration by the court of the length of practice of the practitioner, previous criminal convictions or any adverse findings in disciplinary proceedings. We think the question of security clearance should be dealt with in that vetting process only. I think the extension of this consideration to the court really does blur it somewhat. Whilst that may be a consideration during the vetting process, there are certainly other aspects to be considered. We think it should be considered during the one process rather than having a vetting process and then still having the court take a look at whether this person has any professional blemish on his or her history.

A blanket prohibition on the publication of the record would otherwise prevent this becoming known publicly and an appropriate response being taken. There is a public interest that has to be served in relation to that. It is an important public interest. There should be promotion to ensure that both of these matters are addressed and that the government accepts the amendments. It still allows the court the ability to determine these things but it also provides for two important steps: it ensures that a balance is struck between the public interest and the protection of national security, and it also ensures that the court cannot be subject to an abuse of process, because the appropriate public response can then be taken when it becomes available.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>19</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOpposition amendment (5) also relates to the record of a closed hearing.

In relation to amendment (4) I point out that, generally, the spirit of this proposal is contained in clause 32 of the bill which provides for the court to give reasons for its decision for making an order under clause 31. That relates to an order admitting, excluding or redacting the information or excluding a witness. At the outset, I would point that out to the committee.</para></talk.start><para>In relation to the proposal on the distribution of the transcript and making it public, I would point out that section 85B of the Crimes Act 1914 permits a court exercising federal jurisdiction to order the proceedings to be held in a closed court where the orders are expedient in the interests of the defence of the Commonwealth. So there is a provision for a closed hearing. That being the case, it follows that you do not widely distribute the transcript of the record of those closed proceedings. Clause 29(5) in this bill provides that the court must:</para><para>(a)	make and keep a sealed record of the hearing; and </para><para>(b)	make the record available to, and only to, a court that hears an appeal against, or reviews, its decision on the hearing.</para><para>You really need that for any conduct of appeal. We believe that to disseminate that widely, or even to provide that for distribution to the counsel or defendant concerned, detracts from the fact that you have a closed hearing. Once you decide that a closed hearing is in order, then the record of proceedings should be equally protected, albeit with that provision that the court has to give reasons for its decision and that the record is kept for any appeal purposes.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>19</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn relation to the latter part, there is a public interest for the disclosure of that information more widely, bearing in mind that that is after the court has decided that it is not one of the issues that should be kept private. In other words, it is a matter that has passed through the system and nobody sees any particularly dark issue about it. In those instances, there does not seem to be any practical reason that it should not be made available. I think it also promotes openness and transparency, especially amongst the people that turn up to provide information. If you then say it should be sealed and left for any appeal that is required and be provided to the court only in those circumstances, it does not provide a public good. If you accept the amendments that we have put forward, they will allow a public good as a consequence. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>20</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI can see Senator Ludwig's point on that but I think it is important that the government place on record the fact that, even though an order might not be made, there might be information of a sensitive nature which might be divulged during the course of that closed hearing.

It is our view that clause 31(8) should not be omitted from the bill. This provision reflects the stated object of the bill by reinforcing the manner in which the various matters set out in clause 31(7) are to be considered by a court when determining what orders in fact should be made regarding the disclosure of the information. Among those matters is the requirement that the court consider whether any order that is made would have a `substantial adverse effect on the defendant's right to receive a fair hearing', as amended in this place yesterday. In order to trigger this provision, consideration must be given to whether the effect on the defendant's right to receive a fair trial is not insubstantial, insignificant or trivial. Furthermore, the court maintains an absolute discretion under clause 19 to stay proceedings once a closed hearing has taken place, irrespective of what orders were made during the closed hearing, if in the court's opinion the defendant would be unlikely to receive a fair hearing.</para></talk.start><para>The point I was making earlierâyou may not have been in the chamber, Senator Brownâwas that the closed hearing is not the trial of the defendant. It is a separate forumâif you want to give it a separate name other than `closed hearing', but `closed hearing' will sufficeâwhere a certificate has been issued under clause 31. Notwithstanding what might happen, there is the ability under clause 19, when the defendant is on trial, for the court, in the court's opinion, to determine that a fair hearing is not likely to take place and for that reason stay the proceedings. So what happens is that you have the closed hearing and there is also a trial. As has been said, I think it is essential to the understanding of the process that you have to be able to delineate between the two. A closed hearing can take place either before or during the trialâit can, of course, happen a number of times during the trial. It is designed to ensure that there is fairness in the trial. The closed hearing is to determine as to the competing issuesâwhat is within the public interest and what, in the government's view, comes within national security, to ensure that national security is not compromised as a consequence. For those reasons and the reasons that I outlined earlier about the process, we are not in a position to support the amendment. </para><para>Question negatived.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>22</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move Greens amendment (5) on sheet 4424:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(5)	Clause 31, page 27 (after line 6), at the end of the clause, add:</para><para>	(9)	Where a court makes an order permitting information to be disclosed as being subject to the Attorney-General's non-disclosure certificate, the court must be satisfied that the amended document or substitution document to be adduced as evidence would provide the defendant with substantially the same ability to make his or her defence as would disclosure of the source document.</para></quote><para>The purpose of this amendment is to give fairness to the defendant.

So the provisions within the bill already detail what the court must consider when making an order it may otherwise arrive at. Among those is the requirement that the court consider whether any order it makes would have a substantial adverse effect on the defendant's right to receive a fair hearing. It is important to keep coming back to the fact that the processâgiven the forum of the closed hearing, which is separate from the trialâhas a requirement that the court consider whether any order it may make would have a substantial adverse effect on the defendant's right to receive a fair hearing, as was amended in this place yesterday. I think it is important to keep in train that it is then not the hearing.</para></talk.start><para>Under clause 19(2), in the hearing the court can also come to a similar provision because in that instance, where they cannot exclude the non-security cleared lawyerâso that everyone is in thereâthe court can still stay proceedings once a closed hearing has taken place, irrespective of what orders were made during the closed hearing, if, in the court's opinion, the defendant would be unlikely to receive a fair hearing. So in the hearingâas distinct from the closed hearingâwhich relates to the trial, clause 19 gives the court that discretion to still stay proceedings if, in its opinion, the defendant would be unlikely to receive a fair hearing.</para><para>To put those together, under clause 31(7) the court must take matters into consideration when determining what orders it will make regarding the disclosure of information in the closed hearing and the court can determine whether or not it might have a substantial adverse effect on the defendant's right to receive a fair hearing there. Subsequently, if it did not and the information was excluded, redacted or summarised, then during the trial, which determines the defendant's guilt or innocence, the court can say that in those proceedings, in the court's opinion, the defendant would be unlikely to receive a fair hearing on the information that has been presented or having regard to the way the information has been allowed to come forward from the closed hearing.

Because the court retains this power, we feel it is unnecessary for an additional requirement to be made that the court ensures any editing of a document provides the defendant with the same ability to make his or her defence. </para></talk.start><para>But a more important point to make here is that, given that Senator Brown's amendment (7) has failedâit did have Democrat support but it was not passed in this placeâif we were now to progress with the amendment before us, it would effectively render the bill's regime unworkable. We would argue that that is because the court would have an obligation to give most weight to national security interests in deciding whether to order the editing of a document, yet the court would simultaneously have to be satisfied that the defendant would have the same ability to make his or her defence. So, while the Democrats do not agree with the requirement to place more weight on the protection of national security, if it remains in the bill, it will be important to ensure that the bill is workable and does not place conflicting obligations on the judiciary.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>23</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe government does not support the Greens' amendment.

The Democrats believe it is important to guard against that perception. It should be the case that the prosecutor and the Attorney-General can make their national security concerns clear to the court prior to the making of a proposed section 31 order.

These amendments aim to remove the capacity of the prosecutor and the Attorney-General, if the Attorney-General is a party to an appeal to the court, to vary the proposed written statement of reasons published by the court following a section 31 closed hearing prior to that statement being published. These amendments will remove the required prior notice to the prosecutor and the Attorney-General of the proposed written statement of reasons following a section 31 closed hearing and only allow an ex post facto appeal to vary the form of the published statement.  </para></talk.start><para>The opposition do not support these amendments because we believe that the removal of the prior notice mechanism from the bill effectively makes the entire appeal mechanism contained in the bill redundant. There is no practical benefit in appealing to vary a written statement of reasons once those reasons have been published. The cat, so to speak, is out of the bag, because they have already been published and, if anything were going to be damaged by that, it would have already been damaged. It reminds me of defamatory remarksâthe remarks are out there. So the point of it being varied ex post facto seems to be redundant in that sense.</para><para>The opposition believe that the nature of the potential disclosure that may be contained in the written statement means that it is legitimate for the prosecutor and the Attorney-General to make the decision about the need to appeal to vary the written statement in the context of that statement having not yet been publishedâand that is prior to publication. If there is a requirement to change it, let it be done at that point. For that reason we believe that clauses 32(2), 32(3) and 32(4), as well as clause 33 of the bill, should not be omitted because they serve a legitimate and important purpose contained within the bill.</para><para>It is also worth noting that nothing in clauses 32 or 33 of the bill undermines the court's ultimate discretion to determine the form of their own written statement of reasons. The court still retains that ability. Ultimately, these clauses simply regulate the timing of the publication and possible appeals in a manner that is consistent with the objects of the bill and appropriate given the subject of reasons.

This notice then allows the person, the subject of the notice, to apply for a security clearance from the Attorney-General's Department. </para></talk.start><para>The opposition realises that the security clearance of lawyers is a contentious and controversial issueâthat is recognised. However, the opposition believes that, in the extremely limited circumstances that are contemplated by this bill, the unusual security measure is warranted. This in-principle support for the security clearance of lawyers is limited to circumstances which were supplied by the Australian Law Reform Commission in its inquiry into the protection of classified and security-sensitive information in criminal proceedings. The principle is not one that simply rests with the government. In its report <inline font-style="italic">Keeping</inline><inline font-style="italic"> s</inline><inline font-style="italic">ecrets: the protection of classified and security</inline><inline font-style="italic"> s</inline><inline font-style="italic">ensitive information</inline>, which was released in May 2004âI will not castigate the government again for not paying significant heed to that reportâthe ALRC noted that it felt uncomfortable making a recommendation to the effect that a court or tribunal could order a lawyer to submit to the security clearance process. However, the ALRC noted that if important material is not available to counsel in the proceedings counsel run a risk of failing to provide their client with effective assistance and consequently should consider seeking a security clearance or withdrawing from the proceedings. The ALRC suggested that the proposed focus should not be on the dignity or convenience of the lawyer, but rather on the client receiving the best possible representation in circumstances in which highly classified information must be protected. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee also concluded that the security clearance of lawyers was ultimately necessary if security-sensitive information is to be protected in an environment where criminal proceedings can still go ahead.  </para><para>The opposition shares the view of the ALRC and the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, and for that reason accepts part 4 of the bill, which is necessary to facilitate the process through which the defendant's legal representatives can be notified that they have the capacity to apply for a security clearance.

The court has that discretion. The court can say yea or nay in this instance, and whatever happens from thereon happens.

As I have now been able to determine, that would have the flow-on effect of mandating that lawyers would be required in all circumstances to undergo security clearances, yet the bill itself does not go that far. I am not convinced that that is appropriate. It is then a decision for the defendant or his or her lawyer as to whether the lawyer submits to a security clearance. Obviously there will be ramifications in terms of access to information if the lawyer does not submit to a security clearance, but the point is that the clearance process remains optional, not mandatory.

Unlike for most other forms of transport, operational failure for airborne craft is catastrophic. Just as mechanical safety is highly regulated for safety reasons, so is operational safety in flight regulated. The point is that the demand for the higher standard of aviation safety is nothing new; indeed, it has been the entire basis for aviation regulation in this country. That is why any debate on the issue is so often charged with strong feelings. In the final analysis, as we have seen publicly in recent weeks, the public interest must always come first. One reason we in Australia have had such an excellent safety record is the very risk averse attitude of the public. Government simply reflects that view. We would be foolish to think this matter has its origins in the events of September 11, 2001. If anything, those events simply reminded us that there is no room for complacency. Any security regime can always be improved. As the old adage goes, `Where there's a will, there's a way.' The job of regulators is to make sure that all of the known ways are eliminated.</para></talk.start><para>In Australia there is, justifiably, a strong public expectation that the government will provide a stringent aviation security regime. It can therefore be said that we on this side support any improvements to aviation security, but of course not uncritically. In that context we support the <inline ref="S432">Aviation Security Amendment Bill 2004</inline>. But, as we know, it is just another in a long series of bills presented in an almost ad hoc fashion. In fact, this bill is simply a bandaid to existing legislation and it has all the hallmarks of having been drafted on the run. This bill represents more of the work in progress approach we have come to expect from the Howard government when it comes to post September 2001 security environment matters. This bill does little for aviation safetyâlittle, that is, which should not have been done before. The Howard government has been aware of the need to upgrade the country's aviation security regime for some time. Back in 1998, the Australian National Audit Office, ANAO, released a report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Aviation security in Australia</inline>. This report concluded that, while Australia complies with international standards, more needs to be done. These standards are embodied in annex 17 of the 1944 Convention on International Civil Aviation, commonly known as the Chicago convention.</para><para>Following the horrendous terror attacks on the United States in September 2001, the need for an updated aviation security system became paramount. Those events fundamentally changed the way in which the world thinks about aviation security. Those events also highlighted just how an aircraft can become a very deadly weapon. Yet, unbelievably, it has taken the Howard government in excess of 2Â½ years after September 11 to attend to our air security legislation. It was not until almost 30 months after those terrible acts that aviation security legislation was finally passed. This bill can therefore really be characterised as a work in progress. At every given opportunity, the government like to remind Australians that they take issues of national security quite seriously; yet we have another bandaid to cover yet another crack in the Howard government's security arrangements.</para><para>This bill has two parts. The first amends the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 and the Civil Aviation Act 1988. These amendments will allow background checking for persons who have access to security restricted areas at airports but who are not required to hold an Aviation Security Identification Card, ASIC. That is how the crack is now being fixedâbelatedly. But here is a question the minister might answer: does this apply only to future applicants and, if so, what is to be done retrospectively? ASICs cannot be issued to a person who, amongst other things: has an adverse criminal record; would be considered by the secretary to `constitute a threat to aviation security' if he or she held an ASIC; or is an unlawful noncitizen. Such persons will include pilots and trainee pilots who do not have access to officially designated security restricted areas at airports. The rationale of the government is probably one of, `Oops, we forgot about them in the past and now we will fix it,' otherwise described as a `drafting oversight'. Madam Acting Deputy President Knowles, wouldn't you think that after the events of September 11, 2001 pilots and pilots-in-training would be the first place to start in any security checking regime? Yet the Howard government has missed them until nowâthree years after that event.</para><para>There is, though, a more important change which also has the signs of adhocery. For the first time CASA, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, will have a role in aviation security rather than just aviation safety. There is no explanation for this in the bill or the explanatory memorandum. However, it does seem logical for the appointed safety regulator to have an involvement in this role. But why is it only now that CASA is being given the opportunity to undertake this role? Other questions remain. What has been the relationship between CASA and the department of transport in formulating aviation security regulations? More to the point, when will that legislation actually come into operation? Why, after three years, do we have this patchwork of legislation and regulation, with different authorities with different powers? To the uninitiated, it is one big bureaucratic mess. To those used to observing the Howard government, it is business as usual.</para><para>The second part of the bill amends the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 to include contractors of Airservices Australia as aviation industry participants. It also amends the Aviation Transport Security (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Act 2004 to allow certain programs under the Air Navigation Act 1920 to continue as programs under the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004. We are advised that this will enable existing programs to be gradually transitioned to the new requirements under the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004. Otherwise, existing programs would terminate on the day the substantive provisions of the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 commence. That sounds to us like, `Oops, we forgot about continuity' or another drafting oversight.</para><para>In essence what we have here is another piece being sewn into the patchwork quilt of aviation security legislation. But almost three years down the track we are yet to see much of the legislation in effect. We are still awaiting the drafting of regulations under the Aviation Transport Security Act, and now we have empowerment for still more regulations to be created. Until we see that drafting done, it is impossible to say whether in fact we have a tougher security regime or, more importantly, a more effective aviation security regime at all. There is simply much not done. We have a maze of overlapping legislation and powers to regulate, with little guidance as to what is to be regulatedânot to mention the overall attitude of, `Trust us, we're the government.' Frankly, the opposition has the view that this is becoming a farce. Three years after September 11, 2001, we actually have very little in place and being given effect to at all. The jury is still out, and it is probably reasonable to expect that we will get more of this ad hoc legislation as more gaps open up and become apparent. When will it end, and when will we get in place a security regime that is clear, transparent and effective? </para><para>In debating this bill, it is also opportune to set out Labor's attitude to aviation security. Labor know that aviation security is a top priority for the travelling public in and around Australia. This extends not just to those travelling from major airports and on international flights, but also to regional travellers. From 1 January next year it will be a requirement for all checked baggage at all major airport terminals for international flights to be X-ray screened. This will apply to major domestic flights only by 2007. The Howard government has introduced only limited security measures for regional airports. Labor believe that the government should be investing more to improve security at all 146 regional airports. The government's measures to improve security at regional airports, we believe, do not go far enough. Many of these airports clearly remain vulnerable, including airports in major regional centres such as Albury, Burnie, Devonport, Lismore, Bundaberg and Gladstone. Every day flights leave these airports for major regional centres and capital cities, without passengers being screened. We say that is unacceptable. The public expectation is that aviation security in Australia is robust and strong. However, these expectations are not being met by the Howard government's approach to regional airport safety.</para><para>With these comments, the opposition's view is clear. We do support this legislation, but we are critical of the fact that it has been a long time coming. It has been poorly explained. We believe that the government's policy on regional airports, particularly on screening, safety and security, is simply inadequate. Deficiencies exist, particularly with respect to screening of passengers and baggage at some of the aforementioned regional airports. In closing, Labor support this legislation and the need for a safe and secure aviation industry.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>31</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="S432">Aviation Security Amendment Bill 2004</inline> introduces provisions to require pilots to undergo ASIO screenings every two years when renewing their licences. This is part of a raft of increased security measures in the area of aviation following the events of September 11, 2001 in the United States. Whilst the Democrats agree with the need to protect Australians, the travelling public and the public more broadly from potential terrorist attacks, we are concerned about the cost-shifting to pilots in this bill and the direction in which this government's antiterrorism legislation is going in terms of chipping away at our civil liberties and the presumption of innocence in the public at large.</para></talk.start><para>The Democrats agree that ASIO has a central role to play in gathering intelligence and identifying potential terrorist threats. This legislation proposes that pilots be subject to ASIO screening, as I said. It also proposes that CASA be allowed to impose fees, requiring pilots to bear the cost of those background checks. Pilots will be required to pay what is currently proposed to be $200 every two years. We say that, instead of pilots being charged, ASIO should be properly resourced to perform its function in protecting Australians from terrorism and that it is the responsibility of the government to ensure that ASIO is properly resourced. </para><para>This legislation does not just affect pilots flying the large commercial jets; it applies to thousands upon thousands of other pilots, ranging from hobby pilots flying gliders and ultralights to emergency service personnel and the Royal Flying Doctor Service. It will affect pastoralists and graziers in remote regions of the country, who often use aircraft to travel vast distances, and will affect the hundreds of pilots flying the so-called milk runs delivering mail and other goods in places such as Cape York Peninsula while clocking up hours in the hope of one day getting a job on a Dash 8 or a 737 for a major airline. Despite the high costs involved in acquiring a pilots licence, many of these pilots are not wealthy and would earn far less than one might expect.</para><para>I guess more important than the $200 is the fact that, while this legislation may go some way to identifying potential security threats which may or may not exist, it will not identify all of the security threats. If anything, these measures will focus on only the lesser of any potential risks posed by pilots of aircraft. It should be noted thatâand I draw the attention of the government in particular to thisâas was the case with the events of September 11 in the US, a person need only be skilled in flying an aircraft to hijack a plane and fly into the side of a building; that person does not necessarily need to be licensed. In fact, it was reported following the events of September 11 that the hijackers of planes involved in those attacks took lessons in flying aircraft only and were not interested in landing them. I do not know whether that media report was accurate, but it does demonstrate the point that a person does not necessarily need to go through the processes of being licensed. Similarly, a person may not necessarily need to have had flight training in Australia. It is entirely conceivable that a person obtained their licence or even pilot training without obtaining a licence in another country and travelled to Australia as either a pilot or a passenger in an aircraft, or by other means, before attempting to commit a terrorist act.</para><para>ASIO, as I am sure the government is aware, obviously cannot rely solely on this method of intelligence gathering to identify aviation security risks. It is important to note that these measures will play only a minor role in augmenting much broader intelligence gathering in this area. We feel that it is important that the government reviews and reports on the effectiveness of the provisions of this bill and that these provisions be reviewed after a period of time. We want to know how many suspected terrorists are identified through these searches; how many licences are revoked, suspended or denied to applicants; whether there were any appeals and how many of those were successful; and so on. I will therefore be moving amendments to insert a sunset clause so that the legislation can be reviewed in four years time and the parliament can at that time decide whether the provisions of the bill are justified.</para><para>The move to automatically screening every pilot as a matter of course raises some serious questions about the start of the slippery slope or the thin end of the wedgeâhowever you might like to describe itâwhen it comes to civil liberties. The parliament has passed over 20 security and antiterrorism laws in recent years, and the Labor Party has been far too eager in my view to embrace these without asking some of those serious questions. Already in the 40th parliament we have passed laws so that all employees working at airports undergo ASIO checks when applying for an ASIC, as they are called. Just this week parliament is to consider laws that will not only allow ASIO to conduct checks on those people who use dangerous substances, such as ammonium nitrate, but also enable the government to make regulations for checks to be conducted on people who use a thing prescribed by the government. Earlier this week the government, with the help of the Labor Party, passed laws allowing agencies to intercept SMS messages and emails without a warrant. The Democrats moved 33 very simple amendments which we believe were reasonable to protect basic civil liberties, but these were not even considered. One has to ask: where is the debate in this place from the opposition on these issues? </para><para>The government wants to blanket screen all pilots, and blind Freddy could see where this is going to lead us. Flight attendants are already covered by the provisions for all ASIC holders to be screened. Next, the government might be telling us that anybody in the country holding a truck licence will need to be screened because trucks can be used as lethal terrorist weapons. Why stop at trucks? Perhaps anybody holding a bus drivers licence could also be checked, as could doctors, chemists, biologists and other scientists who also might be able to produce biological or chemical weapons. Perhaps we should slap them with a $200 ASIO screening tax as well. Better still, why not slap any university student who applies for entry to a science degree with a $200 ASIO tax? At what point, I would ask, do we stop? These may be ludicrous suggestions or they may not be.</para><para>Will we at some point find ourselves with `Australia cards' and subject to automatic ASIO checks every two years? Will we all have to pay a $200 tax for the privilege of this? Is this the price that we pay for being citizens in this country or for being truck drivers, bus drivers, flight attendants or pilots? In the light of the potential damage, destruction and loss of life which can be caused by the use of an aircraft as a terrorist weapon, we are prepared to accept that on balance it is reasonable to ask pilots to undergo an ASIO check when applying for a licence. But we do not accept that pilots should have to contribute to meeting the cost of that. We will remain vigilant and, with the prospect of a government controlled Senate next year, we ask government senators to also remain vigilant and ensure that our civil liberties are not encroached upon by similar types of legislation into the future.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>33</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âin replyâI thank honourable senators for contributing to the second reading debate on the <inline ref="S432">Aviation Security Amendment Bill 2004</inline>. I welcome the support of both the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats. I will respond very briefly to a couple of points made by Senator Bishop. I guess it is in Labor's political interest to paint the government's security measures over the months and now years since the attack on the twin towers in the city of New York on September 11 as a patchwork. I guess that is a political point that they would seek to make. The reality, however, is that the Commonwealth government under the leadership of Prime Minister Howard and the National Security Committee of cabinet, and very skilled and dedicated people in the relevant portfolios, have worked to create an integrated and comprehensive response to a new threat to mankind and to civilisation.</para></talk.start><para>That has involved a range of measures across transport, defence and civil emergencies to ensure that Australia and our allies have in place integrated responses that will give the best level of security and protection to the Australian people in this new security environment. It is a new environment. It is a new paradigm. It is a new threat that the world faces. It is a threat that advanced pluralistic democracies like Australia have to face up to. We are, in fact, defending what so many Australians have died for in wars. We are, in fact, defending liberty. We are, in fact, defending a democracy which is under challenge from those who do not like democracies, who do not like a pluralistic society and who do not like freedom of religion or freedom of expression. This is, to be fair to Senator Allison, a very important debate to have on the balancing of civil liberties, which we all hold so dear, and the security of the nation and of individuals as a whole. The government treads very carefully to balance that. In the measures before the Senate today there are a number of protections. For example, pilots or trainee pilots who feel that their rights are being infringed can go to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal if they think they have been unfairly dealt with. </para><para>Senator Bishop made a point about the progress of our aviation security measures. We do notâas others did, for what were clearly partisan almost pork-barrelling reasonsâgo around to key marginal seats saying, `We'll upgrade security at this particular regional airport.' Mr Latham, in his failed attempts to stir up some politics on this issue, went to a few marginal seats in the lead-up to the federal election and said, `We need to improve regional security so we'll improve screening at this airport.' Those airports generally correlated with key marginal seats that Labor were targetingâunsuccessfully, of courseâin the election. Senator Bishop named a few of the towns that he thought should have upgraded security. It was sort of a marginal seats strategy, not a security strategy.</para><para>Our strategy was to have our decisions about regional airport securityâand, in fact, the security measures that are before us in this billâdriven by a process involving sensible experts who could guide the government in terms of risk assessments. So we conducted a review of these risks in July 2003 and in December 2003, guided by the risk assessment process conducted by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, we announced an expansion of the nation's aviation security regime. In the process of implementing some of these measures we found there were some legislative barriers to action, relating to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority in particular.</para><para>We want to ensure that we have our pilots, trainee pilots and other people involved in the aviation sector checked by ASIO and given a security clearance so that we minimise the risk of people with ill will or ill intent getting into the sky in aeroplanes. Prior to September 11, it was a relatively benign activity. You and I, Madam Acting Deputy President Knowles, have spent a lot of our time in the general aviation sector and we know that probably all of the people in that sector in Australia perform a wonderful service for this country, particularly across the remote parts of the country, and that they pose absolutely no risk. But, since September 11, we now know that an aeroplane of virtually any size can be turned into an enhanced weapon. That is what we are addressingâit is a serious concern and it is a serious issue. We need to face up to it.</para><para>I think we are not helped by the Australian Democrats condemning either the government or the Australian Labor Party for passing measures that seek to enhance the security of Australia. The Labor Party have made it clear that they will support this bill. They have given us support on a number of occasions for pieces of legislation. I think gratuitous attacks on either the government or the Labor Party, saying that in some way we are trampling people's civil rights in these measures, are wrong. Senator Allison asked at what point would we stop. We will diligently assess the risks to Australian citizens in Australia and around the world using the best expert advice and intelligence that we can possibly muster. When that expert advice guides us to legislative actions that can improve the security of Australiansâand, therefore, ultimately improve their libertyâthen we will bring them to this parliament and argue for them. We will not stop, to answer Senator Allison's question, until the war on terrorism is won and until the security situation is safe again. I do not think anybody knows when that will be. </para><para>These are ludicrous suggestionsâto use Senator Allison's own wordsâabout measures for bus drivers and other people. There may well be a case at some stage for bringing new measures in, but we will be driven by expert advice from intelligence organisations and other experts. Senator Allison has criticised obliquely measures to improve the security around people who work in secure areas at airports. I think all Australians who are travelling would like to know that the people who move around secure parts of our airports have had security clearances. I think all Australians would feel that their civil liberties are improved by those sorts of measures. These measures mean that as you go through authorised areas to move in and out of airports you would know that to get through them you need to have had a security clearance. That is a measure that was obliquely criticised by the Democrats.</para><para>I want to address the measures that are being introduced in relation to the transportation and storage of ammonium nitrateâthe material of choice for blowing up Marriott Hotels and other places around the world. I think most Australians would like to know that we have in place a rigorous set of measures to ensure that this substanceâwhich is generally used for the fantastic purpose of improving plant production but can be abused and can, in the wrong hands, be used to destroy human lifeâis correctly used. I think most Australians would agree that that is a worthwhile and sensible thing for the governments of Australia to get together and work on, in consultation with the agricultural industry and the suppliers of ammonium nitrate.</para><para>Equally, these are measures to provide our security services with interception powers to ensure that they can try to get intelligence to try to pre-empt a terrorist attack. They are about using the best modern equipment to intercept telecommunications to ensure that our intelligence, security and police organisations can hopefully prevent an attack. I do not regard these measures as anything other than measures that ultimately improve the liberties of our civilians. I commend the bill to the Senate and wish it a speedy passage.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>35</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Billâby leaveâtaken as a whole.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>35</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI move Democrat amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 4434 together.</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Page 2 (after line 11), after clause 3, add:</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">4 Cessation of operation of Act</inline></para><quote><para>		This Act ceases to operate at the expiration of four years after its commencement.</para><para>(2)	Schedule 1, item 4, page 5 (lines 21 to 23), omit paragraph 74H(1)(j).</para></quote><para>In doing this, I acknowledge that there is no support in the chamber for these amendments.

We have alerted the government to this, which we see as a very real security issue. Please, Minister, do not suggest that the Democrats have been opposed to that move. What I did question was the fact that, as I understand itâI did not have the passage of this legislationâthe government can determine any substance at all to be in this category. That appears to me to be an opportunity, at least, for misuse of government powers.</para></talk.start><para>But getting back to the amendments, as I said in my speech in the second reading debate we would like to introduce a sunset clause into this legislation. We think there is a good argument for a review of how necessary and how successful this has been so that the parliament can be informed about those measures that I have mentioned. Our second amendment would remove the requirement by CASA to collect fees from pilots. As I said, I think this is a cost-shifting exercise. It is a bit like the Senate being required to pay for the extra security in this place. Why are we asking pilots to pay for security? It should be a matter for ASIO. If it is important enough to be done then it should be something which the government covers through ASIO funding. I am disappointed that there is no support for these amendments.

The amendments relate to self-funded retirees, older Australians and carers on income support, grandparents caring for children and certain disability pensioners.</para><para>The Bill contains five major measures.</para><para>Firstly, the Bill establishes a new payment, to be known as the seniors concession allowance, which will provide all holders of the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card with a payment of $200 per year.</para><para>This payment recognises that most self-funded retirees do not receive concessions for energy, rates, water and sewerage, and motor vehicle registration from state and territory governments. It also recognises the contribution that this group has made in providing for their own retirement.</para><para>The payment will be made in two instalments, in December and June each year, to people who are eligible cardholders on 1 December and 1 June respectively. It will be indexed twice yearly, exempt from taxation and payable if the cardholder is temporarily absent from Australia for up to 13 weeks.</para><para>Transitional arrangements will be in place for the first payment of seniors concession allowance. Anyone who is eligible for a Commonwealth Seniors Health Card in December 2004 will qualify for the December 2004 payment.</para><para>Secondly, the Bill establishes a further new payment, to be known as the utilities allowance, which is payable to senior Australians of age pension age (or veteran pension age) who are in receipt of income support. The payment will help this group to pay regular household bills such as gas and electricity.</para><para>In general, the payment is $100 per year for singles and $50 per year for each member of a couple. It will be paid twice each year, following the pension indexation adjustments on 20 March and 20 September. After the first payment, it will be indexed twice yearly. It will be exempt from taxation and will be payable if the recipient is temporarily absent from Australia for up to 13 weeks.</para><para>The taxation status and temporary absence rules for both payments are consistent with the treatment of a number of income support ancillary payments, and the standard compliance and debt recovery provisions will apply to the new payments.</para><para>The utilities allowance and seniors concession allowance will benefit over two million older Australians who have contributed, and continue to contribute, to Australia.</para><para>Thirdly, this Bill will provide additional support for people providing care to an adult or a child with a disabilityâa group of people who perform a vital role in our community. This will be done by increasing the number of hours that carers can spend in work, training or study, from 20 to 25 hours per week, without losing qualification for carer payment. This will provide greater flexibility and more opportunities for carers to participate in the workforce, and for them to have more of a break from caring, without affecting their carer payment eligibility. </para><para>In recognition of the special needs of grandparents with the primary care of their grandchildren, this Government waived, from 1 November 2004, the work, training and study test for access to child care benefit. This gives eligible grandparents access to child care benefit for up to 50 hours of approved child care a week.</para><para>This Bill will now make child care more affordable for grandparent carers who are receiving income support, such as age pension or carer payment, by enabling them to have access to a special rate of child care benefit. The special rate, provided for in this Bill, will cover the full cost of child care fees charged to eligible grandparents by approved child care services.</para><para>Finally, the bill will provide for increased bereavement payments under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, in respect of disability pensioners who were receiving above general rate disability pension. Previously, the bereavement payment had been limited to 100 per cent of the general rate.</para></quote></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>38</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on the <inline ref="R2195">Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2004 Election Commitments) Bill 2004</inline>. At the outset I indicate that Labor will be supporting the passage of this bill. However, as with much of the government's legislation, we will support it not because the policy initiatives are strong or represent the best approach to dealing with the issues that we face as a nation, but because it lessens some of the hardships created by the poor policy choices this government has made over the last eight years. Many people across Australia are suffering because of this government and we have no intention of standing in the way of any relief they can get. Disappointingly when we look at them as a whole, these policies make no attempt to address the underlying structural problems in our social welfare system. The debt crisis brought about by this government remains unresolved and at least 1.4 million families are facing debts averaging around $800.</para></talk.start><para>This bill is a loose collection of quick fixes, a bandaid approach to social welfare, which demonstrates this government's failure of will, ability and interest in this portfolio area. Real welfare reform is about making the social security system simpler and more accessible for the six million Australians who access income support payments each year. Good policyâLabor policyâwould create a simpler, more efficient system that ensures that Australians who need income support can get it, and get it when they need it. In contrast, the government continues to make the system more complex, with a new one-off payment every time a problem arises, each with a slightly different eligibility test and each with a different indexation arrangement.</para><para>In addition to the government's failure to address the structural problems in our social security system, this bill highlights its willingness to create two classes of welfare recipient, just as in other areas where its policies create a two-tiered system for consumers in health, education and telecommunications. So I will take the opportunity to point out some of the failings of this bill and show how these are symptomatic of the government's continued mishandling of our social security system. Look at the glaring mistakes and inconsistencies in the government's funding of this bill. Even the government's own bean counters in the Department of Finance and Administration and in Treasury concluded that the savings intended to fund these initiatives were overestimated by $130 million. So from a government that claims to be economically responsible we now have a $130 million funding black hole. Worse still, the government has not introduced the legislation that is required to implement the changes needed to fund the other $700 million worth of savings to pay for the measures outlined in this bill. </para><para>The bill itself seeks to implement a range of new payments and benefits for senior Australians, all of which were promised by the government during the election campaign. As the minister has indicated, the amendments to legislation outlined in the bill are to: create a utilities supplement for senior Australians of age pension or veteran pension age who currently receive income support; establish a new seniors concession allowance for self-funded retirees who hold the Commonwealth seniors health card; change the eligibility requirements for carer payment by increasing the number of hours that carers may spend in work, training or study without losing qualification for carer payment; create a new special rate of child-care benefit for grandparents with primary care of their grandchildren; and extend bereavement payments to widows of totally and permanently incapacitated veterans and ex-servicemen.</para><para>I will speak about each of these initiatives in turn. Schedule 1 of the bill creates a new utilities supplement for senior Australians by amending a range of Commonwealth legislation, including the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and the Social Security Act 1991. The new payment is intended to assist senior Australians to pay for regular household bills, such as those for gas, electricity and water. Currently, senior Australians on income support are entitled to receive one of a number of concession cards that provide access to cheaper prescriptions and a range of other benefits. The bill provides that all Australians of age pension or veteran pension age who receive income support will be eligible for the new payment. The utilities supplement is $100 a year for singles and $50 for each member of a couple, and it will be subject to consumer price index indexation. The payment will be paid in two instalments each year, on 20 March and 20 September, starting in March next year. The government claims that the new benefit will be paid to 2.2 million senior Australians each year, at a cost of $606.4 million over four years. </para><para>While Labor supports this initiative, which will provide greater financial assistance to pensioners of age pension age, an obvious by-product of this measure will be to create two classes of pensionersâthose that receive the utilities supplement and those that do not. The government said in its election policy announcing the utilities supplement that it `recognises that some older Australians who rely on income support can experience difficulty in saving up to pay regular household bills such as the gas or electricity bill'. That is certainly true. I am sure that is particularly true in Canberra in winter. But what the government fails to acknowledge is that it is not just older Australians on income support payments that have difficulty in saving to pay regular household bills. There are many thousands of needy Australians struggling on pensions who are not of age pension age and so will not receive any assistance through the utilities supplement. </para><para>The utilities supplement does nothing to help those Australians receiving carer, widow, disability or sole parent pensions who are not of age pension age. For example, a carer aged 60 caring for a partner of a similar age with severe disabilities will be treated as being less deserving of financial support than an age pensioner couple in a similar situation who are just a few years older. Perhaps the government believes that pensioners who are not of age pension age are less deserving than those who are. But, as I have already indicated, Labor does not intend to prevent eligible pensioners from benefiting from this legislation. </para><para>Schedule 2 of the bill establishes a new seniors concession allowance of $200 per annum for self-funded retirees who are eligible for the Commonwealth seniors health card. It does so by amending a range of Commonwealth legislation, including the Income Tax Assessment Act and the Social Security Act. The new payment recognises that many self-funded retirees do not generally receive energy, rates, water and motor vehicle registration concessions in the same way as some other senior Australians do. It also acknowledges the contribution made by self-funded retirees in providing for their own retirement.</para><para>The bill limits the new cash payment to holders of the Commonwealth seniors health card. Under the existing means test arrangements for this card, the new payment will be available to retirees with adjusted taxable income of less than $50,000 per annum for single people and $80,000 per annum combined for couples. The government proposes to make the payment on 1 December and 1 June each year, starting with a $200 payment on 1 December 2004. As with the utilities supplement, the cash payment to self-funded retirees will also be subject to CPI indexation. The government estimates that 287,000 self-funded retirees will receive the new payment, at a total cost of $255.2 million over four years. However, the $200 payment sells self-funded retirees short. The payment is just another bandaid measure to compensate self-funded retirees for the government's failure to live up to its promises. At the 2001 election, the government promised that it would:</para><quote><para>... work with State and Territory governments to extend more of the State and Territory concessions that Age Pensioners now get to [Commonwealth Seniors Health Card] holders.</para></quote><para>Unfortunately for self-funded retirees, the government has failed to deliver those benefits. Now the government is providing a $200 payment as compensation for that failureâa fraction of the value of the full concession benefits that were promised in 2001. It is also unclear whether the government intends for both members of a self-funded retiree couple to be eligible for this new paymentâa question about which I will ask the minister in the committee stage. The bill does not appear to preclude this outcome as long as both members of the couple are eligible for the Commonwealth seniors health card. This is clearly inconsistent with the government's treatment of the utilities allowance, which is available at a couples and at a single rate. The utilities allowance cannot simply be claimed twice by both members of a couple. It is also inconsistent with the age pension, which is available at a couples rate and a single rate. Couples do not simply get double the single rate of age pension. So in the same bill we have completely different policy approaches on displayâanother classic demonstration of how this government makes policy on the run.</para><para>Schedule 3 of the bill amends section 198C of the Social Security Act to change the eligibility requirements for carer payment by increasing the number of hours that carers may spend in work, training or study without losing qualification for carer payment. Currently, people caring for an adult or a child with a disability and who receive carer payment may temporarily cease providing care in order to undertake training, education, unpaid voluntary work or paid employment. However, the maximum length of time that a carer may temporarily cease providing care in order to undertake any of these activities and still retain their carer payment is 20 hours per week. The bill increases that threshold from 20 to 25 hours per week. The government claims that this measure will increase flexibility for carers by allowing them to increase their labour force participation, thereby reducing their potential for long-term welfare dependency. The government estimates that the change will cost $18.5 million over four years. </para><para>On the face of it, this seems like a good initiative. It appears to give carers greater flexibility to participate in the work force, increase their income and consequently improve their standard of living. But, while the government is increasing the number of hours that carers can work, what it has not told them is that it is not changing the income test for carer payment. So for every dollar earned from paid work, carers will lose 40c of their carer payment. If a carer on the minimum wage of $12.30 an hour works an extra five hours a week for $61.50 in income, they will lose $24.30 of their carer paymentâ40 per cent of the financial benefit that comes from the paid work. Combined with the increase in personal income tax they must pay, carers in this situation are confronted with a very high effective marginal tax rate in the order of 57 per cent. This is a major disincentive for them to seek the additional paid work that the government says will occur as a result of this bill. As always with the government, it seems to give with one hand but take with the other.</para><para>Schedule 4 of the bill amends the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999 and the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999. It does so to improve child-care assistance for grandparents in receipt of income support who have primary care responsibilities for their grandchildren. The changes mean grandparents who have primary care of their grandchildren and who are receiving income support will be entitled to a special rate of child-care benefit. This special rate will cover the full cost of child-care fees charged to eligible grandparents by approved child-care services. The government estimates that the change will cost $78.5 million over four years and proposes that it commence on 1 January 2005.</para><para>Labor supports the measures relating to grandparents as far as they go, but we note that, first, the assistance is limited to grandparents who are lucky enough to find a child-care placeâthat is, a place in an approved long day care centre or family day careâand, second, many of the 27,000 Australian grandparents with dependent grandchildren will gain nothing from the changes in this bill. For example, many grandparents, particularly those who live in rural or regional Australia, are confronted with the same reality that hits many parentsâthere are just not enough child-care places in approved child-care centres. These grandparents will get no benefit at all from these measures.</para><para>In addition, many grandparents use registered care for the simple reason that such carers are more conveniently located or because their grandchildren have a strong relationship with the carer. In contrast, I note that in our election policy Labor undertook to give extra financial help to all grandparents who provide primary care to their grandchildren, whether they used child-care services or not and whatever the type. Grandparent carers need this sort of universal assistance, in recognition of the personal sacrifice that they make by helping raise their grandchildren. The bill falls short by failing to provide that universal assistance.</para><para>Also of great concern is the fact that the government's election costings for this initiative were just plain wrong. The bill contains the official estimate of $78.5 million over four years for the special rate of child-care benefit. This compares with the government's election estimate of $70 million. That was about $8.5 million off the mark. So much for the claims of sound economic management. </para><para>Schedule 5 of the bill honours an election commitment to extend bereavement payments to widows of TPI veterans and ex-servicemen. The current provisions for bereavement payments of disability compensation under the Veterans' Entitlements Act are that six fortnightly payments are made to surviving partners, but only up to the 100 per cent level of the general rate. The bill will extend these payments to include all payments in excess of the general rate. This will benefit surviving partners of all 45,000 people in this category, including 28,500 TPIs and 15,000 extremely disabled. The cost is estimated at $14.8 million over four years. Under the bill, the new arrangements will apply from 1 January 2005.</para><para>Debate interrupted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title><type>Matters of Public Interest</type><page.no>42</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Kirk, Linda  (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Kirk)</inline>âOrder!

Last week we saw the Howard government exposed for years of failure to seriously tackle welfare reform and years of failure to support welfare recipients with better work opportunities. We saw the real intent behind their initiatives exposed through their threat of coercion. We saw their real agenda: cutting costs. We saw the complaint about the rising cost of the DSP and we could see that the driver of government welfare policy is in fact the Treasurer. Most Australians would have preferred to see a focus on creating opportunity and on partnership.</para></talk.start><para>Last week the government released the interim evaluation report on a pilot program established to investigate the interest of disability support pensioners in seeking employment and their success in gaining employment. The release of the report confirmed the government's failure and revealed the government's intent. The pilot program was a positive initiative and, arguably, well overdue. We welcomed its inception in January and sounded notes of caution about the implications of the program results at the time. The concern we raised at the time essentially was over the lack of support provided by this government to disability support pensioners who would like to work. An obvious example is the oversubscribed programs administered through the Department of Family and Community Services. Specialist disability open employment services have caps on the number of people they can assist and there are waiting lists of people wanting support to work. Perhaps the government should consider supporting those who are providing the support as a first step. Nevertheless, the pilot program was a positive initiative and it was no great surprise to most observers to see that many people want to work. </para><para>The government announced that people want to work with great surprise and fanfare, as if they had made some amazing discovery and as if it is somehow unbelievable. The government find it unbelievable that people who are on the DSP may be on it for a very good reason and that, nevertheless, they may still want to work whenever and however possible. Instead, the government sees the DSP as the haven for people who feign bad backs. Their instinctive response when they see a disability support pensioner who is not working is to threaten coercion.</para><para>The response by the Minister for Workforce Participation to the interim evaluation report simply made no sense. In one breath he said that the report showed that people want to work. However, in the next breath he said that it showed people needed to be coerced to work. Unless he and I were reading different reports, it showed nothing of the sort. There was no evidence in the report to suggest that coercion was suitable or necessary, and there was a simple reason for this: participation in the pilot program was voluntary. It is logically and practically impossible for a pilot scheme where participation is voluntary to show that coercion will produce better results. That leaves one possible conclusion for the claimed need for coercion: this government is gearing up for a punitive and unfair policy driven by the coercion of disability support pensioners. The government is gearing up for yet another crude plan to cut people off DSP benefits by simply changing the eligibility test just as it has attempted to do twice before. </para><para>The other telling sign is that in his first major interview on the topic the minister emphasised the costs involved in maintaining the DSP. There is no doubt that the cost is increasing. However, the response cannot be to simply shift people from the DSP onto unemployment benefits. As we know, the government are refusing to release details of their plans, which I might say is hardly in the spirit of genuine reform. But they have form. Twice in the last parliament they proposed legislation to amend the definition of work capacity from 30 hours a week at award wages or above to 15 hours. This would have had the effect of cutting around 200,000 Australians off the DSP. Currently, the test is whether a person is capable of working 30 hours a week inside a period of two years and follows a medical determination that the person has a disability.</para><para>On its second attempt the government attempted to broaden the appeal of the legislation by inserting a grandfather clause so that the change would take effect only for new applicants for the pension. On both occasions Labor rejected the legislation. My message to the government is this: if you want to continue with the same unreasonable approach to disability support you will get the same response from Labor. We will continue to say no to unreasonable and unfair attacks on disability support pensioners. If, however, the government is not just focused on improving the budget bottom lineâand this is contrary to every indication so farâand if the government is prepared to look at ways in which we can genuinely support people on welfare moving into work, including those on the DSP who have the capacity to work, my door is always open.</para><para>There is some obligation here for government. We have to encourage an employment environment that fosters the employment of people with a disability. We have to recognise that many disabled people will not be able to make the transition to work and, for those that can, support will be required. We have to recognise that government is not doing all it can to improve incentives and to break down the substantial barriers. Welfare reform must be mutual and must be based on partnership. If the government is genuine we are prepared to talk. But we will not engage in coercion and cost cutting at the expense of some of our most vulnerable Australians.</para><para>I would like to look now at some of the results of the report. The spin from the minister was that disability support pensioners have so far been unaware of the vast array of services open to them if they want to return to work. In his press release of 24 November the minister said:</para><quote><para>The pilot also found that unnecessary concern about the consequences of undertaking paid work on access to benefits and concessions was a factor in a decision not to pursue employment. An immediate priority is to ensure that more people on DSP are informed about the option to give work a try and not be worse off, and of the assistance available under the Job Network.</para></quote><para>It seems to me that comment displayed some uncharacteristic understatement from the minister. What the report really shows is the consistent failure by this government's employment programs to provide appropriate services and appropriate referrals to services.  </para><para>Let us have a look at what the report actually said. You need go no further than page 1 to read this key finding: </para><quote><para>The majority of participants (62%) had already indicated a willingness to work by actively registering as looking for work but most did not have a current referral to Job Network services before their commencement or were receiving Job Search Support Only services. </para></quote><para>What that means is that well over half the participants had already said they wanted to work, but they were not referred to the right place. There is a big difference between the minister's spin and the reality. Another omission from the minister's pronouncements was this critical finding: </para><para>	Referral information was often out-of-date and difficult to update.</para><quote><para>This impeded the efficiency of referrals between providers, and inhibited job seeker access to services. Systems requirements and Pilot policy were not well understood by providers, and attempts to communicate it via the Pilot website, emails and regular teleconferences were not successful. Some of these issues may have affected commencements as a few job seekers appear to have lost motivation after prolonged delays in the commencement process.</para></quote><para>	...	...	...</para><quote><para>The evaluation has gathered evidence of significant disincentives and widespread ignorance inhibiting DSP recipients' take-up of work opportunities. </para></quote><para>These are fairly damning criticisms. It is clear that the government also has work to do at Centrelink. Some examples of Centrelink experiences cited by DSP recipients included asking Centrelink questions about work or study options but being told they were not required to do anything and feeling discouraged from asking further, and a lack of information from Centrelink about available employment assistance unless it was specifically requested. Perhaps the minister should check that the system actually works before making threats to disability support pensioners. </para><para>We know that currently less than 10 per cent of DSP recipients report any earnings and currently less than two per cent are participating in Job Network. The minister hears that and says, `Clearly, we need to coerce them.' But there are significant barriers to participation for Australians with a disability. Not least among these is the fear of loss of benefits on finding work and the implications to benefits if work is lost. For exampleâand I quote from page 10 of the report: </para><quote><para>DSP recipients reported ...:</para></quote><para>	difficulties in ... establishing eligibility for DSP due to stricter eligibility requirements and a lengthy claims process ... Many stated they would be more likely to take on work if they had a `safety net' which allowed them to return to the pension if needed.</para><para>This concern is significant, given that retaining work is often harder for DSP recipients, particularly those with mental health problems. Currently, if you lose your job because of your disability, you will be guaranteed return to the DSP. But how many employers would state that as the reason, and is it desirable to have that reason recorded on your employment record, anyway? DSP recipients also reported:</para><para>	previous negative experience with employers and perceptions of discrimination by employers, which discourages DSP recipients from testing their work capacity.</para><para>I ask: are these people the ones the minister refers to as not being on the DSP legitimately? Are these the people who need to be coerced? The minister, like so many of his colleagues, implies that people on income support are undeserving. Some people, they say, are abusing the system with pretend problems. The minister in that case should ensure that there is no abuse of the system. That is what the government should do. The solution is not to make everybody who needs the pension pay for those who may not have needed the pension in the first place. Compliance is not the primary reason for welfare reform. Not being assured of compliance is not the reason to move people from welfare to work. There are far better reasons than that.  </para><para>Labor are very serious about welfare reform. We strongly believe in providing the means and the incentive to help Australians contribute to and improve our productivity and their personal circumstances. Labor have led the way in welfare reform, focusing on partnership and on mutual obligation. Australians who are not working but who have the potential to work need support to help realise their potential. A statement from the report which should be taken very seriously by the government is this: </para><quote><para>DSP recipients were obviously attracted by the Intensive Support Services being offered through the pilot.</para></quote><para>And, as the report went on to say:</para><para>	Pilot participants reported improved prospects of finding work, a greater incidence of case management and higher levels of satisfaction than for DSP job seekers in Job Network services generally. They reported receiving more intensive servicing, and felt the services were more likely to be appropriate for their disability and service needs. </para><para>The minister should stop pretending that this report endorses the erosion of support for Australians with a disability and realise that what it does show is that many people with a disability want to work, and a bit more help from their government would be welcome. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Davidson, Ms Gay</title><page.no>45</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>45</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator FERRIS</name><name.id>5L6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âToday I want to pay tribute to a woman who was well known to many of us in this house and who was a trailblazer for women in the profession of journalism.

Let's start with `tenacity'. How many young girls drove themselves to school in the 1950s in a pre-war Singer sports car wearing their father's World War II RAF flying jacket and refused to accept that uniforms were compulsory? Gay's entry into journalism as one of the first women reporters on a New Zealand newspaper came at a time when girls covered mainly women's or social issues. Now, that's tenacity. Gay told me recently that she regarded newspaper reporting as a bit of a game. She recalled how she had lurked one frosty winter night outside a local trade union headquarters listening through a ventilation grille to a highly secret meeting of the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants, who were determined to manipulate the vote to get a strike that they wanted. Gay wrote the story and split the New Zealand Trades Council as they searched for the rat who had leaked to `that girl reporter'. Now, that's tenacity. </para><para>But her capacity to achieve, to organise, to mentor, to befriend and to counsel even the most challenging friend earned her early respect from those in Canberra fortunate enough to be invited to her bountiful dining table in Hobart Avenue. Senior bureaucrats, academics, politicians, layabouts, strays adopted by her and her husband Ken and on occasions pure ring-ins were all made welcome and often left at lunch there wondering as darkness was falling where on earth the afternoon had disappeared to, lost as it was in a swirl of fascinating conversation that had captured all of us.</para><para>Gay's years as a senior and highly respected journalist in Canberra gave her a unique insight into the workings of the bureaucracy, academia and, importantly, government. She became a respected health and social welfare policy commentator and later served on a number of boards and committees in the ACT. Her generosity was boundless and, as a regular boarder at her Hobart Avenue home, I can attest to the number and variety of people I would find there when I returned from a late night parliamentary sitting. Apart from those who had stayed on from lunch, there were teenagers with parental conflicts, women escaping from troublesome relationships, men ejected by exasperated wives and loversâall of them finding solace, a comforting meal and a warm bed in the generous hospitality of Gay's home. That spirit of generosity lives on today in her daughter Tui, who has so patiently and compassionately supported her mother in these last difficult years.</para><para>Many people will remember Gay Davidson as the tireless campaigner for a compulsory measles vaccine after the tragic death at the age of 12 of her second daughter, Kiri, from complications arising from what appeared to have been a simple childhood illness. More recently, Gay has struggled with a difficult illness herself, borne with great dignity and the courage that was characteristic throughout her life. Dozens of Canberra friends gathered to say goodbye to Gay and to celebrate her life at the Canberra Press Club where, ever the trailblazer, she had also served as the first female president. Her many friends mourn her passing.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Recherche Bay</title><page.no>46</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>46</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to talk to the Senate about Recherche Bay in far south Tasmaniaâit is about as far south as you can drive; in fact, Cockle Creek, which is as far as you can drive, is on the southern edge of Double Bayâwhich is named after one of the two French scientific expedition ships. The expedition commanded by D'Entrecasteaux set out from France in 1791 and arrived in Tasmania in January 1792. The ship stayed for five weeks, and they gathered many botanical specimens, including the blue gum, which is now the floral symbol of Tasmania. They were aware that Aboriginal people had been in the area but they did not meet any. However, they made extensive exploratory forays in various directions from Recherche Bay, including quite a remarkable overland trek to a peak to the south of Mount La Perouse, then to the south coast and back to Recherche Bay.</para></talk.start><para>The ship circumnavigated the continent of Australia and went back to Esperance in Western Australia, named after the other ship, in early 1793. They had such great recollections of Recherche Bay in Tasmania and were in need of repairs and fresh water, so they set sail across the Great Australian Bight back to Recherche Bay and stayed for a few more weeks. This time they met the Aboriginal people, the Palawa. The first meeting came after four of the officers walked overland from Recherche Bay and camped overnight at a creek entering what is now Southport Lagoon. In the morning they woke up and decided they would walk along the southern part of Southport Lagoon to the entrance which they had visited the year before. On this walk they heard human voices and found the Aboriginal people fishing in Southport Lagoon. They put down their muskets and, to cut a long story short, there were a couple of hours of intriguing communication between the French and the Palawa, neither understanding each other's language but a lot of understanding, enjoyment and exploration of each other's similarities and differences during those couple of hours. </para><para>When the French decided to go back to the ship a couple of warriors went with them and, much to the amazement of the French, when they got back to the camp site where they had slept the night before, the warriors pointed out where each of them had been sleeping. This brought home to the French that this was Palawa country and the Palawa knew what was going on and it was not the other way around.</para><para>The French had put in a garden in 1792. When they went back in 1793 they found the remnants of the plants in the woods and were again amazed that one of the warriors came and pointed out which were their plantsâthat is, the Palawa plants, the indigenous plantsâand which were the French imported plants put in the garden the year before. Quite remarkably the remains of that garden, the wall, were discovered last year by two Tasmanians, Helen Gee and Bob Graham. The remains of the observatory that the French set up onshore at Recherche Bay in 1792 were also discovered. This was a very important breakthrough in navigation, which was to have a big impact on global navigation in the following century. The observatory was set up after the French had failed to set up their scientific equipment rapidly enough to witness the transit of Venus across the sun, which brought heartbreak to the astronomer on board the ship.</para><para>The thing about Recherche Bay and the north-east peninsula, where the French walked so frequently and saw Tasmanian tigers and a whole range of other marsupials, is that it is effectively intact but is under great and imminent threat from logging. There is an imminent proposal to complete a road across the Southport Lagoon conservation area which was started over a year ago to allow logging of the very forests from which the French entered and collected their specimens and on the edge of which is the remnant garden and observatory.</para><para>One-hundred and forty hectares of this peninsula is in private hands, owned by the two Vernon brothers. Unfortunately, the Tasmanian government has not secured an arrangement with the Vernon brothers to buy this private land to ensure that it is kept because of its extraordinary global importance as a meeting place between the scientists of the European enlightenment and the extraordinary knowledge of the Palawa people in Tasmania, the Indigenous people. Last Friday, with Cate Weate and Margaret Blakers from my office, I walked across the peninsula, in the vicinity of where the road will be completed if allowed to go ahead, and also in the vicinity of what is one of Australia's rarest plants, the Tasmanian swamp eyebright, listed by the federal authority, internationally and by the Tasmanian heritage unit as critically endangered. I was astonished to find that this plant, which is down to 40 mature species in one area of about a quarter of a hectare, has a four-wheel drive track going straight through the middle of its habitat. There is a fence being built against the remnant plantsâgoodness knows how many were destroyed by this four-wheel drive trackâwith some star pickets, and that is it. This is a failure at state and federal level of the authorities to protect a magnificent flower, arguably one of the rarest plants on the face of the planet, by neglect.  </para><para>What is more, off-road vehicles crossing the peninsula have created massive environmental damage. Besides the introduction of the root rot fungus <inline font-style="italic">Phytophthera cinnamomi</inline>, in places the squalid broadening of the tracks by off-road vehicles trying to get through swamp areas is as wide as 80 metres. There is debriding of all the native vegetation, there is soiling of the streams and there are enormous ruts built through the very country through which the French walked to meet the Indigenous people in 1793. This is a matter of state government neglect and failure to properly equip Parks and Wildlife to prevent that destruction. There is in place a draft management plan which would prohibit four-wheel drive vehicles south of Southport Lagoon and therefore in the region of this rare plant, but it has not been brought into being.</para><para>This whole region is extraordinarily beautiful. East of Recherche Bay is Black Swan Lagoon on the other side of the peninsulaâI counted 162 black swans on this lagoon on Fridayâand then a long white beach, along which the French walked in 1793 and met a group of 40 Palawa people coming south. The French carved a tree, by the way, just off the beach which disturbed the Indigenous people greatly as introducing a bad spirit to their forest. Thirty years later, one of the local warriors told a European that the Indigenous people destroyed that tree after the scientific expedition had left. What we have here is an intact historic landscape, as it was when the French arrived, except for some past selective logging and these four-wheel drive impacts that we see today. We have the opportunity here in this nation, in the interest of international human history, culture and remarkable ecological intactness, to prevent the loss of that landscape and to preserve its integrity by preventing the logging and the procedure of that road.</para><para>I noted yesterday in question time that there is no forest practices plan covering the completion of the road. Whether or not the minister has been able to establish that, there is an enormously wonderful opportunity here for the new Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell, and for Prime Minister Howard to rescue this area by paying fair compensation to the owners of the private land out of, if necessary, the $50 million or so that the Prime Minister has said will be allocated to Tasmania as part of the compensation package, or from other Commonwealth moneys, to ensure the integrity of this area for the nation's benefit into the future. But it needs urgent and clear-headed action. It is a really great opportunity for this government to show that it understands the nation's history, that it celebrates it, that it understands the ecological value of remnant places which are as intact and as beautiful as Recherce Bay and that it is prepared to put aside the minimal amount that would rescue the area and then manage it so that it can be presented for Australians to go and see. With signage and proper presentation, it would be one of the most fascinating places for all of our citizens now and in the future to visit and to see the country just as the French saw it and, more particularly, just as the Palawa people lived in it. It is an incredibly wonderful opportunity. When I was there on Friday, there was Mount La Perouse to the west, as described by the French, still with snow on it. They noted that snow was there in January and February, in those days before global warming.</para><para>I appeal to the government to seize this opportunity for a remarkably good outcome at Recherche Bay. I understand that the French Ambassador is in the state at the moment and is going to Recherche Bay. Negative international attention will come to Tasmania and to Australia if the logging and this obscene road, with its two-metre deep ditch and up to four-metre pile of what was the native cover piled to the side, resumes. That has been proceeding through the Southport Lagoon conservation area. It has been stopped, but it certainly needs to be seen that it is not resumed and in fact that reparation is made there. </para><para>Mr Howard committed himself during the election campaign to releasing the defined details of the maps of the 170,000 hectares of old-growth forest to be protected by the government today. It is a promise that has not been kept. It is the first breach of promise from the election campaign. We have to accept that there are good reasons behind that breach of promise, and if they include the rescue of the north-east peninsula, the Southport Lagoon conservation area, Recherche Bay and its potential to become part of the glorious World Heritage area of Tasmania, then I will be one of those who will overlook such a lapse. Here is a great opportunity for this government to do something very lasting for the nation and for the international community interested in history and ecology. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Economy: Household and Personal Debt</title><title>Product Safety</title><page.no>49</page.no></subdebateinfo><title>Product Safety</title><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>49</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is the first day of December today, and as we head into the Christmas-New Year period I would like to speak as shadow minister for consumer affairs about two major issues: consumer debt and product safety. The Christmas-New Year period is one of particularly high consumer spending, primarily on gifts and holidays. It is important for Australians to be aware of a number of issues and risks that may affect us during this period. Consumer confidence is generally high as we head into the holiday season, with the Reserve Bank of Australia this month revealing that consumer confidence surged to its second highest level in 30 years. Recent fluctuations notwithstanding, it is obviously a period of substantial spending. While this news is great for retailers, many Australian families will soon develop post holiday blues as they continue to struggle under a mountain of debt due to inadequate warnings on credit cards and the traps that come from spending a lot during this period.</para></talk.start><para>Labor has been warning about the growing debt crisis for more than four years but the Treasurer and the Howard government have done little to address, inform and educate Australians about how they can better deal with rising levels of household debt. From a very practical point of view, the Howard government could be doing more to support consumers. With newspapers today carrying stories of record household debt, reporting that the average Australian household is spending 2.3 per cent more than it earns each week, it is clear that accumulating debt has become a way of life for many Australian households.</para><para>Today's stories come from the release of the AMP.NATSEM report yesterday: <inline font-style="italic">Household debt in Australia</inline><inline font-style="italic">âwalking the tightrope</inline>. The report confirms the new records Australians are setting in accumulating debt. The report found that all forms of debt are on the increase; home loans, other property loans, personal loans, HECS and credit card debt are at record levels. It is worth placing these statistics on the record. In 2002, Australian households owed $422 billion in housing and other loans and on credit cards. This accumulated household debt amounted to just under 60 per cent of the value of Australia's gross domestic product. This means, according to the AMP.NATSEM report, that in 2002 each household in Australia carried a debt of $60,000 which, given an average disposable household income of about $46,000, means that the level of debt represents 1.3 years of income. This implies that many Australians will be burdened with high levels of debt for years to come. </para><para>As a nation we are spending more than we earn, which is why it has become so important that as much information as possible about the levels of debt we are incurring reaches Australians. Record levels of combined household debt place increasing pressure on families at this time of the year, when credit cards are often used to purchase Christmas presents or while holidaying, because people are finding it harder to save for the increased expenses incurred during the year.</para><para>Credit card debt is increasing at an alarming rate, with Reserve Bank of Australia figures showing this month that Australians owe nearly $28 billion on our credit and charge cards. The figures I am referring to increased by another $157 million in just one month, from August to September this year. The interest bill for Australians in September alone was a whopping $266 million. That is almost $9 million a day. Credit card debt is an issue that affects the majority of Australians, with around 69 per cent of Australian households responsible for either a credit or charge account, with an average household credit and charge card debt in excess of $5,300. This figure has skyrocketed under the Howard government, going from $1,601 in June 1996, just a few months after they took office, to $5,309 in September 2004. It is just not acceptable that the Howard government sit back and watch Australians fall further and further into the debt trap with no inkling of an attempt to curb the credit and charge card crisis. While the Howard government sit dormant on addressing this issue, it is the Australian public who lose out. The Howard government should follow Labor's lead in this area to address credit card debt. </para><para>I would like to refer to a series of points that Labor contained in its policy leading up to the last election. They include: firstly, requiring that credit limits be increased only at the request of the cardholder; secondly, prohibiting unsolicited promotional material with preapproved limits; thirdly, requiring financial health warnings to ensure that consumers are made aware of the potential cost of credit card finance; and, fourthly, ensuring that monthly statements contain warnings about how long it would take to repay debt if only minimum payments were made and the amount of interest that would be paid. Those are four commonsense points that certainly some jurisdictions in Australia have already acted upon. But there has been a singular lack of leadership from the Howard government to address those issues and provide a bit of practical support.</para><para>Before I move on to product safety I also want to make a general comment about rising household debt. The last time household debt was so high was in the early nineties, and the reason for that increase pointed to high interest rates. At that time, the possibility of that matter being resolved was linked to the decrease in interest rates that followed. That puts it in sharp perspective now, when we are experiencing record household debt at a time when interest rates are low. If they are low and we have this immense amount of household debt, it highlights consumers' vulnerability to interest rate rises right across the nation. If you have that exposure of household debt when interest rates are so low, the risk to households and families of interest rates rising is potentially disastrous. We all know this is the sentiment that the Howard government tried to tap into during the election campaign. But it is the vulnerability that consumers have been placed in as a result of that debt that the government must take responsibility for and not try to mislead or trick Australian people into believing that they are better off having this high household debt while interest rates are so low. It is a very daunting situation for anyone who has a big mortgage and debts to face. </para><para>I would now like to turn to product safety. This issue, again around Christmas time, is particularly important. People have a right to know when they are purchasing gifts for family and friends that their gifts are safe and reliable. The state governments are in effect the front line of consumer affairs. I wish to take this opportunity to acknowledge the excellent efforts undertaken by the states and territories in leading the way in advocating the rights of consumers and ensuring that appropriate regulations and laws are in place to protect these rights. Secondary to the states are the four federal agencies dealing with aspects of consumer affairs. Despite this secondary role, there is an increasing necessity for the Commonwealth to play a collaborative role and provide leadership. They have a responsibility to bring about greater harmonisation between the states and territories and their respective laws, particularly on the issue of product safety.</para><para>It is very easy for consumers to become confused when attempting to check on a product or report a faulty product when they have to grapple with the concept of separate agencies in their states and in the federal jurisdiction. Product safety information can become even more confusing for consumers, particularly at Christmas time when everyone's life is in a bit of a flurry and they are trying to purchase many toys and gifts for their children or for other children. The states and territories have had little choice but to act independently in the banning of toy products deemed unsafe. For example, the Victorian state government conducted a blitz on dangerous and banned toys late last week in the lead-up to Christmas.</para><para>The Victorian government are communicating to Victorian consumers the products to be wary of. To their credit they have been involved in a concerted effort for all the states and territories to work more closely together. That raises the important question: why is the Howard government leaving it up to individual state and territory governments to source and research these products to determine whether they meet safety standards? Surely the government has a role to play. The complete lack of federal leadership shown in relation to developing national uniform product safety legislation or guidelines is, unfortunately, typical of this government on issues of consumer affairs. It is just not good enough and it is not unacceptable when there is a constructive role it could play. I know that the states would welcome the constructive involvement of the federal government were it forthcoming. </para><para>But the fact is that the Howard-Costello government have paid little regard to the Ministerial Council on Consumer Affairs, which represents state and federal ministers. They have had little input and taken little from the discussions of this group to develop improved consumer affairs policy. It is hoped that Mr Chris Pearce, the member for Aston and Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, who I understand is now the chair of the ministerial council, will show a little more leadership from the federal government.</para><para>Australians need a consumer advice service which deals with product safety nationally and which is available for all Australians, and it should be led by the federal government. It is not acceptable to wait until a state gets sick and tired of doubling up and other inefficiencies and instigates its own interstate agreements. I commend the states on the efforts they have made in trying to cooperate. It is not good enough for the federal government to sit back and do nothing. They should be taking a lead in this area and supporting the good work of the states to date. The Ministerial Council on Consumer Affairs, in their `Review of the Australian consumer product safety system' discussion paper released in August this year, stated: </para><quote><para>The involvement of multiple jurisdictions in regulating the safety of consumer products results in duplication of effort which places pressure on Government resources. This is because similar regulatory tasks, such as issuing mandatory standards or bans, are often conducted by each jurisdiction in respect of the same product.</para></quote><para>They further stated: </para><quote><para>There is a need for a system that ensures the clear, comprehensive treatment of products in a way which draws upon the expertise and resources of businesses and is supported by more efficient use of the resources available to government.</para></quote><para>That says it how it is. The doubling up affects not only the consumer as the report states; the development of product safety legislation over time in each jurisdiction has created some obstacles and additional costs for businesses that wish to sell their products to consumers throughout Australia. So there is an issue of red tape caused by having the same product sold in a range of jurisdictions. Surely, if nothing else, that would motivate this government to act.</para><para>The government needs to heed this report and to recognise the problems in its product safety system. The Labor opposition will be on the back of the government to ensure it follows through in addressing the issues raised in the paper and that it implements the changes to the Australian product safety system. Whether it is a council report or the federal government's own report, time and again we see that the report is released only after years of completely ignoring the issues. The report is then placed on the shelf in the minister's office somewhere and nothing is done about it. We want to see a change from the Howard government. Labor want to see some activity, not a government that sits back and observes the ridiculous doubling up and inefficiencies it is inflicting upon our state and territory governments in the consumer regulatory systems. It is incumbent upon this government to show the sort of leadership expected from a federal government acting on its own report.</para><para>During the election Labor committed to providing improved consolidated information and research regarding product safety through the office of consumer affairs, and Labor will continue to keep this government accountable for fixing their system. This particular issue, as I said, has been around for a long time. I have not tried to detail all of the products here, but I do urge people who are listening to note that consumer affairs and product safety are critical issues. People do not want to be put in the appalling situation of either giving a gift or purchasing something they need only to find that there is an unacceptable risk associated with that product. The circumstances around that sort of situation could be tragic. It is obviously a place where government can step forward, work with the state and territory jurisdictions and move very quickly to show federal leadership and get unsafe products out of the marketplace.</para><para>Finally, I would like to go back to the issue of household debt. This issue is not going to go away. It is in the context of poor economic management overall. I think that, over time, many Australians will come to see just how vulnerable a position the Howard government has allowed them to find themselves in with its handling of rising household debt.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women</title><page.no>52</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>52</page.no><name role="metadata">Kirk, Sen Linda</name><name role="display">Senator KIRK</name><name.id>00AOO</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âLast Thursday, 25 November, was White Ribbon Day, which is the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women. White ribbons are worn on 25 November each year to encourage people, both men and women, to speak out about violence against women. </para></talk.start><para>White Ribbon Day was a particularly poignant occasion in Adelaide this year. Just one week earlier on 17 November a woman was shot by her estranged husband in the Myer department store in the city. On Wednesday, 17 November 61-year-old Carole Schaer arrived for work in the shoe department of Myer in Rundle Mall, just as she had done for the past seven years. Carole Schaer had separated from her husband, 69-year-old Simon Schaer, eight years earlier. She was in another relationship and was getting married in January next year. Ms Schaer had filed for divorce. The papers were to be served on Mr Schaer on 19 November, and Ms Schaer had planned to be in Port Lincoln on that day. Instead, the divorce papers were delivered early. On the morning the papers were served, 17 November, Simon Schaer burned down his home in Magill. He then made his way to the Myer Centre in Adelaide city and shot his former wife, Carole Schaer, at close range with a hand gun. Newspapers reported that former neighbours of the couple in the leafy suburb of Kings Park in Adelaide were shocked at the murder and described the Schaers as a lovely couple.</para><para>I give the Senate this example today of this tragic incident that occurred just a few weeks ago in my home town of Adelaide to illustrate the extent to which violence against women can bring about tragic consequences for innocent women. I extend my condolences to the family of Carole Schaer. Violence against women is not a problem confined to one particular social class or age group. Elderly women, young women and pregnant women are all victims of violence. It happens in small towns, in the outer suburbs and in the most affluent neighbourhoods. It might even be happening in my street or to someone that I know.</para><para>The South Australian government recently published a statistical profile of women in my home state. It confirms that, statistically, women have more to fear from their partners and husbands than they do from strangers. Police records show that, in 2000, 77 per cent of South Australian women who reported being physically assaulted were assaulted by an intimate family member, and in the same year the figure for sexual assault was 97 per cent. Australian research also shows that more than one million women have experienced violence during a relationship. Of these women, 60 per cent said they lived in fear during the relationship, 67.7 per cent of women who suffered violence said that their children had witnessed the violence and 20 per cent of women who suffered violence were pregnant when the violence first occurred.</para><para>Family violence generates enormous health and legal sector costs in our communities and is second only to traffic accidents in the use of police resources. Earlier this year here at Parliament House I participated in Amnesty International's launch of its campaign Stop Violence Against Women. On this date Kate Gilmore, Executive Deputy Secretary-General of Amnesty, made a speech. She gave these quite startling statistics: internationally more women die as a result of violence than are killed by cancer, road accidents or malaria; worldwide, one in three women is a victim of violence, including beatings, rape and attack; and 79 countries have no law against domestic violence.</para><para>It is sobering to consider that just a few generations back violence against women in Australia was viewed by many as normal behaviour. At the beginning of the 20th century an Australian husband could legally beat his wife. A magistrate infamously ruled that a man could beat his wife, but with a stick no thicker than his thumbâhence the expression `rule of thumb'. Back then rape was a crime, not against the woman but against her father. </para><para>I take this opportunity today to express my condolences to the family of Carole Schaer. I am raising the issue of violence against women because it is important that we reflect on the tragic situation many women find themselves in. I also commend the work being done by groups such as Amnesty International and UNIFEM. Praise should also go to the many small community organisations who are working towards a reduction in violence in their local areas.</para><para>In October this year, I participated in an antiviolence rally in Port Noarlunga in Adelaide's south which was organised by people who are involved in the Seeds of Nonviolence projectâa community initiative aimed at men in the city of Onkaparinga region. The project offers counselling as well as community programs to support men and their families who are moving away from violence. It was most encouraging that day to see so many people prepared to take a public stand against violence. I want to say a public thankyou to the organisers of that event and to share with the Senate my belief that it is grassroots projects like that, directed at men, which play a key part in violence reduction. I urge the government to investigate and direct further funds in this direction.</para><para>Violence against women is often hidden. Women are too afraid or too ashamed to report it, and often when they do it is not taken seriously. On White Ribbon Day, we make a pledge to speak up against violence against women. We say that violence will not be tolerated, and that we will do all we can to work towards offering support and counselling to both men and women who have the courage to say `enough is enough' and ask for help.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Policies</title><title>Howard Government: Election</title><page.no>54</page.no></subdebateinfo><title>Howard Government: Election</title><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>54</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âToday, 1 December, is a very good news day for the Australian seafood industry and indeed for all Australians who are consumers of Australia's fine seafood. Earlier this morning I was privileged to be at the Sydney Fish Market to launch the `environmental tick', one might say, given to the Australian seafood industry under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. Senators will know that five years ago this very tough act was passed by the Howard government, requiring very strict regulations on, amongst other things, the management of the fisheries industries.</para></talk.start><para>Almost on time, with perhaps a little extension, the Australian seafood industry has been able to get that environmental tick under the EPBC Act. That means that this Christmas time Australians can tuck into Australia's fine, fresh, `clean and green' seafood, content in the knowledge not only that seafood is healthy, good for their diet and very Australian but also that the Australian fish and fish products they are eating come from environmentally sustainable fisheriesâsome of the most environmentally sustainable fisheries in the world. The 11 Commonwealth fisheries that have been assessed by Environment Australia all came out with a clean bill of health. Four of them will be reviewed in three years time and the rest have a five-year review period in accordance with the EPBC Act. So it is a great result for the seafood industry and for those Australians who love seafoodâand shouldn't that be all of us? </para><para>I know all senators would agree with me in urging all Australians to have a lot of Australian seafood come Christmas time. The seafood industry is doing it a bit tough at the moment with the very high prices of fuel, the high Australian exchange rate and the low-quality, low-value fish products that are imported into the country. But we as Australians can help the seafood industry and ourselves by getting stuck into some fabulous seafood this Christmas time. </para><para>I also want to touch briefly on the Howard government's commitment to Tasmania and indeed to all Australians in relation to the Tasmanian forests. Senators will recall that the government has given a commitment to add 170,000 hectares of old-growth forest to the reserve system in Tasmania. It is very important to emphasise to all Australians, many of whom have been confused by the ramblings of the Greens party over the years, that this will mean one million hectares of old-growth trees are locked away permanently in reserves in Tasmania forever and a day. If you listen to the Greens and the misleading that they are so adept at, you would think that there are only five or a dozen old-growth trees left in Australia. You would think that there are practically none left because that is the sort of misleading information that the Greens give. Over the last 10, 20 or 30 years, they have been able to hoodwink the public, particularly the public of Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide, that there are only a couple of old-growth trees left. </para><para>The fact is that, following the implementation of the Howard government's election commitments, one million hectares of old-growth forests in Tasmania will be permanently locked away out of 1.2 million hectares, which is the total area of old-growth forests in Tasmania. That is not a bad result. I want to repeat that to emphasise it: of the 1.2 million hectares of old-growth forests in Tasmania, following the implementation of the Howard government's program one million hectares of old-growth forests will be locked away.</para><para>At the moment officers from my department, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, from the Department of the Environment and Heritage and from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet are working with the Tasmanian government to put together the boundaries of those new additions to the forest. We had hoped to make those boundaries known today. That was the commitment we gave. We wanted to emphasise that we were not going to follow the Labor Party line of having yet another review into the forestsâthere have been hundreds of them alreadyâand coming back in 12 or 18 months time, thinking about it and perhaps getting a policy then. We wanted it to be firm; we wanted to give the industry the certainty of knowing what is reserved and what is not. More importantly, we wanted to make sure that Tasmanian workers, such as the blue-collar workers and the other workers in the industry, including contractorsâthose people who are now flocking to the Howard government, to the Liberal Party, in droves because we look after their jobsâunderstand that we are concerned about their jobs, that we are concerned about the environment and that we are concerned about the forests. But we believe that a balance can be met which will add additional trees to the reserves and which will ensure that all of those workers in Tasmania maintain their jobs. That is the commitment we have given, and we are determined to keep it. It did not happen on 1 December, as we had hoped; it will happen in a few weeks when we complete our negotiations. </para><para>I want to read into the record, in response to Senator Brown's petty criticism, that even the Wilderness Society spokesperson in an article today said that he was glad the government was not rushing this decision. The article states: </para><quote><para>âIt's better to get a good decision than a rushed one,â he said. âWe don't want to blow this opportunity to protect some of Tasmania's important wilderness areas and forests.â</para></quote><para>Even the Wilderness Society are supportive of the Howard government's approach to the negotiations to add additional reserve, whereas all Senator Brown can do is complain and whinge.</para><para>I think Senator Brown is very uncertain at the moment. Most Australians have worked out that the Greens political party have nothing to do with being green or with the environment. They are all about those very left-wing social and political agendas. They have done nothing on the environment in the last three years. They have hardly asked a question, you might recall, Mr Acting Deputy President. Certainly, they have never turned up at estimates committees to ask any questions at all on the environment. They are just frauds when it comes to the environment, and I think the Australian public saw through them. The Greens have had their worst election result. The results for the Greens and the Democrats this time round were worse than they have been in many years past.</para><para>While Senator Brown has tried to put a positive spin on it, the Greens lost their only House of Representatives member and got nowhere near the number of senators he expected. The Greens did not even win the number of seats held by Democrats senators who were defeated. It has been an appalling result for the Greens as a political force, because Australians have worked out that they are frauds when it comes to the environment. The Greens are only interested in left-wing social and political agendas, whereas, by contrast, the Howard government is the greenest, most environmental government that this nation has ever seen. The addition to the reserves in Tasmania is just one element that demonstrates what an environmentally aware and environmentally conscious government the Howard government is.</para><para>I wanted to say a couple of other things about the election but, to allow Senator McGauran to speak on the very important subject of wool, I seek leave to incorporate the rest of my speech in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. </para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as followsâ</inline></para><quote><para>The real winners on 9 October 2004 were the people of Australia who emphatically decided on the team to continue the Australian way of life and the prosperity we have enjoyed since 1996.</para><para>As well there were many unsung heroes.

I would like to bring to the attention of the Senate the Wool Factory, a business in Horsham, Victoria, that keeps some 900 merinos. They are housed and fed for life. Each sheep is housed in an individual pen under one roof. The object of the Wool Factory is to produce the finest of fine wool. Moreover, this outstanding business employs some 40 special needs workers, who have various disabilities. It is a vital part of Horsham economic life. The business was established in 1983. In that time it has grown, on and off, some of the world's finest wool. With that backdrop, I announce to the Senate that the Wool Factory has achieved a world first. It has produced the finest bale of wool in the worldâa 93-kilogram bale of wool with fibres of a thickness of 11.8 micron.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name></talker><para>âThat's fantastic.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name></talker><para>âIt is fantastic, Senator Macdonald. Just to put that in perspective, it is about a sixth of the thickness of a human hair. The bale is expected to go up for auction in December, when no doubt there will be some keen bidding for it from our main suppliers, such as Japan, China and Korea. The Wool Factory achieved not only this world prize for the finest bale of wool but also a very prestigious award earlier this year from Ermenegildo Zegnaâand I suspect there would be a few people wearing Ermenegildo Zegna suits in this parliamentâfor the world's finest and best fleece. The first bale of wool I mentioned was 11.8 micron, but in this single fleece they were able to achieve 10.6 micron. It came from a sheep also at the Rowville stud of David and Susan Rowbottom in St Helens, Victoria. So it looks as though Victoria is leading Australia, if not the world, in producing the finest wool. And do not think there is not stiff competition for this award. As my colleagues on both sides of the chamber know, Australia has some pretty strong competitors in this market. No lesser countries than New Zealand across the Tasman, South Africa and Argentina compete for this prestigious award.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I had the opportunity recently to visit the Wool Factory and they gave me a sample of the world award-winning bale, which I am very happy to show the Senate. I know I cannot table it, but for all my colleagues in the chamber I have a piece of some of the finest wool ever produced in the worldâand it is a Victorian product. I know many of my New South Wales colleagues, such as Senator Sandy Macdonald who is a wool grower, would be envious. I can tell all those Tasmanians who think that they grow some of the best and finest wool, purchased mainly by the Italians, that Victoria has taken the crown away from all the wool producing states. It is not to say that they do not put in a fair effort but it seems to me that, when it comes to the finest of fine wool, Victoria takes the crown.

I was not surprised by the question at all.

It is therefore a good program for the district, delivering environmental outcomes in delivering alternative fuels but also delivering an environmental outcome in underpinning the structural adjustment that is required for a community that is going to go through a process of structural adjustment caused by the need for water reform.

Who could forget that terrible incident in 2001 when the balaclava-clad secretary of the AMWU violently invaded two workplaces in Victoria, causing shock, fear and terror to innocent employees? This incident has now been appropriately dealt with by the courts. Unfortunately, innocent employees and employers have no redress against less violent invasions of the workplace by union officialsâinvasions that are sanctioned by state Labor governments. I can confirm that the Howard-Anderson government is going to seek to correct this position in the very near future. I know senators opposite will not be happy with this, and their interjections have indicated that. After all, when you look across the chamber, what do you see?

Everyone seems to be happy with these projects and happy with the great results that they can deliver for Australia. The only people who want to be negative and unhappy about them are the Australian Labor Party. We know the reason for that. It is that people like Senator Carr and the leadership of the Australian Labor Partyâand, it seems, most Labor Party senatorsâseem happiest when they are closest to the general post office of a major capital city and even happier when they are in a cappuccino strip. They are very unhappy when they get out to the regions.

Questions of drink spiking and the use of illicit drugs are indeed relevant. Earlier this year the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy received a report from the Australian Institute of Criminology which was conceived and commissioned by the Commonwealth. Fifty per cent of the funding for that came from the Commonwealth. I point out to the Senate that in this area the Howard government has given a high priority to the question of drink spiking. When you consider that that report outlined that each year there were between 3,000 and 4,000 drink spiking instances, that one-third of those result in sexual assault and that four out of five victims were female, it gives you an idea of the insidious aspect of drink spiking.</para></talk.start><para>Illicit drugs are another threat that our young Australians face, especially at that vulnerable stage of leaving school. Earlier this month, Customs and the Australian Federal Police working together seized 820 kilograms of ecstasy, the largest seizure ever in Australia, with an estimated street value of $200 million. Millions of hits of the drug were saved from reaching the streets of our towns and citiesâfrom reaching the community at a stage when thousands of students would be leaving school.</para><para>As well as that, just a couple of weeks prior to that, again Customs and the AFP seized 125 kilograms of crystal methamphetamine, or iceâanother amphetamine type stimulant drug, a designer drug that unfortunately is targeted at young people. That was seized in Sydney, again keeping a large quantity of that drug off Australia's streets. What this means is that we are making progress in the fight against drugs. In relation to heroin, we have had international endorsement of the progress that law enforcement has made. As a result of cutting down on the supply of heroin, we have seen a reduction in the rate of deaths from heroin overdoses. We want to do the same for amphetamines and other illicit drugs. In fact, reports from such bodies as the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, the Australian National University and the United Nationsâall independent reportsâacknowledge the great work that is being done by law enforcement in Australia.</para><para>Of course, we fight illicit drugs on three fronts: education, health and law enforcement. But we can only succeed through education and health if we succeed in reducing the supply of illicit drugs. In relation to drink spiking, our strategy is the same: we have to target that. Yet we have from the opposition criticism that the Commonwealth government is going beyond the report that I mentioned by saying that we should have uniform laws. I have just seen in the last 24 hours an announcement from Victoria that they will introduce laws on drink spiking, and I congratulate them on that. Earlier this month New South Wales made a similar announcement. That is the sort of action the Commonwealth has called for: a national concerted effort on drink spiking. To have 3,000 to 4,000 instances of drink spiking in Australia each year is far too many, and we have to embark upon a program of education, law enforcement and targeting offenders, particularly when sexual assaults are involved in this sort of insidious activity. We are totally dedicated at the Commonwealth level to provide leadership in the fight against illicit drugs and in the fight against drink spiking, and we call upon the federal opposition to join us in that mission. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Defence: Financial Statements</title><page.no>64</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>64</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is directed to Senator Hill, the Minister for Defence.

The core question remains: will the minister guarantee that the Auditor-General will not have to qualify the accounts next year?

Senator Evans knows, or should know, that once the Auditor-General qualifies accounts it is actually very difficult to remove those qualifications. Defence has worked closely with the Auditor-General in putting in place this remedial program. I think that Senator Evans should also acknowledge that, despite these deficiencies, in terms of operations the logistics of the department have worked extremely well. In terms of budgeting there has been a significant improvement overall. In terms of cash management the accounts are not qualified in any way. So there are a lot of positives. Senator Evans, not surprisinglyâhe is in opposition and, I suspect, will be there for a long timeâhas concentrated on the negatives.

I have previously put before the Senate considerable evidence of areas of improvement in health within Iraq and the very significant investment that has been made by the international community towards that goal. There is no doubt that before the war the health system within Iraq was very seriously run downâpartly, you might say, as a result of sanctions but also partly because Saddam Hussein had other prioritiesâand certainly the ensuing conflict would not have helped in that regard. But the efforts by the international community in rebuilding the system and building a better system have been considerable. They are, of course, being hindered by the ongoing insurgence, which makes it very difficult to attract international personnel. That insurgence is also, obviously, hindering the construction of infrastructure. The international community is putting a major effort into the reconstruction of Iraq, into the rebuilding of its institutions and into assisting it with its primary responsibilities in areas such as health and education, and it will continue to do so. I am sure Senator Bartlett is aware of the recent donors conference and the amount of international assistance that is being given.</para></talk.start><para>In relation to that other so-called independent report of deaths of civilians, the truth is that the number of deaths of civilians is not known.

In relation to malnutrition and other health failures, I can get the material out again and bring it to the Senate, but there is significant material of improvements. For example, the inoculation of children has been a major program within Iraq since the conflict. It is very difficult. There is no doubt that there is a very difficult environment within the country at the moment. It is very difficult to attract, as I said, international support.

If any ISP is found not to comply with the code of practice, compliance can be enforced by the ABA and Internet service providers can be fined up to $27,500 per day. The government did consider mandatory filtering some years ago and reviewed this recently, as Senator Harradine correctly said.

I said in my answer to his primary question that simple filters are easily outsmarted by merchants of offensive content and that the kind of complex technologies needed to analyse every single item being downloaded were not considered feasible in our review. The review also estimated that the cost of this sort of filtering would be $45 million a year to begin with, falling to more than $33 million a year on an ongoing basis. The biggest issueâit is not so much the moneyâis that such an expensive scheme would not necessarily solve the problem and small to medium ISPs would simply be driven out of business for little or no benefit. What does work is greater information and parental supervision, and those are the kind of programs that the government is promoting with the $30 million initiative.</para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Telstra: Chief Executive Officer</title><page.no>69</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>69</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to Senator Coonan, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts.

I am glad that he has found time to pay a bit of attention to his shadow portfolio because it is a portfolio where issues change from day to day. The government was advised this morning of Dr Switkowski's decision to step down from the position of CEO of Telstra on or before 1 July next year. It was, of course, a decision reached by Dr Switkowski in consultation with the Telstra board. As to Dr Switkowski's remunerationâand I think the terms of Dr Switkowski's remuneration have been up on Telstra's web site for about a yearâthe payout, as I understand it, is $2.09 million as well as accrued leave and incentive payments. He will also receive fixed remuneration in lieu of notice should he go before 1 July. </para></talk.start><para>As Senator Conroy would know, the government certainly does not seek to intervene in the remuneration decisions of companies. Our approach is to ensure that there is full disclosure by directors and that boards are accountable to their shareholders for remuneration decisions. As Senator Conroy would know from the very lengthy discussion in this chamber about it, the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program (Audit Reform and Corporate Disclosure) Act 2004, fondly known to all in here as CLERP 9, significantly enhances the director and executive remuneration disclosures that are made in annual reports. The important thing is that there be transparency in disclosure, and that is certainly what has happened here. Among the information that needs to be disclosed, partly due to my colleague Senator Campbell's close attention to this issue in the whole of the CLERP 9 process, is post-employment benefits, including retirement benefits and contributions and other arrangements to benefit employees following cessation of employment.</para><para>As everyone would be aware, Telstra, as a result of its corporatisation by a previous Labor government, is subject to these and all other corporate law requirements. So there is nothing remarkable about Dr Switkowski's remuneration, which is subject to contract and properly disclosed to shareholders. In fact, the board, as I understand it, would be adhering to this contractual arrangement that has been notified and up on Telstra's web site for over a year. I am not at all sure what Senator Conroy is seeking to derive from this because, on my understanding, Dr Switkowski's remuneration was certainly not at the top of executive bands and payouts. The particular issue that needs to be emphasised is that, while these kinds of payments are important, it is really important that there is appropriate disclosure. That is exactly what has happened in this instance.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>70</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMr President, I ask a supplementary question. The key issue here is performance and the golden handshake and whether Dr Switkowski is entitled to it.

In light of the rise in Telstra's share price when rumours of Dr Switkowski's demise as CEO circulated recently and of Telstra's plummeting share price during Dr Switkowski's stint as CEO, hasn't the government sacrificed Switkowski to sell Telstra?</para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>70</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âDr Switkowski's payout has been well and truly publicised.

Deaths from transport injuries are almost three times as high. Deaths from fires, burns and scalds are 10 times higher than any of us could expect to suffer.</para></talk.start><para>This report is not a surprise. It puts a spotlight on the problem. It is a very sad situation and it is not one that has happened overnight. It has happened over decades of disadvantage and of failed solutions of previous governments of all persuasions and at all levels. And it is, frankly, a failure of Indigenous leadership. There have been improvements in a number of areas that we should not shy away from heraldingâif only to give encouragement to those who are working in this area. One I might mention in particular is that the rate of deaths in custody is reducing. Deaths in police custody have decreased by more than 50 per cent in this decade as opposed to the decade prior to the royal commission.</para><para>But today's figures just remind us of the situation, and recent incidents at Palm Island and at Redfern should remind us all of how far we have to go. These problems will not be resolved by merely tinkering at the edges. What we have been doing has not been working. We cannot just replace one set of representative structures with another and convince ourselves that we have done something useful. Issues like passive welfare, safer communities and jobs are far more important than structures and who gets the job. We do require radical reform. Incidentally, abolishing ATSIC is just a part of the story. Government assistance must be based on results and on mutual obligation. Communities must be helped to tackle their own problems. Government must offer support but work with communities so that they get a chance to shape their future.</para><para>We need to deal with the communities direct, not through intermediaries. To really give Indigenous Australians a voice we must listen to them directly, not through some structures that we create. We are moving away from no-strings welfare to a mutual obligation for individual welfare recipients in remote areas, as for other Australians. The activities that will be required will be developed with local communities so that they match the opportunities and the needs of those communities. I expect they will be vastly different from those services which are required and offered in the metropolitan area. We are going to help individual communities to take greater responsibility for local social improvements in return for federal Indigenous-specific funding. That principle will apply only to those special programs that are only available to Indigenous people. In other words, there will be no greater mutual obligation placed on Indigenous people for normal welfare services than there is on others.</para><para>We are looking at practical measures: the no school, no pool funding that we have put into the Northern Territory with the Northern Territory government, and I hope we will be able to extend that; working with the Fred Hollows Foundation and Woolworths to get nutritious stores and food available to remote communities; scholarships to enable Indigenous kids to board in good schools around Australia; and leadership programs for women and young people.

More than that, he confessed, so it was a very interesting question time. The minister confessed that he had lost complete control of the management of Defence, the financial management of the defence department, and that he had had to call in outside help. He had had to call in the Department of Finance and Administration and he had had to call in Ernst and Youngâhe had had to call in just about anybodyâbecause, after three years of having his Defence accounts qualified by the Auditor-General, the minister had finally admitted defeat.

He ran up the white flag and said, `Basically I can't do the job.' Three years in a row the Auditor-General has said that he cannot approve the defence department's accounts because they are in a shambles. They are not a true reflection. The department is unable to identify its assets and unable to identify its leave balances. We are not talking about chickenfeed here. We are talking about $8 billion worth of Commonwealth assets that it is unable to identify. This is one of the largest departments in the Commonwealth and this minister has been unable to get his accounts past the Auditor-General for three years running.</para><para>The Liberal Party in Western Australia used to be very fond of the idea of three strikes and you are out when it came to young Aboriginal offenders and others in the criminal justice system. I say to the minister: three strikes and you ought to be out. Three times you have failed to get your accounts past the Auditor-General. Three times the Auditor-General has said: `You haven't got proper financial management of one of our largest departments. You can't run your department. I can't sign off on your accounts because you can't tell me where the tanks are and you can't tell me how much money we owe our service men and women. You've got no proper records.'

Yet the minister has failed to get on top of this issue.</para><para>Senator Hill has been in the job for all of those three years. He has been in the job and has failed to get on top of it. As I said, at least he was honest today. He threw his hands up and said, `I've had to get in outsiders. I've had to hand over to Senator Minchin.' That must have really galled himâhaving to hand over to his old factional enemy Senator Minchin because he has got the job now of sorting it out. Senator Minchin has been called in because, quite frankly, Senator Hill cannot manage it. I can see Senator Ferguson smiling. Senator Ferguson, you would smile. There is a delicious irony in all this that you and I both understand. </para><para>Senator Minchin has been given the job of sorting out the mess that Senator Hill has made of Defence's financial systems. Senator Hill has had three years. Clearly, the Prime Minister and others have said: `Enough's enough. If the Auditor-General won't sign off on this stuff we've got to get somebody else in.' So they have got a two-pronged attack. They have got Ernst and Young coming inâI would be interested to know how much that is going to cost us; in addition to all the other costs of Defence, we are now paying for Ernst and Young to sort out the problemsâfor what the minister describes in delightful terms as a `remedial program'.

It is nice for the government to say: `We'll look after him. We'll put in a remedial program. The bloke's struggling a bit so we'll have a remedial program. We'll have a little literacy program, a remedial program, a little bit of accounting literacy because, quite frankly, he ain't up to the job. So we'll use taxpayers' money to do the job that this bloke can't do. We'll get in Ernst and Young and we'll pay them a fortune, and we'll get his old mate Senator Minchin, his old comrade from South Australia, who's always been one of his biggest fans, to come in and lend him a hand!'</para><para>I do not know if Senator Hill is all that comfortable with Senator Minchin but he has run up the white flag. He has got to get someone else to run the department because he cannot do the job. In a private company if you cannot do the job you resign. The head of Telstra resigned today. He could not manage the job. He has gone. Senator Hill ought to take the same advice. The payout is probably larger in his case. I know he missed out on the London job. Senator Alston beat him to the punch. But if you cannot do your job you ought to go. Quite frankly, three years in a row Senator Hill has proved he is not up to it.

We had exactly the same sorts of questions and comments coming from the opposition that we hear every day. This is a soundly defeated opposition that has found itself in the same spot asking very tired old questions. The people of Australia made the decision on who runs the defence forces in this country.

Outside the first and second world wars, there probably has not been a busier time for our defence forces, who have found themselves involved in operations all around the world. I think they are currently involved in some 10 or 11 operations with varying numbers of personnel. But when you consider the effort that has been put in by our defence forces over that period of time, you see that they have done an outstanding job. The minister himself, for those three years that he has been in charge of our defence forces, has done an outstanding job, which has enabled our defence forces to maintain the efforts they are putting in, in the interests of our neighbours and countries around the world. </para><para>This government has a proud record in improving the quality of financial management and reporting across the public sector through a range of reforms, which have included, of course, the introduction of accrual accounting. It is accrual accounting that has highlighted the issues that have been raised by the Auditor-General because it imposes rigorous requirements on agenciesâfar more rigorous requirements than were ever placed on agencies by previous governmentsâto ensure that their assets and their liabilities are adequately valued. That is where the difficulty has come in over the past three years because far more rigorous requirements have been placed on agencies than have ever been placed on agencies before. We should never forget that.</para><para>We take the issues that have been raised by the Australian National Audit Office, ANAO, in relation to the Department of Defence very seriously because they prove that, in relation to accrual accounting, there are still many things that have to be put in place and got right. Accrual accounting was a bold move by this government. It is something that had been asked for for a long time. It is only understandable that, in a very complex department like the Department of Defence, with so many different arms and with such large numbers of people, once these rigorous requirements were placed on those agencies, the ANAO has had to make sure that everything is up to the very high standard that we expect.</para><para>The problems that exist within the defence department go primarily to the adequacy of record keeping, which was not as rigorous in previous days as it is required to be today. The defence forces themselves over a period of time will be working very hard to make sure that that record keeping is kept up to date. One of the things that accrual accounting and rigorous record keeping have highlighted is that it has created some uncertainties, particularly in relation to leave entitlements and inventories. So if we have this rigorous requirement which ensures that agencies have their assets and liabilities adequately valued, it is understandable that it takes some time before they get it exactly right. In the initial stages of accrual accounting and as we have gone through the auditing process some years after accrual accounting was set up initiallyâwhich has taken some timeâit is understandable that it should take some time to get it exactly right. It needs to be emphasised that the problems raised by the Audit Office do not impact at all on the integrity of the government's key budget aggregates. It has no impact on that whatsoever, like the underlying cash surplus, the revenue and the cash outlays or the net debt. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>76</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAt the outset I must say that this qualification by the Auditor-General in respect of his report on the management of finances in the Department of Defence is about as serious as it is possible to get. It is exactly why we do have an Auditor-General to advise the parliament. As the custodian of the public purse he advises the parliament about financial mismanagement, financial management, financial irregularities, the valuation of assets and the extent of liabilities. It is not just the size of the black hole, although $8 billion is a huge amount of money in anyone's language. It is a figure that is incomprehensible. Yet the government is not aware of where $8 billion of various assets might be locatedâsomewhere or anywhere around Australia. That figure of $8 billion is the equivalent of two-thirds of Defence's annual budget. The Auditor-General's report is simply about incompetent management of the Department of Defence in the past and in the present. And one suspects, on the basis of past and current performance, that well into the future that incompetence in the area of management will continue. </para></talk.start><para>The government, through Senator Hill and Senator Minchin, have responded by saying that this is just an accounting issue, an issue of assets and liabilities, an issue of whether the left-hand side of the column balances the right-hand side of the column. They say, `Don't you worry about it, boys over there, it's just a matter of simple arithmetic.' But that is not what the Auditor-General said in his report. The Auditor-General said the opposite is the case. Fundamentally, the government cannot account for $8 billion of assets and liabilities. What does that amount to? It includes general stores, I am told, ammunition, property and the cost of accrued leave. There is $2.03 billion for the general stores inventory and $845 million of explosive ordnance. They do not know what its value is or in what warehouse, if any, it is located and they do not know in what part of Australia that explosive ordnance might be found. There is $2.86 billion of repairable items and $1.39 billion in land, building and infrastructure. They do not know where it is so they cannot value it. How can you not know where land and buildings are? How can you not have a valuation of the joint down the road? Without those sorts of details we have no idea where taxpayers' money has been spent for the last 10 to 15 years in this department. </para><para>Nor, of course, do we know about the true state of all existing assets and liabilities within the Australian Defence Force. If this were a private company the obvious thing would have happened: the board of directors would have resigned en masse; senior management would have been asked to leave; the regulatory agencies would have been invited to come in, to look at the books and find out where the mess was; and maybe some sort of report might be made to the shareholders of the company. The board of directors would have been sacked and some of them would probably go to jail for their gross mismanagement. What we have here is the government's own public sector ADF HIH. In the simplest terms it is nothing other than a gross public outrage.</para><para>From another point of view, what sort of confidence does this give Australians about the capacity of the Australian Defence Force and the management and administration of the Department of Defence? We do not know what stocks of ammunition we have. We do not know what general stores we have. And to brush this off as a simple accounting problem, a simple arithmetic problem, a simple matter of maintenance of records, is simply too trite, too simple and too glib. The worrying point is that it is more than five years since accrual accounting was implemented across government agencies. Why hasn't this problem been identified before? If records were inadequate last year, the year before and the year before that, why haven't the necessary system changes been put in place to correct those errors and deficiencies? Here we have (1) ignorance of the problem and (2) an accumulating problem year in, year out in the Department of Defence. Moreover, it is a management problem. On top of that we have had the same minister with responsibility for the Department of Defence for three years. Why hasn't he taken issue with the secretary of his department and with the Chief of the Defence Force? Why hasn't the riot act been read to all of those persons at a senior level? <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>78</page.no><name role="metadata">Johnston, Sen David</name><name role="display">Senator JOHNSTON</name><name.id>00AON</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt never ceases to amaze me! Two speakers, two predominant performers on the other side with absolutely no knowledge of two subjects. Firstly, they have no knowledge of how to read an audit reportâno knowledge and no understanding. I am giving Senator Evans the benefit of the doubt, because I am saying either he has not read the report, or the press coverage of the report, or he does not understand it. The fact is that the anomaly referred to is an error rate giving rise to a qualified Auditor-General's report. The $8 billion alleged to be misplaced or unavailable or accounted for is an error rate. It is not a real figure. </para></talk.start><para>Senator Evans says that the tanks have been misplaced and the weapons are unaccounted for. When Senator Evans was shadow minister he made no bones of the fact that he had no real interest in the subject matter of this portfolio. This minister has done more than all his predecessors and contemporaries to fix Labor's appalling record of the administration of defence. Let us pause for a moment to address the issue of the real moneyâin excess of $1 billionâthat senators on the other side, when they were in power in the early 1990s, simply could not account for in the Collins class submarine project. This was real money in providing one of the most important force element group's weapons systems, and it was presented to this government with no weapons system capacity. That was the length and breadth of the former government's ability to manage a project. I am talking about an idea, a concept, which is very good. The Collins class submarineâthanks to this ministerâis now one of the most formidable weapons forces this country possesses, and I am extremely proud of it. But that is no thanks to the Labor ministers who administered the project. It was a shambles when we picked it upâreal money gone, real money not accounted for and weapons systems not delivered with the projectâall because Labor ministers were incapable of understanding what had gone on. </para><para>There are no tanks unaccounted for. There are no explosives or ordnances missing. Whilst it is disturbing that we do not have an accurate assets account, the facts are these: Defence has over 90,000 service men and women under its umbrella and in excess of $50 billion worth of assets, a $16 billion annual project, and $40 billion worth of projects currently being undertaken. That is due to the expertise of this government. Under Labor, defence was left to rot and when East Timor came along and it was our duty to do the right thing and engage our forces there, the Defence Force was stretched. That was largely because of Labor's 13 years of abject neglect. </para><para>There are over 315,000 individual classification items, in 500,000 different locations, in 21 warehouses just like Moorebank. Over 400,000 leave applications are processed every yearâan enormous undertaking. Operationally, our service men and women have performed magnificently. The Labor Party, and the opposition in this place, should spend more valuable time acknowledging the exceptional performance of our Australian defence forces and the logistics that have been supplied to them.

Listening to Senator Johnston, I was surprised at his comments because the figure I had read about how many people are entitled to leave in the defence forces was over 70,000ânot the 90,000 that Senator Johnston referred to. But we will never know whether it is 70,000 or 90,000 because at the moment almost half of the budget for Defence cannot be accounted for. This matter has been raised in the last few weeks. I suppose you would not have seen this, Senator Ferguson, but we could see from this side that when a question was directed at Senator Minchin about this farce in Defence Force accounting and we asked about this situation, old Senator Minchin had a wry smile on his face.

It is a lovely picture, the three of you there together: Senator Ferris, Senator Ferguson and Senator Hill, all happy chappies. Today, by virtue of the Westminster system, we are able to pin down Senator Hill about this appalling situation. When this matter was first raised a few weeks ago one of the newspapers said they could not get hold of the minister. Normally when there is a troop deployment leaving, or an aircraft or a ship to be launched, there is Senator Hill. There is a photograph of Senator Hill with almost every bit of military equipment we have in this country. From ship to helicopter to aeroplane to troops marching off to God knows where, there is Senator Hill. But we could not find him a few weeks ago. He was MIAâmissing in action. Where was the $8.35 billion? It was AWOL. I allude to these military terms because that is exactly what has happened. At the moment $2 billion worth of boots, uniforms, hats and rations cannot be accounted for, $845 million worth of bombs, explosives and ammunition cannot be accounted for and, depending on which figure you choose, mine or Senator Johnston's, $1.22 billion worth of leave entitlements is owed to our military personnel and staff. How has it got to this?</para></talk.start></continue><para>We know from reports that in the last three years the minister has been castigated and taken to task by the Minister for Finance and Administration and the Treasurer about this appalling situation that has been deteriorating in the Department of Defence. What has occurred? It has got to the stage now where an outside firm, a respected accounting firm, has been brought in to try to identify the problems that the minister has presided over. As Senator Bishop said, if this were a private firm, the company directors would be sacked, the chief executive officer would be sacked, there would be a significant investigation into this and people's heads would be rolling. So we have this situation in the Department of Defence where I say that over half the money that is spent cannot be accounted for.</para><para>The reports say that we are talking about centuries-old practices that have not been changed. The Department of Defence and the minister have been alerted to this fact for the last five years, but what has the department or the government done about it? Nothing. For all we know, this major warehouse at Moorebank in Sydney may have ordnance that goes back to the Boer War. I understand in this one warehouse in Sydneyâthe largest one, at Moorebankâthere are something like 315,000 types of items stored in over half a million distinct locations. This situation has been highlighted to the government for over five years, and during the last three years the Minister for Finance and Administration and the Treasurer have been on the minister's back to fix it up. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>80</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>80</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Hill) to a question without notice asked by Senator Bartlett today relating to health conditions in Iraq.</para></motion><para>The simple fact of the matter is that there is more and more independent, wide-ranging evidence that the conditions faced by the civilian population in Iraq are, in most respects, continuing to deteriorate and worse than those faced prior to the war. It is difficult to separate out the arguments about whether we should or should not have participated in this invasion of Iraq from the arguments about what should happen now. The Democrats' position is clear and indisputable: we believe the invasion of Iraq was a serious mistake. But we need to try to separate out that argument from the present situation. Regardless of what your view is about whether or not the invasion should have happened, the fact is that it did. We have to look at what the best current approach should be rather than continue a de facto argument about a question that has already been resolvedâfor better or for worse.</para><para>The big challenge for all of us, whatever our position was originally on the war in Iraq, is to make sure that we all do whatever we can so that the situation does end up being for better and not for worse. The evidence is continuing to mount that for the Iraqi people, who were meant to be, accordingly to the government's rationale, the key beneficiaries of this invasion, the situation is for the worseâand getting worse. What is most frustrating about that is not just that it is happening but that there is a refusal on the part of this government and other governments around the world to acknowledge that basic fact because they see it as some admission of failure or of a mistake. The fact is the situation is getting worse, and we have to look at the information that is now coming to light.</para><para>The minister disputed some of the estimates of 100,000 civilian deaths since the war. Let us leave that one to one side. That was an estimate released a month or so ago. Reports released in the last day or two and detailed today by the Australian Medical Association for the Prevention of War outline the health situation facing ordinary Iraqis. Let us just look at the situation facing children and at a simple measure like malnutrition. According to studies conducted by the current Iraqi health ministry, in cooperation with Norway's Institute for Applied International Studies and the United Nations Development Program, the rate of malnutrition in young children under five has almost doubled since the invasion of Iraq, which was around 20 months ago. That equates to around 400,000 Iraqi children suffering from chronic diarrhoea, dangerous deficiencies of protein, and malnutrition. As we all should know, if that condition is maintained for any length of time it will lead to permanent damage for those children's physical and mental wellbeing and dramatically eliminate opportunities for their entire lives. We are talking about the future of Iraqâtheir children. There are hundreds and thousands of themâdouble the number than before the warâfacing serious malnutrition as a direct result of the current situation and the consequences of the invasion. Unless those sorts of basic facts are recognised then they certainly will not be able to be addressed.</para><para>We have a dramatic increase in the incidence of typhoid and other diseases such as measles and mumps. There is not enough action being taken to address those problems and the impact they are having on the children, the civilians, the families of Iraq. Until those problems are acknowledged, there will never be action taken to address them. And unless we do, there is no way that we could ever say that this terrible action that is continuing will be anything other than for the worse for the Iraqi people. Quite clearly, if it is for the worse for them, it will be for the worse for the broader world as well. We must act to address this situation now. The Democrats continue to criticise this government, and we urge them to lift the blinkers from their eyes and do far more to turn the situation around. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES</title><type>Notices</type><page.no>81</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Presentation</title><page.no>81</page.no></subdebateinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lees</inline> to move on the next day of sitting:</para><motion><para>That the Senateâ</para><para>	(a)	acknowledges the threats facing the endangered Asian elephant throughout its natural range, including live trade, human-elephant conflict and poaching for ivory tusks, hide and meat;</para><para>	(b)	notes that:</para><para>	(i)	the Asian elephant is listed as an Appendix I species under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES),</para><para>	(ii)	Appendix I species are those whose trade must be subject to particularly strict regulation, and only authorised in exceptional circumstances,</para><para>	(iii)	Australia has been a party to CITES since 1976,</para><para>	(iv)	implementation of the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Environment</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Protection</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">and</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Biodiversity</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Conservation</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Act</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">1999</inline> serves as Australia's way of meeting its international obligations as a CITES party,</para><para>	(v)	under the Act, CITES Appendix I species cannot be imported for the purpose of exhibition, and zoos must prove that they are able to meet the biological and behavioural needs of the animals if importation is for reasons such as conservation breeding,</para><para>	(vi)	Australian zoos have requested permission from the Australian Government to import nine Asian elephants from Thailand as part of a captive breeding program,</para><para>	(vii)	research undertaken by Oxford University in 2002 and supported by peers has identified that zoos are unable to meet the biological and behavioural needs of elephants in captivity, as elephants in captivity suffer from stress and boredom leading to abnormal behaviours and have a greater incidence of infant mortality and early death, and</para><para>	(viii)	the proposed captive breeding program offers no conservation benefit to the Asian elephant species as no offspring will ever be returned to the wild and elephants do not breed successfully in captivity;

The context of this urgency debate, as we all know, is that on Friday, 19 November yet another Indigenous Australian died in custody on Palm Island. The community has requested that we refer to him as Kumanjayi Doomadgee out of respect for family mourning after his death. The day after, on 20 November, another Indigenous man died in police custody in hospital at Normanton in the Gulf of Carpentaria. It is for these reasons and for the many deaths that have occurred over long years that I believe there is a growing indifference to the great Australian silence about the increasing rates of imprisonment and deaths in custody of Indigenous people and the lack of fair treatment under the criminal justice system.</para><para>I will talk more about Palm Island, but it is important to emphasise the broader context: Indigenous people are 15 times more likely to be imprisoned than anyone else in Australian society. Indeed, last year 75 per cent of deaths in custody of prisoners who were detained for no more than public order offences were Indigenous Australians. In 1991 we spent enormous amounts of money on a royal commission to address these issues and deal with the 99 deaths that had occurred in the preceding decade. Yet, despite the 339 recommendations, since that time the number of deaths has continued to increase parallel with the increasing rates of imprisonment of Indigenous people in this country. We have to do something to address this problem because the way it is being played out is unsustainable.</para><para>Most of all, recommendation 1 was that all governments at federal, state and territory levels should report annually on how they are implementing these recommendations. You might recall that on Monday I asked the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison, about this issue. He said he did not know that annual reporting on the implementation of the recommendations no longer occurs and that, in the government's massive surpluses, they cannot find the funding to properly implement and monitor a national strategy to deal with the problem of overrepresentation and deaths of Indigenous people in custody. The Commonwealth funding to report on the implementation of the recommendations ended in 1997âa decision by this governmentâand no decision was made to renew it. </para><para>In the last eight years we have seen little if any improvement in conditions in Indigenous communities and there is much unfinished business. We saw race relations boil over on numerous occasions earlier this year in Redfern and more recently on Palm Islandâthese poor relations are often reflected at the coalface between the local police and local community members. The riot on Palm Island on Friday, 26 November 2004 was a reaction to the news that an autopsy revealed that Kumanjayi Doomadgee died with four broken ribs and a punctured spleen and liver. Police statements reported by the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 22 November 2004 said: </para><quote><para>... a check on the man shortly after he was placed in the cell revealed he was asleep ... A subsequent check showed he appeared pale and had a weak pulse. Although an ambulance was called, paramedics were unable to revive him.</para></quote><para>Is it any wonder, given the circumstances of finding out about the tragic loss of life, that the community was upset? A young man, drunk and singing in the street, is detained by police for causing a public nuisance and an hour later he is dead. Two other prisoners have made statements saying that they witnessed him being beaten by a police officer, and I am told by the Palm Island Council that they have confirmed that the accused officer was removed from other Indigenous communities, namely Doomadgee and Burketown, because of similar violent incidents.</para><para>It gets worse. The Queensland government knew about the possibility of local unrest and they sent in additional police to retain law and order. Later, as we all know, a state of emergency was declared. The tactical response police were in full gearâriot shields, balaclavas, helmets with face masks, a Glock pistol at the hip and a shotgun or semiautomatic rifleâwalking the streets and arresting unarmed and unresisting Aborigines. I ask: how is it that all of us can read about Palm Island in the papers, see the pictures of children standing next to members of the riot squad, pictures comparable to those that we see on our television news daily about Iraq, and not be shocked and spurred to action? Why is it that Australians have become so indifferent to the misery of fellow Australians? How is it that we can dismiss this in such a light way? </para><para>I believe there has been a massive overreaction by the Queensland government and certainly by the local police. Comments made by Premier Beattie and the Police Union are inflammatory and sensationalist. How can we know, outside official inquiries, that excessive force was not used and why is it that the Police Union are calling for charges of attempted murder? Do they not already see that there has been a death in the community and that that person had a nameâKumanjayi Doomadgee?</para><para>While police are allegedly too frightened to return to Palm Island, it is encouraging that all Palm Island teachers have returned to the island. They are working with the children to help them deal with this horrific situation and have no fears for their safety. It seems to me we do have problems with the state of race relations in this country. For the Commonwealth government to watch over two major race riots in the space of 10 months and not see an urgent national problem beggars belief. This country has major race relations problems that are escalating under the reign of the Howard government. </para><para>It is true that the state governments also bear responsibility. Indeed, criminal matters and corrective service issues, as we all know, fall under state jurisdiction, as do health and education, but all of those institutions are failing Indigenous people right across Australia and all Australian governments are failing Indigenous people. It is not so much that the responses are slow: they are inadequate because we refuse to use the power we have in a better way, we refuse to empower Indigenous Australiansâfor example, by abolishing ATSIC, we have no idea what is going to happen with regional councils come 30 Juneâand then we play the game in a small way. You only have to ask the Palm Island Council, which has no power and no say over what happened in the Palm Island community last week. </para><para>All we hear about from the government is blame, not their own governance, their lack of leadership or lack of understanding. We hear of Indigenous people who continue to struggle with living conditions that most Australians could not imagine. Why do Australian Aborigines now have a life expectancy that is 20 years lower than the rest of the nation? Why is it that, if you were living on the streets of Nepal, Bangladesh or Vietnam, you could expect to live longer? These facts alone ought to ring alarm bells about the need for a proper response.</para><para>I ask again why Australians have become indifferent. It is because it now seems to be acceptable to blame Aboriginal people for their own circumstances. Yet, if this were happening in any other community in this country, there would be a major outcry. Is it any wonder then that Aboriginal people have this perception and belief that there is one rule for some and another rule for the rest? Many strong Indigenous people across this country are struggling with deaths in custody. They are doing so under very difficult circumstances. I highlight the fact that, while we wait for the second autopsy report, none of the 18 rioters arrested for being a public nuisance have been released on bail. They are all still locked up in Townsville, mostly because there is no local police station on Palm Island. If you were a member of the community charged with rape, robbery or something like that, so long as you had the means and your solicitor argued in your favour, you would roam free, but that is not the case for these rioters. We ought to look to the law to be more fair and equal and to be applied to these people in the way it should be applied. The Beattie government and certainly the federal government ought to show more leadership. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>94</page.no><name role="metadata">Johnston, Sen David</name><name role="display">Senator JOHNSTON</name><name.id>00AON</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMay I say in response to this motion that the Commonwealth does assume and accept a responsibility to show national leadership to reduce rates of incarceration of Aboriginal people and has delivered substantial outcomes in that regard since being elected in 1996. The government continues to be focused on this issue. Sadly, the same cannot be said for the states, particularly state Labor governments in Queensland and Western Australia. In those states there has been complete lethargy with respect to a whole host of Aboriginal matters. Deaths in custody have been approached in a half-hearted, lackadaisical manner. Indeed, broad reports dealing with Aboriginal domestic violence and child abuse in Western Australia have been approached in a very untimely fashion. These are matters of great concern to the Commonwealth government and to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, the Hon. Senator Amanda Vanstone.</para></talk.start><para>The government does not support this motion. The motion is simplistic in its response and unrealistic in terms of what is actually happening in Aboriginal communities throughout Australia. With the greatest respect to Senator Ridgeway, I ask: has he actually been to Palm Island? I have been to Palm Island, Senator. I have met with the people and I have seen the infrastructure. I have experienced the difficulties that they experience in accessing services and in their capacity to make some meaning of their lives on Palm Island. I was there last year in October observing the work being carried out there by the Australian Army engineering corps.</para><para>Palm Island, as many in this chamber would know, is some 65 kilometres north-east of Townsville. It is home to approximately 3,000 Aboriginal residents. The Palm group of islands is the traditional country of the Manbarra and the Bwgcolman people. The settlement was established in 1918 to replace the Hull River Mission near Tully in north-east Queensland. There are 40 distinct clan groupings on this island, so it is a grouping of disparate, dispossessed people. That is one of the roots of the problem on Palm Island. </para><para>I was there observing the performance of the Australian Army. They had constructed some 20 new homes and assisted in repairing the hospital and the roads, including the airport access road. It had been a most successful program. They had spent some $10 million making a substantial contribution to the lives of the people and their ability to gain employment. I saw the 20 purpose-built homes and I met the people who were going to live in them. I saw the upgrade and repair of the island's water treatment plant. I saw the upgrade, repair and installation of adequate drainage to Wallaby Point and Butler Bay; the provision of ablution facilities at the youth centre and the sports centre; the repair and upgrade of the access road; the beautification and installation of pathways at the children's playground adjacent to the main town site; and the refurbishment of the island's aged care facilities. Over 140 patients were being treated by the Royal Australian Navy dental team when I was there. I sat down with these people and I asked them: what is the principal overriding concern of people living on Palm Island? Their answer was, as one, very simple: `We do not have a job. We are looking for employment. We are desperate to find a meaningful job so that we can support our families.'</para><para>The fact is the Queensland government has been sitting on its hands with Palm Island for far too long and this problem has been waiting to happen. I call upon the Premier of that state to conduct a meaningful inquiry that these people can relate to with respect to the death of the man in question. When you have 40 disparate tribal groups dispossessed and placed on an island for as long as they have been, and who are utterly dependent upon welfare, this is the nub of the problem. They have got no self-esteem, no motivation and no desire to branch out and do anything meaningful given the dependency that they have been subjected to for such a long time. I call upon the Queensland government to not simply say that this is a matter of law and order; it is not. It is a much deeper problem, one which it, sadly, has been neglectful of. These people, as I say, are very keen to find jobs.</para><para>In many of the Army projects, the attendance record of the 40-odd Palm Islanders who were training and acquiring proper TAFE certificates was invariably 100 per cent. That sends the clear message to me as an observer that these people are wanting to get on with their lives and do something purposeful, and they cannot. The island has very limited opportunities. There are a host of proposalsâindeed, I put some ideas in the minds of the ATSIC people who provide services to that island. Nothing much has happened, obviously, and it is of great concern to me.</para><para>I am convinced that, with a very small amount of lateral thinking and effort on the part of the Queensland government, things can be changed on Palm Island, but there needs to be some political will. I observed both in native title in Queensland and on Palm Island no political will whatsoever from the Queensland government to engage these people and put them on the right path. It has been left to the Commonwealth government through this plan and AACAP for the Australian Army to go there with the Navy to attempt to provide some form of assistance and support to these people.</para><para>I come back to the wider problem, and this motion talks of race riots in Redfern and on Palm Island. On my part, the beginning point to addressing Aboriginal issues is compassion. We must have compassion for Aboriginal and Indigenous people in this country, but it is not a one-way street. There must be a reciprocal discipline disclosed in each community in each part of Aboriginal culture that says, `We are unhappy about spending the rest of our days utterly dependent upon government handouts.' </para><para>I celebrate Noel Pearson's and so many of his fellow travellers' attitude to that in this area. It is time. The minister, to her great credit, has bitten the bullet and said, `If you do not send your kids to school, you will not go to the swimming pool. If you do not get a uniform and if you do not participate and enrol your children in education and start assuming some responsibility then there will be no government support.' This, I must say, is long overdue. Senator Ridgeway, I share many of your sentiments with respect to what has happened on Palm Islandâbe in no doubt, I share themâbut it is not a one-way street and some responsibility and leadershipâthat good old wordâas you have enunciated today, has to come forward.</para><para>The dependency and the frustration that flows from that requires leadership from Aboriginal people. `Self-determination' has simply been a euphemism for the strongest dominating the weakest in Aboriginal communities. The levels of domestic violence, criminal violence and unemployment in Aboriginal communities are unrivalled and unparalleled around Australia. When we say that in order to receive government largess you have to get up off the ground and do something to earn it, you have to work for the dole, so many people are up in arms saying `This is not right.' Let me tell you, Mr Acting Deputy President, it is right. The government has come to the conclusion that the ATSIC fantasy of spending money and living high on the hog while the people at the bottom of the ladder get nothing is coming to an end. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>96</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe opposition will be supporting this timely urgency motion moved by Senator Ridgeway, and I take this opportunity to congratulate him on the speech that he has just given. I am particularly concerned that it is necessary for this chamber to actually bring forward a motion of this type, effectively condemning the government for its failure of leadership on the issue of deaths in custody and, of course, on the broader question of its failure to implement the recommendations of the royal commission on the same matter.</para></talk.start><para>I am frankly appalled by the death of Kumanjayi Doomadgee. According to the newspaper reports that I have read, Mr Doomadgee suffered several broken ribs and a ruptured liver and spleen as a result of attacks on him while he was in police custody. He was left alone, quite contrary to all police procedures and what we understand to be public knowledge of these matters. He died in police custody in circumstances which can clearly only be described as shameful and shocking, and yet we have been told that this was a relatively minor matter and that the actions of the police were entirely appropriate. As far as I am concerned, I welcome the statement by the Queensland Premier that there will be a rigorous and immediate inquiry into the actions of the police in this matter. Frankly, there ought to be.</para><para>The issue of Aboriginal deaths in custody was a matter of major public debate at the time of the royal commission back in 1991. The number of Indigenous people that were being incarcerated and the number of people dying in custody was generally acknowledged as a matter of great shame to this nation as a whole. However, since the election of this government we have seen a deliberate policy by this government to try to remove this issue from public debate and from public consciousness. In fact, the government sees its role in leadership as one of removing the question of reconciliation from the national consciousness. If it was a disgrace 10 years ago, it is a disgrace now to have so many Indigenous people being incarcerated and to have so many people dying while in custody. The truth of the matter is that Indigenous deaths in police custody in 2003 stood at 1.9 per 100,000. For other Australians, the figure was 0.1 per 100,000. It is quite clear that in many areas of public policy the treatment of Indigenous people is so completely different from the treatment of other Australians. </para><para>In 2001, Dr Bill Jonas, who was then Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner at HREOC, spoke publicly about the sorry situation that we find ourselves in. He also spoke of the underlying causes of that situation. I am sure that when you hear a few of the remarks that Dr Jonas made you will not be surprised to hear that Dr Jonas is no longer in the position of social justice commissioner. Dr Jonas said in 2001 that the year 2001 marked the 10th anniversary of the final report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and that also recently commemorated was the 10th anniversary of the Mabo decision, which `rejected terra nullius and recognised the continued existence of native title. It is also the fifth anniversary of the <inline font-style="italic">Bringing them home</inline> report'. He also said that Indigenous affairs seems to have become a series of anniversaries, operating as an annual reminder of the unfulfilled promises and commitments of governments.</para><para>Dr Jonas acknowledged that there have been some genuine efforts made on the part of some governmentsâand I would include the Queensland government in thisâto address this issue and its underlying causes. But he said that, 10 years on, there seems to be hardly a `murmur of discontent, let alone outrage among the community about the situation'. Dr Jonas points out the Howard government's failure to commit to a genuine and explicit process of reconciliation as crucial to this situation and to the appalling living conditions faced by so many of Australia's Indigenous people.</para><para>This is a country where Indigenous people have the worst health outcomes of any people in many of the world's poorest countries. We have the world's highest rate of trachoma. We are, of course, the only developed country where blinding trachoma remains. Other countries where trachoma is prevalent include Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Iraq and Vietnam. Death rates of Indigenous Australians from cardiovascular disease are five times higher than for others within our community.</para><para>Dr Jonas said in 2001 that the Howard government's `practical reconciliation' approach was flawed and doomed to failure. He said:</para><quote><para>The impoverished notion of practical reconciliation will not in and of itself lead to meaningful reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples. It is simply not enough to assert that what is needed is for Indigenous people to assimilate to mainstream society or that reconciliation will be the product of a country that is relaxed and comfortable with itself. </para></quote><para>We know that this government has now gone further and is seeking to force behavioural change on Indigenous people in return for basic services and financial support that are their right as citizens. We have just heard a senator from the government side talk about `government largesse' in return for these changes in behaviour. There seems to be a presumption on the government side that shared responsibility policies mean that only some people will be able to access government largesse when we would regard that access as a basic right and entitlement. A fundamental change is being proposed by this government in a most paternalistic and authoritarian manner. </para><para>The government policies we have seen have not resulted in much improvement in any of the social indicators. That simply is the case. In the case of Palm Island, the Queensland government may well be criticised for not acting quickly or decisively enough to improve the conditions of the people on Palm Island. However, the Queensland government has taken quite extensive steps and has developed far-reaching plans. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Justice Agreement, signed between Indigenous leaders and the state government in 2000, is central to this process. A progress report on the agreement notes with regret, however, that it will take many years to achieve a significant reduction in Indigenous incarceration rates. It goes on to say:</para><quote><para>Importantly ... a long-term reduction in over-representationâ </para></quote><para>of Indigenous imprisonmentâ</para><quote><para>cannot be achieved without also addressing the underlying social, cultural and economic issues that contribute to this over-representation.</para></quote><para>It is a pity that this government does not understand that basic principle. The nub of the issue is as simple as this: until the economic and related circumstances of Indigenous people in this country are significantly improved there will be no improvement in their lives and overall wellbeing. As a nation, as governments, we have to face the challenge squarely and work in genuine partnership with Indigenous communities and their leaders. We have to be able to provide opportunities that create employment. We have to build industries in local communities. We have to provide meaningful and appropriate training opportunities. We have to lift our performance in delivering education to Indigenous communities.</para><para>Specifically on Palm Island we certainly have to implement an alcohol management strategy, but we also need an economic management strategy. Alongside employment in industries like tourism, aquaculture and service delivery, we need an economic plan for local government on the island. This plan must ensure that local councils do not have to have an undue reliance on alcohol sales to maintain an independent source of income. One of the deepest core problems on the island is its local government's economic dependence, and that has to be addressed squarely by all governments concerned. That is the collective responsibility of all Australians. It is the role of the Commonwealth government to show leadership and to put in place policies of its own that will increase the economic independence and self-reliance of Indigenous citizens. As Bill Jonas said, practical reconciliation is an `impoverished notion'. It has contributed substantially to the continued and worsening impoverishment of Indigenous people in this country. The opposition supports the motion and calls on the government to do likewise. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>98</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Greens support the urgency motion moved by Senator Ridgeway. The ongoing tragedy of Indigenous deaths in custody is compounded by this government's refusal to take action to reduce the entirely unacceptable rates of Indigenous incarceration and disadvantage. Indigenous people are imprisoned at between 15 and 16 times the rate of non-Indigenous Australians. In 1991 the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody identified the massive overrepresentation of Indigenous people in our prisons as a key factor in the disproportionate number of Indigenous Australians who die in custody. It is wholly unacceptable that, while Indigenous people represent only two per cent of the total Australian population, in the 13 years since the royal commission the Indigenous proportion of our prison population has risen from around 14 per cent to 20 per cent.  </para></talk.start><para>Since the royal commission, the greatest relative increase in incarceration has been for Indigenous women. The Indigenous female prison population increased by 262 per cent between 1991 and 1999. In June 2003, Indigenous women were incarcerated at a rate 19.3 times that of non-Indigenous women. Indigenous women were 24.4 per cent of women prisoners in 1991 and 32.8 per cent in 2003. The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody identified many causes for this overrepresentation, including past colonial practices of government, inappropriate police behaviour, the criminalisation of public order offences, socioeconomic factors including poverty and high unemployment, and a focus on law and order rather than the more modern and appropriate approach of community policing. </para><para>The Greens fully support the implementation of all the 339 recommendations of the Aboriginal deaths in custody royal commission. We must seek to massively reduce rates of Indigenous incarceration if we are serious about eliminating Aboriginal deaths in custody. This is essential if we are to prevent the sorts of events we have seen recently in Palm Island and Redfern. But we must go further than this: we must address the disadvantage, the poverty and the appalling health, employment and housing conditions that plague Indigenous communities across the country. We must address this disadvantage by recognising a history of injustice and neglect that generations of Indigenous Australians have suffered at the hands of white Australians and white governments. We must also support Indigenous self-determination and Indigenous representation at all levels of decision making in the community and in the national parliament rather than abolish the only national elected Indigenous voice. </para><para>It is heartening to see that, where the government has failed to respond to engage with reconciliation, land rights issues, a treaty or an apology to the stolen generation, the community has taken up these issues wholeheartedly. I hope to join Michael Long tomorrow, as he walks into Canberra on his long walk, to show the support of the Greens for the Indigenous issues he is raising. I hope other senators and MPs will join him in that walk tomorrow morning. We have seen this sort of supportâfor Michael and for the people of Palm Island and the Redfern communityâcoming from the community, but we often fail to see it coming from government.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>99</page.no><name role="metadata">Scullion, Sen Nigel</name><name role="display">Senator SCULLION</name><name.id>00AOM</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>CLP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âFirst of all I would like to thank Senator Ridgeway for this urgency motion. I know that he has brought this motion forward to encourage debate on a matter that he is very passionate about, and I commend him for his continued leadership in this area. It is unfortunate, though, I have to say, that I am unable to support the motion. The reason is that the premise on which this motion is brought is that the government has failed to provide any leadership on these issues. Because that is false, I simply cannot accept it and for that reason I cannot accept the motion.</para></talk.start><para>It is without doubt that the circumstances in which Aboriginal people find themselves, as has been well articulated in this place and is well known to the public, are of concern to every Australian, including the fact that Aborigines live on average 20 years less than mainstream Australia. We heard today in this place the shocking statistic that an Aboriginal woman has 11 times the chance of being murdered than any other Australian. I share with the senator, and I am sure with all Australians, my shock and horror at the circumstances recently in Palm Island with the death of Kumanjayi Doomadgee and with the subsequent burning, riots, violence and horror that everybody in that community must have felt. </para><para>As I said, I cannot support the motion because since it has been elected this government has been committed to improving the lot of Indigenous Australians. We have recognised that their lot is not the same as other Australians. I will cite the reasons I feel thisâit is not just a view; it is actually a fact. You can look at any of the indicators across a broad range of areas. There has been an increase of 22 per cent in employment, 25,000 extra people have access to accredited training and new apprenticeships have risen by more than 50 per cent. In the area of health, Aboriginal deaths from respiratory illnesses are still four times the rate for other Australians, but they have been reduced by half, so we are heading in the right direction. I accept that that is not quick enough, and that is why we are here today. Ten per cent of kids are staying at school. That needs to be higher, but it is improving. Well over 10,000 more homes are now owned or are being purchased by Indigenous people since we came to government. Sixteen per cent of the Australian continent is now owned and controlled by Indigenous people. That leads to a great change in how people feel about themselves, particularly with regard to their connection to the land. Aboriginal deaths in custody have been reduced by 50 per cent.</para><para>With those statistics we could say that the situation is better. My government accepts that it is still not good enough. We could claim that some $2.9 billion has been spent on Indigenous affairs and looking after the benefit of one particular aspect of Australians, but it really means nothing unless we look at the way we spend it. This government's vision to ensure that Indigenous Australians share equitably in opportunities, in both an economic and a social sense, has to be underwritten by a change in the way we do things.</para><para>There is a bit of a saying that the definition of lunacy is to keep doing the same thing and expect a different outcome. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed with Senator Carr saying, `Look, you guys over there, you can't possibly be patronising, you can't possibly come up with dramatic, draconian answers; just potter along doing the same thing and no-one will notice.' The message to Senator Carr is that, if you do that, nothing will change, and this government is absolutely determined to change the lot of Indigenous people.</para><para>We have had so much criticism over the abolition of ATSIC. Let me tell you: as part of a committee I travelled around this country and the only people who gave evidence to me were people who either were directly employed or had a direct association with that organisation. In the communities, from the people who are receiving those services, there was overwhelming silence with regard to ATSIC disappearing. Most of the people I talked to in those communities were very much looking forward to ensuring that the arrangements that are put in place after ATSIC are of great benefit to them.</para><para>I also heard in Senator Carr's dissertation some reference to the processes of the regional councils going by the by. The very first task that we gave the regional councils was to ensure that the consultative processes to be put in place to follow them were put in place by them, with recommendations. The principal changes we have now put in place are not necessarily about houses and infrastructure; they are about the process. We have brought about a structure that now contains the most powerful people in Australia. We have brought together the minds of people and said, `We need to look very carefully at what we're not doing right and how we can change this.' All the ministers across government who have anything to do with program delivery in Indigenous affairs now make up the ministerial task force, and the secretaries and the CEOs at those very high levels make up the secretariat group that supports them. </para><para>We also now have the National Indigenous Council, which is going to be able to give us advice. Those are people who have some experience with program delivery in a lot of the social and economic outcomes we are talking about. It is very sad that the National Indigenous Council is already being debunked by all these people who know so much better than those fine Aboriginal people who now make up that body. Many of them have been shamed by people saying, `No, you can't make a contribution; you can't be part of the solution.' I think that is an absolute outrage.</para><para>In the Northern Territory, as a part of this process we have had the COAG trials, which have trialled a new way of doing business. We are making sure that we are improving the lot of Indigenous people on the ground, because we know the close association between the levels of disadvantage and the number of people who are appearing before the courts. That is the issue that we are talking about today. I am very proud of this government's record in ensuring that we make those changes. I think at the moment that we are ready for the next step forward in ensuring that we change the processes to actually deliver some improvements to the lot of Aboriginal people.</para><para>There was reference to the reporting process. I know that in 1997 the reporting process of Indigenous deaths in custody changed and were no longer adhered to, but it is not right to say that this government did nothing then. In 1997 we held a ministerial summit into Indigenous deaths in custody. We knew that the best delivery was a partnership deliveryâthat is the way of this governmentâand we have ensured now that every state and territory has some sort of a partnership, either an Aboriginal justice strategy or some sort of Aboriginal justice amelioration challenge. That is what we did. We did not just stop writing it down. I do not think there would be many Indigenous deaths in custody that this nation does not know about and is not concerned about. I repeat: I thank the senator for his motion and I know it continues his leadership role on this issue, but I cannot support the motion on the basis that it is crafted on an incorrect premise.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>101</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThis is a very important motion, and I congratulate my colleague Senator Ridgeway on bringing it forward. It is important that we debate in this place the status of Aboriginal deaths in custody and the best way forward. I was disappointed by Senator Scullion's contribution that the government cannot support this motion, because this motion calls only for: </para></talk.start><quote><para>... annual reporting by State, Territory and Federal governments on the implementation of the recommendations of the Royal Commission.</para></quote><para>What is wrong with that? What is wrong with acknowledging it is a Commonwealth responsibility to coordinate these areas, report annually and make sure that this issue is not lost and just swept under the carpet?</para><para>As a senator for Queensland, I have been deeply disturbed by the events on Palm Island. Queensland has had a very poor record on race relations for many years, and it seems old lessons are dying very hard. Premier Beattie keeps telling the people of Palm Island to wait for the Crime and Misconduct Commission investigation and to `show some leadership'. Yet the Premier and the police commissioner have prejudged the inquiry by declaring the police innocent of any wrongdoing, even before any witnesses are interviewed.  </para><para>Mr Doomadgee died of intra-abdominal haemorrhage caused by a ruptured liver and portal vein after being taken into police custodyâbut the Queensland government is yet to treat the death as a death in custody. While the Aboriginals involved with the subsequent riot have been arrested and incarcerated, the police involved with this death in custody are yet to be suspended. Sympathy or understanding for the family and the community have been absent. I do not condone violence but, in the face of such governmental and official indifference, I can understand why the community of Palm Island has erupted. As Madonna King in yesterday's <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail </inline>said:</para><quote><para>The way the Beattie Government and Police Commissioner Bob Atkinson have handled the riot, prompted by the death in police custody, raises many questions. And, unless those questions are answered fully and openly, the same suspicion that fuelled the fury and the rage that led to last week's riot will continue to grow.</para></quote><para>I visited Palm Island some three months ago and met with local councillors, teachers and the CDEP program organisers. There is some very positive, very constructive work being done on the island to build a vibrant, positive community, yet they face many serious problems. The community want to achieve more, and they want the government to work with them to do so. But reverting to the age-old race relations tactic of blaming victims will do no good.</para><para>I wish to extend my sympathies to the family of Mr Doomadgee and to the community of Palm Island. I wish to call on the Queensland police and the government to show due respect to the family's grief in the lead-up to the funeral and to treat with full seriousness this death as an Aboriginal death in custody. Finally, I seek leave to incorporate into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> an open letter from Mayor Erykah Kyle of the Palm Island Aboriginal Council to the Premier, which was released on Sundayâan eloquent plea to the government, the community and the media for better understanding of the circumstances of this dreadful incident.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The document read as followsâ</inline></para><quote><para>Sunday 28 November 2004</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Open Letter from Palm Island Aboriginal Council to the Premier</inline></para></quote><para>	This letter was presented to the Premier and other recipients at the Palm Island Council today.</para><para>	cc Aboriginal &amp; Torres Strait Islander Policy Minister Liddy Clark, Police Minister Judy Spence, Police Commissioner Bob Atkinson &amp; Media</para><quote><para>Dear Mr Beattie</para><para>The Palm Island Aboriginal Council, with the support of the Aboriginal Local Government Association of Queensland, would like to express their deep disappointment at the criticisms which have been levelled at our Councillors and community over the past 24 hours.</para><para>As you may be aware the Council has sent a response to your statement, `Premier calls for Palm Island Council to show leadership', to the media late yesterday.</para><para>The Council has been frustrated you have not seen fit to communicate with us directly on these matters before now.</para><para>Our hands have been tied for these past few days by the `State of Emergency' imposed upon us and our people are feeling under siege after seeing the variousâand some incorrectly reportedâmedia items yesterday on radio, television and print news.</para><para>A man has died in police custody. Our people are angry. We are all affected by this, including our Council members.</para><para>The following issues need to be resolved immediately:</para><para>1. The removal of these services from the island has been extreme and unnecessary.</para><para>There has been a mass exodus of services from the island. Of immediate concern is the lack of medical staff at the hospital. Negotiations to re-staff and restore full medical services to the island are of utmost priority. </para><para>For reasons it is difficult to understand teachers from our schools have also been evacuated from the island and we are concerned that our children will miss schooling as a result of this evacuation. What arrangements will be put in place to cater for our children between now and the end of the school year?</para><para>No fresh bread or milk has been delivered to the island since Friday morning which has been of great concern to parents on the islandâwhen will these deliveries be restored?</para><para>2. The police have been more than heavy-handed in their dealings with the community and community people, including our children, are feeling terrorised. The heavily armed presence of 80 police is not necessary at this time and those extra police should leave the island as soon as possible so real order can be restored by the Council and the people they serve.</para><para>To date 13 people, including a minor, have been removed from the island and taken into police custody. Late last night three of those people were on suicide prevention watch. Yesterday the police systematically raided the homes of those they believe to be suspect over yesterday's eventsâwe have had many reports of both children and old people being unnecessarily frightened and mistreated by the police while these raids have taken place.</para><para>We have had one report of a man who already had a broken bone being thrown to the ground in front of children and stomped on by police officersâthis is terrorising our community people. Council has also had reports that Task Force officers are `running the streets' in full armoured uniform including balaclavas, and fully armed in some areas of our community. The island is otherwise calm, and has been for the past 24 hours, other than where these raids have taken place. The raids are scaring our people and adding to feelings of fear and uncertainty.</para><para>At no time have these heavily armed and numerous police ever had need to `fear for their lives', as reported by one media outlet. Police Commissioner Bob Atkinson should clarify and retract his statements to the contrary as soon as possible.</para><para>Despite the numbers of police currently on the island, the police have drawn Council's attention to a weapon missing from the police station and asked the Council to investigate this matter themselves. The only description they have offered is that the missing weapon is `high powered'. No explanation has been offered as to how or why this weapon was able to be removed from the police station by a member of our community.</para><para>The Council would like a guarantee there will be no police presence, or evidence of a police presence, at the funeral service of the young man who died when it occurs.</para><para>3. Alcohol has not played a role in any of the events of the past three days after the Palm Island Canteen was closed by the Palm Island Council on Tuesday. Statements by the Police Minister to the contrary should be retracted.</para><para>4. The declared State of Emergency has prevented our Council from taking up a leadership role.</para><para>Three members of our Council have not been able to return to the island as a result of the State of Emergency declared on the island. Council also understands more than 50 people were left stranded in Townsville on Friday evening after ferry services to the island were unnecessarily suspended and further concern has been caused by the inability of people to either get to or leave the island since then. When will our normal transportation services be resumed and what compensation will the government offer the innocent people who were affected by the suspension?</para><para>why were the police told to evacuate all white people and `any decent blacks' from the island?</para><para>The current status of the State of Emergency has not been communicated to the Councilâno officer in charge has been identified and no certificate, as per the Public Safety Preservation Act (1986), has been issued.</para><para>5. The inability of Council to communicate directly with yourselves and/or the people able to make decisions about the issues outlined here has prevented us from taking on the leadership role you have accused us of lacking.</para><para>There were published (Townsville Bulletin, 23 Nov) calls for police and government representatives to come to the island to allay the concerns of our community about the death in custody as early as Tuesday this week which were ignored. Had the government heeded these calls and accepted the leadership of those who made these calls the events of later in the week would have been averted. </para><para>In regards to the bigger issuesâthe reasons for these current eventsâCouncil would like to make the following statements:</para><para>1. The young man this community has lost was know to be reliable and jovial, although generally of a quietly spoken and calm disposition. This young man was a hunter for the community and had never been in trouble with the law or the community. He was a fine example for our young people and admired for his character by our elders. His loss will be felt keenly by many of our people, particularly his family. Our people feel strongly that a grave injustice has occurred.</para><para>2. Deaths in Custody have been an issue in all our communities for many yearsâtwo deaths have occurred on DOGIT communities in the past two years and the systems in place for preventing these preventable deaths are inadequate. For 13 years there have been 297 recommendations for preventing deaths in custody, not nearly enough of them have been implemented.</para><para>Regardless of the causes of those injuries to the young man it is inexcusable that he was left unattended in the watch house until it was too lateâthe government and the police must accept blame for the current situation.</para><para>The Palm Island Council and community and all the Aboriginal people of Queensland call on the government yet again to re-visit the recommendations and implement all of them as soon as possible so the events of the past week never happen again.</para><para>3. Council has received reports that this is not the first time Police Sergeant Chris Hurley has had to be removed from a community because a similar series of incidents. If this is the case Council would like to know why Officer Hurley was re-assigned to another Aboriginal community without consideration.</para><para>3. There were no deaths or injuries as a result of events on Friday.</para><para>4. The Council is in no way to blame for the events of the past week.</para><para>In terms of a way forward Council would like to state that the people who make the decisions need to be coordinating with the Council to put processes in place to resolve these issues.</para><para>The way forward over the coming weeks and months will be difficult. Trust has been broken and needs to be restored. The people of Palm Island must be able to live in peace and with confidence there will be never be a repeat of the events of past week.</para><para>The way the government and authorities deal with the Council and the community in future should be respectful and on equal terms so all parties are able to take on their appropriate responsibilities with all lines of communication remaining open regardless of circumstance.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Erykah Kyle</inline></para><para>Palm Island Mayor</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Vince Mundraby</inline></para><para>Interim President</para><para>Aboriginal Local Government Association of Qld</para></quote></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>104</page.no><name role="metadata">Moore, Sen Claire</name><name role="display">Senator MOORE</name><name.id>00AOQ</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI also wish to thank Senator Ridgeway for putting this very important issue back on our agendaâand I say `back on the agenda' because these issues have come again to our Parliament House. Once again, the issues of Indigenous disadvantageâand, in particular, the high number of Indigenous people who are caught up in the justice system and, in many cases, the lack of justice systemâhave been brought to this place based on a personal crisis. This issue probably would not have come back in this way to this chamber if there had not been the horrific incidents on Palm Island in Queensland.</para></talk.start><para>Again we are gathered around to talk about issues and again there is so much agreement. I keep saying that in this place. There is so much agreement on what should and could be done, but this motion is trying to achieve more than wordsâsome genuine action. When the original Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody report was brought downâthe entire five volumes and 339 recommendationsâmany people read it because it was a threshold document in Australian history. At the time, there were numerous statements made about what was going to happen in the future and how the crisis of the number of Indigenous people who had been killed in custody brought forward the royal commission. After that, we went into a process which was supposed to include all levels of governmentânot one level or the other, because increasingly what seems to happen when we have these important and very personal issues before us is that it turns into a `pass the issue' game. Whose responsibility is it? It is the states'; it is the federal government's. It does not belong to any single level; it belongs to all of us. Until that lesson is learnt, these debates will continue. There has already been a great amount of work and so many words on this issue. </para><para>In the 1997 conference to which Senator Scullion referred, the National Ministerial Summit on Deaths in Custodyâa one-off meetingâthere was an expectation of some people that that review would continue and that it would continue to look at the real issues and the people. We have heard the stats. These issues consistently degenerate into an argument about statistics. Numbers are thrown around and what we end up with is a fight. That is not what we want. We want to have some commitment to action. In 1997 the National Ministerial Summit on Deaths in Custody had all the relevant ministers at the Commonwealth, state and territory levelâexcept, at that stage, the Northern Territory. A good thing that has occurred is that, if there are any future actions, the Northern Territory will be there. Ministers made a wonderful statementâwe make lots of wonderful statementsâand they said they:</para><quote><para>(a) agree that the primary issue of concern is the significant over-representation of Indigenous people at all stages of the criminal justice system ...</para></quote><para>	...	...	...</para><quote><para>(c) acknowledge that addressing the underlying issues is fundamental to the achievement of any real, long-term solutions to the issue of Indigenous incarceration and deaths in custody; and</para><para> (d) recognize that it will take the combined effort of Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments and Indigenous peoples and the wider community to effectively address Indigenous over-representation.</para></quote><para>We all agreed, we all felt good and we all went homeâand the problems continued.</para><para>The ministers went on and resolvedâalso something that we can all agree toâto address the overrepresentation of Indigenous people in the criminal justice system in partnership with Indigenous people. They also resolved:</para><quote><para>... to `develop strategic plans for the coordination of Commonwealth, State and Territory funding and service delivery for Indigenous programs and services, including working towards the development of multi-lateral agreements between Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments and Indigenous peoples and organizations ...</para></quote><para>The statement then referred to all the things that could be brought together in this process. Once again, we all agreed. We have been saying the same things this afternoon about what should happen, about having partnerships and about setting up plans. </para><para>But, even in 1997, the then social justice commissioner and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commissioner, who were at the summit because they are Indigenous people, refused to be signatory to that wonderful resolution. People questioned why they would not sign up. The reason they did not sign up in 1997 was that they were `concerned that the summit outcomes unfortunately replicate the vague, generalised approaches of the past, which have been marked by refusal to commit to achieving specific, measurable outcomes within specific time frames'. </para><para>In 2004 that sends us a really clear message. What more does Senator Ridgeway's motion want? We have the agreement. We want exactly what the Indigenous people were asking for then. We have the theory, we have the goodwillâthey are there. We want some clear action. It is important that leadership is shown, and it is important that the levels of government, particularly at the state and federal level, will accept that it is not some kind of contest. It is more important than scoring political points; it is about people's lives. In this case, as we have all agreed through volumes of statistics, they are people who suffer significant disadvantage. No-one questions that. What we seem to question is how we will address it.</para><para>In terms of the roles of the different levels of government, we need to have some understanding that Indigenous people must have a voice in the process. I was pleased to hear Minister Vanstone's response in question time this afternoon. She acknowledged that there have been `decades and decades of disadvantage', and that it is not good enough to `replace one set of representative structure with another'. There is no disagreement with that. We want to know how it will work and what will be done. Standing up in this place quoting stats, talking about how much money went where and how many houses have been built does not address the problem. We know where there has been some advance. But we also see the tragedy that occurs in places like Palm Island. The basic reason for that is that we have not achieved any trust. There is no trust and no hope amongst some of those communities. For me, that is certainly the overwhelming tragedy of Palm Island. </para><para>In an area where there has been state, federal and local government involvement, we still have simmering anger and an overwhelming lack of trust. When the tragedy of a loss of life occurredâand no-one can disagree that it was a tragedyâthe response was so violent and so overwhelming. It is a good thing that Premier Beattie went to Palm Island, and I am pleased that there is a five-point plan. I am fascinated, though, how that five-point plan will be entrenched in the communityânot imposed and no more rules put on people. I hear about the kinds of programs that seemingly are going to engage Indigenous people, by telling them, `No school, no pool.' That is so sad. It is also without any future. Communities have every right to make the decisions. But to have that kind of simplistic program imposed on top does not address the key issue. We need to put these great words into practice. The way to do that is certainly not by talking at Indigenous people. We need to have the voices of Indigenous people heard. We always seem to trip up over that bit. </para><para>With this process, there needs to be some genuine action, some cross-government cooperation and also, as Senator Ridgeway has asked for, some regular review. We do not want glossy little leaflets talking about who has visited where and what photographic opportunity has occurred. We need to have some understanding of what real change has been planned and have that measured. It may come down to some communities wanting a process that links their welfare payments or their entitlements. It is not largesse; it is an entitlement as a citizen of this country to a payment that any of us could get if we were in the same circumstances. If there is a decision that is agreed at the local level to implement some of those programs, so be it. But to have some centralised group determine that one set of rules will apply to one group of the communityâone group that we have already agreed at every level suffers from extreme disadvantageâjust continues the pain and the tragedy. If there is going to be a positive outcome out of the tragedy of Palm Island, let it be that we can achieve some genuine change. Let us not have more pages of high-sounding rhetoric. Let us see what genuine changes can be made and maybe then the five-point plan can have a five-point result. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>107</page.no><name role="metadata">Heffernan, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator HEFFERNAN</name><name.id>C16</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThank you, Aden, for your motion today. I do not know why we do not have reportingâwhich is referred to in the latter part of your motionâbut I bloody well intend to find out. I guess the danger might be that it is just another bureaucratic process that produces no outcomes. I rang Michael Long today. He was walking through Yass. There was a cool change. He said he had sore feet, but the weather had cooled down. He is to meet the Prime Minister on Friday morning. I said, `Why don't you come up to parliament tomorrow afternoon?' I have invited him up here tomorrow afternoon to meet a lot of people who are very sincere and committed to making things better for our Indigenous people.</para></talk.start><para>I think there is a lot of goodwill in Australia, but I am sick of all the political rhetoric and a lot of the garbage that comes through this place at times in terms of long-winded speeches when it is only these walls that are listening. I do not think national days of recognition are the solution to any of this. Could someone explain to me how national days of recognition for our kids have done anything to solve the plight of 1Â½ million kids in South-East Asia and a million kids in South America who are tourism products for sex? Good-o, we will have a national day of recognition; it does not do much for them. On the night of the day people walked over the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Margaret Valadian posed the question: now that the Western Australian government has apologised, how are the Indigenous people of Western Australia any better off? It is not a bad question. We have got to give our Indigenous people education. If we give them education, we can get some health outcomes through employment. We have got to give our Indigenous people a reason to get out of bed in the morning. </para><para>I would like to tell a little story. I went to Redfern a couple of years ago and there had been a drug raid there. I pulled up in my car and the mob said, `Gee, mate, don't leave your car there. It'll get knocked off or turned over.' I said, `No, I've just come out here to say g'day to the mob.' When I had finished with Mick Mundine and one or two others, I came out to the car and there was a bloke sitting in the gutter opposite my car. I got in the car and I thought, `I'll go and say g'day to him.' I got out of the car, went over and said to him, `How are you, mate? What are you doing?' He said, `I'm just sitting here.' I said, `What do you do?' He said, `Every day I just come and sit here.' He thought I was a policeman. Anyhow, I said, `Where've you been?' He said, `I've been in jail.' I said, `What were you in jail for? Did you stick someone up?' He said, `I did.' I said, `Were you hungry and short of money?' He said, `I was, so I stuck someone up.' I said, `Why didn't you go and fill out a form and get the dole?' He said, `I can't read or write.' I said, `Mate, do you want a job?' He said, `Mate, I'd love a job.' So I went about that process. I will not bore you with the rest of it.</para><para>Go out to Yuendumu and you will see that there are 450 kids at Yuendumu who should be going to school. The last time I was there I think 100-odd of them were going to school. What hope have they got? Half the adult population, who have got no reason to get out of bed in the morning, entertain themselves all night and sleep all day. The kids do not get tucker before they go to school and no-one gets the kids to school. What hope have these kids got? If you go out to Mount Theo, you will see that these are distressing times for our Indigenous people. It does not matter how many speeches we make in this place; it is not going to make any difference. We have got to actually get things done. Things are being done, and positions have improved, but I do not think this should become a political contest of ideas. I think it should become a contest of goodwill. </para><para>For all sorts of reasons I think Michael Long is a really good example of triggering a new horizon. I think Michael Long ought to join the National Indigenous Council. There are a lot of good people with a lot of goodwill on that council. There are lots of people who say it is just a waste of time because we do not know how it is going to operate. There is now an inquiry in this Senate which has got an inevitable outcome because ATSIC is being closed down. I would appeal to Michael Long to become part of the brains trust. Michael Long is a person who is a doer. He has improved his lot in life, he has taken advantage of the will to improve his position and he is a shining example of what you can do. If I were a little kid out at Yuendumu who got up in the morning and Mum and Dad were not there, and it was time to go to school, and there was no lunch, and things were tough, and I turned on the telly and saw Michael Long, I reckon I would be interested.</para><para>While I commend the intent behind today's motion, Aden, and I think you are doing a good job by putting it before the Senate, I am not too sure that that bloke sitting in the gutter in Redfern would get any benefit out of anything we say here today, because he has no education. Redfern has been destroyed by people who plait their armpits and sell drugs. If you go to the tent embassy down here in Canberra, you will see a lot of well-intentioned people who feel that they have been bypassed by the system. They feel that they have not had their first bite of the cherry while a lot of other people have got fat and rich. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>108</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Scrutiny of Bills Committee</title><page.no>108</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>108</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>108</page.no><name role="metadata">Denman, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator DENMAN</name><name.id>FY5</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn behalf of Senator Ray, I present the 11th report of 2004 of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills.

This bill amends the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to ensure the validity of agreements which were certified, approved or varied under the Workplace Relations Act on or before 2 September 2004, prior to the decision of the High Court in Electrolux Home Products Pty Ltd v. the Australian Workers Union and Others. The bill was the subject of an inquiry and report by the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee. The report was tabled in the Senate on 29 November 2004. The proposed new sections 170NHA, 170NHB and 170WEA of the Workplace Relations Act 1996, to be inserted by items 1 and 2 of schedule 1 of this bill, would retrospectively validate various types of agreements made under the act before 2 September 2004. As a matter of practice, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee draws attention to any bill which seeks to have retrospective impact and will comment adversely where such a bill has a detrimental effect on people. This is in fact one of those bills. </para><para>In this case, the explanatory memorandum observes that the purpose of the bill is to ensure the continued validity of various agreements, the validity which was put in doubt by the decision of the High Court in the Electrolux Home Products case. The minister notes in his second reading speech that the bill `will put parties to an agreement in the position they would have been in if they complied with the Electrolux decision when they made or varied their agreement', prior to the making of their agreements.</para><para>The provisions operate to validate agreements only in so far as they `pertain to the employment relationship'. It is possible that the provisions will be to the detriment of some individuals who have entered into workplace agreements which are retrospectively varied by the legislation. This is where the serious problem of `trespass unduly' on people's rights takes place. When people make agreements under the Workplace Relations Act, they negotiate between the employer and the employees and they strike a bargain, and the bargain is a `whole' bargain. There are many provisions in the agreement and employers or employees do not have the ability to cherry pick individual clauses of such agreements and say, `I agree with that one' or, `I don't agree with the other one.' They agree to an entire package. Once they have agreed to the entire package the agreement is certified.</para><para>What this bill seeks to do is vary those agreements retrospectively after the fact to give those employees and employers a lesser bargain. Clearly, as I understand it, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee considers that these provisions may trespass on personal rights. The question of whether they do so unduly is a matter for the Senate as a whole. It is worth noting and I bring to the Senate's attention the view of the committee, as follows:</para><quote><para>The Committee draws Senators' attention to the provisions, as they may be considered to trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties, in breach of principle 1(a)(i) of the Committee's terms of reference.</para></quote><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Legislation and References Committees</title><page.no>109</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Reports</title><page.no>109</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>109</page.no><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator EGGLESTON</name><name.id>4L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn behalf of the respective chairs of the Community Affairs References Committee, the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee and the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, I present reports on matters referred to these committees during the previous parliament.

The delegation, which was away for the first half of September this year, consisted of Senator Buckland, Senator Tchen and me. While in Canada at the conference, we represented the Australian parliamentary branch of the CPA. The theme for the CPA conference was `Responsibilities and Rights of People and Parliamentarians in a Global Community'.</para><para>The conference brought together parliamentarians from across the Commonwealth to discuss issues. The conference also afforded delegates an opportunity to talk informally together, share experiences and build the friendships that can form the basis for future international cooperation. I had the honour of delivering a paper at the conference, on the topic of gender, democracy, peace and conflict. In the paper I noted the tremendous work done by Australia's women peacekeepers in our region. I should mention that the delegation came away from the plenary conference concerned at its scale. If these conferences were held once every two years instead of every year, then more resources may be available for the CPA's activities at the regional and local level. It is, after all, at these levels that the real work and benefit of the CPA is felt. Having said that, the conference was very well organised by our Canadian colleagues and the delegation left Canada with memories of our hosts' warm hospitality.</para><para>Given Canada's proximity to the United States, the delegation continued the tradition of biennial contacts between Australian and American parliamentarians during the second half of its time abroad. The political, security, economic and social ties between Australia and the United States bind our two countries together closely. The bilateral visit allowed the delegation an opportunity to explore the depth of those ties. The delegation met members of Congress and public administrators; toured a defense plant; spoke to a number of Australian business people working in the United States; and met political commentators and experts in their various fields.</para><para>We also used the visit to present an Australian perspective on issues and to gain an insight into American thinking. The war on terror and the US-Australia free trade agreement provided a backdrop to many of the discussions held by the delegation, particularly in Washington. In fact, the delegation was in Washington on the third anniversary of the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States. We attended a very moving memorial service, principally for those who perished in the attack on the Pentagon building, and laid a wreath at the memorial to those who died so tragically. The delegation was very conscious of the heightened security at US border crossings and airports, and particularly in the streets and around the public buildings of Washington. The omnipresent security provided a sombre note to the delegation's discussions about US foreign policy and the war on terror. </para><para>As with the CPA conference, the visit to the United States allowed the delegation members to talk informally with members of another legislature and build on the already strong rapport between the two parliaments. The value of the visit was that it gave the delegation an opportunity to see issues of importance to Australia from the perspective of another country.</para><para>Before I conclude I would like to thank the President of the Senate, Senator the Hon. Paul Calvert, for allowing me to represent him at the CPA conference and also to lead the delegation. I also wish to thank my colleagues who travelled with meâSenator Tchen, who was the deputy leader of the delegation, and Senator Bucklandâfor making the delegation such a tight-knit and harmonious group. The delegation was enriched by the company of Senator Tchen's wife, Pauline, and my own wife, Sue.</para><para>I also wish to thank the many officialsâAustralian, Canadian and Americanâwho helped the delegation at various stages of its trip. Further, I wish to record my thanks to the delegation secretary, Mr James Catchpole, who was ever vigilant in ensuring that we reached our appointments on time and that our meetings were conducted in a very businesslike manner. His professional approach to the whole trip was highly commendable, and I know it was appreciated by my colleagues. I commend the report to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>111</page.no><name role="metadata">Tchen, Sen Tsebin</name><name role="display">Senator TCHEN</name><name.id>86Y</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to support the comments made by Senator Hogg regarding the report, just tabled, of the parliamentary delegation to the 50th Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference in Canada, and subsequently to the United States. I join with him in recording our thanks to the many people who contributed to the successâand the comfortâof the delegation. </para></talk.start><para>I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Senator Hogg, Mrs Sue Hogg and Senator Buckland for the fellowship they showed my wife and me during our visit to Canada and the United States. Of course, our thanks go to James Catchpole, the secretary to the delegation and an excellent minder. I must also thank Senator Ferris for insisting that I should take part in this delegationâI think for the purpose of broadening my mind. I regret to say that so far there is no evidence that this has happened, but it might.</para><para>The report just tabled provides a summary of the delegation's participation in the Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference in Canada, which Senator Hogg has also succinctly referred to in his speech. I have no need to embellish his account. Suffice it to say that, while this conference serves the very worthwhile purpose of promoting the strengthening of democratic practices in all member nations of the Commonwealth, the participation of parliamentarians from countries with a well-established tradition of parliamentary democracy and a strong economyâcountries such as the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealandâshould be restricted, indeed self-consciously restricted, to providing an interested and supportive presence to the process of exchange rather than seeking to bring matters, which might seem important in their domestic politics but which are mere trifles on the global scale, to the discussion or evaluating everything on the basis of our own practicesâtried and tested though they may be.</para><para>The United States leg of the delegation was again comprehensively covered in the delegation report just tabled. However, I would like to add a few comments in the following areas. The first concerns a visit to the United States Library of Congress. On Tuesday, 14 September, following the delegation's round of meetings with members of the US Congress and Senate, I visited the office of the Congressional Research Service, a branch of the Library of Congress, which is approximately the counterpart of our Parliamentary Library. The Library of Congress is, of course, a much larger organisation, comprising, in addition to its congressional service unit, the national copyright office, a law library, the national archive, and a public access library. The visit was arranged at very short noticeâand I thank Miss Tanya Smith from the Australian embassy for arranging itâto enable me to find out how the US provides its legislators with research support, in comparison with the excellent support senators and members receive from the Parliamentary Library. If there is an opportunity at some future date, I would like to speak on that topic.  </para><para>The next visit was to the Office of Family Assistance. On Monday, 13 September the delegation visited a number of US federal offices, and among them was the Office of Family Assistance. The office is responsible for administering the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, worth $US16.5 billion in the current year. The program is designed to promote employment amongst welfare recipients, on the basis that employment is the most effective way to help people rise out of poverty. This is in contrast to the conventional wisdom that increasing the level of education is the pathway out of poverty and welfare dependency. The approach is firmly based on the idea of mutual obligation. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act requires minimum levels of work participation in exchange for time-limited social security benefits. These benefits are often in kindâthat is, food vouchers rather than cash.</para><para>At paragraph 3.85 of the report the delegation noted that its discussions with Dr Wade Horn, Assistant Secretary for the Administration for Children and Family of the Department of Health and Human Services, and Mr Grant Collins, Chief of Staff of the Office of Family Assistance, were `most thought provoking, particularly as elements of TANF'âthe Temporary Assistance for Needy Families programâ`contrasted sharply with the Australian welfare system'. This contrast is true only insofar as the Australian system exists in its present form. </para><para>It is a matter of fact that since 1966 the Howard government has introduced a number of programs to assist welfare recipients to rejoin employmentâoften in the face of strident attacks by the opposition, especially over the concept of mutual obligation. I note also that the government has flagged necessary major reforms in the Australian welfare system, precisely in the direction indicated by the TANF program, again with strident criticism by the opposition. I am therefore particularly pleased with the reaction of my colleagues to Dr Horn's briefing, and hopeful that the Howard government's welfare reform program, when it is in due course introduced, will receive positive response from the opposition. It should be of particular interest to the opposition that the TANF program was an initiative of the Clinton administration.</para><para>The third issue I wish to comment on is the Australian diaspora. The large number of Australians working and living overseas has been much discussed recently, largely in the context, it seems to me, of this being a sad thing and the need for these lost children of Australia to be brought homeâas the emotive tone of the word `diaspora' suggests. During the delegation's visit to San Francisco on Thursday, 16 September, through the good office of Mr Peter Frank, Australian Consul-General and Senior Trade Commissioner in that city, we had a number of opportunities to meet with Australians living and working in the United States. As the delegation's report notes in paragraph 3.47, we were extremely impressed and pleased by the enterprise and knowledge of these Australians and the success they have achieved in the United States. Indeed, these expatriates do credit to Australia and their achievements and acceptance by the United States community bode well for Australia's increased participation in the United States economy under the Australia-US free trade agreement. They are not just part of an Australian diaspora; they are Australia's colonisers. </para><para>I would like to conclude with the observation that now that I have visited the United States I can say that I was indeed impressed by the size, the variety, the energy, and indeed the greatness of that country. However, it is not the best country in the world. The best country in the world is the one I came home to. I commend the report to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>113</page.no><name role="metadata">Buckland, Sen Geoffrey</name><name role="display">Senator BUCKLAND</name><name.id>009D2</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âBeing a participant in the visit, I would like to add some comments. I concur with all the things said by Senator Tchen and Senator Hogg. I begin by thanking the parliament for giving me the opportunity to participate in the 50th Conference of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. This conference gave me and my colleagues Senator John Hogg and Senator Tsebin Tchen the ability to meet with many fellow parliamentarians from around the Commonwealth.</para></talk.start><para>I do not want to address this part of our visit in any great detail but I refer senators and members in the other place to the comments at the end of chapter 2 of the report. I will just mention two aspects that have been dealt with today but which I would like to deal with again. These matters have also been considered by previous delegations. They are the need for an agenda and a format that encourages more constructive dialogue between parliamentarians and secretariat staff from the different countries, and a greater emphasis on the work done by the regional and local levels of the CPA. Apart from that I would just like to pay tribute to the organisers and host cities of Quebec and Toronto for their hospitality and the work they did to ensure that the needs of all delegates were catered for. </para><para>The substantive part of what I want to speak about is the bilateral visit to the United States following the CPA conference. Clearly, Australia and America being in election mode gave us an easy starting point for many of our meetings, both formal and informal. At Dallas-Fort Worth we visited the Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Co., where we inspected the production facilities and discussed the Joint Strike Fighter. It was pleasing to note that no fewer than nine small to medium Australian companies had won contracts for this project. Lockheed Martin also indicated it had identified a further $US369 million worth of contracts that Australian companies can bid for.</para><para>Our discussions with ExxonMobil, the Australian subsidiary of which is one of our largest companies, gave us the opportunity to talk about their Australian operations, including those on the North West Shelf and in Papua New Guinea. We were also given an overview of their operations on a global scale. ExxonMobil sounded a warning that global economic growth will be compromised unless energy supply and demand challenges are met. They also said that energy conservation initiatives will assist demand to match supply. This sounded a bit like a motherhood statement and it shows that people in all quarters are talking about the problem but far too few are doing anything about it.</para><para>On Saturday, 11 September the delegation attended the Patriot Day observance memorial wreath laying at Arlington National Cemetery. We had the honour of having our delegation leader, Senator John Hogg, lay a wreath at the conclusion of the ceremony. This was a very moving yet very simple ceremony that really gave those attending the opportunity to focus on those souls who lost their lives on that tragic day in 2001, particularly those who died in the attack on the Pentagon. We were privileged to be seated among the survivors and relatives of the victims and we spoke with some of them following the memorial ceremony. </para><para>The other part of the visit I want to make reference to is the time we spent in San Francisco, and I will just mention a few of the things that were important to me. We had a working breakfast with the Australian-American Chamber of Commerce. This was an informal affair but it gave us a great opportunity to talk to Australians working in the San Francisco area and the local businesses they are working with. Some of those business people were taking advantage of the opportunities that have opened up for them in Australia from the other side of the Pacific as a result of their association with Australian companies and Australian members of the chamber.</para><para>A number of members from both sides of the Pacific spoke highly of Austrade and the services available through that body. That was particularly pleasing to me as I have been a great fan of Austrade for some years now, having had dealings with it prior to entering the Senate, through my membership of the Upper Spencer Gulf Common Purpose Group in my home state of South Australia. Austrade is clearly established and highly respected in San Francisco. My experience with it in that city was most rewarding, and this might have had something to do with Austrade's enthusiastic representative in San Francisco Mr Peter Frank. Some at the breakfast seemed pretty keen to talk about the forthcoming elections in both Australia and America, and I have to say I was more interested in the trading opportunities that are clearly there for Australian companies to take advantage of.</para><para>We also met a group of Australian business representatives at the offices of Australian law firm Minter Ellison, which is well established in San Francisco. While I have tried to avoid mentioning any companies or individuals by name so as not to offend those I leave out, I particularly want to mention one who is involved in the agricultural industryâMr Peter Moller of Agri-link International, a South Australian company that manufactures soil moisture sensors. Again, the entire group spoke highly of Austrade's services and the mentoring they provide. I also have to mention our visit to the Napa-Sonoma wine region and the exceptional contribution to the American wine industry that Australian winemakers Southcorp wines and Beringer Blass Wine Estates are making, but let me just sayâand hope it does not get back to Americaâthat our wines are still a bit better than theirs.</para><para>I want to close by thanking my fellow travellersâSenator John Hogg and Senator Tsebin Tchenâfor their company and counsel during both sections of our visit. I especially thank Mr James Catchpole, who was I think our secretarial staffer but more importantly a great friend and travelling companion. Being without the company of my wife, and James being the same, we understood that we were worse off than Senator Tchen and Senator Hogg, but we did our best! I thank too those behind-the-scenes people here at Parliament House, who assisted in making our visit to Canada and the United States both memorable and worth while. Let me close by saying that during our visit I saw the other side of Austrade's work and it really did delight me. I am only sorry that I could not spend more of our visit talking with the representatives of that wonderful organisation. I commend them to the Senate. </para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>115</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Membership</title><page.no>115</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Cherry)</inline>âThe President has received letters from party leaders nominating senators to be members of various committees.</para></talk.start><para>Senator COLBECK (TasmaniaâParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (5.33 p.m.)âby leaveâI move:</para><motion><para>That senators be discharged from and appointed to committees as follows:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">ASIO, ASIS and DSDâJoint Statutory Committee</inline></para><para>AppointedâSenator Ray</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Australian Crime CommissionâJoint Statutory Committee</inline></para><para>AppointedâSenators Denman and Hutchins</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Broadcasting of Parliamentary ProceedingsâJoint Statutory Committee</inline></para><para>AppointedâSenator Faulkner</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Community Affairs Legislation Committee--</inline></para><para>DischargedâSenator Marshall</para><para>AppointedâSenator Moore</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Corporations and Financial ServicesâJoint Statutory Committee</inline></para><para>AppointedâSenators Lundy and Wong</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Electoral Matters--Joint Standing Committee--</inline></para><para>AppointedâSenators Carr and Forshaw</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee--</inline></para><para>AppointedâSubstitute member: Senator Crossin to replace Senator Wong for matters relating to the Industrial Relations portfolio</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee--</inline></para><para>DischargedâSubstitute member: Senator Carr</para><para>AppointedâParticipating member: Senator Hutchins</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade--Joint Standing Committee--</inline></para><para>AppointedâSenators Bolkus, Crossin, Hutchins, Kirk and Lundy</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee--</inline></para><para>DischargedâSubstitute member: Senator Hogg</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Migration--Joint Standing Committee--</inline></para><para>AppointedâSenator Kirk</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">National Capital and External TerritoriesâJoint Standing Committeeâ</inline></para><para>AppointedâSenators Crossin and Lundy</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land FundâJoint Statutory Committeeâ</inline></para><para>AppointedâSenators Carr and Crossin</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Public Accounts and AuditâJoint Statutory Committeeâ</inline></para><para>AppointedâSenators Hogg and Moore</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Public WorksâJoint Statutory Committeeâ</inline></para><para>AppointedâSenator Forshaw</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">TreatiesâJoint Standing Committeeâ</inline></para><para>AppointedâSenators Collins, Mackay and Stephens.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para></interjection></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT (100% MEDICARE REBATE AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>115</page.no><id.no>R2185</id.no></debateinfo></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>115</page.no><id.no>R2183</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>115</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bills received from the House of Representatives. </para><para>Senator COLBECK (TasmaniaâParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (5.34 p.m.)âI indicate to the Senate that these bills are being introduced together.

Where GPs decide not to bulk bill, patients will have lower out-of-pocket costs after they receive the higher Medicare rebate. For a standard GP surgery consultation, this will mean an increase in the Medicare rebate of $4.60 for each patient visit. </para><para>Through this measure, the Government is investing more than $1.7 billion over four years to make GP services more affordable to all Australians.</para><para>The measure will be complemented by an increase in the fees paid by the Department of Veterans' Affairs for GP services provided to eligible veterans and war widows. The Government has announced that the fees paid to Local Medical Officers will be increased from 100% to 115% of the equivalent Medicare fee plus the Veterans Access Payment. This will maintain the relativities between the Medicare and Department of Veterans' Affairs fee scales.</para><para>The measure also builds on other recent Government initiatives aimed at making GP services more affordable, such as the bulk billing incentives targeted at Commonwealth concession card holders and children aged under 16.</para><para>Secondly, eligibility for the extended Medicare safety net at the $300 threshold will be confirmed for all families that are eligible for Family Tax Benefit Part A (FTB(A)). The extended Medicare safety net covers 80% of the out-of-pocket costs for Medicare services provided outside hospital, once an annual threshold is met. The Health Insurance Act currently specifies that, for the purposes of the extended Medicare safety net, a $300 safety net threshold applies to concession card holders and FTB(A) families. </para><para>It has become apparent that there are some families who are eligible for FTB(A), who do not fall within the definition of FTB(A) family. These families are not recognised as eligible for the lower safety net threshold of $300 under the current legislation (unless they are also concessional). </para><para>The Government's original policy intention was that all families who are eligible for FTB(A) payments, would also be eligible for the lower safety net threshold. This amendment will allow the Minister to determine that additional families are FTB(A) families and will ensure that all families who are eligible for FTB(A) are eligible for the lower safety net threshold.  </para><para>Australia has one of the best health systems in the world. For the past 20 years, Medicare has provided Australians with essential protection through affordable access to medical, pharmaceutical and hospital services. Through the measures in this Bill, the Government is making a further substantial investment to strengthen Medicare and support affordable access to high-quality health care.</para></quote><para>âââââ</para><para><inline ref="R2183">Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004</inline></para><quote><para>The Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill would appropriate a total of $1.15 billion as the Australian Government's contribution to the States and Territories for vocational education and training in 2005.</para><para>Vocational education and training underpins the competitiveness of our industries in an increasingly global market and it is vital to ensure Australia's continued economic growth.</para><para>The Howard Government's commitment to vocational education and training is illustrated by the significant funding provided through this Bill and the new initiatives announced this year, particularly addressing skills shortages.</para><para>In 2004-05 this Government will spend a total of $2.1 billion on vocational education and training, of which more than $725 million will go to supporting New Apprenticeships through programmes including New Apprenticeships Incentives.</para><para>We have also announced new measures in our election commitments to a total value of $1.06 billion over 4 years.

Indeed, the policy document entitled `Recognising senior Australiansâtheir needs and their carers' includes so-called savings worth $830.6 million as a result of the PBS changes. I have already referred to the Department of Finance and Administration's analysis of the government's costing of this proposal and have found a shortfall of $130 million. </para></talk.start><para>There are two other things though that must be said. When Labor approached the government last year to look at savings that could be made to the PBS through the introduction of generic brand pharmaceuticals, therefore ensuring the sustainability of the PBS, the government condemned us. We saw the likes of Senator Minchin lecturing Labor about the uncertainty of the impact of generics on the PBS. He said that he would:</para><quote><para>... consider that it would be inappropriate to make any form of speculative provision in the forward estimates for the effects of generic drugs coming onto the PBS.</para></quote><para>But now a few months later the government is using exactly this measure to fund this bill and it is relying on it to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. What is more, Mr Abbott was trumpeting that same inappropriate PBS listing and pricing regimeâcondemned by Senator Minchinâin a press release on 1 October saying that the measures would apply from 1 January. Well, where are they and where is the legislation to implement the new listing and pricing arrangements? Where is the economic modelling that he relied upon to promise cheaper pharmaceuticals from next month? Is the government going to amend the PBS? There appears to be no plan to do so. Is this the first non-core promise of the 2004 election? The government has the spending, but it does not have the savings to pay for it. </para><para>Labor will be supporting the new measures that were promised by the government during the election campaign in order to provide some compensation for the problems created by the government's earlier policy mistakes. The measures outlined in this bill were promises made to the Australian people and Labor intends to facilitate the government's delivery of those promises.</para><para>I will conclude with some observations on the difference between Labor's and the coalition's attitude to, and management of, social welfare. Unlike the government, Labor are committed to a fairer social security system which offers the necessary level of income support for Australians when they need it. We also believe that the social security system should supplement Australians on low incomes, particularly families who face additional costs in providing for children, people with disabilities and people who make sacrifices to care for others. Labor believes we should support Australians but also provide incentives to help people make the transition from welfare to work. The social security system is most effective when it rewards hard work and increases people's access to opportunities and skills so that they can improve their standard of living. To achieve these objectives, our social security system should be an integrated structure of income support measures. Real social security reform would seek to make the system simpler and more accessible to those Australians who access social welfare payments every year.</para><para>As I have said, in this bill the government has failed to fix the long-term problems in our social security system. It has failed to fix the problems and it has failed to do the right thing by more than six million Australians. Labor will pass this bill but will continue to argue for a fairer, simpler and better system of social welfare to service all Australians. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>119</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAs its name suggests, the <inline ref="R2195">Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2004 Election Commitments) Bill 2004</inline> puts into place a series of election promises made by the Howard government. These are all welcome, albeit somewhat inconsistently and unfairly appliedâI will expand on that later. Of more concern, however, are the election promises not made by the Howard government to pensioners that, while not in this bill, are nonetheless imminent.</para></talk.start><para>The government did not promise to target disability support pensioners with the clear intent of getting them off DSP, forcing them to compete with non-disabled job seekers in the open job market. It did not promise that they would be targeted for no other reason than that there are too many of them. I could find no such promise in any of the election material, but since the election the government has clearly indicated that DSP recipients are in its sights.</para><para>I return to the election promises in this bill. The seniors concession allowance provided by this bill is, I believe, a cover-up of a 2001 unfulfilled promise by the Howard government to self-funded retirees that it would provide them with the same concessions for which pensioners are eligible. Many self-funded seniors have low incomes, but do not benefit from the concessions in energy, rates, water, sewerage and motor vehicle registration costs as do pension recipients. These services are everyday items that form a major part of the household budgets for older Australians. </para><para>The Australian Democrats recognise that many self-funded retirees are on low incomes and would benefit by the same concessions offered to pensioners. But when the Howard government made that promise to self-funded retireesânot surprisingly in an election year three years agoâthey did not have the agreement of the states, which the government expected to fund 40 per cent of the costs. It is very easy to make a sweeping promise in an election year and then expect someone else to pay for it. It is not surprising that the states and territories did not subsequently all agree. The government blame the states for not paying something they had not agreed to and cover their inability to deliver on a promise by a payment to self-funded retirees. The Democrats support the introduction of seniors allowance of $200 a year for each holder of a seniors health card, but in the end it does not provide self-funded retirees with any concessions and the government have not fulfilled their now three-year-old promise.</para><para>The bill provides for a utilities allowance for pensioners and veterans of age pension age. The explanatory memorandum informs us that older Australians can experience difficulties in saving to pay regular household bills such as gas and electricity and that this payment is introduced to provide assistance in paying for those. The Democrats are at a loss to understand why the government would think that only older Australians on income support would have difficulty paying for energy bills. Energy tariff increases have placed a significant burden on all low-income Australians. Over the last 12 months electricity prices in some states have risen by 30 per cent. The average quarterly household electricity bill in some states is now close to $1,000. Privatisation of energy supply together with high fixed charges, including service to property charges, mean that low consumption customersâpredominantly low-income customersâshoulder disproportionate costs. This utilities allowance is totally inadequate in its amount and also it is given only to age pensioners.</para><para>Has the government not read the recent report of the Carers Association which states that energy costs are a significant burden for carers who provide care in the home for family members with chronic illness or disabilities or for family members who are frail aged, and that over the last 12 months carers have experienced electricity price increases of 32 per cent or $80.96 a quarter? The answer is not to blame excess use. Low-income Australians are, in some cases, already going without heating, cooling, lighting and appliances in a desperate effort to offset energy price increases. Centrepay arrangements do not make bills cheaper; they simply spread the financial difficulty. Disconnections are increasing at an alarming rate. Children do homework by candlelight, go without hot meals and are unable to bathe. This bill ignores the need of sole parents, people with a disability, carers and the unemployed.</para><para>In the media last week it was reported that key welfare agencies will band together to force action on crippling power bills, which they blame for the death of at least three elderly people, and the disconnection of several thousand needy households. We Democrats believe that the government must take greater responsibility for the welfare of its disadvantaged citizens. The utilities allowance must be extended to all disadvantaged Australians.  </para><para>While the government is prepared to pay each member of a self-funded retiree couple $200 per year concession allowanceâthat is, $400 per coupleâit has decided that this is not the case for married pensioner couples. They will only receive the single rate of utilities allowance for a couple. That directly discriminates against those whose disability, health, education or other disadvantage has prevented them from accumulating wealth.</para><para>In a further example of discrimination against the disadvantaged the government has decided that, while self-funded retirees can receive their first instalment in December of this year, pensioners and veterans must wait until March of next year. The Democrats call on the government to be consistent in its approach and to treat members of a couple the same, regardless of whether they are self-funded retirees or pensioners. It is unacceptable for the government to determine that self-funded retirees, who may have incomes of up to $80,000 annually, need concession allowances at a higher rate and sooner than age and service pensioners and veterans need the utilities allowance paid to them.</para><para>We Democrats welcome the increased flexibility for carers brought by this bill in increasing the number of hours that a carer may spend in work, training or study without losing qualification for payment. Indeed, it is something we have called for over a long time. We commend that. It will not lessen their carer obligations or responsibilityâmany will still struggle to fit in the extra study or work and to cope with the daily task of caring for a disabled or frail person. But it is a start, and we welcome it.</para><para>Most grandparents did not expect to, and certainly did not plan to, raise their grandchildren. For many it just happened and there was no time for decisions. It happened because the children's parents died, were sick, are in jail, used drugs or for any number of reasons were unable to parent the children. Grandparents are robbed of the future they planned but they do not say it too loudly. They mourn the loss of their role as grandparents. Caring brings obstacles, legal woes, financial troubles and emotional issues. They take on the role because they will not stand aside and watch their grandchildren head into foster care.</para><para>This bill provides that grandparents on income support payments can access a special rate of child-care benefit, which will effectively mean they will not have to pay the gap child-care payments. Unfortunately, it does not provide additional child-care places, particularly in rural, regional and remote Australia where there are few child-care places. This bill limits the child care to approved care. This excludes relatives, friends or nannies even if they are registered with the Family Assistance Office. For many grandparents this bill will not ease their load because formal child care is simply not available.</para><para>We Democrats note that there were some 18 pages of explanatory memorandum detailing the rules and qualifications relating to the special child-care benefit rate. It is not an allowance paid to grandparents and, while we recognise that any benefit must be administered, we ask the government to be aware that these grandparents are a new class of disadvantaged Australians who no longer have spare time in retirement. We do not want compliance with 18 pages of obligations to present an additional burden for older Australians already burdened while caring for young children.</para><para>Finally, we Democrats also welcome the increase in bereavement payments. Bereavement payments enable the survivor of a veteran couple to adjust to the single rate over a 12-week period at a time when expenses are high for funerals. It now recognises the above general rate having been received by the deceased veteran or member and is calculated in the rate of bereavement allowance. Regrettably, it does not apply to same-sex partners, who after the death of the veteran experience the same grief and loss and the same financial disadvantages as those of heterosexual couples. We Democrats will be moving amendments to the bill in the committee stage to address what we see as deficiencies and make it fairer for more disadvantaged Australians. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>122</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="R2195">Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2004 Election Commitments) Bill 2004</inline> amends current legislation, implementing government promises made during the last election campaign. It involves amendments to the Social Security Act and the Veterans' Entitlements Act. It must be said at the outset that these promises are of no great moment nor of any particular outstanding merit. In large part they are simply election bribesâpassing money out to sectors of the communityâdressed up in a rather flimsy policy pretext. As policy initiatives they are minorâalso indicating a poverty of policy with respect to social security and to veterans affairs. </para></talk.start><para>The allowances paid are not large sums of money. Those in financial stress will appreciate the assistance, as they would any small windfall. However, we recognise the government was elected in part on the basis of these promises, and tradition demands we recognise that obligation. We note the government is clearly implementing core promises with early start dates. This is a refreshing change from the sheer dishonesty shown after the last election.</para><para>With respect to the carers payments, including the child-care benefits for grandparents, we accept there has been a growing element of unfairness. But it should be added that, with respect to the assistance to grandparents, we do not believe this amendment goes far enough. There are benefits in these measures which recognise shortcomings in the current policy mix. Minor though they are, we support them.</para><para>We do not oppose the fifth amendment, and I will put this into context. This proposal provides for the extension of bereavement payments for surviving partners of veterans paid at a rate in excess of 100 per cent of the general rate. The government makes bereavement payments as a standard practice to survivors of deceased pensioners both in our social welfare and veteran client groups. The policy was originally based on an assertion that it was intended to allow the bereaved some time to adjust to new and harsher financial circumstances. Indeed, it is axiomatic that two can live more cheaply than one. Hence passing from the married rate to the single rate can involve a degree of financial stress. We recognise that it is difficult to accurately adjust administrative systems to cater for the precise date of death, that it is inevitable in the payment of pensions that on the death of one partner overpayments can occur and that recovery from a deceased estate and the deceased's partner is often stressful and difficult. Hence it is easier to provide some leeway.</para><para>To that extent, claiming generosity for this policy is somewhat ingenuous. It is also ingenuous with respect to veterans' policy. The provision of bereavement payments has always been a foil for the argument that the current funeral benefit of $1,000 is inadequateâ$1,000 clearly does not equate to the cost of a funeral in modern times. There is little or no connection between the funeral allowance and bereavement payments. It is convenient spin, but entirely false and inappropriate. For age and service pensions, surviving partners are paid seven fortnightly payments of the rate applying to a couple prior to death. After seven fortnights, pensions switch to the single rate. Seven payments of the married rate of age service pension currently would be $5,502. Seven payments at the single rate would be $3,294. That is a difference of $2,207. </para><para>In the case of veterans, there is also a payment consisting of six fortnightly pays of disability pension. This is at the rate paid, but to a maximum of 100 per cent of the general rate. For veterans, there are approximately 160,000 people currently receiving some percentage of the disability pension for service related injuries from DVA. This tax-free, CPI indexed pension ranges from $29.64 per fortnight at the rate of 10 per cent to $296.40 at 100 per cent. At 100 per cent, six payments total $1,778. To this can be added seven payments of service or age pension at the married rate referred to previously in this address. Of these 160,000 veteran disability pensions, 45,500 receive payments above the 100 per cent general rate. This includes 28,500 who receive the special rate, which contains an additional $492.80 tax free per fortnight. It also includes 15,000 who receive the extremely disabled allowance, which is an extra $150 tax free per fortnight. This bill extends the six bereavement pays to include those whose additional payments are over the 100 per cent rate. For future partners of deceased special rate people, this will be an extra $2,956.80. For the partners of future deceased EDAs it will be around $900. These benefits are not means tested.</para><para>While it might seem logical to expand the bereavement pay to include the whole amount of disability compensation, it is not a matter of need. It barely received a mention in the Clarke report. Again, this confirms that most of the Clarke report content was a waste of time. It also shows the minor nature of this matter. Sadly, though, for political reasons this issue became important to the government as a substitution for serious policy. It simply begs the question about all of the other recommendations made by Justice Clarke in his report. They were in large part based on good policy and the views of the veteran community. No sooner was Clarke despatched to history than the government reverted to its prior ad hoc approach. But Clarke's terms of reference had little to do with deriving better policy. The inquiry was little but a sorting process of competing claims. Justice Clarke and his committee responded according to the merits, either on the grounds of equity or review of factual information. The government rejected most recommendations for change to policy earlier this year. Then it selected which new benefits, if any, it would dispense. Most of Clarke's recommendations were killed at birth.</para><para>Veterans might have expected that at least the government might have returned to Clarke's recommendations for future policy initiatives but, no, the process was cynically intended as a stall, and this is further evidence of that. The government did not need this $1.7 million inquiry to help it determine its priorities. The $1.7 million simply brought two years of peace whereby every veteran and widow with a case to put could be fobbed offâand fobbed off they were. This particular matter was raised by submissions to Clarke but was not the subject of any of his 109 recommendations. It has simply been picked out as something of low cost, without flow-on risks and without any policy basis such as need.</para><para>This highlights one important difference between the government and the ALP with respect to policy. By contrast, our approach has been to establish a policy basis of need and then see how it can be best addressed. That is why we focused on veterans' children, their education and their health. That is why when it came to bereavement payments we looked at the fate of those whose entitlements are inadequateâthat is, the fate of those single veterans who die in indigent circumstances. Their estates receive little by way of bereavement payments. </para><para>Clarke also identified this issue but overlooked the need for any sensible solution, as has the government. This shows quite clearly the lack of any policy focus. For those who will benefit from this bill, the limitation of 100 per cent has been removed as an apparent anomaly. Whether it is really an anomaly or not is a moot point now. It simply means that the higher the disability pension, the higher the bereavement payment, regardless of means. It is also regardless of the degree of incapacity. Actual pension payments do not reflect comparative disability. No doubt the extremely disabled community will see this as a further instance whereby they are discriminated against when compared with the TPIs over the age of 65. Their widows will get far less, despite the fact that they may be more disabled. I would simply say to them that this is a government policy initiative, and it is flawed. I have no doubt they will be making that point to the minister most vociferouslyâas they should. Again, this is another policy shortcoming derived in an election campaign.</para><para>As Senator Chris Evans indicated earlier, we support this bill. As a matter of practice, we will not oppose legislation which gives added benefits to veterans, even when the policy is flawed. I would only comment that it is a pity that this seems to be a very frequent process. The basic issue, though, despite the few merits of this proposal, is that there are many ways of spending $12.8 million. Without wanting to deny the intended beneficiaries, it is valid to ask whether this money might have benefited others in needâfor example, the large number of veterans' children struggling to get an education. Provision of more bursaries for these children would have made far greater impact on improving the lot of many veterans' families. The money, for example, would have provided 640 new bursaries every year. It would also have gone a long way to better addressing the health needs of those children.</para><para>It would also have been more meaningful to have looked at the whole picture of war widows on the basis of need. In short, this giveaway policy does not focus on need. Yes, it will obviously help, but it is a one-off. What many widows really need is ongoing income support into the future. That is why the ALP, in the last election, focused on those war widows under the age of 57Â½. These widows struggle to make ends meet because they are not eligible for the income support supplement. I am sure if you asked them whether they would prefer a one-off payment of $2,956 or a pension of $135 per fortnight for the rest of their lives, their answer would be for the latter, without doubt. However, we do not seek to deny the war widows who benefit from their good fortune.</para><para>The fact remains, though, that 20 per cent of war widows do not qualify for the income support supplement simply because they are ruled out by the means test. In other words, their needs are relatively less and so this added payment will be a true windfall. In the meantime, though, others will continue to do it tough. This is an excellent example of the poverty of this proposal. The priorities are wrong. It is about a limited amount of popularity, not better policy for veterans. As I have said, we support this bill, but because of its cheap election giveaway philosophy it does not advance veterans at all. I referred to the futility and waste of the Clarke report, so we should not be surprised. I want to make some brief remarks on the Democrat second reading amendment, which I presume has been moved. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator Bartlett</name></talker><para>âI will be moving it.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>2L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name></talker><para>âI will speak to it while I have a few minutes left. There is a considerable history behind this Democrat amendment. In a nutshell, it concerns the appropriate means of indexation of the TPI special rate pension. The government's response was to change the index from CPI to MTAWE only with respect to those pensions paid above 100 per cent of the general rate. The rationale for that was never very clear. It was assumed that the portion above the general rate was regarded as economic in natureâthat is, a form of income supportâand therefore it should be treated in the same way as age and service pensions. However, as we know, many others are paid more than 100 per cent of the general rate, including the blind, some amputees and the extremely disabled. These payments cannot be defined as economic, so that rationale, one thinks, is destroyed. Put simply, the government has indexed all pensions paid in excess of the general rate by MTAWE. That includes the extremely disabled allowance, which is 150 per cent of the general rate. By the government definition, this is non-economic compensation normally indexed by CPI only. So, again, policy on indexation has gone out the window.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The government policy is to index the general rate by MTAWE, as it has where it exceeds 100 per cent. So it is a simple extension of that policy to extend it to all of the general rate. It is now, as a matter of logic, only an arbitrary matter about money, no longer about policy at all. That means that 160,000 people in receipt of the disability pension have a precedent in policy. That includes all 28,500 TPIs. This is a problem of the government's own making. It is the simple logic contained in the facts. It is for that reason we support the amendment, as we did last time, contrary to the Democrats' false assertion during the election campaign.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>125</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAs the name of the <inline ref="R2195">Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2004 Election Commitments) Bill 2004</inline> suggests, this legislation puts into place a series of election promises made by the Howard government. It is always welcome when a government keeps its promises, although when those promises fulfil a commitment that is somewhat inconsistent and unfairly applied, as my colleague Senator Greig has always outlined, it is perhaps unfortunate that the government has not seen a little more wisdom along the way and refined those promises to achieve a fairer and more effective result.</para></talk.start><para>Not surprisingly, as my colleague Senator Greig has also outlined, the payment of the seniors concession allowance to self-funded retirees as provided by this bill is simply a cover-up of the failure to implement a promise made long ago. The government promised to provide concessions to self-funded retirees and they failed. Instead, they offer a payment which is of no relevance to concessions.</para><para>As part of my comments I want to address the government's continuing failure to implement other promises. The Clarke report into the review of veterans' entitlements was released in January of last year. It was a disgrace that it took the government more than a year to respond to its recommendations, as it finally did earlier this year. As I have said many times, we have a minister who is quite happy to exploit service men and women for his political gain. He is quick to send young Australians to war but is slow to properly recognise the debt this incurs on behalf of the nation and even slower to address some of the legitimate concerns of veterans. The Democrats do not support the Prime Minister in sending troops to Iraq without the endorsement of the Australian parliament, but we do support the right of those veterans when they do return from that or any other conflict to be properly compensated and treated fairly when they can no longer serve.  </para><para>Whatever our views are on the Iraq war, all of us would like all wars to cease so that we no longer need to have veterans, and people do not have to pay the price and make the sacrifice that they do. But whilst ever we have troops who will put their lives on the line to fight for our country we do have a special obligation to ensure that we do not just pat them on the back when they come back, give them a nice medal and provide a photo opportunity for the Prime Minister, the minister or perhaps a local member. We have a responsibility to continue to support veterans in the many years ahead where often they have direct consequences to deal with as a result of their service.</para><para>For many years now the Democrats have been calling for a reversal in the erosion in the value of veterans compensation and for the TPI to be fully and properly benchmarked to try to turn around the decline in its value. While the Clarke review bill earlier this year addressed the erosion, regrettably it only did so by half. The TPI payment has long been known as a special rate, and this is what TPI recipients believed they were receiving. Not surprisingly, the majority did not know of it as, or ever refer to it as, `general rate plus above general rate'. But the perception of `general rate plus above general rate' is what the government decided to rely on earlier this year when it indexed only the above general rate to both the consumer price index and the 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings benchmark. In my view that constituted a broken promise to veterans.</para><para>The Democrats believe that the `special rate' is aptly named. It is paid to a veteran whose employability is affected by their war- or defence-caused disabilities where the veteran is further assessed as being unable to undertake remunerative work for more than eight hours a week as a result of their service related incapacity. TPI veterans paid a very high price in many respectsâa direct, personal price to their health and their ability to work due to their service to our country.</para><para>The government failed to link the whole of the special TPI rate to MTAWE and the CPI as veterans had been led to believe they would. As a consequence, only the rate paid above the general rate TPI is linked to those benchmarks. The general base rate remains indexed only to CPI and, as we have seen over many years now, that will mean it will continue to erode in its real value.</para><para>In short, this group of veterans were short-changed because the government decided that only what amounts to 62 per cent of that payment will be linked to the MTAWE benchmark. The overall TPI is currently around 45 per cent of the average weekly wage, and this proportion has been reducing for many years. It was, in my view, a slap in the face to TPI veterans and their families that this decline in value was only half addressed and that therefore the problem will be ongoing. In the words of one TPI organisation, war veteran TPIs have been thrown a bone; however, it was a bone pretty much devoid of meat. I suppose, as a vegetarian, in one sense I should find a more appropriate analogy, but the message is pretty clear. The Democrat policy, which is reflected in our second reading amendment, is that the whole TPI payment should be indexed to the male total average weekly earnings and CPI, whichever is the greater.</para><para>The Democrats welcome the remainder of this bill, which provides assistance to older veterans to meet significantly increased energy bills. We are at a loss to understand why the government would believe that younger veterans do not face the same financial struggle, and some of our amendments will address that. We are also at a loss as to why the government creates an anomaly between veteran couples and self-funded retiree couples, and our amendments will also address that. </para><para>I close by noting that almost two years after the release of the Clarke report there are still recommendations that have not been accepted by this government. It is unfortunately not uncommon to see this government cherry pick from reports, picking some of the recommendations and ignoring others. Reviews relating to veterans unfortunately have that as a common occurrence, despite them being commissioned by the government.</para><para>In moving our second reading amendment today the Democrats give notice that the unfinished business from the Clarke report is not a closed issue. We will continue to agitate the government for further action in these and other areas that still need to be addressed for the veteran community in Australia, including the greater health care measures, gold card entitlement and definition of `service'. As Senator Bishop has said, this issue has been raised before in this chamber. There will be an ongoing effort by the Democrats. As Senator Bishop correctly said when this amendment was moved on a previous occasion, the Labor Party did support it. That was something I made a mistaken statement on during the campaign, although I did put out a further statement correcting that. I am quite happy to correct the record here and say that it was supported by Labor at that time, and we are pleased that they are also supporting it now.</para><para>We have seen in other areas in relation to the needs of the veteran community that it can take many years of persistent, repeated efforts in advocating, both in this chamber and in the community, for concerns to be addressed. I can think of one example in relation to the treatment of compensation payments as income by the Department of Social Security. There were about seven or eight years between when this government came to office with a promise to address that anomaly and when it finally acted on it. There were far too many more years than there should have been, but nonetheless it was acted upon and the Democrats praised the government when that happened. We are always willing to praise positive actions, and there are some positive components of this bill. But history shows that oftentimes you have to keep raising issues over and over again to get them addressed. You have to continue not just to pressure the government but to encourage the opposition, and indeed ourselves and other organisations, to keep pushing those issues. This is one issue that we will keep pushing, and I am pleased that the opposition will be doing the same.</para><para>I emphasise the valuable role that service organisations broadly play. These are people who have already done their bit by being service men and women for our country and who then continue to work, almost always in an unpaid capacity, not for themselves in many cases but for fellow veterans who are in need of help. Those groups often have differences in opinion, but they do a lot of work continually pressuring all of us from all parties to recognise our responsibility to ensure that veterans are properly recognised. It is one group in the community that I think all of us would acknowledge we have a special obligation to, and it is one that unfortunately can often get left to one side in amongst all the competing demands, priorities and lobbying that takes place in the parliamentary arena and in the political world more broadly. It is because of the tireless work of a whole range of ex-service organisations that the veterans' voices are not forgotten and that their issues continue to be raised and pursued by people across the political spectrum. I pay tribute to their work and encourage them to keep doing so. I can indicate, certainly from my point of view, that we are quite willing to continue to support the large proportion of the issues that they raise, which we believe are worthy of implementation or consideration.

I want to comment on a couple of things that were said. Senator Evans and, I think, Senator Greig both made the comment that we had failed to deliver on our offer of core concessions to the states. I have to disagree with that. We offered the states in, I think, the 2001 budget an amount of money which would have enabled Commonwealth seniors health care card holders to have about 60 per cent of their concessions paid for by the Commonwealth. We were asking for the states to come up with a 40 per cent contribution for self-funded retirees. Many of them are people who have been frugal throughout their lives, who have provided for themselves, who do not get the pension but who argueâand I think rightly soâthat, because they have in fact provided for themselves, they should get some of the benefits that pensioners get. I then increased the offer to about $75 million last year. I got two nibbles from two states; I got a rejection from some states. In fact, there was very little interest on the whole. We were not going to wait any longer and made a commitment during the election to give self-funded retirees with health care cards a $200 contribution towards their utilities, rates and car registration and to give pensioners a $100 utilities supplement in order to assist them.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It has to be understood that pensioners receive from the states and territories concessions ranging fromâI cannot remember the exact figureâabout $450 at the lowest right through to over $900 in one of the other jurisdictions. So pensioners now receive between $450 and over $900 in concessions across the jurisdictions. That will be added to by the $100 supplement to a pensioner couple. What we have done is offer $200 to each Commonwealth seniors health care card holder to recognise the contribution they have made.</para><para>Senator Evans said that we failed on the original offer. I met with the ministers last week and said that there was still $19 million difference between what we had given to the Commonwealth seniors health care card holders and the original offer. I think in one state our contribution for a self-funded retiree couple exceeds or just matches the benefits that a pensioner gets, so there is no need for that state to even contribute. But some states, where there are larger concessions, could have their proportion of that $19 million and then put in their 40 per centâso the offer is still there. The states could step up to the plate and assist these people who have looked after themselves all their lives. That is to put paid to Senator Evans's proposition that we had not met the commitment; we have, but we were not going to wait any longer. This has been sitting on the table since the 2001 budget. That is how long it has been thereâand I have increased it in accordance with the change in numbers of Commonwealth seniors health care card holdersâand the states failed to respond. There were a couple of nibbles, as I said. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>2L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator Mark Bishop</name></talker><para>âDo you want to get the bill through or not?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name></talker><para>âIt is there.

We Democrats cannot understand why the government would consider that only older Australians are having financial difficulties with increased energy bills or why the government would think that carers and disability support pensioners, for example, as well as disabled veterans, somehow have a greater capacity to save for these difficult bills. </para><para>The government has only to look at the recent pleas by welfare agencies, including VCOSS and the Salvation Army, which report that income support recipients are coming to them in their thousands seeking urgent assistance to pay electricity bills. For some, their bills have gone up by hundreds of dollars each year, despite careful consumption. Deregulation of the energy market, together with large energy tariff increases, has placed a significant burden on all low-income Australians. Over the last 12 months electricity prices in some states, as I said in my speech in the second reading debate, have increased by some 30 per cent, such that the average quarterly household electricity bill is now close to $1,000. The large increase in supply charges, together with higher fixed charges, including service to property charges, means that low-consumption consumersâthat is, predominantly low-income customersâshoulder a disproportionate amount of these costs. </para><para>Welfare agencies report that the exorbitant cost of energy supply causes low-income Australians to sometimes resort to desperate measures, including going without heating or cooling and so on. Disconnections, as I said, are on the increase. I read recently of a family in which both parents had lost their jobs some time ago and were in receipt of income support, and they were simply unable to find the $65 a fortnight for energy supply. Their child, a student, was doing homework by candlelight. The utilities allowance is not adequate. Also, it is only given to those of age pension age. </para><para>The carers association recently reported that energy costs are a significant burden for family carers, particularly those who provide care in the home for family members with chronic illness or disabilities or for the frail aged. Family carers use some 14.5 per cent more electricity on average than other households. Over the last 12 months carers have experienced electricity price increases of around 30 per cent. There is no more capacity for carers or other social security or veterans' income support recipients, including those unable to work because of a disability or with young children, to save for increased energy bills. The Democrats believe that they are equally deserving of assistance. Nor is the amount of $100 adequate. Our requests for amendments provide that an annual amount of $200 per income support recipient is more reasonable. Even that will not pay the energy bill, given that in some states the average quarterly household bill, as I said, is now approaching $1,000. But it will go some way to minimising the danger to health and safety for those for whom disconnection may well become the only option.</para><para>The Democrats do not object to the seniors concession allowance of $200 per cardholder per year. We recognise the contribution that self-funded retirees have made to the community and the economy by being in a position to fund their own retirement. Many are on lower incomes than the seniors health card limits of $50,000 for a single and $80,000 for a couple. The estimated value of concessions varies with use, but conservative estimates put it at at least $700 per year. Alarmingly, however, this bill sets up an inequitable position, where each member of a self-funded retiree couple receives $200 concession allowance per year. In other words, it pays the single rate to each person. But the utilities allowance that a pensioner couple and a veteran couple receive is only half of the single rate. </para><para>Our requests for amendments will not take anything away from self-funded retirees. As I said, we value the very real savings they make to the Australian economy. But we are concerned that, after years of promises by the government, they still do not have concessions. Low-income pensioners are not so by choice, many because of disability, education, location, family heritage and employment disadvantage. Simply because they did not have the opportunity to acquire hundreds of thousands of dollars for their retirement, they are not second-class citizens, and we do not view them as the undeserving poor. Our requests for amendments simply treat pensioners and members of a veteran couple the same as the members of a self-funded retiree couple when it comes to determining the annual rate of allowance, whether it be a utilities allowance or seniors concession allowance.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>131</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI ask the minister to respond to a couple of points made by Senator Greig in moving his amendment.

We focused on seniors and that is why this benefit is for seniors. We focused on self-funded retirees in the last second reading speech, not the speech we tabled. We believe that these people, as Senator Greig has said, have contributed throughout their lives. They are not dependent on the pension. We do give them a Commonwealth seniors health care card, which gives them concessions for pharmaceutical benefits, access to the relevant Medicare safety net and also the higher bulk-billing rate. Pensioners get benefits, as I said, of $450 in one jurisdiction to over $900 in another jurisdiction. One of the reasons that we set the amount at $200 was that it would bring it fairly close to the commitment that we had made, because we could not get the states to come on board. We were treating all self-funded retirees across the country in the same way. In some states, but not in others, this would bring them somewhere near or fairly close to what the states were giving them by way of concessions.</para></talk.start><para>If you actually want me to say who is responsible, the states ought to be giving these people concessions. If these people had not looked after themselves, if they had not provided for themselves, then they would be on the pension, they would have a Commonwealth seniors health care card and they would be getting concessions. We are giving them concessions on the PBS and we are giving them assistance with the Medicare safety net. The states really ought to come up to the plate and give them the whole of the concessions, but they do not. So we believe it is appropriate for the Commonwealth to step in and assist them. </para><para>In order to recognise the contribution that others on age pensions have made, we will give them $100 per pensioner coupleâ$50 each six monthsâfor assistance with their utilities allowance, understanding that they get, as a single or a couple household, between $450 and over $900 in concessions. So in that state, with the extra $100, the contribution is brought up to between $550 and over $1,000 in the top one. That is a significant contribution. I was interested that it does vary so much across the states. For Victoria, we are basically replacing the state concession for car registration, which was about $80 a year, which was ripped from pensioners in the last budget. The decision was made to recognise the contribution that Commonwealth seniors health care card holders and self-funded retirees with a CSH card made and to assist them in this way. But, whatever way you look at it, pensioners are still getting significantly more concessions across every jurisdiction and, when you take into account the $100, significantly more than self-funded retirees. That is why that decision was made to have a differential.</para><para>We cannot support the Democrat amendments. I have had some quick figures done; I am not saying that they are absolutely final. I am advised that the Democrats' age pensioner measure is about $444 million and the other income support measure is about $520 million. That comes to about $964 million. We have not costed in administrative costs and all the other things that go with it. What I would like Senator Greig to do is to come with me to the ERC and tell us where we are going to find $1 billion. I have to go to the ERC and say, `Where am I going to take it from? If you do not want to run up a budget deficit, where am I going to go?' I can tell you that that is not easy. You want to spend $1 billion tonight. Senator Greig nods his head. No wonderâsorry, Senator Greigâthe Democrats are on the decline. You have lost the plot. Former Senator Walsh from Western Australia most probably was right. I used to sit on the other side and hear him talk about some of the Democrats' proposals. I did not quite appreciate why he made some of the derogatory comments he made, but I can see why he would.

One jurisdiction is giving over $900 in concessions to pensioners, some of whom have quite reasonable assets and income and still qualify for a part pension and therefore qualify for those concessions. Now take a self-funded retiree who does not qualify, who considers that they have contributed all their life. We believe this is a down payment to that commitment we made in 2001. As I said before, it still does not reach, particularly when you add the $100 per pensioner couple in the supplement. Even a couple receiving two lots of $200 annually does not exceed the assistance of $450-odd plus $100 that pensioners will now get, where the concession of $100 is as a pensioner couple.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>133</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank the minister for her answer. I think she is making a real problem for herself in this approach. One of the things that strikes me is whether, when you are doing the maths to balance it out, you are also going to take into account local government concessions on rates and things like that. It seems to me that you have embarked on a policy course that leads you into contradictions and complications, and it is going to be very hard to resolve. You mention, for instance, car registrations. My father is a self-funded retiree but does not own a car. How do you work it out for those who do own a car and those who do not, or for those who live in local government authorities that offer rate reductions for people with health care cards or on other bases?

All I am suggesting is that, as a policy path, this is fraught, and this is one of my concerns about the approach. The other thing I would like to say is that I am interested in the comment about how expensive the Democrat propositions are, and I think that is probably right. But I am also keen to know how you will pay for yours because, as I understand it, this was to be paid for by the PBS generic drug propositionsâwhich I have not found on my bills listâwhich were to apply from 1 January. I would be interested to hear the minister explain how the government would fund the cost of these measures, because that is not clear to me. I know what was said during the election campaign but, if the legislation is passed, the costs will apply from 1 January.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In a general sense in response to the Democrat amendments, Labor will not support them. We accept that these measures are largely implementing the government's election promises. We do not support the policy framework that underpins those. We think there are some real difficulties and contradictions with them but, if you like, this is the government delivering on what it said it would deliver, and we are prepared to let it do that. We think the Democrat amendments would add to the adhocery and add to the cost and, quite frankly, would be rejected by the government. So we can have a futile debate now, send the legislation back to the House of Representatives and deal with it in a week's time when we will fold the tent or you will fold the tent, Senator Greig. I think we have to have a realistic appreciation of where we are at in the parliamentary cycle. Our bottom line is that we will not stop the government implementing the promises it made to self-funded retirees and pensioners about these things. We think the policy basis is confused and fraught and that it will lead the government down the wrong path. We do not think it addresses a whole range of inequities in the system but we will not be supporting the Democrat amendments in that regard. We will support the passage of the bill. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>134</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is difficult to know, Senator Evans, where to draw the line, though, isn't it?

Minister, you asked where I would find this amount of approximately a billion dollars. I recall that only three years agoâit was not the recent election but the election beforeâwhen the really hot-button issue of the day was petrol prices, for some reason the Prime Minister felt it necessary to intervene and pour a billion dollars into the economy to bring the price of petrol down by 1c across the nation. I found that obscene and unnecessary, and I note with some curiosity that, although petrol prices have significantly increased around Australia in recent weeks to a level higher than they were three years ago, there is not the same public outcry. I think the politics behind that is fascinating.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Another area where we Democrats would advocate the finding of money is the abolition of the government rebate for private health care coverage. We would be very keenly supportive of that. We would also advocate to the government that it really ought to seriously think about taxing family trusts as it does companies. We find it unacceptable that many wealthy families continue to hide taxable income through those structures. You will find in excess of a billion dollars there, so it is a question of priorities.</para><para>We remain committed to the proposals that we have presented. I clearly have not won the argument on the day but I am pleased that we have had the opportunity to tease them out a bit. I think part of the problem, some of the inconsistencies that Senator Evans spoke of, was more to do with the unseemly haste with which the original legislation went through the parliament when we were perhaps expecting an early election. That raft of bills that went through in a hugely unscrutinised way caused, I think, many of the hiccups that are contained within this legislation.</para><para>Question negatived.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>134</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI move Democrat requests for amendments (4), (5) and (6) together:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the House of Representatives be requested to make the following amendments: </para><para>(4)	Schedule 1, page 11 (after line 15), before item 20, insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">19A  Subsection</inline><inline font-weight="bold"> 5E</inline><inline font-weight="bold">(1)</inline><inline font-weight="bold"> (after the definition of </inline><inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">couple</inline><inline font-weight="bold">)</inline></para><para>Insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">interdependence relationship </inline>means a relationship between 2 persons that is acknowledged by both and that involves:</para><para>	(a)	living together; and</para><para>	(b)	being closely interdependent; and</para><para>	(c)	having a continuing commitment to mutual emotional and financial support.</para><para>(5)	Schedule 1, page 11 (after line 15), before item 20, insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">19</inline><inline font-weight="bold">B  Subparagraphs 5E(2)(b)(i) to (iii)</inline></para><para>Repeal the subparagraphs, substitute:</para><para>	(i)	the person is living with another person (in this paragraph called the <inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">partner</inline>);</para><para>	(ii)	the person is not legally married to the partner;</para><para>	(iii)	the person and the partner are, in the Commission's opinion (formed as mentioned in section 11A), in an interdependence relationship;</para><para>(6)	Schedule 1, page 11 (after line 15), before item 20, insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">19C  After subsection 5R(3)</inline></para><para>Insert:</para><para>	(3A)	The determinations made under subsection (3) are to be applied to individual cases only and not to classes of persons.</para></motion><para>These requests for amendments deal with entitlements to same-sex couples. The bill brings beneficial changes to veterans and their partners in the form of increased bereavement allowance. It recognises the general rate in the payment for 12 weeks which will follow the death of a veteran, and the surviving partner will benefit from this recognition. Of course, not all dependants of veterans will benefit from any of these changes. Partners of many veterans continue to be excluded from benefits rightly due to them because of the definition of `couple', which does not include same-sex partners. In many ways this is an echo of the debate we have already had on superannuation.</para><para>We Democrats have a longstanding commitment to removing discrimination against same-sex couples and people in other family relationships, and that includes veterans. We have continued to do so, without success thus far in a comprehensive way, over a long time because we know that, eventually, the government of the day will have to deal with this issue. It was only after repeated and persistent pressure from the Democrats that we finally dealt with most of the key issues of discrimination within superannuation. But of course we ought not stop there, and today we look to the issue of discrimination within the veterans community.</para><para>We propose to insert into section 5E(1) of the Veterans' Entitlements Act a definition of `interdependent relationship'. The legislation currently provides that a partner can only be of the opposite sex. Our amendment will remove that requirement. The Democrats are concerned that, notwithstanding that gay and lesbian personnel have legally served in the Australian armed forces since 1992, there are no entitlements for, or even recognition of, their partners. Our position is simple: all defence personnel ought to have the right to have their partner of choice recognised if they wish.</para><para>Changes in a number of areas, which recognise the rights of same-sex partners, have been made in federal and, more particularly, state parliaments. The sky has not fallen in and the institution of marriage has not been abolished; indeed the world has gone on much as it did before, except that a significant proportion of the community who were discriminated against socially, financially and legally are not now. That is what this issue is about. It continues to be disappointing to have to keep presenting this argument, which has been raised a number of times previously and spoken against in terms of the degree of fear and misunderstanding that I think still exists in the community. I would ask senators here today to genuinely consider the basic issue that lies at the heart of our amendments, which is simply equal treatment. The degree of antagonism and discrimination against gay and lesbian people is an unsupportable actionâI would argue as unsupportable as racism, which is roundly and rightly condemned in the community. </para><para>I believe the community is supportive of equal treatment. That has been shown by the general support for legislative changes on same-sex issues in all states and territories, including most recently here in the ACT. It is a great shame that the federal parliament is lagging behind community views. We will continue to try and ensure that we get positive outcomes so that discrimination ceases to occur and that, in particular, it ceases within federal legislation. </para><para>Australian lesbian women and gay men will continue to be part of the defence forces. They are currently serving in Iraq. They will eventually become veterans. They will die and some will leave behind lifelong partners. Our position is simple: all defence personnel and veterans ought to have the right of their partner of choice recognised if they wish. Our government is quite willing to send these people overseas to engage in combat duties and to even have them put their life on the line for their country, yet their partners are in a situation where they are not entitled to the benefits brought about by the Veterans' Entitlements Act. </para><para>It is quite relevant at this time to consider the serving personnel in Iraq. Their same-sex partners will have been as concerned for their welfare and safety as any legally married or de facto person for their partner. They will have suffered the same anxiety of separation and unknown dangers; they will have the same hopes of a safe return. A gay or lesbian veteran deserves to expect no less than any other veteran would expect at the end of their service when their partners will get the recognition of the special debt that we owe these personnel who have served their country. </para><para>Adding to this view is the relatively recent case of Mr Edward Young, a veteran in that very position. He took his claim of discrimination against our government to the United Nations Human Rights Commission. The commission found against the Commonwealth and has called on the government to respond to it and to remedy it. But, regrettably, to date the government has ignored that and the discrimination continues.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>136</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is not likely that consideration of the bill will be completed tonight.

This observation was first declared in 1988, and some 12 or so years ago a red ribbon was chosen as its symbol. I was very pleased to attend an event marking this day this morning, addressed by the Minister for Health and Ageing, the Hon. Tony Abbott, with a number of my parliamentary colleagues present. I want to reiterate and support some of the words of the minister this morning. He observed:</para></talk.start><quote><para>HIV-AIDS is indeed a challenge to our society, a challenge to confront our prejudices as well as our behaviours and to attempt to be more consistently our best selves. AIDS is a health issue; it is not a moral issue. Diseases are to be treated, not judged. We are certainly entitled to make judgments about behaviour, but we should not be judgmental about people. And people with AIDS are our brothers and sisters, who deserve to be treated with respect and compassion. And if they are diminished, all of us are diminished. AIDS Awareness Week should not be an occasion for moralising. There should be no moralising about personal choices and also no moralising about an allegedly discriminatory society, because in Australia's case it just would not be true.</para></quote><para>The minister went on to make further remarks in relation to current government activity on HIV issues. </para><para>In 2004 the number of people in the world living with HIV is 37.8 million. The number of new infections in the calendar year 2003 was 4.8 million. The theme of this year's World AIDS Day is `Women, girls, HIV and AIDS'. It is useful to understand why this theme was chosen. From a global perspective, women and girls comprise an increasing proportion of people living with HIV, rising from 41 per cent in 1997 to almost halfâthat is 48 per centâat the end of 2003. This proportion is even more striking for younger women, who represent the majority of young people living with HIV-AIDS globally, at a phenomenal 62 per cent.  </para><para>Young women and girls are more susceptible to HIV than men and boys, with studies showing that they can be 2Â½ times more likely to be HIV infected than their male counterparts. The World AIDS Day message on the World AIDS Day web site says:</para><quote><para>In the global context, women are twice as likely to contract HIV from a single act of unprotected sex, but they remain dependent on male cooperation to protect themselves from infection. In addition, all over the world women are expected to take the lead in domestic work and provide care to family members. HIV and AIDS have significantly increased the burden of care for many women. Poverty and poor public services have also combined with AIDS to turn the care burden for women into a crisis with far-reaching social, health, and economic consequences.</para></quote><para>The World AIDS Day web site goes on to enumerate the key messages which UNAIDS has been promoting throughout 2004. They are messages which concentrate on education and protectionâthe protection, most particularly, of young womenâand they are very important messages.</para><para>I want to refer specifically, momentarily, to women in Africa. In sub-Saharan Africa girls and young women are twice as likely to be infected by HIV as young men, having up to six times the infection rate of their male peers, in certain parts of the subregion. In parts of eastern and southern Africa more than one third of girl teenagers are infected with HIV. In making some observations about the impact of HIV on women, it is fair to say that I have read a lot and listened to a lot of reports but this year for the first time I had the opportunity to visit Africa, in particular Mozambique and Kenya. I would describe the experience, from my perspective, as a reality adjustment. I met positive women, community workers, NGO representatives and medical professionals dealing with the challenge of HIV in Africaâand its impact on women in particular.</para><para>I want to refer briefly to two groups with whom we met. The first was in Mozambique in the capital city of Maputo. It was a group called Kindlimuka, which means `wake up' in the Shangane language. They are the makers of the beaded red ribbon that I wear here in the chamber today. Kindlimuka is an association of people living with HIV-AIDS and their objectives are to support people living with HIV, to support the children of parents who have died of AIDS, to provide some social solidarity amongst those who are infected and affected, and to educate families and communities to reduce infections. </para><para>I have had contact with a lot of community organisations that work with HIV in Australia, but now I have seen the extraordinary challenge that faces a group like Kindlimuka in Mozambique and what they are dealing with when there are few resources and such an enormous stigma attached to, and discrimination against, people living with HIV. Their work in counselling, home based care, advocacy, prevention, sustainability of life and support for children is a very challenging undertaking for them and they are extraordinary people.</para><para>The second group I want to refer to is a group from Kenya called KENWA. I wanted to describe it as an extraordinary organisation but that does not really say enough. It is supported by AusAID in some of its activities. It received significant support from the former Australian High Commissioner to Kenya, Paul Comfort. KENWA is the Kenya Network of Women with AIDS and their stated purpose is `fighting stigma and discrimination against people with AIDS'. Their very entertaining journal is called <inline font-style="italic">Give me a Chance</inline>. It is run by a woman called Asunta Wagura, who is possibly one of the most powerful people I have ever met anywhere in the world. She was diagnosed with HIV 16 years ago. She is the mother of a small male child. She was completely rejected by her family and asked to leave her home with her child. It is not an unfamiliar story. I have heard many similar stories of women infected by their husbands and then simply thrown out with their children. And their only option is to fight to survive. When Asunta put KENWA together, she describes it in the journal <inline font-style="italic">Give me a Chance</inline> by saying: </para><quote><para>âKENWA has grown in leaps and bounds from an organization of just five distraught women slightly over ten years ago, to a force of over 3000 strong ladies and in excess of 1000 orphans. This growth has meant that we have to leave our cribs and stop suckling our thumbs. And with thousands more looking out for us, and our membership swelling by the hour, we must have our nets ready for a great harvest.â</para></quote><para>Asunta Wagura is an absolutely phenomenal person. We heard many similar stories of infected women. She took us to some village communities near Nairobi to see first-hand the work of KENWAâtheir headquarters, the literature they distribute, the education and awareness work they do, the counselling they provide, their drop-in centres in villages, their support for educational activities for children who are infected or are from affected families, and most particularly their individual support programs for women with HIV, which encompass medication, food, shelter and clothing. </para><para>We went to the extremely humble homes of some of the HIV-positive women. Their homes are dirt floored. They are bamboo or cane huts and they do not have electricity, running water or sanitation. HIV-positive women are living with their families in the most extraordinary circumstances. They are supported by this extraordinary organisation with basic nutrition and medication, and they are fighting for their lives. It is an extremely challenging and confronting experience. </para><para>I want to read one paragraph from <inline font-style="italic">Give me a Chance</inline>. It is a testimony from an HIV-positive woman in part of the magazine called `Voices'. She was quite young when she was diagnosed but she was already the mother of two and pregnant. After her newborn baby died she went back to her old job of laundering linen because she had to make ends meet. She said:</para><quote><para>Then I come across KENWA. One of my friends introduced me to this group and told me all about their activities. Once I became a regular face at the KENWA drop-in point in Soweto, people changed their attitudes towards me. Most of my clothes laundering clients just put two and two together after they saw me associating with KENWA. They rationalized that nothing else could make me stick out my neck if I wasn't HIV positive. That's when my problems begun. </para><para>My clients now severed all ties with me. Nobody wanted me to touch their clothes. These were the same people I was depending on for my livelihood. It's like they were now telling me that I could as well starve to death ...</para></quote><para>She goes on to say:</para><quote><para>It's not different in church. Sometimes, other church members don't want to fellowship with me because of my HIV status. I've heard some of them whisper behind my back that I am a prostitute. I wish they knew that HIV/AIDS is not a respecter of persons. </para></quote><para>That sort of story is pretty much the norm some daysâperhaps most daysâin places like that, but organisations like KENWA play an extremely important role.</para><para>In closing, I want to comment on the impact of the pandemic in our region and the very important commitment of Minister Downer and the Australian government to address this. It is not possible to overstate how important it is for responsible Western democracies and for those who want to take leadership on this issue to stand up and look after the people of this region. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tangentyere Council: 25th Anniversary</title><title>Central Land Council: 30th Anniversary</title><page.no>140</page.no></subdebateinfo><title>Central Land Council: 30th Anniversary</title><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>140</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âTonight I want to pay tribute to two organisations in Alice Springs.

These two organisations were formed in Alice Springs in the 1970s to address Aboriginal people's needs. </para></talk.start><para>I congratulate the Alice Springs Aboriginal housing organisation known as Tangentyere Council on its 25 years of operation. Tangentyere is one of the largest Aboriginal organisations in Central Australia and it celebrated the 25th anniversary of its incorporation on 11 November. In the Arrernte language, Tangentyere means `working together'. It was formed by Aboriginal people like Geoff Shaw and Eli and Wenten Rubuntja, who is of course a famous artist, to provide basic services such as running water and shelter to Aboriginal people living on the fringes of Alice Springsâwhat is commonly known today as the `town camps'.</para><para>Over the years, 18 Aboriginal housing associations were formed in Alice Springs and have come together under the banner of Tangentyere Council. Most now have special purpose leases or town camps, as I said, which provide permanent housing for their members. Tangentyere's services range from regular garbage collection to repairs and maintenance on houses. Tangentyere Council operates one of the most successful community development employment programs as well as other community development programs.</para><para>I congratulate the members and the executive of Tangentyere Council, its executive director William Tilmouth and its staff for keeping the passion alive. I was privileged to be at the anniversary celebrations in Alice Springs and to witness the pride that people rightly have in Tangentyere's achievements. It was great to listen to some elders, such as Eli and Wenten and Geoff Shaw, tell tales of the struggles back in the seventies, how it came together and how much they feel they have progressed in providing a service for their people.</para><para>Today a quarter of the Aboriginal population of Alice Springs lives on the special purpose leases that are scattered in and around Alice Springs. I am sure people who have been to Alice Springs would have noticed them. Some are quite central and others are on the fringes of the town. People from a range of Central Australian language groups live on the leases, including members of the Arrernte clan groups, who are the traditional owners of the land that Alice Springs was built on. The traditional owners won recognition of their native title rights in Alice Springs in 2000. And they have recently begun the development of a new Alice Springs urban subdivision, following negotiations with the Northern Territory governmentâan area known as Larapinta.</para><para>Arrernte elder and lawman Wenten Rubuntja, whom I mentioned earlier, was Tangentyere Council's first president. He is much loved in Alice Springs and nationally and he played a prominent part in the celebrations. Wenten is a renowned artist and a former member of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. He is also closely associated with the struggle for land rights in Central Australia. In fact he wrote a fabulous book, which was launched by Ray Martin, called <inline font-style="italic">The t</inline><inline font-style="italic">own grew up dancing</inline><inline font-style="italic">,</inline> about his story and the land rights struggle of Alice Springs. As a former Chairman of the Central Land Council, he also played an important part in the celebrations of their 30th anniversary in Alice Springs on 8 October. The Central Land Council is the second organisation I want to pay tribute to tonight for its 30 years of operations in Alice Springs. Unfortunately, I could not be at the celebrations on 8 October to congratulate people personally, as I was out mobile polling and it was the day before the federal election. However, the member for Lingiari was there and conveyed to me that the celebrations at Blatherskite Park were inspiring. </para><para>The Central Land Council held its first meeting in 1974 following recommendations from Justice Woodward's report into land rights in the Northern Territory. Aboriginal people had gone from believing they owned all of the land to legally owning none of it according to the British Crown. The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, drafted by the Whitlam government and introduced with modifications by the Fraser government, was an attempt to redress this dispossession. The Northern Land Council and the Central Land Council were given the statutory role of advocating and fighting for Aboriginal people's rights to their traditional lands in the Northern Territory.</para><para>The birth of the Northern Territory Aboriginal land councils and the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act also saw the birth of the Northern Territory's Country Liberal Party. It was formed predominantly in Alice Springs and was largely formed, of course, to fight the move to establish Aboriginal land rights. True to its roots, the CLP tried to block every land claim during its reign, wasting millions of dollars in court processes to frustrate the process. As a result, most land hand-back ceremonies have been bittersweet events for claimants, as they remember the elders who have passed away since the claim was lodged.</para><para>Many people have contributed to the success of the Central Land Council over the years, including many impressive regional delegates, executive members and chairs such as Maxie Stuart, Bruce Braedon and the current chair, William Brown Jampijinpa. The CLC's long-serving David Ross, or `Rossie' as he is known, also deserves recognition for his responsibilities and professional management of the council's work. Land councils often wear criticisms for problems such as poor health and education outcomes for people on the lands, problems that are not within the land councils' statutory roles concerning land ownership. They are rightly matters between Indigenous people, their communities and the responsible government partnersâwho are actually willing to work with Aboriginal people rather than dictate to them what the government partners believe would be the best outcomes.</para><para>The Northern Territory Land Council and the Northern Territory Labor government have worked together since 2001 on a range of possible amendments to the Aboriginal Land Rights Act to make it more workable. These amendments include measures to streamline the mining application process. They will work with the outcomes of the current review of the Northern Territory Mining Act. How the federal government gaining control of the Senate next year will affect Aboriginal people's rights to their land in the Northern Territory is unclear at present. We do not yet have the government's proposed changes to the Aboriginal Land Rights Act before us, although we know that there has been an agreed document between the Northern Territory government and the northern and central land councils to improve and strengthen that act. Hopefully, the federal government will not listen to the most extremist rhetoric about the land councils and the Aboriginal Land Rights Act and a realistic look at the act will find sensible improvements that can be made with the support of all parties involved. It will also find many achievements of the land councils worth celebrating. </para><para>So again I congratulate the Central Land Council on its 30th anniversary and for 30 years of speaking up for people's country and keeping the culture strong. Despite what this government might think, there are Aboriginal organisations out there doing some great work while facing extreme pressure and uncertainties. It seems that, since the election, this government has adopted the attitude of blaming the victim and taken the carrot and stick approach and has not really taken the time to celebrate or even recognise the wonderful achievements occurring with Indigenous people. The Executive Director of Tangentyere Council, Willy Tilmouth said:</para><quote><para>Alice Springs is traditional Aboriginal Land. It is Aboriginal country. With the advent of colonisation, we were displaced on to the fringe of society. From that time on, there has been a contest for spaceâspace to live, to strengthen culture and to be Aboriginal. Through the formation of Tangentyere Council, the endeavour to share this space has taken on a united voice in the struggle for equality.</para></quote><para>That struggle has continued through the work of the Central Land Council. Tonight I want to convey my tributes to two organisations in the Northern Territory that I believe are doing an outstanding job in standing up for, and protecting and defending the rights of, Aboriginal people, ensuring that they will be there for all time. I congratulate past members and current members who are involved and work with the Tangentyere Council and the Central Land Council in Alice Springs.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Community Affairs References           Committee: Report</title><page.no>142</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>142</page.no><name role="metadata">Humphries, Sen Gary</name><name role="display">Senator HUMPHRIES</name><name.id>KO6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to comment on the Senate Community Affairs References Committee report <inline font-style="italic">Forgotten Australians: a report on Australians who experienced institutional or out-of-home care as children. </inline>The report was tabled on 30 August 2004, the last sitting day before the federal election. As it was not possible for all the members of the committee to speak on that occasion, I would now like to put some remarks on the record. Honourable senators are aware that, as a rule, we put aside our political differences when working on references like this one and we focus very much on public interest in the work that goes on in these inquiries. We attempt to discern what is in the broader community interest in reaching conclusions and making recommendations.</para></talk.start><para>Occasionally one is aware that both public and private needs are addressed by committee processes such as this. This is very much the case in this inquiry into the circumstances of children lodged in institutions and out-of-home settings in Australia, particularly over the last 50 years. This much was evident from many deeply personal submissions and deeply personal live testimony before the committee over many months. Members of the committee were acutely aware of the pain underlying the submissions and hence of the enormous courage that underpinned so many of the care leavers. We were conscious that the mere penning of a submission by a care leaver, and even more so an actual appearance before the committee, was frequently a seminal moment for that person. Despite the obvious pain for many, we were also aware that the experience was sometimes cathartic, a major watershed in the lives of so many engaging in the process.</para><para>I personally felt a deep sense of privilege in being able to hear stories from people who had never before given those accounts, even to members of their own families, much less to a parliamentary inquiry. The committee heard evidence of the grossest assaults on the dignity and wellbeing of inmatesâI think that is the best word to useâof a variety of institutions, made all the more horrifying because those inmates were children, even very young children, who deserved love and protection, not the kind of treatment they received. </para><para>The cruelty devised for these children is difficult to understand in contemporary Australia. Residents of these institutions were routinely depersonalised, separated from toys and objects of comfort, kept in isolation, beaten, forced to work long hours and often undernourishedâto say nothing of the activities of sadists and sexual predators who lived among them. Many snippets of evidence lodge in the memory and are tellingly poignantâthe story of a girl struggling desperately to be the strength and comfort for her younger siblings, yet deliberately separated from them in the same institution as a means of breaking her will. Indifference and neglect would have been bad enough, had it not so frequently been interspersed with callous manipulation and calculated torment. </para><para>There are many accounts from the evidence which are worth quoting. The conditions that these young people lived in were quite horrifying. One springs to mind:</para><quote><para>The home resembled a work house; we were made to work everyday and all day in dreadful conditions. The house laundered sheets for the local hospital. From early morning to late evening we laundered or ironed dirty soiled hospital sheets. Some of the home girls were intellectually disabled. They were forced to wash soiled sheets in large machines like coppers ... The only time we were allowed to break was for meal times ... I remember the hunger, the work and the attitude of contempt for the staff. They made us feel worthless ... I was 15 years old when I went to the Salvation Army home. We had not committed any crime. But we were locked away like criminals.</para></quote><para>Punishment was severe. Again, the report says:</para><quote><para>As a bedwetter, I used to be beaten daily. They used to throw me under a cold shower and belt me really hard with a large strap where I was wet. This was extremely painfulâespecially in winterâand left big red marks on my body. They also used to rub my face in the wet sheets and then my brother had to wash them.</para></quote><para>It goes on to say:</para><quote><para>They taught me bitterness, hatred, an abiding repugnance for their brand of religion, distrust and suspicion of most adults, contempt for authority in all its forms and intolerance of others. I gained an inheritance of moral confusion, abiding anger, psychological scars and a determination to never again allow anyone to treat me as they had; no matter what. Hence I carried a âchip on my shoulderâ of incredible proportions. It almost bore me down.</para></quote><para>Some questions arose at points at this inquiry about how many children suffered in such circumstances; what proportion were criminally mistreated and how many were not. The evidence on this score is ambiguous; it is also arguably irrelevant. What matters is that abuse and maltreatment occurred on a large scale and little or nothing was ever done about it in many cases. This is the legacy we must now face; this is the private agony that public policy must now come to terms with.</para><para>Above all, we must understand that the issues that arose in these settings resonate still with countless thousands of our citizens. Each of them has one thing in common: when these acts of callousness and depravity occurred each was under the nominal protection of government, a duty which so often was spectacularly dishonoured. That is why this report must spur action, put in place services and support for the survivors of these institutions, open archives and records that have been locked away, and demand from the institutions and their successors that they fully and candidly acknowledge their role in this suffering and make proper amends for it. </para><para>In the time since this report was tabled, a great deal of private agony has been opened up in Australian society by people who have been through those institutions, have read accounts of what occurred and had painful memories resurface about what happened to them. There is only one organisation in Australia at the present time at the national level providing support and advocacy for care leaversâthat is, the Care Leavers of Australia Network, CLAN. It is run by care leavers, not by professional counsellors. It has been inundated with Australians who have had memories revived and who have a desire to tell their harrowing stories and get support and care. This has simply become overwhelming for the two care leavers who constitute the telephone service offered by CLAN. They have their own histories to deal with as well as listening to the life stories of others. What is clear is that organisations like CLAN, and particularly CLAN, need to have access to assistance and to professional and specialised counsellors.</para><para>The committee recommends that those services be provided by state governments and funded by institutions who have had some responsibility in the delivery of a poor quality of care to these people. The federal government may have a role to play in that. I believe, as a matter of urgency, consideration needs to be given to what help can be provided federally to assist in resolving the problems of organisations like CLAN. The report also recommends that there be a conference at the national level of service providers and advocacy and support groups with the aim of establishing a national professional support and advocacy body for care leavers and that this be funded by Commonwealth and state governments. I recommend that those issues be examined quickly and with some urgency.</para><para>Despite a wide variety of experiences unified only by the completely unconscionable nature of the treatment each of these care leavers received, they exhibited throughout one powerful human quality: courage. I saw time and again fellow Australians, their faces contorted in the effort of what they were struggling to do, putting on the public record a shameful episode in our national story at great personal cost to themselves. These were no ordinary witnesses pushing their politicians for some self-serving purpose; these were people bringing to light a dark chapter in the life of our community and serving a vital community interest in the process. They deserve our support in facing the future.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Eureka Stockade: 150th Anniversary</title><page.no>144</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>144</page.no><name role="metadata">Marshall, Sen Gavin</name><name role="display">Senator MARSHALL</name><name.id>00AOP</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise tonight to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Eureka Stockade, which took place in Ballarat in my home state of Victoria on 3 December 1854. The battle at the Eureka Stockade was a defining moment in Australia's development as a nation. It was a revolution, a struggle for principle and a stand against injustice and oppression. It established the principle that persons have a right to free expression, to protest, to mobilise and to struggle collectively without fear of punishment from the state. It was a monumental event that shaped our democracy. Indeed, some say it was the birth of Australian democracy.</para></talk.start><para>Eureka was Australia's first multicultural community. There were over 20 nations represented on the goldfields and at least 16 at Eureka. Some of the nations represented included Canada, China, England, Germany, Holland, Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Spain and the United States. Indeed, only two of the miners at Eureka are believed to have actually been born in Australia. In 1854 anyone wishing to mine on the goldfields in Victoria was required to pay a licence fee of 2 every three months for the privilege of doing soâa flat tax. It did not matter whether one was mining day in, day out or once every now and then or whether one's mine shaft was five metres deep or 50 metres deep, everyone was required to pay the same flat tax rate every three months. No consideration was given to one's capacity to pay or the amount of gold found. Everyone paid the same fee. </para><para>John Molony, the author of <inline font-style="italic">Eureka</inline>, noted that many miners queued up in the early days to pay the licence fee, expecting improvements in roads, health facilities and education facilities. However, these improvements were not forthcoming. State enforcement of the licence fee was excessive and unjust. Miners would be forced to stop work twice a week to show officers of the state's gold commission their licences. If the licence, printed on a flimsy piece of paper, had been damaged, fines would be issued to the miner. If someone was found mining without a licence they would be chained to a tree overnight to await the hearing of their case.</para><para>Unrest grew on the Ballarat goldfields for a number of months. The issue of taxation without the basic democratic right of representation led to a number of meetings of miners, where concerns were expressed about licence fees and the policing of the licence fees. The most significant of these meetings were the meeting of the Ballarat Reform League on 11 November and the `monster meeting', as it became known, at Bakery Hill on 29 November, where over 10,000 people gatheredâwhich was about one-third of Ballarat's population in those days. Molony wrote:</para><quote><para>With a veritable bonfire of licence-burning, the meeting broke. No shot was fired by or upon the diggers; few words were spoken in anger, much less in sedition. All had pledged themselves to stand united in the event that the law should be determined to enforce its sanctions on licence-lacking diggers. How they would so standâeven whereâhad not been decided.</para></quote><para>The diggers then marched from Bakery Hill to the area chosen to establish the Eureka Stockade. Tensions came to a head during a predawn raid on Sunday, 3 December, when police and soldiers joined forces against the miners. The violent battle that ensued was brief but remains a significant and powerful event in Australian history. Although the exact figure remains unknown to this day, it is believed around 28 people died at the Eureka Stockade, including six troopers. Many others remained unaccounted for.</para><para>What occurred was not just about taxation; it was about the right of people to have a say in how they were governed. And it worked. The Eureka Stockade worked. The authorities backed down. The licence fee was abolished and in its place a fairer export duty was introduced. Miners gained representation in the legislative council and a say in the democratic processes of the land. A court to deal with miners' disputes was established and land was opened up to miners in a fairer manner. But it was not the victory that mattered. Rather, it was the struggle and the spirit of dissent that defined the battle at the Eureka Stockade. Indeed, that is what we commemorate today.</para><para>I am pleased the Senate has agreed to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Eureka rebellion by flying the symbol of the spirit of it, the Eureka flag, in the Senate entrance foyer from dawn to dusk on Friday. This is an appropriate mark of respect for a truly historic Victorian and Australian event, and I wish to take this opportunity to thank senators for passing my general business motion yesterday and allowing this to occur. The Eureka flag is embedded in Australian history. Also known as the flag of the Southern Cross, the starry banner or the Ballarat Reform League flag, the Eureka flag was first flown at the `monster meeting' of miners on Bakery Hill on 29 November 1854. It is thought to have been designed by a Canadian goldminer by the name of `Lieutenant' Ross and sewn by a number of the women of Eureka. According to Frank Cayley's book <inline font-style="italic">Flag of Stars</inline>, the flag's five stars represent the Southern Cross, and the white cross joining the stars represents unity in defiance. The blue background is believed to represent the blue shirts worn by many of the diggers rather than the sky, as is commonly thought. </para><para>The flag was also flown at the Eureka Stockade prior to and at the time of the attack by soldiers and police on Sunday, 3 December 1854. It is recorded that the flag was removed from its pole by Police Constable John King on the morning of the miners' uprising. The flag was presented as evidence at the Eureka trials in Melbourne during February and March 1855. The following extract from <inline font-style="italic">The Eureka Flag: Our Starry</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Banner</inline> expresses a view concerning the significance of the flag:</para><quote><para>The Eureka Flag although flown for only five short days has become indelibly etched into many hearts and souls. It is only a flimsy piece of fabric, but because it commemorates courage, and vindicates human rights it has become a lasting and respected symbol. The miners at Eureka were not committed of treason, and although the Starry Banner is a rebel flag, and âsang the rebel chorusâ, it is not perceived as disloyal to the crown but rather as a sign of triumph, of common rights succeeding over excessive force and unjust laws. The Eureka Flag commemorates victory, although the miners were not victorious in battle!</para><para>Because it began in the hands of the people, of the common mass, it is recognised, commemorated and identified as a flag of the people.</para></quote><para>And don't the flags look fantastic as you drive up to Parliament House this week. The ACT government ought to be congratulated for organising themâthey look just great. So too the parliaments of all Australian states and territories will be flying the Eureka flag on Friday to mark the occasion. As I mentioned before, the Senate will be flying the flag from a flagstaff in the Senate entrance lobby on Friday. It is unfortunate that the flag will not be flown from actual flagpoles within the federal parliamentary precinct, but at least it will be flying here on Friday in one shape or another.</para><para>I am looking forward to travelling to Ballarat to attend a number of Eureka 150 events planned for Friday and the weekend. The Bracks government in Victoria must be congratulated for its commitment to the commemoration of the 150th anniversary of Eureka. The many events which have taken place over the past few weeks and those planned for the next few days have beenâand I am sure will beâa great credit to the organisers and the Victorian government. The Eureka l50 program has been a fitting commemoration of the battle which took place at the Eureka Stockade and a great celebration of democracy, dissent and diversity.</para><para>In conclusion, can I just dispel a misnomer out there that in some way Eureka is a story and an event in Australian history owned by or solely associated with the Australian Labor Party and the wider labour movement. I concede that point to Senator Mason. While it is true that Labor and the wider labour movement do feel a strong connection with the story of Eureka, the reality is Eureka is a profoundly Australian story that we should all embrace. It is a shame the Prime Minister and the federal government have chosen to boycott the Eureka l50 commemoration and have refused to fly the flag in the parliamentary precinct. However, we come to expect that from a government that is conservative first and Australian second. Eureka is a story for everyone. It remains a defining moment not only for Ballarat and Victoria but for Australia as a nation.</para><para>147 </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>19:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>147</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 7.30 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>147</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>147</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following government document was tabled:</para><quote><para>Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Foundation LtdâReport for 2003-04.</para></quote><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><quote><para>Defence ActâDeterminations under section 58HâDefence Force Remuneration TribunalâDeterminations Nos 12 and 14 of 2004.</para><para>Export Control ActâExport Control (Orders) Regulationsâ</para><para>Export Control (Animals) Order 2004.</para><para>Prescribed Goods (General) Amendment Orders 2004 (No. 4).</para><para>Financial Management and Accountability ActâStatement under subsection 55(3) relating to the delay in provision of the 2003-04 Consolidated Financial Statements to the Auditor-General.</para><para>Higher Education Funding ActâDetermination under section 27AâDetermination No. T57-2004.</para><para>Higher Education Support Actâ</para><para>Determination under section 36-15, dated 19 August 2004.</para><para>Funding agreement under section 30-25, datedâ</para><para>2 September 2004âUniversity of Canberra.</para><para>7 September 2004âUniversity of Queensland.</para><para>9 September 2004âUniversity of Sunshine Coast.</para><para>17 September 2004âAustralian Catholic University Limited.</para><para>18 October 2004âUniversity of Southern Queensland.</para><para>22 October 2004âEdith Cowan University.</para><para>25 October 2004â</para><para>Australian Maritime College.</para><para>University of Ballarat.</para><para>University of Tasmania.</para><para>26 October 2004â</para><para>Charles Sturt University.</para><para>Griffith University.</para><para>Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology.</para><para>Southern Cross University.</para><para>Swinburne University of Technology.</para><para>University of New England.</para><para>1 November 2004â</para><para>Monash University.</para><para>Murdoch University.</para><para>Victoria University of Technology.</para><para>11 November 2004â</para><para>Charles Darwin University.</para><para>Curtin University of Technology.</para><para>Deakin University.</para><para>Flinders University of South Australia.</para><para>Queensland University of Technology.</para><para>Notice of approval of a higher education provider under section 16-50âSydney College of Divinity Ltd, dated 26 November 2004.</para></quote></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript></hansard>
