Senator Conroy would normally deal with this bill but is unavailable due to the budget being handed down tonight. This bill is a further instalment in the legislative response to community concerns about the rising cost of public liability insurance. Since 2002 state and territory governments have engaged in a process of reforming their negligence laws to reduce public liability claims costs. These reforms have included caps on damages, thresholds to prevent the commencement of actions in relation to minor injuries and changes to the limitation period for bringing an action.</para></talk.start><para>Labor have consistently backed the state tort law reform process and called for Commonwealth action to ensure that it is effective. This bill, like the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2003 which the Senate debated in February, is intended to address the possibility that the state tort law reforms could be undermined by forum shopping. Both these bills respond to recommendations of the Ipp inquiry into the law of negligence. There are a number of provisions of the Trade Practices Act that could form the basis of an action for damages for personal injury or death. Concerns have been expressed to government by the insurance industry that if the Trade Practices Act is not amended, plaintiffs will seek to avoid the restrictions imposed by state and territory civil liability laws by framing an action under the Trade Practices Act. At present there is little evidence that the TPA is being used as the basis for personal injury claims. Nevertheless, Labor accept that forum shopping is technically possible. Consequently, Labor have indicated that we will support amendments to the TPA to address this potential consequence. Labor have always stressed, however, that the amendments must be proportionate to the nature of the problem. We have emphasised that there is no case for abolishing fundamental consumer rights which have stood for decades.</para><para>In the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2003, which I shall refer to as the 2003 bill, the government sought to remove the ability of consumers and the ACCC to recover damages for personal injury and death sustained as a result of conduct breaching the unfair practices provisions in division 1 of part V of the act. Division 1 includes section 52, which prohibits companies from engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct. Many would argue that this is the most important consumer protection provision in the Trade Practices Act. The Senate took the view that the government's bill went too far. It supported amendments moved by Labor and the Democrats which were based on a proposal made by the ACCC. The amendments aligned damages under division 1 of part V with relevant state and territory civil liability laws. The amendments would have had the effect of deterring forum shopping because they would have ensured that plaintiffs could not recover any more under the TPA than in action based on negligence. Unfortunately, the government did not accept these amendments. </para><para>As a consequence of the government's intransigence, there remains a financial incentive to engage in forum shopping. This bill covers TPA provisions relating to: firstly, unconscionable conduct in part IVA; secondly, supply by a manufacturer or importer of unsatisfactory consumer goods in division 2A of part V; and, thirdly, supply by a manufacturer or importer of defective goods in part VA. Instead of abolishing consumers' rights to seek damages for personal injuries sustained as a result of a breach of these provisions, the bill inserts a damages regime into the TPA. The bill introduces a new part VIB which imposes caps, thresholds and limitations on actions for personal injury. In broad terms, these restrictions are consistent with the approach adopted by the states and territories in their tort law reforms.</para><para>I will briefly outline some of the features of this regime. The bill inserts time limits for the commencement of litigation. Proceedings must be instituted within three years of discovering an injury. This limitation is also subject to a long stop provision. Generally speaking, no action for death or injury can be instituted more than 12 years after the act or omission that is alleged to have caused the death or injury. The bill also introduces caps and thresholds in relation to the various heads of damages. Damages for pain and suffering are capped at $250,000. This amount is indexed to the consumer price index. Insurers have indicated that a major factor driving up claims costs has been an increase in the number of small claims. In order to address this issue, the bill inserts a threshold. Damages will not be awarded if the court assesses that the non-economic loss incurred by the plaintiff is less than 15 per cent of the most extreme case.</para><para>Labor accept that thresholds are necessary to restore some balance to public liability arrangements. The bill also caps damages for loss of earnings capacity at two times average weekly earnings. Labor do not believe that the framework set out in part VIB is perfect. In some respects it is more restrictive than state law—for example, the cap on general damages is more than $100,000 below the amount that can be recovered under New South Wales and Victorian civil liability laws. Labor believe that it would be preferable to simply align damages under the TPA with state and territory laws, as we proposed in the 2003 bill.</para><para>Notwithstanding this view, Labor is prepared to support the framework set out in this bill in order to ensure that the potential for forum shopping is dealt with. In March this year Senator Conroy wrote to the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Senator Coonan, inviting the government to extend part VIB to apply to actions brought under part V of division 1. Labor made this proposal in an attempt to break the impasse in relation to the 2003 bill and to ensure that a consistent approach applied to all provisions under the TPA that may give rise to an action for personal injury damages.</para><para>Regrettably, the minister rejected Labor's solution. The government's arguments against the compromise proposal were not convincing. The government argued that the prohibition on misleading and deceptive conduct was never intended to form the basis of an action for personal injury damages. The minister has provided no evidence to support this assertion. Labor believes that the contrary view is strongly supported by the presence of section 4K of the TPA. This section, which was inserted in 1977, makes clear that a reference to loss or damage in the act includes injury. The government also contends that there should be no liability under section 52 for personal injury and death because it is a no-fault provision. By this it means that there is no requirement to prove that a person acted negligently or dishonestly in order for liability to arise under section 52. This argument that section 52 operates unfairly with respect to defendants has been comprehensively rebutted by the ACCC. In fact, ACCC commissioner Ms Jennifer McNeill told the Senate Economics Committee: </para><quote><para>In a situation where a business misleads or deceives a consumer and the consumer suffers damage—in this case, personal injury—as a result, the commission thinks that, as a matter of principle, they should be held accountable and liable for that damage, irrespective of intention.</para></quote><para>Ms McNeill said that this was `because it is much more within the control of the business involved whether and how the representations are made; it is not within the control of the consumer whether and how the representations are made'.</para><para>In any event, the government's approach to the no-fault provisions is inconsistent. Under the bill we are considering today, the government proposes to allow the recovery of personal injury damages for breach of other no-fault provisions in the act. For example, section 74D of part VA gives consumers the right to bring an action for damages where goods are not of merchantable quality. In proceedings based on section 74D the consumer does not have to show that the manufacturer of the goods knew or should have known that they were flawed. Nevertheless, in this bill the government accepts that a breach of section 74D which causes personal injury should be able to form the basis of an action for damages. Labor does not believe that there is any justification for this inconsistent approach adopted by the government. All provisions of the TPA which could form the basis of an action for personal injury damages should be treated in the same way.</para><para>The final argument made by the government is that the Ipp committee recommended the abolition of the right to seek personal injury damages for breach of section 52. The Ipp review terms of reference were very narrow. The committee was specifically instructed to develop and evaluate options to prevent individuals from commencing an action under the TPA. It did not have an open brief. Furthermore, it should be noted that the Ipp review seems to be holy writ only when the government wants it to be. In this bill, for instance, the government inserts a discount rate of five per cent for future economic loss despite the fact that the Ipp review recommended that a three per cent rate apply.</para><para>Labor believe that the parliament is entitled to make its own judgment on these matters. We are not convinced that actions for personal injury arising under division 1 of part V should be treated differently from actions for personal injury arising under other parts of the act. In order to ensure that there is a consistent approach to actions for personal injury damages under the act and to deter forum shopping, Labor will move amendments to the bill to extend the application of part VIB. It is therefore hoped that the government will reconsider its opposition to extending the scope of this part of the bill.</para><para>Labor has grave doubts about whether the government really wants to develop a balanced and workable solution to the issue of forum shopping. The government has spent the last couple of months engaging in some misleading conduct of its own. It has incorrectly told community groups that failure to pass the 2003 bill is keeping their public liability premiums high. As I am sure the minister knows full well, the provisions of the TPA that we are discussing only apply to corporations engaged in trade or commerce. Consequently, they have virtually no application to the community sector. </para><para>The government has also accused Labor of obstructing attempts to reduce insurance premiums for small business. The reality is that the government must explain to small businesses why it has failed to ensure that the savings already being realised from state tort law reforms are not flowing through to them. The most recent ACCC price monitoring report issued in February showed that insurers are making substantial underwriting profits on public liability business and are set to reap a sizeable windfall. The report indicates that the state tort law reforms have begun to take effect. The ACCC found that claims costs for personal injury and death fell by 14 per cent in the first six months of 2003. Despite the fall in claims costs, insurers have indicated that premiums will continue to rise. At the start of the tort law reform process in 2002, Labor warned the government that unless the ACCC was given the power to ensure that cost savings generated by the reforms were passed on to consumers in the form of lower premiums insurers would simply pocket the savings. Regrettably, this seems to be what is now occurring. Rather than running misleading scare campaigns, the government should act to ensure that consumers benefit from tort law reform—not just the insurance companies.</para><para>Before I conclude I would like briefly to canvass some other amendments Labor will be moving in relation to the bill. Labor has been advised that the bill may have an impact on future litigation against companies in the tobacco industry. Without judging the merits of any such action, Labor does not believe that reforms intended to address concerns about public liability premiums were intended to have any impact on the prospects of tobacco litigation. We note that most states have specifically excluded tobacco litigation from their civil liability reforms. In the committee stage, Labor will move amendments to ensure that the caps on damages and the long stop period contained in the bill do not apply in relation to tobacco cases. I will outline these amendments in more detail during the committee stage.</para><para>In conclusion, while we will move some amendments, Labor support the objective of this bill. The bill restricts damages under the TPA to ensure that the state and territory reforms are not undermined but, unlike the 2003 bill, it does not abolish fundamental consumer rights. In Labor's view this represents a more proportionate and balanced approach to the problem. The amendments that Labor will move in the committee stage will ensure that this regime applies to the other provisions of the TPA that could form the basis of an action for personal injury. We encourage the government to support these amendments so that the issue of forum shopping can finally be resolved.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>22728</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The predecessor of the <inline ref="R1993">Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill (No. 2) 2004</inline> was dealt with by my colleague Senator Ridgeway, but in his absence this afternoon I will take the bill forward. It is not as if I come to it as of new, in that I am a member of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee that inquired into the provisions of the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2003, which was this bill's predecessor. That committee reported in August 2003. Because this matter has been dealt with before and because we have put our views on record at length before, I do not intend to take up the time of the chamber for the full 20-minute allocation but I do have a number of points I wish to make.</para></talk.start><para>The first is an attack on the fundamental suppositions made in the Ipp review. My belief for a long time has been that if that Ipp panel had been reviewed in court, they would have thrown out some of its findings on the basis that errors of fact were apparent. They should not have come to the conclusion they did because they neither had the evidence to do so nor did they have the facts before them to do so. In that regard, that view of mine has been confirmed this morning when I reread the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest No. 114</inline>. I wish to quote at length from some of the remarks in the early pages of that digest: </para><quote><para>In response to the insurance crisis, the Federal Government, in May 2002, appointed an expert panel of persons to review the operation of the laws of negligence and related provisions in the TPA and state and territory fair trading legislation. The expert panel was directed to recommend changes to personal injury law to solve the insurance crisis.</para><para>The terms of reference for the expert panel included the following statement: The award of damages for personal injury has become unaffordable and unsustainable as the principal source of compensation for those injured through the fault of another. It is desirable to examine a method for the reform of the common law with the objective of limiting liability and quantum of damages arising from personal injury and death.</para></quote><para>That quote was taken from the review of the law of negligence final report, the Ipp report, September 2002, at page 9. The digest goes on:</para><quote><para>From this statement it can be shown that the panel took as a given that the frequency and size of personal injury damages payouts was too large and so changes needed to be made to personal injury laws to wind this back.</para><para>There has been debate as to whether or not the expert panel should have started from this point. It has been argued that the limited range of claims statistics that were available at the time the review was being conducted meant that it would have been difficult to draw any conclusions about trends in personal injury claims and hence the appropriateness of the law. Despite this, the expert panel made 61 recommendations which are set out in the Ipp Report, targeted at reforming personal injury laws.</para></quote><para>In drawing that conclusion, the digest referred also to the article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> on 11 October 2002 titled `Ipp report: long on notions, short on facts'. I hold to that view and so do the Australian Democrats. We think the Ipp report, with respect to these particular recommendations which affect this particular bill, was not justified and has not been validated subsequently. However, the government continues to pursue this.</para><para>The minister with responsibility for this area, the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, is herself a barrister. My opinion of lawyers is that they are often very capable and esteemed people, but all of them will carry a brief and are prepared to pursue a brief regardless of the merits of the case opposing it. In my view, this is just one of those instances. The committee inquiry, the views of those examining this issue and the countless critics of this area all indicate that there is no evidence which justifies the provisions of this bill. In a recent letter from Assistant Treasurer Coonan to Senator Ridgeway, she did say that there are three cases which in her view—which I presume therefore reflects the government's view—indicate that the floodgates are about to be opened to litigation in an area of the Trade Practices Act which has been marked by a singular lack of litigation.</para><para>She enunciated three cases. These are Johnson v. Golden Circle in December 2003, Kaouna v. Orthosports Pty Ltd and Robbs v. Pathology Services Pty Ltd trading as Mayne Health Laverty Pathology. Three cases do not a flood make. They do not invalidate the remarks I have made. In fact, in my view, the development of jurisprudence in this area is a plus, not a minus. It develops an appropriate reference point by which personal injury and damages can be evaluated. In the Australian Democrat minority report on the provisions of the <inline ref="R1781">Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2003</inline>, Senator Ridgeway and I made a number of remarks in our conclusions. We said that the purpose of the bill—to implement the Ipp recommendations—would prevent any actions being taken or damages being awarded for personal injury and loss resulting from contravention of part V, division 1 of the TPA. We said further that there is no evidence that the TPA has been used as an avenue to bypass existing tort law. However, evidence was put forward which highlighted occasions where consumers could be faced with no avenue for redress if the bill proceeded to abolish a right of action completely under the TPA for personal injury and death. The Australian Consumers Association and the Australian Plaintiff Lawyers Association were not supportive of the bill and preferred that the Senate reject the bill outright. </para><para>I remain to be convinced that this legislation is remotely needed. I will listen to the debate and participate in the committee stage of the debate of the amendments that are before us. But I advise both the government and the opposition that, at this stage, it is my intention to recommend to my party room that we oppose the bill unless my views alter. I would do so because I, and we, believe that the whole campaign to address insurance provisions and damages provisions at law in both the state and the federal arena has often been predicated on insufficient evidence and balance. We think it has been dedicated primarily to restoring the profitability of insurance companies and not to reducing the costs of claims or indeed the restrictive conditions under which many insurance policies operate.</para><para>We have seen and debated in the Senate countless examples of people who have never had a claim in decades of operating their business, charitable and sporting activities. We have seen those people's premiums escalate enormously. There has been no quid pro quo. No state or federal government and no minister anywhere in Australia has secured a quid pro quo from the insurance industry. They introduce these reforms, these restraints on consumer and human rights, and in return the insurance industry should actually deliver lower cost premiums and broader provisions in their policies. In fact, the whole exercise has resulted in less access at law and much more profitability to the industry.</para><para>That does not mean to say that we are troglodytes. It does not mean to say that we do not recognise that you need to reform the law to ensure bludgers and chancers cannot take advantage of it, but that is why you have judges. That is what jurisprudence is about. That is why you have the whole process of evidence and fact to work through. By and large, Australia, with some peculiar case exceptions, has not been subject to the extraordinary problems that you might expect from some of the hyperbole that I have seen printed and published. In fact, if we have to look at the prime causes of problems in the insurance industry in this country, they most of all relate to the greed of corporate bureaucrats, the mismanagement of major insurance companies and the inability to properly assess risk. They have very little to do with inadequacies in tort or any other law.</para><para>The Democrats do not believe that forum shopping has occurred to any extent. We do not believe that the early signs are there that there is going to be a flood of forum shopping resulting from the fact that the Commonwealth law, at least within the Trade Practices Act, remains a little more open and accessible to damages claims than do the tightened state laws. We do not believe that there has been sufficient justification for the large-scale limitations that have been placed on individuals' ability to take legal action in the state law. We do not believe that those state decisions, which we think have been overkill and an overreaction, should be reflected in Commonwealth law at all. You will gather from my remarks that we are not particularly excited about, interested in or pleased by the legislation that is before us. As I said at the outset, subject to what I hear in the debate and the committee process, it is my intention to recommend to my colleagues that we consider opposing the bill outright at the third reading. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>22731</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to address just one aspect of the <inline ref="R1993">Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill (No. 2) 2004</inline>, and that is that the changes proposed in this bill, whether they were intended or not, will have the very serious effect of limiting the opportunity in Australia for suing the tobacco industry. I am grateful to the Cancer Council of Victoria for their submission, which very clearly outlines the dangers associated with this legislation for action against tobacco companies. In their submission to the inquiry into the proposed legislation they say:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The Bill imposes limits on personal injury damages for non-economic loss (Division 3) on personal injury damages for loss of earning capacity ... and on personal injury damages for gratuitous attendant care services ... provides that no exemplary or aggravated damages may be awarded in respect of death or personal injury ... and introduces new limitation periods.</para></quote><para>It is that last point that I most want to draw the Senate's attention to. The effect of the limits on damages and removal of exemplary or aggravated damages is obvious. Again, in the view of the Cancer Council of Victoria:</para><quote><para>... there are no policy justifications for such changes insofar as they would apply to claims against the tobacco industry—there are no public liability insurance issues.</para></quote><para>But the new limitation periods are very significant. Under the proposal, no claim could be brought more than 12 years following an act or an omission alleged to have caused death or disease—the so-called long-stop period—unless the period is extended by a court. Given that tobacco related disease invariably involves a long latency period, virtually no claim could be brought against the tobacco industry for tobacco related disease without the prior permission of the court. This requirement would deliver an enormous benefit to the tobacco industry.</para><para>I would be very surprised if either the Labor Party or the government thought that this was reasonable or that this was, on the part of the government, an intended outcome. This bill is supposed to be about the cost and availability of public liability insurance, not giving the tobacco industry protection against individuals or indeed the government in taking action to recover the many billions of dollars that smoking costs in health effects alone. The regulation impact statement to the first bill says:</para><quote><para>The purpose of the Review was to assist governments to address the issue of increasing premiums for, and reduced availability of, public liability insurance. The government has acted to ensure that small business, community groups, sporting groups, recreational service providers and the like can continue to organise public events and conduct their activities.</para></quote><para>Without giving a view about the value or otherwise of this bill—as Senator Murray indicates, we will listen to this debate—I think it is fair to say that the Democrats are very much opposed to this bill being used to give the tobacco industry a way out. The tobacco industry does not, of course, hold public liability insurance. Unlike playing football or holding a street stall, smoking is a very dangerous, life-threatening and highly addictive activity. In the United States the tobacco industry agreed to pay the US states around $US246 billion over 25 years from 1998 as result of litigation and, as I understand it, the United States Federal Justice Department is now taking steps to recover even more costs. </para><para>The Democrats would like to see the industry sued in this country, too, for its misleading, deceptive and unconscionable behaviour, for lying to smokers about the harmful effects of its product—taken as directed, I might say—and for plying its product to children. We have pressed the ACCC to take action here very aggressively. The response has been, `We can't afford the legal costs.' If a government agency cannot afford to take legal action against the tobacco industry, then individuals are certainly not going to be able to, even though some have tried and with some success. Of course, the government's reluctance to empower the ACCC through funding is a great disappointment, given that smoking already costs an estimated $670 million a year in smoking related diseases, and that is just in our health system.</para><para>Our smoking rates have plateaued after dropping to just under 20 per cent of the population, but 19,000 people still die each year from smoking related disease and many of these people were addicted well before there were warnings on packs and when tobacco companies were allowed to advertise their product. Today there are still people who falsely believe that smoking a mild or a light brand of cigarette will protect their health. The industry continues to deceive consumers. There are still people who were harmed when they were exposed to smoking in utero and as children when smoking was not banned in most public spaces. There are still people who work in hotels and clubs who are being exposed regularly and who inhale other people's smoke. People are taking up smoking at a younger and younger age and more young women are becoming addicted than ever before. The tobacco industry has, in our view, much to answer for and most definitely should not be let off the hook with this legislation. The states have recognised this and it is good that the ALP has drafted an amendment which would exempt tobacco companies. The states have done similarly. They have introduced legislation for the same purpose, but they have excluded tobacco from its reach.</para><para>The Cancer Council of Victoria's submission to the bill points out the government's concern that, in the absence of the proposed changes to the Trade Practices Act, the changes to state laws which address public liability insurance problems could be undermined by resort to the act. In fact, the explanatory memorandum for the first bill says:</para><quote><para>The Review's recommendations were formulated to ensure that the TPA could not be used to undermine any State and Territory laws in relation to claims for damages for personal injuries or death.</para></quote><para>In New South Wales, section 3B(1)(c) of the Civil Liability Act 2002 provides that the act does not apply in respect of:</para><quote><para>... civil liability relating to an award of personal injury damages (within the meaning of Part 2) where the injury or death concerned resulted from smoking or other use of tobacco products ...</para></quote><para>In Victoria, actions or claims for damages in respect of an injury resulting from smoking or other use of tobacco products or exposure to tobacco smoke are excluded from several parts of the revised Wrongs Act 1958.</para><para>In Queensland, section 5(c) of the Civil Liability Act 2003 provides:</para><quote><para>This Act does not apply in relation to any civil claim for damages for personal injury if the harm resulting from the breach of duty owed to the claimant is or includes—</para></quote><para>	...	...	...</para><quote><para>(c) an injury resulting from smoking or other use of tobacco products or exposure to tobacco smoke.</para></quote><para>In WA, the Civil Liability Act 2002, as substantially amended by the Civil Liability Amendment Act 2003, again excludes `damages relating to personal injury that resulted from smoking or other use of tobacco products' from several provisions of that act. In Tasmania, section 3B(1)(b) of the Civil Liability Act 2002 provides that the act does not apply to or in respect of civil liability `relating to an award of damages for personal injury or death where the injury or death concerned resulted from smoking or other use of tobacco products'. </para><para>To be absolutely certain that the Trade Practices Act does not undermine those state laws, it is critically important that an amendment is passed in this place and that it is accepted by the government when that goes to the House of Representatives. It would be useful if the minister could indicate if that will be agreed to. To conclude, the Cancer Council of Victoria's submission says:</para><quote><para>... if either or both of the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2003 and the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill (No. 2) 2004—</para></quote><para>the one we are dealing with here today—</para><quote><para>are passed, they ought to be amended so as not to apply to claims arising out of the use of tobacco products. The policy justifications for the proposed changes do not apply in the context of claims against the tobacco industry. Further, given the scale of the harm caused by tobacco both to individuals and to the community, the effect of legislation making litigation against the tobacco industry more difficult may be to fix the community with substantial costs that might otherwise be paid by the tobacco industry and to weaken the role of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) in regulating the conduct of the tobacco industry.</para></quote></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>22733</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank honourable senators for their contributions on this important bill, the <inline ref="R1993">Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill (No. 2) 2004</inline>. As the Senate is aware, this bill is part of the national framework to support state and territory reforms to the law of negligence. The approach being taken was developed as a result of extensive consultation and hard work by Australian state and territory governments. It is not the sole initiative of this government but is widely supported by all other governments in Australia, industry and the community more broadly.</para></talk.start><para>The reforms, as I have said, are supported by all jurisdictions and have in fact been applauded not only in Australia but also overseas and in particular by underwriters. As a result, we have seen some capacity come back into the market. In fact, reforms undertaken to implement this framework have begun to make liability insurance more affordable and available to community groups and businesses Australia wide. There was a recent initiative with community care in Australia with major insurers underwriting the availability of insurance to community groups. Indeed, there are other examples that I will get to in the course of the debate.</para><para>There is no doubt that Australia was facing a liability insurance market where the cost of cover was rising at the same time as policies were becoming harder and harder to obtain. Some community groups and small businesses in particular simply could not obtain insurance at any price. Since then this government has worked very diligently with state and territory ministers and key stakeholders to develop a national resolution. The bill before the Senate today is a key component in implementing this resolution.</para><para>It did not arise out of some fanciful notion of governments or stakeholders. The bill draws on the findings of an expert panel established at the May 2002 ministerial meeting on public liability insurance, chaired by the Hon. Justice David Ipp of the New South Wales Court of Appeal. The panel was established to assist the Australian government and state and territory governments to formulate as far as we could a consistent and principled approach to reforming liability laws. The review concluded that in many cases a cause of action under the act that we are dealing with today—that is, the Trade Practices Act—is a real alternative to a cause of action in negligence. </para><para>Vital reforms by the states and territories of common law negligence could be undermined unless the Commonwealth made complementary changes to the act. We have already seen repeated evidence of this happening. I have already raised with the Senate a couple of cases—at least, I have now raised three cases privately with colleagues—that I have become aware of in the course of this debate over the past weeks and months in the Senate. Those familiar with the impact of law reform in other areas advise me that it generally takes two or more years before the full impact of such loopholes becomes apparent.</para><para>These reforms are not the kinds of reforms that are like turning on an electric light, where you get some immediate and measurable response. It takes some time for actuarial certainty to flow through to the way in which risks are assessed and to the way actuaries predict the costs of claims. It would be simply flying in the face of both history and experience for the Senate and indeed for my colleagues, I would have thought, to argue that there is no need to fix an obvious loophole that we now recognise until well after it has been fully exploited. That is what has happened in the past. It is really tantamount to arguing that there is no need to shut a gate before a horse bolts when the horse is standing there ready to go. The risk is already identified and well known.</para><para>The expert review clearly and deliberately recommended that the act be amended to prevent claims from being brought forward for personal injury and death under division 1 of part V and to apply rules relating to the quantum of damages and limitation periods to other sections of the act. I am happy to report to the Senate that the state reforms do appear to be working. Australian state and territory governments who have taken action to implement key recommendations of the review now have something to show for our efforts. In the <inline font-style="italic">Age </inline>this morning there was a story by law reporter Fergus Shiel showing how effective the reforms have been in Victoria. Mr Shiel wrote that `personal injury claims have plummeted' since the introduction of reforms in that state, with the number of personal injury writs down from 4,513 to 60. The problem is we already know this kind of improvement will not be sustained, nor will it be sustainable unless the Trade Practices Act is adequately amended to support the state reforms.</para><para>I want to deal very briefly with the differences between the two bills that the Senate has been asked to consider. The Australian government has introduced the <inline ref="R1781">Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2003</inline>. When enacted by this parliament the bill will prevent claims being brought forward for personal injury and death under division 1 of part V. The bill we are actually debating today, the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill (No. 2) 2004, continues this reform agenda and, specifically, will implement recommendations 17 and 21 of the Ipp review. These recommended that the act be amended to apply rules relating to limitation of actions and quantum of damages to personal injury and death claims brought pursuant to an unconscionable conduct claim, which is part IVA; a contravention of the product safety and information provisions, which is division 1A of part V; a supply by a manufacturer or importer of unsatisfactory consumer goods, which is division 2A of part V; or a supply by a manufacturer or importer of defective goods, which is part IVA. </para><para>The approach in this bill of limiting the quantum of damages and establishing a new limitation arrangement for personal injuries and death claims can be distinguished from that taken in the first bill, the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2003 which prevents claims for damages for personal injuries and death under part V, division 1 of the act. The approach taken in the first government bill reflects the view that the Trade Practices Act was not originally intended to provide causes of action to individuals who suffer personal injury and death as a result of misleading and deceptive conduct in the absence of an element of fault. And that is the nub of the matter—in the absence of an element of fault. Allowing claims to be made under the Trade Practices Act in these circumstances sets it aside from regimes where fault is required, such as those in the state and territory governments. Obviously, if they are not aligned one will undermine the other. </para><para>By contrast, the second government bill takes into account parliament's intent that the provisions relating to product safety and information, claims against manufacturers and importers of goods, and product liability should provide a cause of action to individuals who do suffer personal injury and death. There is a very clear difference in intent. Moreover, it is not necessary to remove personal injury and death claims under part IVA as the element of fault required under these provisions will limit the potential for personal injury and death claims and, in fact, will be aligned with the state and territory tort law regimes on fault.</para><para>The government agrees with the Ipp review that limitation on actions and quantum of damages should apply to personal injury and death claims under these parts of the Trade Practices Act. The review panel made a number of specific recommendations on the nature of the limitation periods and quantum of damages that should apply for different heads of damage in relation to personal injury and death claims across all jurisdictions. The bill being debated today will introduce a number of review measures into a new part VIB of the Trade Practices Act. Part VIB will apply these measures to personal injury and death claims brought pursuant to an unconscionable conduct claim, a contravention of the product safety and information provisions, a supply by a manufacturer or importer of unsatisfactory consumer goods or a supply by a manufacturer or importer of defective goods. So there is no suggestion that the government is not cognisant, where parliament intended to provide an action for personal injury and death in relation to certain parts of the act, that they should remain.</para><para>Part VIB will establish new limitation periods for claims and thresholds and caps on awards for various heads of damage. The bill will provide a framework for phasing in damages for non-economic loss depending on the severity of an injury, a mechanism for calculating damages for loss of earning capacity and for gratuitous attendant care services. The bill will also introduce a number of other limits on personal injury damages and will clarify the powers of courts in relevant proceedings to approve structured settlements, which is an earlier reform of this government that was supported in the Senate.</para><para>The government have chosen to incorporate the review's specific recommendations on limitation periods and quantum of damages into the act rather than referring the courts to the relevant state or territory legislation which, we have come to the view, would be much more complex. This approach, which has the support of other jurisdictions and industry, provides a clear and transparent national benchmark for the limitation of actions and quantum of damages in personal injury and death claims. National benchmarks on these matters will facilitate the implementation of nationally consistent reforms giving effect to the resolutions developed and agreed to by ministers. This approach will provide greater certainty and reduced complexity for insurers and underwriters and minimise the incentive for jurisdiction-shopping behaviour by plaintiffs—because it will not make any difference where you bring your action—whilst maintaining remedies for plaintiffs injured in actionable circumstances. </para><para>In the course of the debate—and I may not have heard all of it—there was a return to a suggestion that insurer profits were really what these reforms were all about, rather than a nationally consistent scheme that will bring the balance back into the way in which risk is allocated and the way in which people are compensated for injuries. On the issue of insurer profits, there are some very important points that I think need to be made. The first is that a profitable insurance sector is absolutely vital for the wellbeing of Australia. If we do not have an insurance sector that is not going to be prey to the kind of problem that HIH faced, we in Australia are not going to be able to allocate and shift risk in the kinds of activities that we conduct, whether they be community activities or large commercial undertakings.</para><para>To talk about insurance companies making a profit as if it is some kind of terrible wrong is quite an unsustainable proposition. An insurance sector unable to make a profit is extremely bad news for any community and can lead to withdrawal of capital at best and the failure of companies leaving policyholders high and dry and uncompensated at worst. It is also important to remember that insurance company profits have grown from a very low base—in some cases from significant net losses—and that profits have been at an unsustainably low level for several years. Underwriting profits have been rare for insurers in recent years and when compared to other financial sector operations their return on capital has hardly been outstanding. According to a recent press report that came to my attention, Australia's general insurance providers have achieved a return on equity above 10 per cent only three times since 1994. In the same period the major banks have consistently achieved a return on equity in excess of 15 per cent. But insurance will only be available while investors are willing to provide capital to the industry in the expectation of reasonable returns.</para><para>Another point that the Senate should have regard to is that, based on information provided by the Insurance Council of Australia, public liability represents only six per cent of total premium income, which puts the lie to the argument of those trying to directly link law reform to bottom-line profits. However, there is no doubt that the reforms have made public liability insurance more profitable as a line and attracted new capital to the market. Again I would remind the Senate that that is a good outcome for consumers. Just today in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian F</inline><inline font-style="italic">inancial Review</inline> there is a report of a plunge in insurance shares because of the pressure on premiums from increased competition. Increased competition is exactly what is needed in this market in the best interests of all Australians, and exactly what the reforms are delivering.</para><para>It is extremely disappointing that the Labor Party—I will leave the Democrats out of this—has after some years of virtual silence on this issue now jumped up at the last minute attempting to derail the reforms and please its supporters, no doubt, in some other sectors of the community. Those opposite really do need to be thinking about the interests of the community as a whole.</para><para>There was a reference during the debate to the fact that there was no evidence to support the Ipp review's claim that there was no intent in section 52 to allow personal injuries claims. Once again I draw to the Senate's attention the fact that the High Court, in Concrete Constructions against Nelson, held that section 52 was never intended by the parliament to extend to all conduct regardless of its nature, and there is no evidence that I can divine from looking at the parliamentary debates that parliament intended that section 52 extend to cover personal injury and death claims. I suspect that the High Court in the fullness of time, in the absence of this legislation getting through the Senate and putting it beyond doubt, will eventually be asked to affirm this view in the application of section 52 to personal injury claims. </para><para>There are a couple of foreshadowed amendments. In respect of what we might loosely call the `tobacco amendment', I am quite frankly astonished that, although the bill has been before the parliament since 19 February and passed the House on 25 March, Labor, which has foreshadowed the amendment, chose not to circulate its proposed amendment to the government for consideration until I literally got to my feet. I know that from time to time there are comments made about lack of courtesy on the part of the government, but if there was any serious intent on the part of both the Democrats and Labor for the government to have an opportunity to consider this amendment surely it should have been provided in a more timely way. It might have got some support. As it is, it is far too precipitous for me to form a view on my feet as to the desirability of this amendment. As I have said, one would think that if Labor were seriously interested in amending the bill to constructively improve the law—and I acknowledge that that could be possible—it would discuss or at least inform the government of its plans to make amendments.</para><para>Without any time to consider this amendment the government is put in a very difficult position by being asked to consider it. The government's amendments were recommended by an expert panel, discussed with states and territories, publicly announced and released and have had a lengthy consideration by the parliament. At least nobody is coming to consider the government's amendments unprepared.</para><para>I can say a bit about the existing law reform. On the substance of the amendments that Labor and the Democrats are seeking for special arrangements to be included for individuals who have sustained tobacco related injuries, there may be, as I have said, some basis to consider it. I am no fan of tobacco, I might say. I note that New South Wales has provided a specific exemption from the New South Wales Civil Liability Act 2002 in relation to the award of personal injury damages where the injury or death results from smoking or the use of tobacco products. Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania have some exclusions. Exemptions of this nature are fundamentally civil liability issues and appropriately matters for state and territory law. On the face of it they are not matters for the Commonwealth and the TPA. As I have said, the bill we are debating today introduces national benchmarks on quantum and limitation of actions, and these arrangements will introduce a cap and threshold for the award of general damages. They will not have any effect on the recovery of a variety of other expenses, such as medical expenses.</para><para>Back to the main game of today, which is that I am asking the Senate to pass the government's bill, the proposed amendments to the act close a loophole that has been well identified. It is one where there is only a trickle but there will be a flood. Anyone with any familiarity at all with the practice of an actuary will tell you that that is sufficient to have a deleterious and damaging effect on the ability of these very sensible reforms to take effect in the way in which parliament intended. </para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>22738</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill—by leave—taken as a whole.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>22738</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will seek some guidance from the government in respect of this: we could move the amendments all together—that is, amendments (1) to (6)—or, logically, we could split them and take (1) alone and then (2) to (6) together.

The effect of this amendment is to ensure that the damages regime inserted by the bill applies to claims for personal injury damages brought under part V, division 1 of the bill. As the Senate is aware, the most significant provision in part V, division 1 is section 52, which prohibits misleading and deceptive conduct. Labor moved this amendment as a way of breaking the deadlock between the Senate and the House in relation to the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2003. As noted in the second reading debate, in contrast to the bill we are considering here today, the earlier TPA bill did not simply limit damages recoverable under part V, division 1; in fact, it abolished them. The Senate supported amendments which sought to align damages with state and territory law at the time. However, and perhaps unfortunately, they were rejected by the government.</para><para>Labor cannot support the abolition of longstanding consumer rights. We are, however, concerned to ensure that the potential for forum shopping to undermine state tort reform is in fact addressed. The amendment contained in item (1) will ensure that all actions for personal injury under the Trade Practices Act are treated in the same way. It clearly deals with the problem of forum shopping. On 2 March this year, Senator Coonan told the Senate: </para><quote><para>Cases are ... coming to light where a claim is too small to succeed at state level but can still be brought under the Trade Practices Act. While this loophole remains open, claims costs will not come down and these reforms will remain incomplete.</para></quote><para>In other words, as I understand it, the loophole is that thresholds that apply under state law to screen out small claims do not apply under the TPA. No doubt the amendment contained in item (1) would address this issue, if that is the issue that is being ventilated by the government as a reason. The solution we have put up is a sensible one. If the government does not accept it, it will only confirm our suspicions that in fact the government does not really want a solution to this matter and is satisfied to have this debate continue for considerably more time than it has.</para><para>The other issue I want to mention while I am on my feet is about the amendments in relation to the tobacco industry. My instructions were that they were to be circulated earlier. It appears that they were not. The opposition apologises for their lateness. However, in your own summing up, Minister Coonan, you did indicate that you are aware of the tobacco industry amendments—if I can call them that by way of shorthand—through the state law tort reform process. They are familiar to you and they should not have come as any great surprise. In fact, from the argument you put in summing up I think you may agree with the amendments themselves. It seemed from the argument that if this bill is needed then so are the tobacco amendments, given that they are also reflected in the state tort reform process—but I will leave that for the debate later on. I just wanted to put that on record, and we have also given you time now to look at those amendments so I am sure we can move forward with the debate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>22739</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We think any amendment that prohibits or attempts to restrict forum shopping is a wise one. Our case and our argument is not that people should have multiple access in multiple jurisdictions; our case and our argument is that they should have access to the TPA jurisdiction. Therefore we can have no in principle objection to Labor amendment (1) since, if I understand its consequences accurately, it does seek to achieve streamlined access to a single jurisdiction.</para></talk.start><para>Having said that with respect to the amendment, I will make a couple of remarks which arise from the minister's remarks in closing the second reading debate. There are two issues I want to draw attention to. The first is that the Australian Democrats have absolutely no problem with—in fact we support—the insurance industry getting a proper return on its investment and proper profitability. But the proposition that its low profitability was a result of high claims is singularly flawed. The proposition that tort law reform is necessary to reform the insurance industry and make it more viable is singularly flawed. The whole HIH royal commission and the evidence to that commission indicated that corrupt, criminal and unprofessional behaviour resulted in a drive to the bottom of insurance costs. What they were doing was distorting their risk profile and distorting the prudential requirements that they should have paid attention to, with the result that they brought the whole industry undone.</para><para>APRA itself has been hauled from pillar to post and has been radically reformed by the government, partly because it failed to take action in time. The problem was HIH and industry behaviour, not consumer claims and consumer behaviour. What the government has done is to quite properly address this issue through CLERP 9. The Joint Standing Committee on Corporations and Financial Services is examining CLERP 9 right now. I sit on that committee. I am very much across the things which caused the crisis in the industry as a whole, and they can be sheeted home to corporate behaviour, not to consumer or claimant behaviour. It is very wrong to tie the whole HIH and industry problem back into tort law reform. </para><para>The second brief point I want to make is that the proposition that, because the state governments agree on something, and the Commonwealth government agrees with the state governments, the Senate of Australia should therefore agree is a flawed one. It is an argument; it is not a compulsion. There is no precedent, and the government's behaviour in itself indicates that there is no precedent. Quite frequently the government is faced with eight territory and state premiers at the annual COAG slugfest and the Commonwealth turns its back on them and says, `We don't agree with you,' faced with eight coordinated views. The Commonwealth government is entirely within its rights to do so. Each issue that is agreed by the states and territories that comes to the Commonwealth parliament has to be dealt with on its merits by the Commonwealth government and by the Senate of Australia. Just because there is agreement does not mean that either the Commonwealth government or the Senate will automatically approve of it. This is one of those instances.</para><para>I can advise that the Australian Democrats' view is that this legislation, and the impetus to this legislation, is fundamentally flawed and we seek to have it rejected. We have taken that view based on our judgment of the evidence. The government takes a different view, and it is entitled to do so. We are not further persuaded just by the idea that all the states and territories might agree on a particular issue, because like the government—and it does so regularly—we take the view that on some occasions they can be wrong.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>22740</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to make a few very brief comments in response. I agree that this parliament should look at whatever issue we debate here on its merits and that whether others agree or not may or may not be material. But in my view the Senate is not entitled to take an idiosyncratic view of the way in which insurance operates not only in Australia but throughout the world that would fly in the face of all of the expert and other evidence that clearly indicates that the escalating claims cost was one of the factors that made the longer term sustainability of insurance, certainly in Australia, very problematic and that led largely to a withdrawal of capital from liability lines, particularly ones where premiums may have been taken out many years ago and are never going to cover the escalating costs paid out many years later in long-tail claims.</para></talk.start><para>We have seen that in every insurer from general insurance through to medical indemnity. It is simply not sustainable to have to rely on premium income that is not going to cover escalating and unpredictable costs of claims. That is one of the reasons why the effect of escalating claims has underpinned the need for insurance law reform and for tort law reform, and it is one of the reasons why governments were convinced by expert evidence. To say that escalating claims costs had no impact just flies in the face of the reality that in fact these insurance lines were largely cross-subsidised from other income. </para><para>Of course, when you have the effects of global events and downturns in equities you have situations where the way in which insurers are able to cross-subsidise some of these difficult lines becomes simply not sustainable. There are multiplicities of reasons as to why the insurance industry was under pressure. HIH was simply an exemplar of that, which was exacerbated—I agree with Senator Murray—by gross breaches of prudential behaviour. I do take issue in relation to APRA. It is true that the government found it necessary to quite substantially reform APRA in accordance with the recommendations of HIH, but the royal commission found that APRA was not responsible for the collapse of HIH. There were, indeed, many other factors. If APRA had blown the whistle at the appropriate time it may—just may—have meant that HIH stopped trading perhaps a few months earlier and not over such a substantial period.</para><para>The fundamental reason the government opposes this amendment is that it still enlarges the way claims can be brought that simply do not align with the general regime of the states and territories. So you have a disconnect in the way in which people can bring actions for personal injuries that have nothing to do with each other on liability. Whilst we are hopefully aligning the damages regime with state and territory laws, we also need to align the substantive law, or else we are going to have a disconnect on liability and an alignment on the damages regime. That does not make much sense and it certainly does not solve the problem, despite Senator Ludwig's suggestion that this was helpful. It is not and it will not in fact solve the problem that has been identified as the loophole.</para><para>Finally, on the tobacco amendment, I just want to say that I am reserving my judgment on the merit of it. I am certainly not prepared to do it on the run. As I say, it is a shame that it was not put before the government a little earlier so that we could have considered it. It is clearly a matter that I want to have regard to. As it is currently presented to me and because of the lack of time that I have had to consider it and its implications, particularly in a Commonwealth act, the government will not be supporting it.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>22741</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I now seek leave of the Senate to move amendments (2) to (6) standing in Senator Conroy's name.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>22741</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The reason I am not giving leave at this stage is that I have an amendment which I hope is being circulated at the present moment.

It was unfortunate that the amendments were not available to the government earlier. I think the government have indicated, perhaps not directly, that they will consider them, perhaps in more detail, to consider whether or not they are needed. We say they are, in fact, needed. The states have passed a tobacco litigation exclusion in various forms to ensure that these things are not caught up and that people's rights are not lost through other actions rather than action directed at a specific issue.</para><para>Item (2) prevents the application of the long-stop period to cases involving personal injury from the use of tobacco products. A long-stop period is set out in section 87H and is generally a period of 12 years. The bill currently provides that personal injury damages cannot be brought after the long-stop period expires. Under the amendments proposed by Labor, this long-stop period will not apply. Instead, plaintiffs in tobacco related litigation will be required to bring an action within three years after the date of discovery of the injury. </para><para>Items (3), (4), (5) and (6) ensure that the caps on the various heads of damages imposed by the bill do not apply in relation to tobacco litigation. While the damages regime in the bill does not apply to breaches of the act that occurred prior to the bill's commencement, we are aware that some in the community believe that the tobacco industry is continuing to engage in conduct in breach of the act. In recent years the ACCC has conducted some investigations in relation to tobacco and possible misleading and deceptive conduct in tobacco advertising and promotion. Labor understands that the commission has requested more funding from the government so that these investigations, in fact, can continue.</para><para>In making these particular amendments Labor is not trying to prejudge any litigation against the tobacco industry. However, Labor does not believe that the bill should inadvertently restrict the prospects of tobacco related litigation under the TPA. The Cancer Council of Victoria has stated that the litigation in the United States has revealed `a chronicle of misleading, deceptive and unconscionable conduct in the tobacco industry'. We do not believe that this bill should deter or prevent similar claims from being tested in Australia if plaintiffs believe they in fact have a case. It was never the intention of the tort law reform process to protect the tobacco industry from litigation. Most states have recognised this and specifically excluded tobacco litigation from their civil liability reforms. These amendments are in fact intended to ensure that reforms designed to support state efforts to reduce public liability premiums do not have the unintended effect of protecting the tobacco industry from litigation. Therefore I commend them to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>22743</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There are 19,000 deaths every year from tobacco related illnesses, so we think there are 19,000 reasons to support these amendments.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>22743</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have already made my comments on these amendments.

It is fairly self-explanatory. I will be asking the minister if she will clarify the situation for me. I have a good number of concerns. They emerge from the fact that the states and territories are bringing in legislation which I believe will restrict the rights of injured people. These are among the most vulnerable of people in society. Frankly, whilst it is important to keep an eye on costs, it is also very important to keep our focus on the purpose of the original legislation: if persons are injured and have a case because there was negligence and other factors involved not relating to the person concerned, they should be able to be compensated. A number of examples have been provided to me to suggest that if this legislation—these amendments by the government to the Trade Practices Act—goes through there will be further uncompensated suffering. For example, there are some people so deeply psychologically traumatised after suffering a personal injury that they are in no mental state to summon the resources necessary to bring a complaint in the required, very limited time. It is also concerning that in some states and territories, particularly here in the ACT, reforms to personal injury legislation are being applied retrospectively. That is of great concern because it affects those who have already lodged applications in the courts. Bear in mind that what the government is doing is retrospective in dealing with those particular claimants. There is also some concern that personal injury legislation is leading to serious denial of a person's basic right to seek legitimate compensation for injury. </para></talk.start><para>Before moving this amendment, I will ask the minister to clarify the situation in respect of particular cases. I think that sometimes it is useful to identify particular cases so that they bring it all to mind. For example, a boy aged 12 years was severely injured during a diathermy procedure to remove a wart from the palm of his right hand. The doctor ignored the risks of fire in using alcohol with an open flame. The burns to his hand were significant. The boy has required several procedures, including several skin grafts from his thigh, to repair his hand. It is likely that he will need further skin grafts and nerve repair surgery and that he will have to wear a protective glove/sleeve for at least one year. Is that case covered, Minister? </para><para>There are a number of other cases, for example that of the parents of a one-month-old child. The child was admitted to hospital for surgery in relation to a common heart condition. Postoperatively the child was resuscitated with a bag which was faulty and poorly maintained. As a result the child developed a pneumothorax and died. There were significant adverse findings by the coroner in this case on the failure of the hospital to maintain and inspect the bag. The parents now suffer significant psychological problems. Under the government's amendments, that cannot be compensated. An elderly lady, for example, had a medication error with pharmaceuticals. She was given 10 times the dose of a sedative that put her into a Parkinson's state and coma. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted. </para><para>Progress reported. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>22744</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq: Treatment of Prisoners</title><page.no>22744</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>22744</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is directed to Senator Hill in his capacity as Minister for Defence and Minister representing the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

In relation to the photographs that we have all seen in the press in recent times, as I understand it the publishing of those photographs was the first time that Defence or ADF personnel, so either military or civilian people within Defence, saw those depictions. In relation to matters of abuse, of course we are now reminded of a CNN report in January—I think it was on about 20 or 21 January—that made reference to an investigation being carried out by the Pentagon in relation to alleged abuses. So I guess the whole world knew from that time that there was an investigation taking place but most would not have known the details of that investigation. </para></talk.start><para>I think the only other relevant bit of information is that Defence became aware in February of a report of the International Committee of the Red Cross which involved an examination of detainment practices in Iraq—I think from about March of last year through to November of last year.

I congratulate him and wish him well in his role as a senator for Victoria. The Australian economy continues to perform strongly under the responsible management of the Howard government. The latest <inline font-style="italic">World Economic Outlook </inline>from the IMF predicts that Australia's outstanding economic performance will continue with strong growth in 2004 and 2005. That is good news for Australian workers and their families. Australia's unemployment rate is now 5.6 per cent—the lowest level since June 1981; the lowest level for 23 years. More Australians are now in work than ever before.</para></talk.start><para>We have helped create more than 1.3 million jobs since coming to office. That is more than 440 new jobs every day. The yearly inflation rate has declined to two per cent. That is in stark contrast to Labor's average of 5.2 per cent. Interest rates remain at historically low levels. Australian families are now saving more than $540 every month on an average home loan thanks to the economic management of the Howard government. This strong economic performance has come about because we have made the hard but necessary decisions to get the budget back into surplus. We have been able to fund tax relief for Australian workers and their families and at the same time direct extra funding towards priority areas such as health, education and defence. </para><para>We all remember Labor's record on the economy: crippling home interest rates of 17 per cent, a record one million Australians unemployed and $96 billion of debt racked up in Labor's last five years in government. We still hear Labor crowing about that, and Labor are now at it again. Mr Latham says they will spend billions of dollars more on services and at the same time he is promising tax cuts. Meanwhile, the shadow Treasurer, Mr Crean, says that they will run budget surpluses. It did not add up when Labor were last in government; it still does not add up. I remind the Senate that in its 13 years in office, Labor delivered nine budget deficits—an average deficit of $12.2 billion. We can only judge the Labor Party on their record in office: big spending, high taxes, huge budget deficits. It is Australian families who pay the price through higher interest rates, higher unemployment and more tax. Mr President, despite Mr Crean's pledges to keep the budget in surplus, you should read the fine print of Labor's policy platform. Only four months old, it clearly shows Labor's intention to again run up huge budget deficits. You cannot trust Labor on economic management; you cannot trust Labor on taxes, and you cannot trust Labor on interest rates.</para></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DISTINGUISHED VISITORS</title><type>Distinguished Visitors</type><page.no>22746</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

As Senator Hill has already outlined, the budget that will be brought down tonight will be brought down against the backdrop of the incredible performance of the Australian economy, both by historical Australian standards and by international standards. We have achieved that outstanding performance through hard work and good policy decisions made in the national interest, despite, often and regrettably, the opposition of the Australian Labor Party. The government's financial position is equally as strong. By taking the tough decisions we have had to take over the last eight years, we have turned the budget around from a deficit that we inherited of $10 billion to consistent surpluses. We are one of the few developed economies in the world able to meet our necessary expenditures, keep the budget in surplus and reduce taxation.</para></talk.start><para>We have now repaid some $66 billion of the debt that Labor left us and we have reduced government net debt to just 3.9 per cent of GDP, probably the lowest in the developed world. We are saving $5 billion every year in interest payments that we used to have to pay under Labor, so it has been a huge turnaround from the shambles we inherited. You have got to remember, as Senator Hill pointed out, that Labor in their last five or six years took our debt from some $17 billion to $96 billion in just that brief period of time. They were running deficits as high as $17 billion in any one year, and they were pretty deceptive about the state of government finances. They used to count the sale of government assets as revenue to try to fool us into believing the budget was in surplus. In the 1996 election they went around telling everybody that the budget was in surplus, and when we came into office we discovered a $10 billion deficit.</para><para>The consequences of such an approach to government fiscal policy were disastrous. If you run big deficits, if you have high debt, you are going to put upward pressure on interest rates, and that is what we experienced under Labor. They had to fund all this by finding new taxes and pulling them out of nowhere to shore up their incapacity to control government spending. We have turned the nation around since those disastrous days of Labor, but it seems that the Labor Party have learned very little from their experience in government. Just over the past two years in opposition the Labor Party have, on their very own figures, racked up no less than $11 billion in new spending promises. These are their own figures and their own work based on their own policy.  </para><para>They have consistently told us there will be no net new spending, that they are going to find all the savings in the existing budget to fund all their new, wonderful spending programs. But when you look at what their spokesmen are actually saying, they leave a huge gap in the process. On 19 April the shadow finance minister, who seems to have usurped the shadow treasurer as their spokesman, claimed that Labor had identified $7 billion in savings to pay for the $11 billion. Mr Latham came out only a week later and said there were $6 billion in savings but then Mr Crean popped up out of nowhere on Sunday and said there were actually $8 billion in savings, so we really have no idea—and I do not think they have any idea—of what the savings are. In any event, the savings do not match the spending. There is still a big gap in relation to their spending that they said they would cover by savings—and they do not know whether those savings will be $6 billion, $7 billion or $8 billion. In any event it is not $11 billion. It is a shambles. Their two key spokesmen were ministers in the previous government that racked up all these debts and left the disastrous legacy that we had to inherit. Tonight the budget will continue the outstanding performance of this government in strong economic management and strong fiscal management, all designed to ensure Australia's strong future.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq: Treatment of Prisoners</title><page.no>22748</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>22748</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is directed to Senator Hill in his capacity as Minister for Defence and as Minister representing the Prime Minister.

That is what Mr Latham said and he was supported by Senator Evans.

The Labor Party should be getting behind the forces, recognising that their contribution in helping to stabilise Iraq and hand Iraq back to an Iraqi government for the benefit of all Iraqi people is a wonderful objective. That Australian forces will put their lives on the line to help achieve that objective is something of which we should all be proud. Instead of the Labor Party coming out and saying, `We're proud of our forces and we support our forces,' they now want to drag them into some allegation that, in some way, they are associated with an abuse of prisoners. Mr President, that is an appalling attempt; it is not worthy of Senator Evans. I will say it is not even worthy of the Australian Labor Party. I suggest they get behind the forces and offer them some broad based Australian support, and they will be making a much more worthwhile contribution to the Australian public.</para></talk.start></continue></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>22749</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

Our income policies encourage people to achieve a higher standard of living in retirement than they could on the age pension alone. They provide choice and flexibility so Australians can work while they want to and retire when they are ready. Most recently, the government announced a number of improvements to the superannuation system. One of the most significant changes the government announced was to allow people to access their superannuation without the need to retire. This will allow a person who is not ready to retire to continue to work with their employer on a part-time basis and to use part of their superannuation to supplement their income.</para></talk.start><para>Rather than force people out of the work force, as indeed the Labor Party's policies would do, the government wants to give people the choice to retire when they are ready. From 1 July 2003, the government is assisting Australians to save through a superannuation co-contribution by making a matched, direct payment of up to $1,000 to boost the retirement savings of low- to middle-income earners. Under this initiative, for workers earning up to $27,500 the Australian government will match their own personal superannuation contributions dollar for dollar up to $1,000 annually. The co-contribution tapers for people earning over $27,500. The upper income threshold is $40,000.</para><para>The government has committed more than $1 billion in total to this initiative to help Australians save for their retirement. The super co-contribution is a targeted way to assist Australians to save. The co-contribution is expected to provide participants over 30 years with a significant boost to retirement incomes: 14.5 per cent for employees on $20,000 and seven per cent for employees on $32,500. On the other hand, a two per cent cut to the contributions tax is expected to increase retirement incomes by less than one per cent over 30 years at a significant cost to revenue. </para><para>In addition, the government provides substantial tax concessions to super savings, worth over $11 billion a year. This includes a reduction of the superannuation surcharge to further encourage those who can afford to save to do so and it includes the pension and annuity rebates, which means that those retirees who take their super as a pension have the contributions and earnings taxes that they previously paid returned to them. This government is committed to policies that help people save for their retirement and that provide both choice and flexibility so Australians can retire when they are ready.</para><para>I was asked about alternative policies. Recently, the Leader of the Opposition made a speech outlining Labor's ideas on super. The main announcement in the document appeared to reannounce a reduction in the contributions tax. However, not only have Labor failed to say how they will pay for this promise but the reduction would do little to actually increase savings, other than, of course, for higher paid employees through salary sacrifice. Salary sacrifice is not often available to Australia's battlers. Labor have fallen hook, line and sinker for the old union con job about taxes on super. The result is unfair and does little to help people improve their net retirement incomes. Labor's reduced contributions tax will cost over $1 billion a year and will only improve retirement savings by less than one per cent. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>22754</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>22754</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to Senator Hill, the Minister for Defence.

I think you will find that the new arrangements we intend to put in place are a very constructive response to what was seen generally as a crisis of leadership in ATSIC and a growing need to change the way we address Indigenous disadvantage in Australia. As I have said in this place on a number of occasions and elsewhere, our sole goal is to improve the outcomes and opportunities for Indigenous people in areas such as health, education and employment. The ATSIC experiment in separate Indigenous representations simply did not work. Indigenous people on the ground had lost confidence in ATSIC. I was in a number of the remote communities a weekend after this decision was announced and I can say that the only people that raised it with me were Indigenous people saying congratulations to the government for doing something that would finally see the money that was meant to be spent on Indigenous Australians actually get there—in other words, for them to get value for money.</para></talk.start><para>We are absolutely committed to working closely with local elected and representative leaders of Indigenous organisations—and, incidentally, in consultation with state and territory governments—to deliver services in a very coordinated way. We have learnt that through the COAG trials. It is not a Liberal/Labor thing: the Commonwealth of Australia Liberal-National government has been cooperating with the Labor governments all around Australia on these trials, and we all agree that coordination is a much better way to go. We will of course have a ministerial task force to make sure that the Commonwealth inputs, not just in the COAG sites but more generally, are more effectively coordinated. We intend to have a national Indigenous council which will have people appointed on the basis of their expertise.</para><para>There is no doubt that there have been some tremendous ATSIC commissioners who have had the capacity to do the job, have had their hearts in the right place and have done the job really well. That is not true across the board. We expect that the 35 ATSIC regional councils will continue until June 2005. They will be able to provide invaluable advice to state and territory governments and to the Commonwealth on the best way we can establish better mechanisms at the local level. There will need to be legislative change—you rightly identify that, Senator. That legislation will be introduced, though I cannot give you a date at this point.

But my supplementary question, given that you have confirmed there will need to be legislative change and that the government has stated that your changes to ATSIC will come into place by 1 July, is this: how will you make all of these changes to ATSIC properly and appropriately by 1 July? Given that ATSIC is established by an act of parliament, how will you make these changes without having an act of parliament passed by this place before 1 July? I note that the government's own program for legislation which is to pass in debate before 1 July does not include legislation to amend or abolish the ATSIC Act, so how can you make all these changes to a body established by law without modifying the law that establishes it?</para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>22756</page.no><name role="metadata">Vanstone, Sen Amanda</name><name role="display">Senator VANSTONE</name><name.id>7E4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Reconciliation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator, I will make two points. Firstly, you may see legislation before then. Of course, if the Senate agrees with what the government wants to do in this area I would have thought it would be very keen to pass the legislation and get on with the job of providing better services to Indigenous Australians in a much more coordinated way than we have been able to do in the past. No bad faith do I indicate to that in terms of what Labor did in its last 13 years in office nor indeed to our first six years. But it is over the last two years that we have really learnt from these COAG trials about the benefits of cooperation and working in a more effective way. With the cooperation of the Senate we will be able to do it. If that cooperation is not there, Senator, executive power does allow certain acts to be undertaken by the government and I can assure you that the government will be taking every step it can to protect, for example, ATSIC's assets to make sure they are not palmed off to third parties. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DISTINGUISHED VISITORS</title><type>Distinguished Visitors</type><page.no>22756</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

We have dealt with this with a whole-of-government approach. Minister Anderson and I have been involved in extensive measures in relation to ensuring that the skies of Australia are not only safe but secure. There have been a number of comprehensive measures which have been put in place. You see this when you travel not only domestically but also when you leave or re-enter Australia. A number of initiatives were brought in. Laptop computers and all goods and persons entering sterile areas are screened. We have increased our explosive trace detection technology and we have also increased the number of canine teams that we have for bomb detection from six to 18. As well as that we have increased significantly the number of Australian Protective Service personnel in the counter-terrorism first response role at our major airports from 244 to 400. This has been a significant increase in airport security around the nation. As well as that we have introduced a $12.8 million initiative which funds the Australian Federal Police for the implementation of the protective security liaison officer program—an extra 20 officers dealing with security at our airports. </para></talk.start><para>Senator Macdonald's question also asks what measures we have taken in air security. At the last election we said that we would implement an air security officer program. These air marshals are vital for ensuring that the public can travel with safety and security in our skies. We always said that we would implement this firstly on a domestic basis; the attacks in the United States were domestic flights. We did this; we introduced it in December 2001 and it has been operating very well. We always said that once we had that program up and running we would extend it internationally, and this we did in December last year with our air security officers covering flights between Singapore and Australia. This is a reciprocal agreement which also allows the Singapore government to place its air security officers on its national flag carrier on flights to and from Australia.</para><para>I was very pleased to announce last Saturday, with the US Ambassador, Mr Tom Schieffer, that we will now be putting air security officers on flights between the United States of America and Australia. This is a very important air route for us, a very strategic one. Our officers will be armed and they will be covert. Our air security officer program is one that is world's best practice. We have had interest expressed from overseas countries in the running of this program. This gives the travelling public the assurance that we have security in place in relation to our flights both domestically and internationally.</para><para>This, again, is a reciprocal agreement with the United States, and that country will have its air marshals on its national flag carrier on flights to and from Australia. Canada has indicated an interest in operating air security officers to Australia. It has direct flights to Australia; we do not, in turn, have direct flights to Canada, but nonetheless we are sympathetic to that request. Of course, we have negotiations pending with other countries. We are deadly serious about aviation security, and the measures which we have put in place indicate that.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask that further questions be placed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>.</para></talk.start></interjection></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>22758</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq: Treatment of Prisoners</title><page.no>22758</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>22758</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Hill) to questions without notice asked today relating to abuses of human rights of Iraqi prisoners.</para></motion><para>The monstrous treatment of Iraqi prisoners that we have seen on our television sets and in newspapers and the mass media since CBS TV broke the story on Thursday, 30 April has been appalling to all fair-minded and decent people. We have to ask the question: what is the significance of these shocking revelations? I think that on the personal level we feel for the fellow human beings who have been made to suffer and, in some cases, die as a result of this appalling and degrading treatment. We feel for their families. We also feel revulsion that US and British uniformed personnel—or, indeed, anyone—could be capable of such acts. </para><para>We must also, I believe, be very concerned about the damage these acts have already caused to the United States and broader Western interests. This damage goes far beyond the impact on the situation in Iraq. It will be felt around the world. This behaviour will fuel the hatred that motivates terrorists. It will reinforce the flawed rationale that they use to justify their acts. It will help them recruit others to the cause. It will add to the ranks of the suicide bombers. It will help them persuade the populations of Islamic countries that their cause is just, that the West is decadent and that it is indeed anti-Islamic. These abuses are of the utmost seriousness, and they must be treated as such. There can be no question that they warrant the resignation of the US Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld. The more he digs in, the more it will exacerbate the damage that has been done.</para><para>The Australian government has to lift its game as well. It is not good enough that today here in question time Senator Hill was unable to explain when and how he first became aware of these abuses, why we were not told of these abuses earlier than we were and what action the government took in response. We have a broad responsibility for all Iraqi prisoners as an occupying power and specific responsibility for the prisoners captured by Australian troops under the Geneva convention. To say that those responsible for these atrocities have let Australia and Australian troops down by their actions is, I think, an understatement. But the government's see-no-evil attitude has let our troops down further. Foreign Minister Downer has said disingenuously that he was aware of the matter in January. Senator Hill was unable to tell us in the Senate today when he was informed of the report of the International Committee of the Red Cross. He has told us that Defence was made aware of this in February but, when asked three or four times in question time today, Senator Hill would not tell the Australian people, would not tell the Senate, when he became aware of this report. That is not good enough.</para><para>It stands in stark contrast to what he has told the public on the ABC.

We are appalled by what we have seen on the television in the last couple of weeks and what we have seen and read in the newspapers. But, our having been appalled, the issue then is whether those who are at fault are taking appropriate action. It seems to us that they are. You can trace this right back to January, when the Pentagon put out a statement. Evidence of alleged abuses was brought before the US administration, those abuses were investigated and those at fault were prosecuted. As has been said by the US administration, if others are found to have abused they will be prosecuted as well. The British government has said exactly the same thing, and of course that is the appropriate response. </para><para>To say the very least, it is unfortunate that what seems to be a small number of individuals have caused considerable damage to the standing of the United States and, to some extent, the United Kingdom. They have caused some damage to the standing of their military forces, which is most unfortunate because their military forces are pledged to uphold, and do uphold, the highest values and standards. Nevertheless, poor behaviour has occurred and it is being responded to appropriately. Not only have the US and Britain acted in relation to the specific allegations but also, as I said in question time, my advice was that when the International Committee of the Red Cross brought to the attention of the occupying powers and to Mr Bremer as head of the CPA that its investigations had indicated problems with the detention system that should be addressed, the report was received positively by Sir Jeremy Greenstock, by General Sanchez and by Mr Bremer and actions were immediately instituted to revise the way in which prisoners were treated within the military jails of Iraq. So, whether those governments are acting on allegations against individuals who should be prosecuted or on allegations of a broader nature about standards that the International Committee of the Red Cross does not regard as satisfactory, that has been responded to positively.</para><para>What I regret, apart from the terrible things that have occurred to certain individuals, is the fact that this has significantly undermined the values that we are seeking to take to Iraq. We may have been in Iraq primarily to address the issue of weapons of mass destruction and the threats associated with those but we also wanted the benefit of removing a tyrant whose human rights abuses against the Iraqi people are legendary, including hundreds of thousands illegally killed by him, and we wanted instead to represent a different set of values. This behaviour by a limited number of individuals has significantly diminished our case in that regard. What we need to do now of course is to make ground in nevertheless re-establishing those values to demonstrate that we are committed to helping the Iraqi people in the very difficult task of stabilising the country and passing over the responsibility of government to them. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>22760</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The minister seems unable to understand why the Labor opposition and, I think, the Australian public regard this as a serious matter for Australia.

The involvement of Australia in this regard was none at all. Australia has no jurisdiction over the Iraqi prison system. Any prisoners that have come into our custody have in fact been passed over to the controlling powers, to the occupying powers. Regardless of the attempts by the opposition—their yelling and their screaming, their frantic attempts to pin some sort of fault on Australia—we utterly reject that sort of charge. Senator Faulkner came in here and said that we let our troops down with regard to this incident. Not only do we reject that but we say: what could let down our troops in Iraq more than the opposition saying that their role is nothing more than symbolic?</para></talk.start><para>The treatment of the prisoners, from all those that have seen the pictures and read the articles, is to be condemned. There is absolutely no doubt that those responsible should be disciplined and punished, if not court-martialled. It has been a public relations disaster. It has been a setback, particularly in the Arab world, to the cause and the mission—to why we, as part of the coalition of the willing, went into Iraq. It was correct for the President of the United States to apologise to the Arab world and to the president of Jordan. It ought to be stated that this incident was made public by the US, before it even came to media attention. The President said it turned his stomach. So the system is working. This incident was flushed out and will be dealt with.</para><para>Listening to the questions—and, indeed, there will be an urgency motion this afternoon—you would think that the opposition were trying to draw some moral equivalence between the former regime and the existing occupying powers. We reject any moral equivalence at all. In fact the government do not back off one bit from our involvement in Iraq, from its beginning to today. We do not back off from our part in the removal of the merciless dictator Saddam Hussein, the wider cause on the war on terror and the wider cause to bring democracy to that country in the heart of the Middle East. We have already seen some knock-on effects from our involvement—that is of course with Libya itself now deciding to cooperate with the right side of the war on terror and to dismantle its weapons of mass destruction. That, fundamentally, is the difference between the approach of the government and the approach of the opposition—the pretenders to government. We will stay and finish the job; they will not. They have never been in favour of this war. They have been anti-American throughout all of this. They seize every opportunity to twist and turn and to attempt to show moral equivalence between the mission and cause of the coalition of the willing and the former regime of Saddam Hussein. We reject any moral equivalence at all.</para><para>We should not lose sight of the advances that have already been made in Iraq. Never do they come in here and tell us about the schools and universities that have been opened up, the Marshland Arabs who now have their lands back, the 200 newspapers, the water that has been resupplied, the electricity that has been resupplied, or the fact that the country is functioning better today—even as a war zone and a terrorist zone—than it was under the former regime. Never do you hear them in here talking about the advances. Never do you hear them in here talking about Amnesty International's own report on the former regime: the public beheadings of women and the rape machine that they had in operation. Rather, they try to establish a moral equivalence between the former regime and the occupying powers. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>22763</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I found Senator Hill's answers at question time today gravely disappointing. They were both inadequate and dissembling. All we got from Senator Hill was evasion and diversion instead of a proper series of answers regarding the shameful behaviour of occupying forces in Iraq. We got the usual coalition hegemony on patriotism, and we have just heard it again from Senator McGauran here: only they are supporting our armed forces overseas. Both Senator Hill and now Senator McGauran went on to imply that Labor is linking the brutal treatment of prisoners with our own armed forces. Nothing could be further from the truth—absolutely untrue. What a strawman argument this is; what a pathetic diversion. We are interested in what action the government took: not what our defence forces did but what action and what reaction to these events the government took.</para></talk.start><para>The treatment of prisoners in Iraq becomes critical when we revisit the reasons for intervention in that country. Paramount amongst the arguments for intervention was Iraq's possession of WMD. Of course, none can be found. Indeed even the arguments for a WMD program are now highly suspect. The second proposition was that Iraq was linked to international terrorist groups, although no evidence was produced at the time and certainly none has been found since. You will notice that no-one mentions that as a reason. There is a third reason: we are now reliant for justification of the intervention in Iraq on the regime change rationale. That is something that the US and the UK put up front at the start. Our government rejected it outright. They only adopted the regime change argument in retrospect when the other two main justifications for intervention disappeared. For regime change to work it must be based not only on creating a new democratic Iraq but also on the example offered by the occupying powers—and occupation is never easy. The widespread publicity of the prisoner abuse has probably spawned more terrorists in the Middle East than any other particular episode that has occurred. This is made worse as the image of cover-up and lack of transparency continues.</para><para>It seems from the answers given today that the Australian government has washed its hands of the issue. There is no need for such a toadying response. We can support, as an international citizen, various acts in Iraq for the good but we can remain in a position to critique faults. Why not? We do not have to be silent on faults. We can critique them. The major fault here was not applying the Geneva Convention to either Guantanamo Bay or in fact to Iraq. You did not have to grant prisoners Geneva Convention status; all you had to do was say, `The provisions of the Geneva Convention will apply to these prisoners'—a quite separate concept—and none of these events could have occurred.</para><para>The second big problem is the use of contractors—something we do not generally do but something that the Americans have done to make up for shortfalls in their armed services—and here there is very little control. It seems, and I cannot rush to judgment yet, that a lot of the problems that have occurred in Iraq are to do with uniformed personnel responding to the directions of civilian contractors employed by either the Department of Defense in the US or the CIA. </para><para>This government reacted very badly when we pointed out there were certain analogies with Vietnam. I do not think they understood that what we are talking about is the psychology of the Iraqis. Unfortunately, they are adopting a psychology similar to that of many Vietnamese. Instead of this becoming a debate about ideology, it becomes a debate about national liberation. I must say Australia trains its interrogators really well. I saw them in action as late as last Friday training our interrogators. The Geneva Convention applies. All practise interrogations are videoed. There is a doctor, a psychologist and a supervisor always available and observing these things. I hope that training will stand us in good stead well into the future. We do not want the defence minister at question time to look puzzled or defensive or confused on this issue, as he did today. There are moral imperatives here, and what a pity Minister Hill has not risen to the occasion. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>22764</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to speak on this motion to take note of answers concerning Iraq and I also refer to the fact that Senator Bartlett asked similar questions on behalf of the Democrats today. I join with the Labor Party colleagues who have made comments on this issue, I totally endorse the references to international humanitarian law made by Senator Ray and, as honourable senators would be aware, for this afternoon the Democrats have initiated an urgency debate on this issue. We think one of the most important aspects of this prisoner abuse and torture scandal as far as the federal parliament is concerned is Australia's involvement in the war in Iraq and whether or not we accept responsibility for the atrocities that have occurred under the occupying powers. We will no doubt discuss this further in the urgency debate, but the Democrats strongly believe that our country has a legal and moral obligation to ensure that individuals who are detained under the occupying forces in Iraq are treated with respect for their persons, their honour, their family rights and their religious convictions, practices, manners and customs. We call on the government to ensure that this is the case and to take responsibility for its role. But the government's response so far to the allegations of prisoner abuse has revealed that this government has no consistent story, and again we heard evidence of this in question time today. We have a government that is prepared to say anything to cover its back in relation to this issue.</para></talk.start><para>Looking over the comments made in recent days by the Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, it seems that all of them have different takes on whether or not Australia is indeed an occupying power in Iraq at all. Then there is the issue, highlighted in question time today, as to when the government first became aware of the allegations of prisoner abuse. The Minister for Defence claims that he first became aware of the allegations when he saw the images in the media a few weeks ago, but the foreign affairs minister says that he was aware of the allegations as early as February. There is also evidence coming to light that our Prime Minister may have been aware months ago of evidence provided by Amnesty International that Iraqi prisoners were being abused. The only thing clear in our government's handling of this issue is that confusion reigns. There is no clear evidence of what this government knew and when.</para><para>In the criminal justice system, inconsistent stories are interpreted as evidence of lies. The Democrats believe that continuing overwhelming inconsistencies in the statements of different government ministers suggest that, once again, this government is not giving us the entire story. The Australian community has every right to be outraged, angered and saddened, but are we really surprised? Are we really surprised by what happens in war? The only thing that seems to be liberated in war is the worst aspect of human nature, and that includes torturers liberated in war. This is no less the case if the rationale for going to war is to actually stop torture in the first place. In a civilised society there can be no ifs and no buts about the issue of torture. </para><para>Why does the Prime Minister think people went to the streets to protest against war in the first place? We were not quibbling about a few tanks or a few bombs; people protesting against the war were protesting against torture, depravity and all the things that go with it because war always involves torture. War, once embarked upon—with troops at risk and patriotism the big issue—always justifies extreme measures, and torture is one of them. If people do not believe that we have heard excuses, they should listen to Rumsfeld, Gingrich or any of the other apologists. In the last few days they have presented torture as a blip, as the exception. This is an argument that is not good enough because it involves shirking responsibility. If you can abdicate responsibility for a teeny-weeny blip then you can abdicate responsibility for everything that is done in war.</para><para>All wars potentially licence evil and liberate the worst in humankind. Those who go to war, those who lead us into war—and, most particularly, those who give us spurious reasons for war—have to take responsibility for what happens in war. There are no buts about it. The images are shocking, depraved and shameful; full stop. There are no buts in this case. They are the consequence of the decision to go to war and our government, as well as other coalition partners, have to acknowledge that. That is exactly what we will be talking about in the urgency debate. It is time this government stopped trying to cover up their own actions and evidence. It is about time they took responsibility as an occupying power, as any other nation involved in this conflict must do.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PRIVILEGE</title><type>Privilege</type><page.no>22765</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>22765</page.no><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senators Knowles and Humphries, by letter dated 29 March 2004, have raised a matter of privilege under standing order 81, and asked that I determine the matter in accordance with that standing order. The matter is the unauthorised disclosure of the draft report of the Community Affairs References Committee in its inquiry into poverty. There is no doubt that there was an unauthorised disclosure of the draft report of the committee. The four press reports referred to by the senators each state that a draft report was seen or obtained by the newspaper concerned.</para></talk.start><para>The resolution of the Senate of 20 June 1996 requires that committees which are affected by unauthorised disclosures of their documents follow the following procedures: (a) the committee shall seek to discover the source of the disclosure, including by the chair of the committee writing to all members and staff asking them if they can explain the disclosure; (b) the committee should come to a conclusion as to whether the disclosure had a tendency substantially to interfere with the work of the committee or of the Senate, or actually caused substantial interference; and (c) if the committee concludes that there has been potential or actual substantial interference, it shall report to the Senate and the matter may be raised with the President by the chair of the committee in accordance with standing order 81.</para><para>It appears from the information provided by Senators Knowles and Humphries that the committee has followed these steps and that the majority of the members of the committee have concluded that the disclosure did not interfere with the work of the committee. On this basis, the committee has not made a report under paragraph (c). Senators Knowles and Humphries, in effect, dissent from this conclusion of the committee and the committee's decision not to raise a matter of privilege. The order of the Senate makes it clear that it does not prevent a senator raising a matter of privilege under standing order 81. Senators Knowles and Humphries have the right to raise the matter of privilege in spite of the committee's decision. </para><para>In determining whether a motion to refer a matter to the privileges committee should have precedence, I am required to have regard to the following criteria: (a) the principle that the Senate's power to adjudge and deal with contempts should be used only where it is necessary to provide reasonable protection for the Senate and its committees and for senators against improper acts tending substantially to obstruct them in the performance of their functions, and should not be used in respect of matters which appear to be of a trivial nature or unworthy of the attention of the Senate; and (b) the existence of any remedy other than that power for any act which may be held to be a contempt. </para><para>The question which arises is whether the fact that a committee has concluded that its work was not interfered with, and that it should not raise a matter of privilege, means that the matter does not meet criterion (a). I do not think that this conclusion should be drawn. Criterion (a) in effect requires me to consider the seriousness of the matter. The seriousness of the matter, as described in that criterion, is not affected by a decision by a committee that an unauthorised disclosure has not substantially interfered with its work. It is open to the Senate to take the view that the matter is serious regardless of that conclusion by the committee.</para><para>I therefore consider that the appropriate course is for me to give the matter precedence and leave it to the Senate to determine whether the matter should be referred to the privileges committee. The Senate may then determine what weight it should give to the conclusion of the committee that the committee's work was not interfered with. It will then be for the Senate to determine whether that conclusion should lead the Senate to refrain from any further inquiry, through the privileges committee, into the matter. I table the letter from Senators Knowles and Humphries, who may now give notice of a motion.</para><para>Senator FERRIS (South Australia) (3.37 p.m.)—At the request of Senator Knowles and Senator Humphries, I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, they will move:</para><para>That the following matter be referred to the Committee of Privileges:</para><para>Whether there was an unauthorised disclosure of the draft report of the Community Affairs References Committee in relation to poverty and financial hardship and whether any contempt was committed in that regard.</para></speech></debate><petition.group><petition.groupinfo><title>PETITIONS</title><page.no>22766</page.no></petition.groupinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1</name.id><name role="metadata">The Clerk</name><name role="display">The Clerk</name></talker><para>—Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows:</para></talk.start></interjection><petition><petitioninfo><title>Immigration: Detention Centres</title><page.no>22766</page.no><no.signed>60</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>DT6</name.id></name.ids><names><name>Senator Bartlett</name></names></petitioninfo><para>To the Honourable Members of the Senate in the Parliament Assembled.</para><para>The Petition of the undersigned draws attention to the damaging long-term effects to children of prolonged detention in Immigration Detention Centres.</para><para>Your petitioners ask the Senate, in Parliament to call on the Federal Government to release all children from immigration detention centre into the community, and to provide them with psychological counselling, education and medical services</para><presenter><no.signed>60</no.signed><talk.start><talker><name role="display">Senator Bartlett</name><name.id>DT6</name.id></talker><para>Senator Bartlett (from 60 citizens).</para></talk.start></presenter></petition><petition><petitioninfo><title>Constitutional Reform: Senate Powers</title><page.no>22767</page.no><no.signed>60</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>DT6</name.id></name.ids><names><name>Senator Bartlett</name></names></petitioninfo><para>From the citizens of Australia to the President of the Senate of the Parliament of Australia.</para><para>We the undersigned believe that the Prime Minister's call for Senate Reform is an attempt to dilute the powers of the Senate and to enable the Executive to have absolute control over parliament.</para><para>We urge all Senators to ensure the powers and responsibilities, of the Senate are protected in the interests of ensuring good governance on behalf of the Australian people and to oppose any moves by the current, or future, Governments to weaken the ability of the Senate to be a check and balance on the Government of the day.</para><presenter><no.signed>60</no.signed><talk.start><talker><name role="display">Senator Bartlett</name><name.id>DT6</name.id></talker><para>Senator Bartlett (from 60 citizens).</para></talk.start></presenter></petition><petition><petitioninfo><title>Trade: Live Animal Exports</title><page.no>22767</page.no><no.signed>24</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>DT6</name.id></name.ids><names><name>Senator Bartlett</name></names></petitioninfo><para>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. </para><para>The Petition of the undersigned notes the inadequate numbers of livestock available for Australian slaughter, food consumption and hides; the increase in Australian abattoir closures; the growing negative economic, employment and social impacts on rural Australia; and the unnecessary suffering endured by Australian livestock because of this nation's pursuit of trade and financial benefits at any cost.

I have chosen not to go into that at this stage because I believe this matter is extremely urgent and of absolute importance. The Democrats believe the Senate, representing the people of Australia, must take the first available opportunity to formally condemn the abuse, torture and mistreatment of Iraqis detained by the occupying forces in that country. We cannot pretend that we have no responsibility for what is happening in that country. It is a very serious matter, so let us not encounter during this debate the usual smokescreens that this is just some form of anti-Americanism, that this represents some support for Saddam, that this is rerunning the debate on whether we should have gone to war or, even worse, that this is some sort of attack on Australian soldiers. </para><para>On this issue, it does not matter whether you were in favour of or against the war; that has happened for worse or for better—or, some might say, a mix of both. Let us not forget, though, that in addition to this incident over 10,000 people have died as a direct consequence of that war and that they continue to die every day. We, as a country that has forces in Iraq playing a role—we all know that; it has been the subject of extensive debate—are involved in capturing Iraqis and handing them over to our coalition partners for imprisonment. We must therefore ensure that we fulfil our direct responsibility to see that those people are treated properly. Frankly, I just could not believe Senator Hill in question time today suggesting that it was none of our business, that we had no responsibility for what happened to people after we handed them over. That is absurd just as basic decency, let alone in terms of obligations under international law or basic moral obligations.</para><para>We must send a clear signal as a house of parliament that we as a nation condemn this sort of treatment of prisoners unequivocally. We owe it to the Iraqi people whose country we have invaded, allegedly on the basis of liberating them. We owe it, even more importantly, to our own defence personnel who are there in Iraq as well as to those who are part of the broader Australian armed forces, so that they know their parliament will say unequivocally, `We will have no truck with this sort of behaviour.' We owe it indeed to the world as a whole to send a clear message, as a sovereign house of parliament, that we will defend and support the rule of law, because that is underlying all of this debate. We have a commitment to law and that commitment must be upheld. We must condemn this behaviour, we must ensure it does not happen again, we must ensure it is not widespread or endemic. It must be properly and openly investigated. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>22774</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The opposition will be supporting the urgency motion. What has happened in Abu Ghraib prison is tragic; it is disgusting and it is unforgivable. It has completely undermined the whole Iraq campaign. Those Iraqis who may have been inclined to place their trust in the occupying powers to bring democracy to their battered and suffering country will have great difficulty now, given the gross breaches of human rights and of Islamic law and custom. The democracy espoused by the United States and the other occupying powers has been tarnished. The photos of the naked Iraqi man about to have dogs unleashed on him bring those responsible closer to the moral trough inhabited by Saddam Hussein.</para></talk.start><para>I would like to retrace the emergence of this scandal. On 16 January the US military confirmed that an investigation into allegations of detainee abuse by 17 soldiers at Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad was initiated on 14 January. CNN reported the allegations included: `US military reportedly posing for photographs with partially unclothed Iraqi prisoners' at Abu Ghraib. Three weeks ago, on 28 April, CBS TV revealed photos of US military police stacking naked Iraqi prisoners in a human pyramid, performing simulated sex and with wires positioned that appear to suggest a detainee will be electrocuted if he moves. </para><para>On 3 May a 53-page report by Major General Taguba for Lieutenant General Sanchez was leaked to the <inline font-style="italic">New Yorker</inline>. It was finished in February and kept secret in the Pentagon. It appears to have been initiated after a US guard turned whistleblower. It reveals numerous instances from October to December 2003 of `sadistic, blatant and wanton criminal abuses'. It further reveals abuses committed by US military police, US intelligence officers and private military contractors. It also notes that a military investigation in November 2003 found `no military police units purposely applying inappropriate confinement practices'. Six days after the release of the photos, on 5 May, Mr Howard made his first public comment:</para><quote><para>I condemn that behaviour absolutely and unconditionally.</para></quote><para>He failed to comment on Australia's obligations as an occupying power. On 7 May the International Red Cross revealed it had repeatedly complained to the US about the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by US troops throughout 2003. The Pentagon also admitted that at least 10 suspicious deaths of POWs in Afghanistan and Iraq are being investigated. The US Army said it was investigating possible abuses of 42 Iraqi civilians and 35 POWs.</para><para>On 9 May one of the seven US soldiers charged with abusing Iraqi prisoners, military police officer Sabrina Harman, said she was acting under direct orders from military intelligence to `make it hell' for inmates before interrogation. Secretary Rumsfeld was in denial. Seymour Hersh in this week's <inline font-style="italic">New Yorker</inline> stated:</para><quote><para>... when Mr Rumsfeld was asked whether the photographs and stories from Abu Ghraib were a setback, he said, `Oh I'm not one for instant history'. By Friday however, with some members of Congress and with editorials calling for his resignation, Rumsfeld testified at length before the Senate and House Committees and apologised for what he said was fundamentally `un-American' ... Rumsfeld said he had not actually looked at any of the Abu Ghraib photographs until some of them appeared in press accounts, and had not reviewed the army's copies until the day before.</para></quote><para>Senator Hill's response was similar: that he had only become aware of the situation when press reports appeared. Today he has clarified that what he meant was that he had first seen the photographs when the press reports appeared. He will not say when he first learnt about these abuses. He will not front up and say that.</para><para>Foreign Minister Downer has said Australia has no legal responsibility for any of the POWs in Iraq, including those captured by Australia. This completely ignores the fact that Australia, as one of the occupying powers, has obligations towards Iraqi prisoners in general and those taken captive by Australian forces in particular. We know, from Senate estimates, that the SAS was successful in capturing prisoners. All up, Australian troops captured more than 100 Iraqis. Exactly how many we do not know. The obligations for the protection of prisoners are outlined in the third Geneva convention and in the 1977 first optional protocol to the fourth Geneva convention. Article 3 prohibits occupying powers from allowing acts which constitute `outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment'. Furthermore, articles 129 to 131 outline the sanctions to be applied to any grave breach of the convention. John Howard reluctantly stated on 17 April 2003:</para><quote><para>We—</para></quote><para>that is, Australia—</para><quote><para>have the obligation of an occupying power under the Geneva Convention. We, along with the Americans and the British have responsibilities, certainly, and we won't neglect those responsibilities. </para></quote><para>Mr Howard has tried for months to weasel his way out of occupying power status by pointing to the United Nations naming only the US and the UK in UN resolution 1483. But legally this does not wash. Australia's occupying power status is defined by the fact of our invasion and the fact of our continuing military occupation of Iraq—facts which give effect to our obligations under The Hague and Geneva conventions. Mr Howard cannot seriously use a Security Council resolution which turns a blind eye to Australia's involvement in the invasion and occupation.</para><para>United Nations Security Council resolution 1483 does not purport to be an exhaustive list of the occupying powers, as it simply notes correspondence received from two of them—the major two. Importantly, the `Authority' referred to in UNSCR 1483 is the Coalition Provisional Authority, the vehicle of the occupying powers for political administration in Iraq, in which Australia has continuing high-level representation. In other words, you cannot pretend not to be an occupying power while having direct representation in the political vehicle of the occupation itself—that is, the CPA.</para><para>If Mr Downer, Senator Hill and Mr Howard had had a whiff of information from our representatives in US command or within the authority about the scandalous treatment of prisoners they should have been checking this out. Mr Downer says he actually knew about reports of mistreatment in January. What then did he do? Senator Hill and Mr Howard—belatedly—visited Iraq and had discussions three weeks ago with the interim government and Mr Bremer. Did they ask after our prisoners? Did they raise the human rights abuse allegations? Apparently not.</para><para>The abuse and torture of Iraqi prisoners is shameful. It is the worst thing that could have happened to the occupying powers, who need the trust of the Iraqi population in order to restore stability and security. Now with these potent images of brutality the `prestige of the West', which Mr Howard used last week as yet another excuse for the Iraq war, has been severely tarnished. The images of humiliation have been plastered overnight across the faces of allied gravestones at the World War I cemetery in Gaza by furious locals. The stark images have given Osama bin Laden and his followers—the real targets of the war on terror—huge succour.</para><para>President Bush's response—to defend Rumsfeld's administration of the Pentagon—is the wrong signal to send. His strong praise of the defence secretary will only further enrage fair-minded Iraqis. As Harlan Ullman, principal author of the `shock and awe' doctrine and a senior adviser for the Centre for International and Strategic Studies, said last night on the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline>, the pressure for information came from the top. President Bush and Defense Secretary Rumsfeld have to accept some responsibility.</para><para>In indicating the opposition's support for this urgency motion, I want to clarify our position in relation to two aspects. Firstly, we would have liked to see the motion directed not only at the United States but at all the occupying powers. The United States is by no means the only country in the dock over the abuse of Iraqi prisoners. There are also allegations of abuse by British forces. Our own government also shares obligations as an occupying power in relation to the humane treatment of all prisoners in Iraq—obligations which, I might add, it is remarkably reluctant to acknowledge.</para><para>Secondly, while paragraph (e) of the motion is entirely consistent with the opposition's position on the negotiation with the United States of a so-called article 98 agreement, our preference would have been to keep this issue separate from that of the abuse of Iraqi prisoners. An article 98 agreement would require Australia not to surrender US citizens suspected of committing crimes against humanity to the International Criminal Court for prosecution. The inclusion of this paragraph in the motion before us implies that we are equating the prisoner abuse which is alleged to have occurred in Iraq with crimes against humanity and that we consider that those responsible for the abuse in Iraq should be brought before the International Criminal Court. Such conclusions are, at the least, premature. The allegations of abuse in Iraq have not yet been thoroughly investigated and it is not at all certain that the crimes they may be found guilty of would fall within the definition of `crimes against humanity' and therefore come within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. It should also be said that the International Criminal Court is only able to take action in the event that the US or other contracting parties are not undertaking disciplinary or remedial action. That is not the case in relation to the allegations of prisoner abuse in Iraq, given that prosecutions are under way. That said, we have no problem with the substance of the motion before the Senate and we will be supporting it. As I have said, what has happened is tragic, it is disgusting and it is unforgivable. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>22777</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Sandy</name><name role="display">Senator SANDY MACDONALD</name><name.id>CX5</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>NATS</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Nothing I say in connection with opposing the urgency motion condones the inappropriateness of the behaviour documented with respect to the prisoners held by the United States in Iraq. This would never be sanctioned by Australia or by the ADF involved in the war against terror or in rebuilding the peace in Iraq. These unhappy visions will not, however, make Australia cut and run. The defence and security of Australia are contributed to by good order and security in Iraq and the Middle East generally. Australia will continue to support the rebuilding of Iraq, whether it be in training its army or controlling Baghdad airspace. Our troops have the total support of the Australian government and will be funded in tonight's budget well into the future. As reported by the Prime Minister after his visit to Iraq on Anzac Day, their morale is high, their training excellent and they continue to do a very good job on behalf of world peace and on behalf of the Australian government. I can report from personal contact that serving ADF personnel consider that some opposition assertions that the putting of Australians' lives on the line in Iraq is simply symbolic is very offensive to them. Many of us in the community and the Senate would like to dissociate ourselves from those comments.</para></talk.start><para>This isolated and wrong behaviour by a hopefully small group of US service men and women does not alter the fundamentals of the Saddam Hussein regime and the reasons the coalition of the willing rightly took to remove Saddam Hussein from office. This was a destabilising regime. It was horrific to its citizens. It persecuted the majority Shias. It subjugated the Kurds in the north. It was a country in breach of a host of UN resolutions. It had used weapons of mass destruction—gas—against its own citizens and against Iranians in the Iraq-Iran war. As a near neighbour of Pakistan and Afghanistan, it had acted as a haven for terror and had helped finance and give succour to those Palestinian terror groups—particularly Hamas and Hezbollah but also a number of other jihadist groups—determined to destroy the state of Israel by violence of any kind.</para><para>There are no videotapes or photographs of Saddam's 200,000 victims, his treatment of women or his failure to educate people. There are no pictures of the mass graves of the tortured victims of his mass destruction. We get a little of what it must have been like in Saddam's regime when we see the way that some of the remnants of the Baath Party brutalised the four American contractors in Fallujah. The perpetrators of these killings are true examples of the Saddam Hussein regime. We must all hope that these people never get control again. </para><para>Admittedly, the new beginning in Iraq is proving much more difficult than any of us would have feared. The remnants of his regime—the foreign jihadists who have been attracted there—want to see Iraq subjugated again, either with a Saddam Hussein look-alike or with an Islamic dictatorship. Neither would be satisfactory. In fact, both would be disastrous, particularly for Iraq but also for the region and the world.</para><para>I must say to the Iraqi people that it should not just be America stepping up to the plate and helping with the rebuilding of Iraq; they too must step up to the plate, accept responsibility for building a new Iraq and make a considerable effort to do so. It is difficult for them. Very few of them would have seen a free country before. The Baathists were in power for about 30 years, which means that the great majority of Iraqi citizens have never had the chance to partake of a free and open society.</para><para>We must not forget that, despite all the negative publicity coming from Iraq, there have been a number of positives since March last year. The Iraqi governing council is operating and has drafted the most liberal constitution in the Arab world. School attendances are up by over 10 per cent. Many girls are attending school for the first time. Public health funding has increased substantially. Hospitals are all operating, which was not the case before the war. Child immunisation has increased substantially. The historic marshlands have been repopulated by the Marsh Arabs. Drinkable water and electricity supplies have been increased very substantially. The oil is flowing again, obviously with some difficulty, but Iraq's international port has been substantially improved. It will be interesting to senators that before the improvements were made you had to wait for the tide before you could enter with larger ships.</para><para>In a national survey by the British firm Oxford Research International, 56 per cent of Iraqis said that their lives were better off than a year ago. The UN High Commission for Refugees, which was expecting two million refugees after the war, has had to close shop because it found that it had no takers. In fact, the population traffic has moved in the opposite direction. Not only are there signs of change in Iraq; there are signs of optimism in the region. Firstly, Gaddafi's Libya realised that the game was up and that to be regarded as an international pariah was not sensible. President Gaddafi has handed over his weapons of mass destruction. Civic movements have grown in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria, which would not have happened without the democratisation of Iraq. Overall, the changes in Iraq's society have provided freedom, women's empowerment and knowledge to Iraq's society, which was devastated by Saddam Hussein.</para><para>There is a theme of anti-Americanism going through this place—opposite, specifically—and also unfortunately through the Australian community. It is very concerning to me. I will just finish with a short quote from William Shawcross, the well-known British journalist who spoke recently at the Sydney Institute. He said:</para><quote><para>The bottom line is this. For all its faults, American commitment and American sacrifice are essential to this world. As in the 20th century, so in the 21st only America has both the power and the optimism to defend the international community against what really are forces of darkness. In this endeavour America needs its allies in the liberal democratic world—for both real and symbolic purposes. Indeed the two often march together. </para></quote><para>I say to our American colleagues and friends: these times are sent to test us. These are difficult times. The visions that we see before us on our television screens are more than embarrassing, and they would be more than embarrassing to decent Americans too.

The difficulty of the speech we have just heard is the failure of the people promoting the war and occupation in Iraq to come to grips with the fact that we are all human beings and we all have the ability for great good but the potential for evil as well. The problem goes right to the President of the United States, who has classified humanity into two camps: good and evil. He has repeatedly said that you are in either one or the other and has made the defining line outside his own camp.</para></talk.start><para>I blame the President of the United States for inherently being involved in the problem that we now see. This is a man who has said about human beings, no matter how despicable their behaviour: `We will hunt them down. We will take them out. We will smoke them out,' and so on. Without drawing new lines he has accommodated—as indeed our own Prime Minister has accommodated—pictures of hooded people from our own nation as well as other nations being led in manacles into a prison where they have not been charged, where they have had no legal representation, where against the Geneva convention on many other counts they have also been completely separated and cut off from their kith and kin and loved ones. The problem is that having broken international law and the Geneva convention in one place in full daylight, and supported it, no new line was drawn. Now we are going to have the subordinates brought to trial, and they are being brought swiftly to trial. But the responsibility in some measure goes all the way up the line. When we come to our own country we have to ask: when did Prime Minister Howard and Minister for Foreign Affairs Alexander Downer and indeed Minister Hill, who refused to answer this simple question in question time here just two hours ago, know about the details on the abuse in this prison that was coming from the Red Cross?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>CX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Sandy</name><name role="display">Senator Sandy Macdonald</name></talker><para>—He answered very clearly.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>—There are those opposite who will interject and say, `Everybody knew about it.'

I ask members opposite to tell this chamber that Prime Minister Howard did not know about this last January, that he did not know about this months ago. You know that he did, and he did nothing.

This has been a blow and a matter which has caused me great personal distress, as I say, given the ambitions and intentions and objectives that the Australian government joined the coalition of the willing with in going into Iraq to achieve what I believe have been very many good things. </para></talk.start><para>I want to see the US government now rectify these matters—and I believe that they will. I want to see them prosecute the perpetrators in a clear and transparent fashion, as I believe most government senators and members do, and I believe that will happen. I also want to say that I believe that this conduct is extremely out of character for the United States and for the United States military. I think this has been an aberration and I think it will be arrested quickly and brought to an end and those perpetrators will be prosecuted, court-martialled, as justice would see them processed.</para><para>This motion, however, seeks to acknowledge and promote the fallacy of some sort of Australian involvement, legal or moral, in the criminal activity of the perpetrators of this sort of conduct. It is clear that they were on a frolic of their own. We were not involved, notwithstanding that Senator Brown would have you believe that we were there or have some responsibility. That is not the government of Australia. We had no responsibility in this. They were conducting criminal acts. We were not party to those. Senator Brown, for you to insinuate in this chamber that we were part of that is an absolute outrage. That you would impute on the Australian government, which has done so many good things in the recent history of this country, that we would condone or be part of this is just a disgrace. Indeed, it is ironic that Senator Bartlett would bring this motion to this chamber.</para><para>I say this in recounting the facts for the benefit of Senator Brown and Senator Bartlett and, indeed, for Senator Faulkner: there was no Australian involvement. Australia is not an occupying power. UN Security Council resolution 1483 designates the United States and the United Kingdom as the occupying powers. Australia is not an occupying power. For Senator Faulkner to insinuate, and to mislead this chamber, that we are is utterly false. I want to put that on record right here and now. Australia did not detain or accept prisoners in Iraq. The Red Cross did not pass its report to the Australian government or to the Australian ADF—we did not get it.</para><para>The sad fact here is that notwithstanding Senator Ray's high-minded words, which I want to move towards accepting, the opposition through Senator Faulkner has sought to embroil the Australian government and the Australian Defence Force in this conduct. I say to them, as I said to Senator Brown: that is an outrageous contention and one which I want to reject utterly. The Democrats, of course, suffer from a chronic abhorrence of the United States and anything American. They delight in heaping scorn and derision at the feet of the United States. In Kosovo and Bosnia the United States led the humanitarian team that saved so many lives there. </para><para>I want to talk about Gaddafi. Gaddafi's declaration and handing in of his weapons of mass destruction would not have occurred without the action taken in Iraq led by the United States. I want to talk about the civilian democratic movements that are springing up in Egypt and Syria and Saudi Arabia at the behest and with the assistance of the United States. I want to talk about democratic reform movements throughout the Middle East because of actions that the United States has taken. I want to talk about the 70,000 people that it is estimated would have died in Iraq under Saddam Hussein in 2003 had it not been for the coalition of the willing. I want to talk about the 5,000 children per month that were dying because of sanctions but who now live. I want to talk about the 17 municipal elections that saw democratic candidates elected. </para><para>Before my time runs out I want to talk about the fact that Senator Faulkner stood here and said that this conduct undermines everything we have sought to achieve in Iraq. Let me say this: we have the most magnificent agricultural advisers teaching people in Iraq how to grow crops and horticulture. We have Australian air traffic controllers who are daily seeing tonnes and tonnes of food and relief coming into Iraq so that its people can be fed and their medicines can be administered to them. That is under the command of Wing Commander Cheryl Steele, who I will take this opportunity to say is doing a fantastic job, as are all of our Defence Force personnel in Iraq. I want to talk about our naval training team over there who are training Iraqis to have their own navy. I want to talk about HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Stuart</inline> that is protecting oil that is being exported to provide vital resources to Iraq.</para><para>Senator Faulkner says that this conduct that has been complained of stands to undermine everything we have done in Iraq. Let me tell you one thing: the biggest undermining event that has occurred since we went to war in Iraq was when the Leader of the Opposition said that our commitment was `symbolic'. That is the greatest undermining event that has occurred to us. The Leader of the Opposition delivered to the Australian Defence Force the biggest slap in the face and the most disgraceful and disdainful thing that I have ever heard in this parliament. There is nothing symbolic about men and women of the Australian Defence Force putting their lives on the line for peace and democracy. We have done that throughout the world in so many different theatres, in so many places, in so many peacekeeping operations. For the opposition leader to say publicly that what we are doing is symbolic typifies the superficial, facile capacity of the opposition to come to terms with real, true international responsibility to do the right thing.</para><para>The Australian Defence Force have a most magnificent record of commitment and achievement throughout the world, the Middle East particularly, in peacekeeping operations. More power to them. I want to go on record to say that I have no doubt—there is not a single, solitary question in my mind—that had we been in charge these events would not have occurred. We were not in charge. We were not there. It is not our responsibility. But I trust, and want to work hard to see, that the United States arrests this conduct, puts an end to it once and for all, and thoroughly, transparently prosecutes those perpetrators.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>22781</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In supporting this motion on behalf of the Australian Labor Party I want to make it clear that we do think that Australia has some responsibilities in this matter. There is no accusation against ADF troops. Quite clearly, the ADF handed over responsibility for prisoners very early. I want to make it clear that this is not about the role of the ADF. Their conduct has not been called into question. That is not the issue here. The government—and Senator Johnston mirrored this as a member of the government—has failed to understand the importance of this issue, understand its significance and admit to and accept Australia's responsibilities. </para></talk.start><para>This issue of how the Iraqi prisoners have been treated and abused is important for a range of reasons. It is important first of all as a moral question. The whole world has been revolted by what it has now learnt about what has occurred inside the Iraqi prisons. We have been perhaps slow to voice our moral concerns. But it has had a wide range of other impacts. It has certainly undermined the standing of the coalition in Iraq because it has undermined the moral authority that we have sought to bring to Iraq and to justify the coalition's role there. </para><para>We see another example of how this has played out in the Arab world with reports today that the Commonwealth war graves in Gaza have been wrecked and vandalised and in their place have been left images of those Iraqis who were mistreated inside the coalition prisons. That is a sign of the reaction in the Arab world, a sign that this is a much bigger issue than merely the significant enough issue of the mistreatment of those particular prisoners. It is an issue that we all, as citizens of the world, have to take seriously. But it is an issue that Australia must take seriously because we are one of three coalition partners involved in the invasion of Iraq. We were the coalition of the willing. There were only three military forces committed: the US, the UK and Australia. The government has been trying to dance around the question of occupying power et cetera, but it is clear that we have responsibilities as an occupying power. We were one of the three. We therefore have responsibilities in post-war Iraq, responsibilities that have been debated in this chamber on a range of occasions and have been subject to the broader public debate about our role in Iraq.</para><para>Clearly, the government accepted those responsibilities at the time because the government signed an arrangement for the transfer of prisoners of war. I tried to get hold of this document during the war and post the war and was not able to get hold of it for some time because the government said that it wanted to seek the authority of the other partners in the coalition—the US and the UK—to make the document available. That document was signed on 23 March 2003 by the United States Central Commander, the air marshal in charge of the UK Command and Brigadier McNarn on behalf of the Australian National Headquarters. That was an arrangement for the transfer of prisoners of war, civil internees and civilian detainees between the forces of the United States of America, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and Australia. It sets out our legal and moral responsibilities for prisoners of war. It envisages the transfer between the UK, the US and Australia of prisoners of war and it sets out a commitment to the Geneva convention.</para><para>It sets out ongoing commitments for those powers who have captured Iraqis and detained them even though the actual control of those prisoners may have passed to one of the other powers. I know that Australia, mainly through the SAS, officially took 59 prisoners. The SAS captured those persons while doing the very outstanding work that they performed inside Iraq. Those Iraqi prisoners were immediately handed over, largely to British authorities, for detainment. But we had a legal responsibility for those 59 detainees. There may have been others. My information that I have been available to verify is that we had 59. They were handed over to the US and the UK.</para><para>Have we honoured our commitments under this agreement? Have the Australian government on behalf of the Australian people honoured those protocols we signed up to? Those protocols envisage us having an ongoing legal and moral interest in and an obligation to those prisoners of war. The questions we have tried to ask Senator Hill are: what has happened to those prisoners? Have they been treated appropriately? Is he satisfied that they have been treated appropriately? If not, what action has he taken to make sure that they are treated appropriately in the future? It seems to me that it would be very reasonable for us to make sure of that as part of our narrow responsibility for those 59 prisoners. I would argue that as part of the coalition and in our role as an occupying power we have a responsibility generally for prisoners taken, but clearly we have obligations in relation to at least those 59 prisoners. </para><para>The minister has been unable or unwilling to provide answers to those questions. He seems to be in denial about the capture of those prisoners, and he seems to indicate that we have no responsibilities. I do not accept that. It seems too cute by half. I saw the pictures and I have seen the reports of the SAS capturing those prisoners. The government have admitted that we captured them but are saying now that we somehow have no responsibility for them. I find that very hard to believe, particularly in the light of the formal agreement with respect to those prisoners—which the government provided. Even if it were not for that agreement, we as an occupying power and as one of the three powers in the coalition would have a broader obligation to those prisoners to take responsibility for them, to ensure they are treated humanely and to continue to satisfy ourselves that they are treated appropriately. I do not know whether any of the prisoners taken initially by Australia have ended up in the prisons in question or have been subject to mistreatment, but I think that it is reasonable to ask and that it is a reasonable matter for Minister Hill to satisfy himself and the Australian public about.</para><para>I make it very clear that there is no suggestion of any mistreatment by ADF personnel. There have been no accusations levelled—there is nothing but praise for the work they have done—but there is a moral obligation on us as an occupying power to take an interest in those prisoners, and in all prisoners, given our role in Iraq. The answers from the government to these concerns have been similar to those given by the governments of the UK and the USA. They have been far too slow and grudging in their responses to these most serious allegations. They have been far too flippant in dealing with what now appears to be a much more systemic abuse of prisoners than was originally thought.</para><para>The minister today again tried to talk about the treatment of the few involved in abuse. As allegation after allegation piles on top of the last and as photo after photo and video after video becomes available, it becomes clearer that issues of systemic abuse need to be addressed. There are questions about whether or not this has been authorised at higher levels, about whether or not this has been encouraged or at least condoned and about what action has been taken to deal with those higher up the chain. I am always very concerned when I see a series of privates being prosecuted for offences in a chain of command. That is not the way the military works. I have a great deal of difficulty, as I think many Australians do, swallowing the line that all of this started with a few privates inside the prison. All we are saying is that these are very serious issues. They greatly undermine the moral authority of the coalition inside Iraq. They greatly undermine the moral authority of the US, Australia and the UK in the Arab world. We are going to have to deal with these issues. I was pleased to see Senator Hill today admit the seriousness of concerns about the likely reaction. The deplorable action in relation to the Gaza war graves today was the beginning of the repercussions and highlights the Arab reaction to these most shocking allegations.</para><para>I think we need some answers from the Australian government. We have to have some acknowledgement of our responsibility as an occupying power to ensure our reputations as Australians are protected. We must ensure that we get to the bottom of this, that the perpetrators are brought to trial and that we deal adequately and quickly with these most serious allegations. I was very disappointed by Senator Hill's responses today. He said on ABC TV only last week that the first he knew about these events was when there were public revelations on TV only a matter of days before. In recent days we have learnt that in fact the federal government knew of the Red Cross report as early as January this year. It would strike me as very odd if they did not know about the US investigations, given that we have senior military officers attached to the joint command inside Iraq. These are serious issues that the Australian government have to address. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>22784</page.no><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Sen Ross</name><name role="display">Senator LIGHTFOOT</name><name.id>WP6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to express at the beginning of my contribution to the debate on this urgency motion my disgust and feeling of revulsion—I cannot really express adequately my disappointment; it turned my stomach—at seeing those images of the American and, to a lesser degree but still significantly, the United Kingdom forces treating prisoners in such a fashion. It was horrifying, it was disgusting, it was obnoxious and it was woeful. Those behind the malevolence and malignity of this ought to be rightly prosecuted to the fullest possible legal degree. But could I say—not at all in mitigation of that; I am not offering any rebuttal whatsoever for those actions that were taken by the forces of those countries against these prisoners—that I do not see, as is the imputation offered by the other side, that any blame whatsoever can be attributed to the Australian defence forces, the SAS or the Howard government. People of Australia should not feel personal guilt or blame for this grievous, lamentable, invidious and vexatious behaviour by armed services that are not our own.</para></talk.start><para>Australia entered the war in Iraq with the United States and the United Kingdom and with the legal imprimatur of United Nations Security Council resolution 1441. At the end of the war, although not the beginning of the peace, Australia withdrew. United Nations Security Council resolution 1483 was then invoked, with the occupying powers of the United States and the United Kingdom only. For anyone to say that Australia still had a legal responsibility is quite wrong. I understand that an election is coming up. I understand the desperateness on the other side to involve the Australian government and the Australian armed services, particularly the SAS. They come from my home state of Western Australia and did a magnificent job in Iraq. I am sure everyone in this place was proud of them, except those who speak out this afternoon and impute some malevolence on the part of the SAS. Yes, the SAS took prisoners in Iraq, but the vast majority were released and sent home, and they were pleased to be released. On the assessment of senior officers of the SAS, some were detained and handed over for further interrogation, predominantly to the United States but later some to the United Kingdom as well.</para><para>Iraq is far better off today than it was at any time during the rule of the Baath Party, particularly under Saddam Hussein. To try and draw some parallel with what the United States and the United Kingdom are doing is quite wrong, mischievous and even nefarious—it is evil. Only a tiny fraction of the 140,000 people who comprise the occupying force of the United States and the 20,000-odd people from the United Kingdom has behaved in such a manner. The vast majority are good and decent people who want to do a job and see Iraq as a democracy, as a free nation, and it is coming. Only a tiny proportion of the country is not secure. The top one-quarter or one-third of the country predominately north of Baghdad is under the control of the Kurds—and particularly their most wonderful leader His Excellency Jalal Talabani—and is going about its peaceful business and rehabilitation. It is trying to recover from the atrocities that Saddam Hussein inflicted upon the Kurdish people. It is looking for more oil and looking to establish a democracy there to live in peace after decades and generations of suffering and after losing hundreds of thousands of its people to weapons of mass destruction. </para><para>This urgency motion and debate—no matter how abhorrent these practices have been in the past, and they are stopping now and the people responsible will be punished; court martials are starting on 19 May—only bring down the good work that is being done not just by the occupying forces of the United States and the United Kingdom but by those good and decent Iraqi people, particularly the Kurds. They are putting their lives back together and want a system of democracy and a federated Iraq where all people from all walks of life and from all different religions—and there are many of them there—can live in peace side by side, can amount to something in their lives and can hopefully one day live a life similar to that which we live in Australia or that which we emulate of the United States, the United Kingdom and other parts of the free world.</para><para>I am not pleased with this urgency motion. Yes, I support part (a). No, I do not support parts (b), (c), (d) or (e)—either in part or in full. I am proud to associate myself with all the Australian defence forces, and particularly those brave men who were right out in front—past the pointy part—of the invasion of Iraq last year. They sent back signals that saved many of the lives of our allies. I am proud to be associated with the United Kingdom and the United States. I am not going to let the behaviour of a few people, as abhorrent and as evil as it is, to alter that opinion. They are good people. The coalition of the willing is a good organisation. We will bring nothing but good overall to the Iraqi people. At the end of the day, I hope that people on the other side recant and join our push for a better life for the Iraqi people over time. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>22785</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My role on behalf of the Democrats, having moved this urgency motion, is to wrap up our views.

Anyone who goes into a war situation must understand that, and that includes our leaders who lead us into war for whatever reason, no matter how spurious. Even on the basis of the rationale of trying to prevent torture, leaders have a responsibility to acknowledge that this happens. We cannot dismiss these people, as we have done—as backwoods, trailer trash and no-goods—when we have a responsibility as citizens, as part of humanity, to acknowledge that this takes place. I am sure senators have heard of the 1971 Stanford survey that was done by Professor Zimbardo in which he talked about human ability to be responsible for such acts of sadism and degradation. </para><para>This debate today is about acknowledging that at some point we have to not only denounce these acts but accept legal and moral responsibility when we go into a war situation. The engagement of the occupying powers in these acts has called into question much of the rhetoric we have heard regarding the war in Iraq. From the outset, the British, the US and the Australian governments have cast this war as a battle between good and evil. The initial justification for this war, the weapons of mass destruction, ultimately proved false. Coalition forces have not found evidence of weapons of mass destruction, and let us not forget that this was the only possible legal justification provided by coalition forces for this military action.</para><para>I put on record again that the Australian Democrats were among those who did not believe that there was any legal basis for the war. But in the absence of that legal basis for the war coalition leaders tried to make a moral case in favour of military action, arguing for a desperate need for regime change. Like every party in this place, the Democrats did condemn the horrific acts of torture, abuse and murder perpetrated by Saddam Hussein's regime. We did not believe that a controversial war without UN backing was the appropriate way to put an end to that regime. Time has unfortunately proven that these concerns were justified. More than a year later, insecurity and acts of terror continue to thrive within Iraq. The very nations that purported to save the Iraqi people from murder, torture and abuse by Saddam Hussein's regime have in fact seen such acts committed—torture, murder and abuse of Iraqis. We have witnessed a change from one regime which flouts human rights to potentially another.</para><para>Since the evidence of prisoner abuse first emerged, Prime Minister Howard has been among those who venture to argue that the abuse inflicted by the occupying forces cannot be compared to the abuse inflicted by Saddam Hussein's regime. There is a grave danger in talking about what is potentially a hierarchy of torture—that some acts or more acceptable than others. It is a dangerous, slippery slope. The children of Iraq have been saved from nothing if they are sexually abused and tortured by saviours. The women of Iraq have not been saved if they have been raped by their liberators. The evidence against US troops includes allegations that a 12-year-old girl was stripped naked and beaten and it is reported that yet to be released images include evidence of US soldiers raping Iraqi prisoners.</para><para>I welcome the condemnation of these abuses by the occupying powers. We acknowledge that the US has said that it wants to get the perpetrators, it wants to bring them to justice, yet it is easy sometimes to be cynical about what kind of justice and what the rule of law means when this nation in particular has flagrantly disregarded international humanitarian law. There are two examples of that. Guantanamo Bay is one example where we see a concocting of this new description of enemy combatants in order to get around international humanitarian law and Geneva conventions. The second disregard is the refusal to recognise the International Criminal Court—hence putting the ICC in the motion today—and asking nations to sign a statement that they will not surrender US citizens to the court. The Australian government is currently in negotiations with the US for one of these agreements, which is perhaps ironic given the crucial role that we played, particularly in establishing the ICC; hence the importance of that to this motion. The horrific acts that we have seen committed in Abu Ghraib and elsewhere potentially are exactly the kinds of offences that the ICC was established to deal with. </para><para>We have heard confusion from this government. We have heard different stories as to whether or not we are an occupying power, but at some point leaders who lead us into war have to take responsibility for their actions. I am sure the government knows this, and its attempt to divest its responsibilities for those acts are appalling. Unfortunately, we have not evolved to such a high plane that people giving or taking absolute power over other human beings can be trusted not to exploit it for their own base gratification. We have to acknowledge that war gives awful opportunities to people, and that is why we opposed it in the first place. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>22787</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>22787</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Chapman, Grant (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Chapman)</inline>—Pursuant to standing orders 38 and 166, I present documents listed on today's <inline font-style="italic">Order of Business</inline> at item 13 which were presented to the President, the Deputy President and temporary chairs of committees since the Senate last sat in April.

Finance disagreed with the seven ANAO recommendations at the time of the audit, for reasons noted in the audit report. </para><para>The JCPAA hearing on 31 May 2002 considered the disagreement between Finance and ANAO regarding the audit recommendations, and relations between Finance and ANAO during the audit. At the hearing, Finance further explained the disagreement it had voiced at the time of the audit, indicating that whilst there were some genuine differences regarding methodology, Finance considered it had already implemented some of the ANAO recommendations. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Response to the recommendation(s)</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">JCPAA Recommendation No. 1, paragraph 3.57</inline></para><para>The Committee recommends that the Department of Finance and Administration report to the Committee on whether the substance of the Australian National Audit Office's recommendations have been accepted and are being implemented.</para><para>Finance reports to the Committee as follows:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">ANAO Recommendation No.1</inline> ANAO recommended that Finance review the methodology for deriving the hurdle rate of return in the Australian Government Property Principles (AGPP). A hurdle rate of 14-15% was set in 1996, the year the AGPP were established. This rate was set using the Capital Asset Pricing Model. During the 2002-03 Budget considerations, the Government decided to reduce the hurdle rate to11%, with effect from </para><para>1 July 2002. This reduction was a reflection of the Government's lower long-term cost of funds in more recent years. The methodology used to calculate the rate was refined. The ANAO expressed broad agreement with this outcome at the JCPAA hearing on </para><para>31 May 2002. The Government also decided that the hurdle rate should be reviewed annually by Finance. The annual review for 2003-04 concluded that the rate should remain at 11.0% with effect from 1 July 2003. The hurdle rate and methodology has been reviewed again as part of the 2004-05 Budget process.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">ANAO Recommendation No.2</inline> ANAO recommended that Finance review the payment of success fees to advisers and the allocation of responsibility to advisers where success fees are used. Finance has not used success fees as a basis for remuneration of expert advisers on major property sales since August 2001, and has no current plans to do so. Finance continues to use success fees to remunerate real estate agents executing minor sales such as residential properties. This is consistent with standard practice in the property industry. The fee scales used are those recommended by industry peak bodies. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">ANAO Recommendation No.3</inline> ANAO recommended that Finance review contractual arrangements with property sales advisers to ensure full documentation and effective management of contractual commitments. Finance has procedures in place to ensure that all contractual arrangements, including variations to contracts, are formalised via comprehensive contract documentation and approval by appropriate delegates, and effectively managed via a range of widely accepted contract management mechanisms.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">ANAO Recommendation No.4</inline> ANAO recommended that, for high value property sales, Finance evaluate the merits of prioritising tender evaluation criteria and documenting the consideration of these priorities in the tender evaluation process. Finance already implements tender evaluation processes that are aimed at obtaining best value for money and are appropriate to the circumstances of the tender. Finance protects the Australian Government's financial and other interests by accepting the best conforming tender, bid or offer. Conformance covers a range of issues (refer ANAO Recommendation No.5 below) and may include, for example, environment and heritage protection and other planning considerations. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">ANAO Recommendation No.5</inline> ANAO recommended that Finance's approval process for property sale and leaseback transactions include the formal consideration of the Financial Management and Accountability Act and Regulations and the Australian Government's Property Disposals Policy, Property Principles, Procurement Guidelines, and the relevant Chief Executive's Instructions. Finance already considers all property sale and leaseback transactions in the context of how they will satisfy the objectives of all of the relevant policy and regulatory instruments, including those specified above. Finance will further formalise this practice by incorporating explicit relevant approval processes into Finance's procedures manual for property divestment (refer JCPAA Recommendation No.2 below). </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">ANAO Recommendation No.6</inline> ANAO recommended that Finance consider requiring all bidders in public tenders to lodge a security with their bid. Finance has previously explored this issue, and legal advice does not support this practice in most situations. However, should an appropriate situation arise, and if supported by legal advice, Finance would consider taking security deposits from registered bidders. Successful bidders are, in any event, always required to lodge substantial deposits upon exchange of contracts, with the balance due on settlement. </para><para>ANAO also recommended that Finance consider assessing the financial capability of short-listed tenderers. Finance already undertakes, on a case by case basis, appropriate business checks on preferred tenderers to assess their suitability as a purchaser and their ability to complete the sale transaction. Finance also includes in legally binding tender documentation the right to undertake security, probity and/or financial checks on prospective purchasers. Value for money considerations indicate that exhaustive checks are not necessary or cost effective for lower value property sales.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">ANAO Recommendation No.7</inline> ANAO recommended that Finance undertake an appropriate whole-of-lease assessment of value for money on sale and long-term leaseback transactions to ensure the financial interests of the Australian Government are protected. Finance already undertakes appropriate analyses to protect the Australian Government's financial interests. The divestment approval process includes whole-of-lease assessment against the AGPP, including the hurdle rate of return specified therein (refer ANAO Recommendations 1 and 5 above). There have been no sale and leaseback transactions implemented by Finance since June 2003. Finance's future sales will increasingly be surplus properties that are no longer required for Australian Government purposes and are less likely to involve any leaseback arrangements. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">JCPAA</inline><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation No. 2, paragraph 3.59</inline></para><para>The Committee recommends that the Department of Finance and Administration, in consultation with the Australian National Audit Office, by June 2003, develop, publish and apply a sale management better practice guide for the disposal of future Commonwealth estate properties, underpinned by the Australian Government Property Principles. </para><para>Finance supports in principle the recommendation to encourage better practice. From a property vendor's perspective, however, Finance has reservations concerning the general publication of its detailed internal procedures.

Finance and Defence have for some time, and on a regular basis, exchanged information on divestment practice.

The delegation's objectives included observing progress with the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands, RAMSI, and noting the key outcomes and support provided to the Solomon Islands. The delegation met with the Prime Minister, senior ministers and Solomon Islands community representatives. In addition, a range of briefings were provided by Australian government officials headed by Nick Warner, who is the senior DFAT official there. </para><para>The delegation was able to express on behalf of the parliament its appreciation for the outstanding contribution made by personnel of the Australian Defence Force, the Australian Federal Police and a range of aid and coordinating bodies. As parliamentarians and senators we have a responsibility to visit our personnel who are serving overseas and that particularly applies at Christmastime, so I was delighted to be part of this delegation. As always, I was impressed by their professionalism and their training. We always think that our ADF personnel, our Federal Police who accompany them and our other coordinating personnel are good, but it is a great pleasure to see how really good they are in an operation like that.</para><para>The Solomon Islands was a failing state. Lawlessness and rampant gun use were features of the community before the RAMSI intervention. Collapsing public institutions, corruption and ineffectiveness, together with a declining economy, presented a bleak future for our South Pacific neighbour. Australia, with a number of other countries in the region—and it was interesting that we were flying in Royal New Zealand Air Force helicopters—responded effectively and appropriately to the Solomon Islands' request for assistance in the middle of last year. I had visited the Solomons in April as part of a Senate inquiry into the Pacific. It was in a very sick state at that time. It was very interesting to be able to go back six months later and see how much had been improved. RAMSI halted the downward spiral of events occurring in the Solomon Islands. Law and order were quickly re-established without a shot being fired. With law and order under control RAMSI was soon able to begin making inroads into improving the government's financial framework and accountability and ensuring that the government institutions were more effective in achieving their objectives. </para><para>The delegation concluded that Australia's assistance to the Solomon Islands through RAMSI should continue until the Solomon Islands' government and the Australian government are confident of developments and that there will be no decline in conditions as assistance is slowly wound down. The committee recommended that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade provide detailed information about the regional assistance mission in its annual report. In addition, while RAMSI remains a critical part of the Solomon Islands recovery the Minister for Foreign Affairs should make an annual ministerial statement to the house reporting on the progress of RAMSI.</para><para>In conclusion I would like to thank the groups that we met with in the Solomon Islands, the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands, the Hon. Sir Allan Kemakeza, ministers, parliamentarians and representatives of RAMSI, the Australian Defence Force, the Australian Federal Police, the defence forces of other countries and a range of aid agencies. I understand that the report has been tabled. I commend the report to the Senate.</para><para>Question agreed

All State and Territory Censorship Ministers have indicated their support for the changes proposed by the Bill.</para><para>The national classification scheme assists consumers to choose films and computer games by assigning a classification and consumer advice to classified products.</para><para>The Bill merely renames the existing classification types and does not affect the criteria used to classify films and computer games. Classification decisions are made in accordance with section 11 of the Classification Act, and with the National Classification Code and the classification guidelines.</para><para>Both the National Classification Code and the classification guidelines will require amendment to reflect the changes to the names of the classification types. However, the changes will be procedural in nature and will not otherwise affect the criteria used to classify films and computer games.</para><para>The amendments will improve the operation of the national classification scheme in two main ways. </para><para>First, the amendments will implement common classification types for films and computer games. </para><para>These amendments follow and complement recent changes to the classification guidelines agreed to by the Commonwealth and the States and Territories.</para><para>The combined Guidelines for the Classification of Films and Computer Games, which came into operation on 30 March 2003, replaced the previously separate Guidelines for the Classification of Films and Videotapes and Guidelines for the Classification of Computer Games.</para><para>Submissions to the review of the previous guidelines indicated that members of the public sought clear and easily understandable classification categories and supported the creation of a single set of classification symbols for films and computer games. </para><para>Similar conclusions can also be drawn from research commissioned by the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC).</para><para>In a study conducted in March 2002, 71% of people agreed that the same classification symbols should be used for films and computer games. This research also indicated that there are poor levels of awareness of the computer games classification scheme. For example, the study found that only 43% of the population are aware that computer games are classified. This contrasts dramatically with 97% awareness of the film classification symbols. </para><para>Bearing in mind the results of this research and the fundamental policy objective of a universal classification scheme, the Bill introduces common classification types for films and computer games based on the well known film classifications. This will significantly assist consumer decision-making regarding classified products.</para><para>The new common classification types for films and computer games will be known as G, PG, M, MA15+ and RC. R18+ and X18+ classifications will apply to films only.</para><para>The second major purpose of the Bill is the creation of a more effective distinction between those classification types that are advisory in nature (being G, PG and M) and those to which legally enforceable restrictions apply (being MA15+, R18+ and X18+). </para><para>This distinction will be achieved by the removal of age references from the unrestricted classification types and use of age references for the restricted classification types only. This distinction will also assist consumers to identify the relative hierarchy of classification types. </para><para>Given the substantial difference in the material permissible in the advisory and restricted classifications, this amendment is expected to be of great assistance to consumers, particularly parents. It will also help address some of the confusion currently experienced about the difference between the M and the MA classification types. </para><para>The Attorney-General's Department and the OFLC have consulted extensively about the proposed changes. Since November 2003, consultation meetings have been held with consumers (including parents), film exhibitors, film distributors, computer games distributors, home entertainment distributors, generalist retailers, specialist retailers, the video, DVD and computer games rental industry and television. The Government responded to the issues raised during that consultation process.</para><para>The Bill makes consequential amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (the Broadcasting Services Act). Provisions of the Broadcasting Services Act apply the classification system administered by the OFLC to television Codes of Practice, internet content and datacasting.</para><para>Within the Broadcasting Services Act there are references to particular classification types. Such references are amended by the Bill to ensure consistency between the OFLC classifications and their application and use on media regulated under the Broadcasting Services Act. </para><para>The amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act do not change any of the regulatory requirements under that Act. For example, restrictions on the times that material classified MA can be shown on television will apply to both programs already classified as MA as well as those that will, after the commencement of the proposed amendments, be classified MA15+.</para><para>Following passage of the Bill, the Director of the Classification Board intends to determine, under section 8 of the Classification Act, new markings for films and computer games.</para><para>The markings prescribe the classification symbol and description that goes with each of the various classification types and specify the requirements about the display of classification information. This includes, for example, the size, location and duration of symbols, classification descriptors and consumer advice on classified products and related advertising.</para><para>In recognition of the potential impact of these changes on industry, particularly cinema, retailers and video stores, it is proposed that the new Determination of Markings will enable products classified prior to the commencement of the proposed amendments to carry the old classification marking or the new classification marking. Any products classified after commencement of the proposed amendments will be required to carry the new markings.</para><para>During development of the Bill, most stakeholders expressed strong support for a common classification system across all media. This was consistent with OFLC research findings. Therefore the Government is keen to see a common approach based on the Determination of Markings issued by the Director.</para><para>In particular, for computer games, films and programs classified MA15+, the Government expects consumers to be informed that such products are not suitable for people under the age of 15—which is the defining feature of this classification under the National Classification Code.</para><para>The Government also expects the OFLC and television to continue to work on the development of consistent messages.</para><para>The OFLC will conduct national education activities to ensure the community understands the new classification types. These activities will raise awareness of all the classification types.</para><para>Under the national classification scheme, the enforcement of classification decisions is the responsibility of the States and Territories. Accordingly, each jurisdiction has enacted complementary classification enforcement legislation.</para><para>Implementation of the proposed amendments will also involve amendments to State and Territory legislation. It is anticipated that the State and Territory legislation will follow the passage of this Bill. </para><para>Consequential changes will need to be made in the National Classification Code as part of the transition to common classification types. These amendments have been agreed in principle by Censorship Ministers and will be formalised prior to the Bill's commencement. In accordance with the requirements of the 1995 Intergovernmental Agreement on Censorship, the amendments to the Code will then be tabled in both Houses of Parliament.</para><para>The principal purpose of the national classification scheme is to inform the choices of consumers. The simple amendments made by this Bill, in conjunction with public education activities by the OFLC, will go a long way toward better meeting the important objectives of the scheme.</para><para>—————</para><para><inline ref="R2010">SURVEILLANCE DEVICES BILL 2004</inline></para><para>Australia's law enforcement personnel are always striving to stay ahead of the criminals. </para><para>Our police forces rely on a variety of tools to investigate, catch and prosecute criminal groups which are becoming ever more organised and sophisticated.</para><para>One increasingly important tool is the use of surveillance devices.</para><para>A surveillance device can be anything from an ordinary set of binoculars, a tiny microphone or camera hidden in a suspect's vehicle to a piece of software to capture the input of information to a computer.</para><para>The current surveillance device laws available to Commonwealth law enforcement are not up the job of 21st century policing. </para><para>This Bill began as an initiative of the Leaders' Summit on Terrorism and Multi-Jurisdictional Crime held on 5 April 2002. </para><para>A Joint Working Group of Commonwealth and State and Territory officials was established by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and the Australasian Police Ministers' Council. </para><para>The Joint Working Group developed comprehensive model laws for all Australian jurisdictions to improve the effectiveness of cross-border criminal investigations in the areas of controlled operations, assumed identities, protection of witness identity and electronic surveillance.</para><para>These model laws were released in a public discussion paper to solicit feedback from groups and individuals on the suitability of these proposed powers.</para><para>This Bill implements the electronic surveillance model Bill, tailoring it to the needs of the Commonwealth.</para><para>The Surveillance Devices Bill 2004 will allow the Commonwealth to consolidate and modernise its now somewhat outdated surveillance device laws and provide law enforcement agencies with access to the surveillance tools necessary to protect Australians and to investigate crime. </para><para>The Bill allows officers of the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Crime Commission or a State or Territory police force investigating a Commonwealth offence to use a greater range of surveillance devices. </para><para>The Bill will allow for data surveillance devices, optical surveillance devices and tracking devices in addition to listening devices which are currently permitted. </para><para>To restrict Commonwealth law enforcement to the use of devices which are only capable of recording spoken words is simply not adequate. </para><para>As criminal and terrorist groups make use of sophisticated technology, our police must be able to match and better them.</para><para>This Bill does not prohibit the use of surveillance devices, but rather establishes a structured process for the use of surveillance devices, where such use would ordinarily be prohibited under a State or Territory law.</para><para>The Bill also allows for a surveillance device warrant to be issued in relation to a wider range of offences. </para><para>The current listening device provisions allow for a warrant to obtained only in respect of a very limited number of specified offences. </para><para>For example, the current listening device provisions make no reference to terrorism offences, people trafficking and child sex tourism.</para><para>This Bill proposes that, in line with the electronic surveillance model Bill, a surveillance device warrant will be available for any Commonwealth offence, or State offence with a federal aspect, which carries a maximum penalty of at least three years imprisonment.  </para><para>This offence threshold ensures that an appropriate balance is struck between the public interest that law enforcement investigate serious offences and the privacy interests of individual Australians.</para><para>Two other types of offences are also specified as offences for which a warrant may be obtained. </para><para>These are offences against the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1989, which relate to the failure to declare the import or export of money in excess of A$10,000 and operating a bank account in a false name. </para><para>These are included because they are frequently indicative of more serious underlying criminal conduct.</para><para>Various offences against the Fisheries Management Act 1991are also included to assist Australia in the logistically difficult task of protecting the fisheries resources in the Australian Fishing Zone. </para><para>The Bill will also allow surveillance device warrants to be issued where a child recovery order has been issued by the Family Court to assist with the location and safe recovery of any child who is subject to an order.</para><para>Depending upon the type of device involved, the Bill will require that either a warrant or a police authorisation be obtained. </para><para>Less intrusive surveillance may be carried out without a warrant.</para><para>There is nothing unusual about this.</para><para>Police, throughout our history and across jurisdictions, have engaged in certain types of surveillance without a warrant.</para><para>For example, this might include using a pair of binoculars to watch a group of terrorist suspects scout a location for a possible attack.</para><para>This is routine police work and must not be subject to unnecessary restrictions which would destroy police effectiveness.</para><para>The power contained in this Bill for police to conduct such surveillance is arguably not necessary, however, it has been included here to clarify the law on this issue.</para><para>Importantly, the Bill makes clear that, where police surveillance is more intrusive, a warrant or internal authorisation must be obtained.</para><para>For example, where optical surveillance involves entry upon private land, a full warrant would be needed, to be issued either by a federal judge or a nominated Administrative Appeals Tribunal member.</para><para>Under this Bill, tracking devices can also be used by law enforcement officers without a warrant but with the authorisation of a senior officer of their agency where it does not involve entry onto private land or interference with the interior of a vehicle.</para><para>An officer who may authorise use of a tracking device must be at least a senior executive officer (or of Superintendent rank in State or Territory police forces) who has been authorised in writing by the Commissioner.</para><para>An internal authorisation, rather than a full warrant, is permissible in these cases because of the lower level of intrusion involved. </para><para>The Bill also permits emergency authorisations to be given by a senior executive officer of the law enforcement agency to a law enforcement officer for the use of a surveillance device in circumstances that are characterised by urgency. </para><para>The Bill provides for three such situations: where there is an imminent threat of serious risk to a person or substantial damage to property, to recover a child the subject of a recovery order, and, where there is a risk of the loss of evidence in relation to important specified Commonwealth offences, including terrorism, serious drug offences, treason, espionage and aggravated people smuggling. </para><para>The Bill brings the extra-territorial use of surveillance devices into a legislative frame-work for the first time. </para><para>The technical expertise of Australian law enforcement, particularly the AFP, has been used to great effect in this region and elsewhere, in cooperation with foreign Governments.</para><para>For example, Australian expertise in a variety of fields, in conjunction with the Indonesian police, was critically important to the investigation of the 2002 Bali bombings. </para><para>Where Australian law enforcement wish to use surveillance devices overseas, they will now need to do so subject to an Australian warrant which will bring this use under the record-keeping and reporting requirements of Australian law. </para><para>The Bill sets out the requirements for permission from the relevant foreign Governments and the limited circumstances in which extra-territorial surveillance can take place without such permission. </para><para>Generally speaking, the exceptions relate to use of surveillance devices on foreign-flagged vessels in the waters around Australia.</para><para>These extra-territorial provisions will enable Australia to more effectively tackle crime beyond our shores and in particular, will assist with the ecologically sustainable management of Commonwealth fisheries.</para><para>The extra-territorial use of surveillance devices will also complement recently introduced extraterritorial offences that allow the AFP to investigate Commonwealth offences offshore with the permission of the foreign country.</para><para>These provisions are in accordance with international law.</para><para>In recognition of the privacy implications of this Bill, the Bill imposes a range of strong accountability measures. </para><para>The most intrusive types of surveillance must be subject to the scrutiny of a judge or AAT member before the surveillance begins, or, in the case of an emergency authorisation, within two business days after the authorisation has been given.</para><para>The subsequent use, disclosure or communication of material gathered by, or relating to, a surveillance device is subject to stringent restrictions.</para><para>For example, it is an offence to communicate such material unless it is covered by one of the exceptions.</para><para>And record-keeping requirements ensure that all documents relevant to surveillance device use under warrant or authorisation must be kept to establish a proper compliance paper-trail.</para><para>Chief Officers of law enforcement agencies using Commonwealth warrants and authorisations must submit detailed reports, both after a warrant or authorisation has expired and also annually.</para><para>The Bill also imposes a duty on the Chief Officers to destroy surveillance device material when it is not longer relevant to one of the permitted purposes in the Bill.</para><para>The Bill contains strong powers for the Commonwealth Ombudsman to inspect law enforcement agencies. </para><para>The Ombudsman must report on a six-monthly basis to the Attorney-General who in turn must table these reports in Parliament. </para><para>Importantly, the Ombudsman has the power to compel law enforcement officers to answer questions or produce relevant documents.</para><para>This Bill will greatly increase the capacity of Australian law enforcement agencies to investigate serious offences, including terrorism, while maintaining an appropriate respect for the privacy of all Australians.</para><para>—————</para><para><inline ref="R1678">WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (AWARD SIMPLIFICATION) BILL 2002</inline></para><para>Australia's Workplace Relations system needs progressive, evolutionary change. </para><para>Despite falls in unemployment, it remains the duty of this Government through Parliament to do whatever we reasonably can to create jobs.</para><para>Reforms since 1996 have resulted in fewer strikes, lower inflation, higher productivity and lower interest rates. This Government has helped Australian families improve their living standards with more choice and more disposable income.</para><para>The reforms to awards in this bill will continue to maintain a safety net of minimum wages and conditions to protect the low paid and disadvantaged in the work force.</para><para>The Government is now in a position to introduce a further single issue bill drawn from the More Jobs, Better Pay bill 1999.</para><para>The award simplification process under the 1996 Act has been beneficial to employers and employees. Since July 1998 over 1,400 obsolete awards have been set aside, and over 1,000 have been simplified.</para><para>Award simplification has established a fairer and more streamlined safety net of minimum wages and conditions of employment. It has also facilitated agreement making and more productive workplaces. </para><para>It is now appropriate for the Parliament to enact measures for further targeted simplification. Overly complex and restrictive awards hinder agreement making at individual workplaces and act as a barrier to continued employment growth.</para><para>This bill amends the Workplace Relations Act to tighten and clarify allowable award matters. Provisions will be removed which duplicate other legislative entitlements, or which are more appropriately dealt with at the workplace. </para><para>This bill will more clearly define and specify allowable award matters. For example, redundancy pay will only relate to genuine redundancy, and not to resignation by an employee. The range of matters currently referred to as `other like forms of leave' will be more closely specified and the bill clarifies matters that are isolated from an award.</para><para>The current provisions of section 89A which allow matters that are incidental to the specified allowable award matters and necessary for the effective operation of the award are amended to include only matters which are essential for the purpose of making a particular provision operate in a practical way. This bill will ensure that awards maintain a safety net system but one that is appropriately streamlined. </para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline

Greens:</para></talk.start><para>Omit “should be received by a meeting of the House of Representatives in the House chamber, to which all senators are invited as guests”, substitute “be received by a meeting of senators and members held in the Great Hall of Parliament House, Canberra”.</para><para>The Greens have been very strong on this issue throughout. Before President Bush and President Hu visited this parliament and were given the extraordinary privilege of speaking in the House of Representatives to the two chambers of parliament, gathered together but separate, last October, we moved to have both President Bush and President Hu address this parliament in the Great Hall. We believe that should be the future practice and this amendment gives effect to that. We do not believe that this chamber should be put in an ancillary position at the side of the House of Representatives with addresses from visiting heads of state. We believe that the proper process here is for heads of state, who are essentially strangers when they come to this parliament, to address both houses—and indeed other people—in the Great Hall.</para><para>The practice that is being recommended by the Procedure Committee is not consistent with the constitutional arrangement whereby the two chambers of this parliament are equal but separate. I reiterate that it was entirely wrong of the Speaker of the House of Representatives—and insofar as the committee finds that the President of this place was complicit—to prohibit Senator Nettle and me from a sitting of the Senate when President Hu visited in October last year. The outcome of that unsatisfactory arrangement and the breach of proper procedure and defence of this chamber and its rights is being compounded by the motion that is now before this parliament. </para><para>We should not be subservient or copycats of arrangements made in other parliaments. I remind senators that the standing orders of this place, and indeed the constitution, indicate that the people who should speak in this chamber are the people elected by the Australian public to this chamber. We have an excellent provision in the Great Hall for receiving other people including the heads of states of the great powers and indeed of any other country. That is where their addresses should be given to the members of parliament and to the people of Australia. These chambers are for the elected representatives of this country.</para><para>Joint sittings become impossibly difficult to sort out in terms of which rules of which house are to be applied. I might say that the arrangement that is now being put in place here effectively makes senators subservient to the Speaker of another place when visiting heads of state come to address the parliament. They will of course be addressing the house of assembly and not the parliament, but I would bet right here and now that that truth will not be observed by future prime ministers and future governments. They will be inviting the heads of state not to address the House of Representatives but to address the parliament of Australia.</para><para>Under the terms of this motion that will not be the case. Let us make that very clear: they will be addressing the House of Representatives with senators invited to sit at the back with their rights to take place in debate removed and with their rights to represent their constituents in this country removed, as we saw on 23 and 24 October last year. We believe this is a mistake. We believe this is not consistent with the intention of the Constitution or the electors of this parliament. Sure, it may be an arrangement that is satisfactory to other parties within this parliament, but we beg to disagree—and disagree very forcibly. We believe the better arrangement is for such great events as speeches from visiting heads of state to be held in the Great Hall. That is among its ostensible purposes. That is the rightful place for such speeches to be given.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>22800</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This recommendation was the unanimous view of the Procedure Committee but this matter was also referred to the Privileges Committee for consideration, which unanimously endorsed the Procedure Committee report.

Senator Brown has alluded to the fact that it is probably almost impossible to write rules for a genuine joint sitting with absolute equality between the two chambers. Senator Brown is wrong when he says the only people who can speak here are those who are elected.

I think it is just a balance. If you are going to go ahead with what are called joint sittings, joint meetings or an assemblage of all parliamentarians it is fair enough that those be on the House of Representatives side. I do not know whether Senator Brown will be sitting up the back. I will never know, because I do not go to joint sittings. I went to one in 1991 and I have not been to one since, because I find them the most insufferably boring and tedious events. I do not know how we can really duchess some visiting dignitary by inflicting that on them. That is beyond me, but apparently it does work. If it does work—if we can get an extra trade concession or something else by having a joint meeting—good on them. </para></talk.start></continue><para>What I am most concerned about is how parliamentary privilege applies. Frankly, I cannot work out any way it can apply to joint sittings as they have been held in the past. It is simply a nightmare. I think the simplest solution that the Labor Party has found is to meet in the House of Representatives and operate under their rules. If I go over tonight and listen to the budget, I go over there in exactly that capacity: I operate under their rules and, if I misbehave, I might be disciplined by them—who knows?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name></talker><para>—But it is a meeting of the House and not the—</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>—It depends how this is going to be purported in future, Senator Brown. If it is going to be purported for a meeting a la the United States Congress, that would be a wrong representation, once we come to these arrangements. It is a meeting to which all parliamentarians are invited—nothing more; nothing less. All those questions of privilege and standing orders disappear because only one set applies, because the meeting is occurring in the House of Representatives. So we disagree with Senator Brown on this matter. We think that the proposal coming out of the Procedure Committee and endorsed by the Privileges Committee is the very simple way of approaching these matters. It is not totally satisfactory. Incidentally, I do not like the idea of meeting in the Great Hall. I do not find it a very attractive place for meetings, frankly. One of the reasons you have these meetings in a parliamentary chamber is the atmospherics.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>—You have been there, though, haven't you?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>—To the Great Hall?</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>—Yes.

In conclusion, we are not going to agree with the Greens on this matter. I do not say that with any animus at all. We just have a different view of these things. I think that this solution from the Procedure Committee is a simple one—not brilliant but simple and adequate—and I think we will be able to proceed that way in future.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>22801</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Democrats will support this motion. We think it is time that this whole matter was tidied up and that there were protocols that everybody understood and agreed to. We had the situation where some heads of government were entertained in the Great Hall and others were invited to address the chamber. There was always a doubt about whether it was the Senate or the House of Representatives, and essentially it was a bit of a mess. We have always said that we thought the Great Hall was an appropriate place. I accept Senator Ray's comments about the atmosphere. It is a great place for a dinner but not necessarily a great place for people hearing well, seeing the speaker and so forth. If they are up the back of the Great Hall, you are unlikely even to be able to see. So, in that respect, I think it is useful work that the Procedure Committee has done in making this recommendation. </para></talk.start><para>We will support Senator Brown's amendment about the Great Hall because it has been our view for some time that that is the appropriate place. You still have a difficulty here if the House of Representatives or the government—or whoever makes the decision—chooses not to have a head of state address the parliament in whichever chamber. I do not think that has yet been resolved. Do you have to be a country of a certain size before it warrants an invitation to address the chamber? We have not dealt with that very important issue, so we will still get anomalies and difficulties. For that reason, I think our preference would be to stick with the Great Hall. But if that amendment is not passed, we will support this change.</para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the amendment (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>17:16:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.</para></division.header><para>(The President—Senator the Hon.

I put that suggestion forward because I will be voting differently on the two parts of the motion. Secondly, I want to explain why the Greens will be opposing the second part of the motion. We do not believe that any component of the Senate proceedings should be made secondary, which is effectively what this motion does. It means that private members time on Thursday afternoons will be made a matter of no determination if there is a division, whereas at all other times the Senate can make a determination.</para></talk.start><para>The Greens are strong defenders of private members time; there is too little of it in the Senate. All the crossbench senators, and indeed the opposition, value private members time greatly. Effectively what is being said is that after 4.30 p.m. there are planes to be caught and if you are going back to Western Australia, Tasmania or the Northern Territory—and I understand that—it is much better to do that and not to have a vote in the chamber at that time on Thursday afternoons. I do not accept that. Change the sitting times if we must, but retain the right at all times for a deliberation when matters are being debated, not least during private members time. In my books, it will make private members time after 4.30 p.m. on Thursdays a subsidiary matter to government time. I do not know whether there is another explanation for this. I note that the vote will be put off until the next day of sitting. I believe we should not entertain that. More importantly, the second component of this motion states:</para><quote><para>(b)	if objection is made to a motion being taken as a formal motion, a proposal to suspend standing orders to allow the motion to be moved shall not be received by the President and put to the Senate unless 5 senators, including the mover ... indicate support ...</para></quote><para>This is another move to repress the increasing diversity of this place. As we know, and we saw it today, urgency motions can only be gotten up when supported by five senators—that means the Labor Party, the coalition or the Democrats. If urgency motions come from the Independents, the Greens or One Nation, unless they can get four people from other parties or four individuals to support them they will never, ever put one up. In fact, I have had one or two in all of my time in this place, and they were successful through the support of either the Democrats or Labor. There is an impediment to urgency motions coming forward from this corner of the house if you do not have more than five members.</para><para>The motion before the Senate effectively will extend to formal motions where there is a proposal to suspend standing orders to allow the motion to be moved and debated. You will need five members to support that process. It effectively means that the rest of the Senate will be able to remove consideration and a vote on a motion which may be very important to the individual and a supporter in this place. However, whereas two are required now for a division and for this process, five will be required in future. I cannot support a move to take away existing rights of Independent senators or smaller parties in this place in this way, and that is exactly what this will do. I do not know who will be here after the next election or five elections from now, but I am aware that there is a general tendency by the bigger parties in particular to use numbers to keep newcomers at bay. The simplest expression of that, and it applies right around the country, is to put Independents on the right-hand side of the ballot paper when everybody else goes into a ballot to see what place they get on the ballot paper. As far as Independents are concerned, they are always on the right-hand side; they never, ever get the left-hand column. Therefore, Independents get the donkey vote. Who legislated that? Not the Independents. It was legislated by the big parties of the day in all parliaments in Australia, as far as I am aware, and it is wrong. </para><para>Here we have a proposal to further remove existing powers of Independents and smaller parties of fewer than five members in this place, and I oppose it. It is not fair. There will be all sorts of arguments about time saved and so on. We should have more private members time, and the resort to moving that `a motion being taken as a formal motion, a proposal to suspend standing orders to allow the motion to be moved' is not used frequently. In fact it has been used much less frequently in recent times than five or six years ago. This is a trial, but, as we know, trials are brought in simply to be converted into standing orders a little way down the track. We oppose the motion.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>22804</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—At the outset I make it clear that I am not speaking in my ministerial capacity and therefore am not seeking to close the debate. I would seek to wear a hat either as a member of the committee or as a private senator, which I can do. Senator Brown, in relation to the 4.30 p.m. provision of part (2)(a) of the motion, we are very happy to have that voted on separately and will be happy to give leave if that is what is required.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Brown, when talking about part (2)(a) of the motion moved by Senator Troeth, mentioned the need for this change. We say quite clearly that of course it is only on a trial basis. It is only for this session. It will, effectively, apply to only three Thursdays, from memory—we have only three sitting weeks in this session—this week's and two other Thursdays. It is being done on that basis because the consensus in the Procedure Committee was that it was a change that we would like to see. We would like to see how it operates and whether the sorts of problems that Senator Brown envisages occur. We would then have the chance to review it in the next set of sittings.</para><para>The reason for the 4.30 p.m. cut-off is as Senator Brown has predicted. It is to allow senators the same opportunity that our friends and colleagues in the other place have, and that is to get home to their constituencies at a reasonable time on Thursday evenings. It will enable them to travel to the airport without having to engage in a stressful race. It will enable them to catch aeroplanes that take many of them to the most remote parts of this incredibly large continent. Some go to North Queensland, some go to Queensland, some go to Western Australia—I declare my strong vested interest in that regard—others go to the Northern Territory, as Senator Brown mentioned, and still others go to Tasmania. That is, without any shadow of a doubt, the reason it is being done. There is no secret agenda there. </para><para>We want to ensure that senators can get home to their constituencies on Thursday nights without having to engage in a stressful and sometimes dangerous race to the airport. A lot of highly stressed individuals around Australia and around the world actually die doing that. A lot of people have heart attacks at airports and on the way to airports. There may not be much sympathy out there for politicians rushing to airports, but I think that those of us who spend much of our lives racing to airports know that it is not a good thing to do. So we are seeking to avoid that. </para><para>Currently, the standing order provides, almost identically, that no divisions will be taken after six o'clock. That provision was in fact put there for a similar reason, but the practical reality of airline schedules—and, I think, the practical reality after 14 September 2001, when Ansett effectively collapsed—is that there are fewer services and fewer options to get out of Canberra and travel to one of those far-flung parts of the continent. Six o'clock may have worked relatively well up until 14 September 2001, but there are now simply far fewer flights and far fewer options on Thursday evenings when you are trying to shift a couple of hundred senators and members and many hundreds more staff out of Canberra to destinations around the nation. That is the reason.</para><para>I do not think that this diminishes the value of the business that is being conducted in the Senate at the time. A good example is that you can still have votes; it is simply that you cannot have divisions. If something is controversial and needs to be voted on, then the Procedure Committee has come up with a sensible, rational and fair way of dealing with such a contested vote, and that is to have it the next time the Senate sits and everyone is here. I make the point that it does not diminish the quality or the importance of the debate that may be going on after 4.30 p.m. In fact, earlier on a Thursday—at 12.45 p.m.—it is the practice of the Senate to deal with large volumes of government legislation in what is called the non-controversial timeslot. The Senate goes through a process of working out what legislation we can deal with at that time. I make the point that legislation dealt with at that time is no less important; it is simply not legislation that requires anything other than an affirmative vote. We take votes on all of that legislation. The amount of legislation that goes through in that timeslot is quite substantial. I would hazard a guess and say that, on average, it is probably three or four bills every week. Over 20 sitting weeks that is a massive number of bills. That does not mean that those pieces of legislation are less important. So I ask Senator Brown to consider that argument.</para><para>In relation to the suspension of standing orders seeking the declaration of a motion as formal, I point out that it is already practice in the Senate that, for an urgency motion to be declared, five senators are required to stand in their places. That is standard, existing Senate practice if you want an urgency motion debated. You need that for matters of public importance as well. So it is not some sort of conspiracy to crack down on Independent senators; it is a process that brings into line existing Senate practice in relation to urgency motions and motions to deal with matters of public importance.</para><para>In relation to providing time for private senators' matters or non-government business, I point out that there are very few parts of the Senate schedule where government business is guaranteed. This afternoon is a good example of that. Since the end of question time I do not think we have dealt with any government business. We are now here at 5.36 p.m., and for some hours this afternoon we have been dealing with everything but government business. The Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer has come in to ask about her bill on whatever she is dealing with at the moment. We have told her, Senator Murray and others who are interested to come back in perhaps half an hour when this debate has finished. That is a fact. In many sections of the week, government business time is that amount of time that is left over after we have dealt with everything else. </para><para>I am not saying that the government gets a bad shake out of this place. The reality is that through negotiations and discussion—and, 90 per cent of the time, through very good will on behalf of the opposition, Senator Brown, the Democrats, and Senator Harradine and other Independents—we ensure that we balance business between what the government needs to deal with the legislative program and what other senators need for dealing with formal motions, urgency motions, matters of public importance and even private members' bills on Thursday afternoons. I think that through it all Senator Brown would, if he were fair, say that we strike a reasonable balance in these things, and that is what we seek to do. I commend the Procedure Committee for bringing forward these proposals to amend the standing orders and create some temporary orders for the balance of these sittings—albeit the very shortest sittings in the Senate calendar this year; I think there are only 10 sitting days to go.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">McLucas, Jan (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator McLucas)</inline>—By way of clarification: we will deal with paragraphs (2)(a) and (2)(b) separately, Senator Brown.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>22806</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I address myself to both of these issues. It is important for the Senate to understand that the recommendations of the Procedure Committee on the substantive issues in relation to when a division can be called—what time on Thursday afternoons in the first instance—and the procedures relating to formal motions are compromise recommendations. They are issues that the Procedure Committee has been examining for some time, particularly in relation to the question of how to deal with formal motions, and there is recognition by the committee that it is useful in this circumstance for us to recommend that a sessional order apply. The Procedure Committee is not recommending a change to the standing orders at this point; it is recommending temporary orders be put in place.</para></talk.start><para>The first issue is that if a division is called for on Thursday after 4.30 p.m. then that matter be held over until the Senate next sits. I think this is a quite unremarkable change, I really do. Current standing order 57(3) states:</para><quote><para>If a division is called for on Thursday after 6 pm, the matter before the Senate shall be adjourned until the next day of sitting at a time fixed by the Senate.</para></quote><para>All this temporary sessional order of the Senate does is amend the time of 6 p.m. to 4.30 p.m. My maths might be wrong but I think that means, given that this would apply to the end of the current sittings period, it will be effective for only three sitting weeks—this week and the last two weeks of June, given that we have an estimates fortnight situated between them. We are talking about a proposed temporary order of the Senate to apply for three Thursdays that changes the time of this particular standing order—that is, from 6 p.m. to 4.30 p.m. I do not see this as a radical change; it is a compromise from the Procedure Committee. There is an element of, `Let's have a look at this; let's see how it works for a very limited period of time.' There is an element of the Procedure Committee having another look at it to see if a further sessional order is warranted or, as sometimes happens, proposing the consideration of a change to the Senate standing orders. It is pretty unremarkable, I have got to say. If there is a matter of great moment and dispute that leads to a division being required after 4.30 p.m., it is not as though the division will not happen—it will just not happen then. It will happen, but it just will not happen after 4.30 on the Thursday afternoon. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Robert Ray</name></talker><para>—It never happens anyway.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—That is absolutely right, Senator Ray.

Let us not turn this into some sort of international incident or claim that it is a massive denial of democratic rights; it is not. But if perchance it does not work, and I think that is rather unlikely, the Procedure Committee can have a look at it in the very near future. I would like to think, given the spirit with which it dealt with this proposal in the first instance, it will come forward with a sensible recommendation.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Having said that about the first of the proposals that have exercised Senator Brown a little, let me now turn to the second one—which I think is a more substantive issue.

Can we divide on it? Paragraph (2)(b) is a matter of greater substance, and most senators in this chamber know it is also a matter which has concerned the opposition for a considerable period.</para></talk.start></continue><para>One useful thing I think the Procedure Committee has done is produce this report, which gives a valuable history of the way formal motions have developed. Their use has changed since they were included in the first set of Senate standing orders in 1903. It is a massive change; but most of that evolution has occurred over recent years. I think the Senate would be aware that the opposition have been concerned that some motions adopted by the Senate—particularly motions on foreign policy—run the risk of being misunderstood by other sovereign governments. The distinction between the Senate agreeing to a motion and the executive government adopting a position is something that is not well understood. It is a very poor mechanism to adopt. It is a very blunt instrument for us to deal with. </para><para>One of the great weaknesses of these formal notices of motion is that senators are asked to either agree or disagree with formality: you either agree with the motion as it is moved by the senator or you do not. The capacity for amendment is not available to any senator, except on occasions when it occurs by negotiation—and that is a small minority of occasions. You cannot amend it. In some areas the nuances of these motions are important. It does make a difference how motions are worded, and small amendments can make a difference. So it is a blunt instrument. If you agree to formality, you are forced to vote either in favour of it or against it. </para><para>What is the alternative? It is to declare such a motion `not formal'. If you declare such a motion not formal, it is then the right of the senator who has proposed the motion to move a suspension of standing orders—an automatic right. As a result of amendments to the standing orders proposed by me when I was Manager of Government Business in the Senate in the good old days when Labor was in government, those debates on the suspension of standing orders are now limited to half an hour, five minutes per speaker. But it is still a half-hour chunk out of the day. At the end of the day, you determine an issue by voting on whether to suspend standing orders to debate the motion or not. Again, it is an unsatisfactory situation.  </para><para>I do not say that this has necessarily been abused by senators. You could say that this mechanism has been abused; I do not say that. This is a mechanism available to senators in the Senate standing orders. There have been absurd congratulatory motions concerning sports men, women and others—some have been for quite significant achievements, but some have been for the odd achievement or the odd issue that was pretty trifling—and the chairs themselves have attempted at times to rule such things out of order. But it is the issue of substance that is of concern to the opposition, and we have argued for a long time that it ought to be of concern to the government, particularly in the area of foreign policy. The government have not shared those concerns. They share them now, but they were not willing to act when the opposition made strenuous attempts after Labor lost government in 1996 to see if we could make some changes to the way this particular provision of the standing orders worked. We were unsuccessful in that. Now there is a broader acceptance, we need to do something about it. </para><para>It is said that this is antidemocratic in some way, that it stifles the voice of minorities in the chamber. I do not think that is true. I do not think a substantive argument can be made to suggest that that is the case. Frankly, if you are unable to get five senators to stand in their place to call on a debate for the suspension of standing orders, you have got Buckley's of getting to 39. That is the truth. That is the hard, bottom line politics of this. If you cannot get five people to stand up in their place to bring on a debate about a matter, what chance have you got, really, of seeing such a thing being carried? At the end of the day, so much of the way this chamber works is by negotiation off chamber—in the margins. That is how it works. Most of these sorts of debates are the exception, not the rule. Most of these sorts of matters are matters of negotiation between whips, between managers and between others—at times even party leaders have some responsibilities in these areas. There are senators in the government and in the opposition responsible for chamber management, and those on the crossbenches also take an active role in chamber management. </para><para>I frankly believe that this is the case on key issues, on priority issues. When a senator believes that something is of sufficient significance that it ought to be brought on for an opportunity to consider whether a formal motion should be agreed to, I am not in much doubt that a senator will not receive support. But it does put a brake on this procedure. It does send a signal to all of us in the Senate that this is a procedure, a mechanism, in the standing orders that has spun out of control over the past number of years. This is an attempt to say, `Is there a sensible, fair and reasonable way of trying to adopt a procedure that is going to work in the best interests of the Senate as a whole?'</para><para>I think you can make a very strong argument, by the way, for more dedicated time for non-government business—or general business, as it is described. I believe that in the not too far distant future in this chamber we will hear more arguments presenting that point of view. I think governments of any political persuasion, if they are smart, will say: `This is quite reasonable. If we can dedicate more time to that, it might be a good idea but, on the other hand, let us see if we can dedicate some time to government business.' The point that the Manager of Government Business in the Senate makes about the capacity for government business time to be gobbled up on a pretty regular basis has some truth to it, but there is a quid pro quo in this sort of thing—if you want more general business time with the capacity for non-government senators to debate business in this place, the other side of the ledger is more dedicated time for government business. </para><para>This is the sort of thing we ought to be looking at if we are serious about reform in this chamber. I would commend that to the government, the opposition, the minor parties and the Independents as a way forward in dealing with some of these age-old problems. I believe that, on this particular occasion, the Procedure Committee has taken a pretty balanced view of what is a difficult, growing and quite serious problem. That is where the opposition come from on this matter. We accept that the debate on general business motions—the mechanism of general business notices of motion—has evolved and developed in a way that was never intended. This proposed mechanism, which will apply for about 12 sitting days only, is a start to addressing it. I am all in favour of the Procedure Committee, after it has applied for what will literally be a handful of days, taking a good hard look at how effective it has been, seeing whether it stands the test of scrutiny and applying its mind to how this issue should be addressed in the future. The opposition have identified it as a problem for a long time now. We believe the Procedure Committee has adopted a balanced view; it is a compromise position. I personally believe, as do my colleagues, that it is likely to be an improvement. We certainly believe it is worth testing and trialling for the few remaining weeks of this session. It is for all those reasons—and they are important reasons—that the opposition will support this proposal.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>22809</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to indicate that the Democrats will not support the no divisions provision, 2(a), or the formality suspension of standing orders provision, 2(b). I will take 2(b) first so I can respond to Senator Faulkner's remarks. Some figures have just been passed to me. Senator Faulkner said this has spun out of control and that it is a serious problem that needs to be addressed because it was never intended that this procedure be so demanding on the Senate's time. My response is that, in 2002, there were three motions to suspend standing orders. From the records I have, there were more in 1994, 1995 and 1996 than at any other time. There were 10 in 1994, 14 in 1995 and 19 in 1996, so it is hardly a problem that has suddenly emerged as a big issue and a great time waster. I think it is exaggerating the problem, to say the least.</para></talk.start><para>It is a poor solution to what is really a nonexistent problem. The number of senators required to support this measure is totally arbitrary. It has some connection with being in support of an urgency motion or a matter of public importance, but that is all. Otherwise you could just say that it is designed to keep those who cannot muster five senators from doing this. Of course, what we know is that standing orders are suspended largely by the crossbench. I am the whip of the Democrats, and we have seven senators. Even with a lot of forewarning and notice, it can be quite difficult to muster five people into the chamber at one point in time, not because it is difficult to contact them or anything of that sort but because people have other commitments such as meetings they cannot get out of or committee work. There is a whole range of reasons why people find it difficult to get into the chamber at a point in time. Often we have to wait a length of time, so it is also time wasting. I would argue that we need to reform that system. From our point of view, it is an unnecessary barrier to a process that should be available.</para><para>You cannot do anything but conclude that this is about the non-Democrat, non-Labor and non-government members of the Senate—those who are Independents or with other parties such as the Greens—and I do not think that is fair. One of the major problems is that we never know when formality will be denied, so it could be there is not the requirement for someone who denies formality to have five people behind them in support of that denial. If we are going to go down this path, maybe that is what should happen. But that has not been considered in this proposal. Maybe that is the compromise Senator Faulkner is talking about, although I must say that I do not remember that being proposed by anybody in the Procedure Committee. </para><para>It is a mechanism which allows us to debate difficult motions, and there is nothing wrong with that. There is no other way of debating motions at the present time. If formality is denied, it ought to be for a good reason and there ought to be an opportunity for people to say what the reason for denial is and for others to have a different view and to express that. It is a democratic process. It is about getting on the record, getting on the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, why it is that this motion is deemed not to be appropriate to vote on at this point in time. It is a poor solution, in our view. The number of people required to suspend standing orders is arbitrary. The point has been made that you are not going to reach 39 if you cannot reach five. If that is the case, why not make the required number 38? That would bring you closer to knowing whether the motion was likely to be supported. Since when has there been a requirement to demonstrate an ability to win a vote before, say, going to a division? Is the next thing going to be that you cannot call a division unless you have five or, again, 38 supporters? That presupposes that everybody has made up their mind at that point in time. It just does not make any sense. One can only conclude that this is a procedural change meant to stop a problem that does not exist.</para><para>It is not going to be a trial. It does not matter how many weeks we have. There were only three suspensions in 2002; it may be six months before we have another suspension of standing orders. Should we manufacture one just so that we can see how it works? Is that what we ought to do? I think it is silly to call this a trial. It is not a trial. We are just going to change it, and that is how it will go.</para><para>I turn to the issue of not having divisions after 4.30 p.m. on Thursdays. I cannot see any logical reason for this. For some time in this place consideration has been given to those people who have to travel very long distances to get back to their constituents or to their families—which in some cases I think are more important—and pairs have been provided. There have been informal arrangements made in this place. I guarantee that after 4.30 on Thursdays there is not going to be a full complement in this place in any case. That is the arrangement we have been operating under for a very long time. There is no pressing need to suddenly change the rules. Senator Ian Campbell said that this change was not a reflection on the importance of general business. Then I would say: what about we move it? If general business is no less important, then let us shift it to Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday.</para><para>As it is, private senators' bills are shoved to the end of the week, and that in itself suggests that they are not as important. They are rarely voted on. Sometimes they are, but only when pressure can be applied by the senator, who is usually from the crossbench. Normally there is some time wasting and there are some deliberate attempts to frustrate the process of this place. The reward is given often informally and usually by the ALP, who say, `We'll allow this to go to the vote,' with agreement from the government. Otherwise it is talked out, as we in this place all know. To say that no lesser importance is being given to general business on a Thursday by not having a vote is a nonsense. It is not clear to me what happens if a vote is taken on the next day of sitting. That next day of sitting may be weeks and weeks later if that Thursday happens to be at the end of a sitting period. How will people remember what the debate was all about, even if the next sitting day is the following Monday? It hardly seems possible that disconnecting the vote from the debate is a democratic step forward. </para><para>Again, it is no real trial. I do not even know if we will have a bill to deal with on the Thursdays remaining in this so-called trial period. No protocol has been established, as I said, for what happens when we do come to the vote. Will there be on the next day of sitting further debate before we have the vote? Who knows? Will the vote be held at the beginning of the day or at the end of the day? How does that all work? It is not at all clear to me. This has just not been thought through.</para><para>The other thing about Thursdays is that government members in particular constantly complain about the fact that we have committee meetings during sitting times and at other times between sittings and that we do not take the opportunity to use the Fridays at the end of a sitting week. I do not know how many times I have been lectured about the apparent reluctance of senators to stay over on Thursday nights in order to do what is expected of them—that is, stay here on Fridays and do committee work. The signal being sent is that Fridays are not days on which we expect to work in Canberra.</para><para>The Democrats would like to see real reform in this area but not reform that would take away the need for us to be in this place and that would further diminish the importance of this chamber and of attendance in this place. We think real reform should be about making sure that there is more time given in general business to dealing with private senators' bills, that there is no fixed period within which the debate must be completed and that there is an opportunity for the vote to be taken on that legislation so that we can see how both government and opposition members—and other members of the crossbench—will vote. That is a reasonable ask, and we should move to a system which is not just dependent on individual senators making or not making a nuisance of themselves, on informal arrangements that might be a quid pro quo or on deals done over a range of matters that are often not transparent or obvious to the rest of the chamber. That is where we need reform to general business.</para><para>In replying to the comments about general business taking up so much time, there is general business and there is general business. We have spent a lot of time this afternoon talking about what is a critically important issue. It might not be government business, but it is about the business of the Senate and it is no less important than dealing with government business. If there is not enough time for government business, let us have that debate. Let us talk about longer sitting times if that is what is necessary. Let us talk about ways in which we can facilitate government legislation. But, as we know, for almost as long as I can remember government business has been put up which is not necessary—either because we have rejected it in the past and are going to reject it again or because the government is not ready. Let us fix those problems so that we have an orderly sitting, particularly at the end of a parliamentary sitting, to deal with government business instead of talking about reform in general business time.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>22811</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank Senator Allison for allowing these matters to proceed to debate today because, in the general tradition of the Procedure Committee, unless we have unanimous consent we do not put matters forward. Senator Allison has graciously allowed us to debate these issues here because other members of the committee felt strongly about it, and her dissent was noted in the report quite properly. </para></talk.start><para>Senator Allison is a bit confused about one thing: the purpose of five people standing in their place. She says that there has hardly been any suspension of standing orders. That is true, but do you want to know why? Because it is a waste of time. Therefore, people allow formality and vote things down just to avoid a whole series of motions for the suspension of standing orders. What this rule does is empower people to challenge the formality of the motion. That is what it is about. Forget the dissembling from Senator Ian Campbell here today that this is just bringing it into line with urgency or MPI motions. We sat through the debate, so we know that is utter rubbish, and why that was put forward here today I have no idea. What we see as a problem in this chamber is an occasional or at times a persistent abuse of the formality process. As Senator Faulkner said, some motions are put up here that should never, ever be considered formally. They are complex and have foreign affairs knock-on complications. They should be challenged, they should be relegated to somewhere else and not determined. That is precisely the reason this particular rule is being introduced. It is a fairly generous one. It does not set the bar too high, but it makes it a little more difficult to grandstand in this place. </para><para>Senator Allison talks about a reduction in democratic rights. If the procedures of this place are abused, all our democratic rights are reduced. That is the problem I have with this. Every time we leave a weakness in the standing orders, it is exploited by minority groups. Sometimes I think that is a good thing; sometimes it is a bad thing. This merely puts a brake on it. And, as we have pointed out, it will be tested over only a few parliamentary days. Senator Allison is quite right, though, when she says that usually when these things are tested they become an inevitability. There is an element of that, and that should be put on the record.</para><para>On the question of not having divisions after 4.30 on Thursdays, the reality of this chamber is that, if you do not want to take a vote on Thursday general business, you talk it out. There is nothing we can do about that. Governments often do it; sometimes oppositions do it. Therefore, it is irrelevant to say that we are curbing the rights of senators to have a vote on something. We are not at all. We are probably making it a little more likely. Senator Allison has said—and she might be right—that this may allow too many people to leave the chamber. That is up to the political parties. I have never shot through from here on a Thursday night, and neither has Senator Faulkner. A lot of us stay because we believe it is our duty to stay.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator Patterson</name></talker><para>—As do some of us on this side, too.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>—We have had only one vacuous contribution from your side, so I am glad you have doubled it, Senator Patterson.

I am sympathetic to that. And herein lies the answer in my view. If we do not have divisions after 4.30, I cannot see any reason why general business—which currently runs between approximately 4.30 and 6 or earlier if we get to it—cannot run through to eight o'clock. This would allow the Labor Party to give up its almost monopoly on general business. I think the Democrats get a run once a year. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator Murray</name></talker><para>—Once or twice a year.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>—Same with the Greens—maybe once a year. It is very hard for us to go back to the other issue and say that, instead of considering this matter formally, you should put it to general business, because if there is no time in general business they are left in a catch-22 position. There is absolutely no reason in these circumstances, with no quorums after 4.30, that we could not run general business through to eight o'clock, then have documents, then have committee reports and then have the adjournment. Then you would be able to sit down and negotiate and say: `I'm sorry, Democrats, but the Labor Party want first crack at this. We want from four o'clock to six o'clock to discuss it. But, by the way, after six o'clock your motion comes up.' Ironically, even though we have not got to a determination position, the no-quorum, no-division rule at 4.30 may in fact greatly increase general business. I am certainly going to raise that proposal—I think I discussed it with Senator Allison informally once—at the next Procedure Committee meeting because I do believe we do not devote enough time to general business matters. </para></talk.start></continue><para>There is no question that the five people standing in their place rule slightly affects minority parties. The reason is that it was intended to—let us be honest—because we believe they are exploiting standing orders. It is not a massive hurdle to jump, and I hope people take a responsible attitude to it. It will mean that far more formal motions will be challenged and declared not formal, once this temporary standing order comes in. By having this rule as a sessional order, if something goes disastrously wrong with it, at least we can dump it.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Chapman, Grant (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Chapman)</inline>—The question is that paragraph (1) be agreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Question agreed to.</para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—The question is that paragraph 2(a) be agreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Question agreed to.</para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator Allison</name></talker><para>—Mr Acting Deputy President, I ask that the Senate record our no votes for that vote and the following one.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—That will be recorded.

However, I did come across some of these issues when we were addressing the medical indemnity issue. The senator has referred to two scenarios that he is particularly concerned about. The first scenario was that of a 12-year-old boy who was injured in a surgical procedure. I am advised this type of situation will already be covered by the bill we are debating today. Any period during which there is no guardian or capable parent to bring an action will be disregarded for the purpose of calculating the date of discoverability or long-stop periods. As an additional protection for a period when there is a capable parent or guardian, the date of discoverability will only be determined on the basis of facts that a capable parent or guardian knows or ought to know. If it could not be reasonably determined that an injury had occurred, an element of discoverability would not be met and time for commencing an action would not run.</para></talk.start><para>The second scenario that Senator Harradine has raised was that of a one-month-old child injured in hospital due to negligence. Similar protections, I am advised, would operate for determining the date of discoverability in this situation as I have just outlined. In addition, similar protections would also operate to cover personal injuries and personal injury claims by incapacitated persons during any period without a guardian, assuming of course that the requirements for TPA liability could be met. There are adequate protections in place for each of these groups, assuming they can establish the additional requirements for TPA liability. I will now leave the expert to take over.

There was so much pork in it that I feel absolutely full up, and it is very difficult to speak when you are full. There are not many things that surprise me as much as that budget did. I am going to focus on an area where I perhaps have more expertise than I have in some of the other areas that were covered. The area I want to discuss first is the tax cut area. It was obvious from last year's discourse by the Leader of the Opposition, who was then shadow Treasurer, by the Prime Minister and by the Treasurer that big tax cuts were inevitable. It was the Australian Democrats' view that the way to approach tax cuts was to lower the rate and broaden the base. I heard discussion today about lowering the rates for higher and middle income earners, but those higher and middle income earners who benefit from a lower rate for themselves did not have that paid for by broadening the base. The Democrats believe that to address issues of equity in tax you need to begin with low income earners. On that basis we have been arguing for a significant increase in the tax free threshold rate from its present level of over $6,000 to somewhere up to $10,000. I remind the chamber that it would have cost around $18 billion to raise the tax free threshold to $20,000. </para></talk.start></continue><para>However, the government has not gone that route. So we are faced with a circumstance where the government is going to bring to the Senate a tax cut regime that will need Senate approval. There are only two parties which can make that happen. The Greens will have a lot to say but will have absolutely no effect. I would remind the media that, until 1 July 2005 and even then depending on the outcome of the election this year, the Greens will continue to have no effect on deliberations of this kind. If you look at the Greens record over the last number of years, you will find that they are best characterised by saying no, but whether they say no or yes has been irrelevant in numerical terms, although not irrelevant in political terms. I acknowledge Senator Brown and Senator Nettle as being extremely capable in political terms but in numerical terms on legislation they will be irrelevant not only for this budget but for the next budget. So it is left to Labor and us. If Labor agree with the government's tax cuts recommendation, through it will go. If Labor disagree, it will be up to us, and I can assure the government that we will want more attention paid to low-income earners. It is not that we do not recognise the virtue of assisting middle-income earners, but we think low-income earners have the priority.</para><para>In turning to issues of tax and spend, the Democrats believe that the priority for expenditure is on those issues which consumers and voters feel very strongly about, namely health and education. I would note that the budget speech did address new expenditure in both those areas, some of which looked pretty attractive. But the issue for us has always been how we would pay for them. The Democrats have been at pains over many years to be very precise about our ability to pay for matters that are important to the community's needs, and we have not been afraid to put our money where our mouth is. It was the Democrats, with the coalition, who provided what is now nearly $30 billion worth of revenue through the GST. That was opposed, as you would recall, by both the Labor Party and the Greens, yet both parties—like us—demand extra expenditure in health and education. I am absolutely certain that there is no possibility whatsoever that Labor will ever walk away from the GST because of the certain income stream which has been guaranteed for essential expenditure in the states. The Greens, however, have a policy of abolishing the GST.</para><para>All these thoughts were brought to my mind by one of those powder puff interviews which it seems Senator Brown often receives these days. In this case it was the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Sunrise</inline> interview on Channel 7 by its chief political correspondent, Mark Riley. I know there is no-one in this chamber more capable of combating tough questioning and being able to handle himself—Senator Brown is no baby—but this powder puff interview was quite extraordinary because not only did they fail to elicit the fact that Senator Brown and Senator Nettle cannot influence any of the legislative outcomes which will emerge from the budget but they failed to ask the most basic of questions. Senator Brown, quite rightly, pushed hard for greater expenditure on health, education and other areas. The next question that should have been asked—and was not—was: `How are you going to pay for that?'</para><para>There are ways of paying for that. One of the ways the Greens do intend to pay for it is by increasing taxes quite considerably. They opposed the reduction in corporate taxes which Labor and the Democrats supported. Those reductions were accompanied by broadening the base and, as a result, the increase in corporate taxation since that date has been quite extravagant. It has been very, very significant. I do not think the Greens at that time understood that that would be the consequence, and I do not think they understand that if they abolish the GST, as they choose to do, they are going to have to raise direct taxes by the $30 billion that they would so save. So I would expect an interviewer like Mark Riley, who is not inexperienced, to ask a few tough questions like: `You want to do this, that and the other. How are you going to pay for it? What are you going to do? What are your views on taxation? And do you have or are you likely to have the numbers to deliver those outcomes?' I am sure, knowing Senator Brown and his abilities, he would have had an answer for those questions, but those questions were not asked. </para><para>That means that the Democrats and Labor will be left with the choice of determining the Senate view not only for this budget but for the 2005 budget, and on this budget hangs a great deal because it is a huge budget and a very significant expenditure leap for the government. I look forward hopefully to the challenge of negotiating with the Treasurer on these matters—that is, if Labor opens the door and gives us the opportunity to do so.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Anzac Day: Gallipoli</title><page.no>22819</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>22819</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tonight I rise to make some remarks regarding the Anzac Day ceremonies in Gallipoli this year, which I was very privileged to attend. I note that my colleague Senator Bishop, who is here in the chamber, was there representing the opposition in his capacity as shadow minister for veterans' affairs. It is truly a ceremony that each year many Australians find moving and memorable, and I certainly had that same experience.</para></talk.start><para>Despite the official warnings in the travel advisories from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, it was estimated that some 12,000 to 15,000 people, mostly Australians, attended the ceremonies. That is particularly significant, given the increased security requirements that were in place at Gallipoli and of course throughout the world. Indeed, it appears that the travel advisories warning Australians not to undertake unnecessary travel to Turkey had, if anything, the opposite effect, as this was one of the largest crowds ever in attendance at Anzac Cove. On 25 April, Anzac Day, four ceremonies are held. The first of course is the dawn service at Anzac Cove. It was a bitterly cold night, it was windy and there had been rain. But that did not prevent the many thousands of Australians—many of them young people, but I also met some elderly Australians—from braving the elements that night and the following morning to attend. Indeed, it has become synonymous with the ceremonies at Anzac Cove on Anzac Day that many people camp at the site overnight. It was a serene site indeed to see the candles and the torchlights flickering amongst the hills as we waited for dawn to break. </para><para>Anzac Cove and the Gallipoli peninsula itself are largely untouched, except for the memorials and the graves of so many known and so many more unknown soldiers who died on both sides of the conflict in 1915. The weather, the distances that people had to travel and the terrain, as I said, did not deter those from attending the ceremonies. You get the clear feeling in this special place that the elements people may have had to endure for a few hours were so insignificant compared to those endured by the original Anzacs, by the allied soldiers and by the Turkish soldiers defending their country in 1915.</para><para>It may sound trite or maudlin, but you certainly feel that you are standing on sacred ground. Because of the increased security arrangements this year, many of those attending—unlike those of us in the official party who had the privilege of being able to access the site in a much easier way by car, boat or coach—had to walk kilometre after kilometre, firstly to the Anzac Cove service itself and then to each of the ceremonies that took place at different locations. I understand that people walked between 15 and 20 kilometres throughout the day to attend each ceremony.  </para><para>The next ceremony of course is the special one held at Lone Pine, which is significant for Australia. That morning I heard one of the best speeches I have ever heard at an Anzac Day service, or indeed at any other commemorative service, given by Ambassador Jonathan Philp. It was inspirational and it captured perfectly the atmosphere of remembrance and celebration. I quote some words from Ambassador Jonathan Philp's speech. He commenced by saying:</para><quote><para>More than 2000 years ago, and not far from here, Pericles said of his nation's dead: “Monuments may rise and tablets be set up to them in their own land, but on far-off shores there is an abiding memorial that no pen or chisel has traced; it is graven not on stone or brass, but on the living hearts of humanity. Take these men for your example”.</para></quote><para>Ambassador Philp went on to speak about the development of a generosity of spirit between the Australians, other allied soldiers and the Turkish soldiers that occurred in the tragic battle. He said:</para><quote><para>It is the Turkish spirit of generosity and reconciliation that has led to the creation of this Gallipoli National Peace Park, and I wish particularly to thank you for the hospitality you show us all during these days of commemoration each year; and for the security you have provided in these difficult times to ensure our services are conducted peacefully.</para><para>In 1991, the last surviving Anzacs were asked how their opinions of the Turks had changed at Gallipoli. Most had no opinion before they came. One man, Albert Kyle, who was stationed here at Lone Pine, said he had heard the Turks were barbarians who took great delight in slaughtering. But once at Gallipoli, he found, in his words, that they were “brave, enterprising and humorous”. Others called them “clean fighters”, “valiant, honest soldiers”, men who “fought tenaciously, fairly and were to be treated with respect”. The Australians thought the Turks badly fed, but they happily accepted the Turkish cigarettes thrown to them in exchange for food. When they finally departed the Peninsular, some Australians left a meal ready for their enemy. It is strange to us that they should have taken breaks from trying to kill each other to throw notes and presents from trench to trench, but it is a mark of the respect the Anzacs and the Turkish soldiers had for each other.</para></quote><para>In his closing remarks, Ambassador Philp said: </para><quote><para>This place is Turkish today. The Turks fought bitterly in 1915 to keep it theirs, and no Australian will come again to claim the land. Instead we claim their hospitality, which they give generously, and together we remember the terrible experience we shared here, and the spirit, the legend of the Anzacs, and of Ataturk and his men.</para></quote><para>It is important to note that Turkey has renamed the landing beach at North Beach, Gallipoli as Anzac Cove. And it was Mustafa Kemal Ataturk himself who, in 1934, said these now famous and moving words:</para><quote><para>Those heroes that shed their blood and lost their lives ... You are now lying in the soil of a friendly country. Therefore rest in peace. There is no difference between the Johnnies and the Mehmets to us where they lie side by side here in this country of ours ...</para><para>You, the mothers, who sent their sons from far away countries, wipe away your tears; your sons are now lying in our bosom and are in peace. After having lost their lives on this land they have become our sons as well.</para></quote><para>I quote those words particularly because we will all recall that last year there were some very offensive and inaccurate reports in the Australian media about supposed plans by the Turkish authorities to charge admission fees to people attending the services. Those claims were totally wrong, and the people who wrote those articles should be ashamed of themselves. One thing you experience when you attend these ceremonies is the generosity of spirit and the hospitality and respect shown by the Turkish authorities to this special place for Australia and New Zealand. </para><para>I conclude by thanking the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Mrs Danna Vale, and the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Hill, who was in attendance at the ceremonies. I also thank Air Vice-Marshall Gary Beck of the Office of Australian War Graves, the Australian Ambassador to Turkey, Jon Philp, and all those others associated with the services this year. As I said, it was great privilege to attend and a moment I will never forget. I note that next year is the 90th anniversary of the landing of 1915, and that indeed will be a memorable experience for those who attend.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Budget 2004-05</title><page.no>22821</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>22821</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to speak tonight about the situation facing the Senate over the next month or so in particular, and potentially over the next few months, depending on the decisions of the Prime Minister. Unfortunately, it is pretty much totally in the hands and the mind of the Prime Minister as to when he decides to call an election. That is not a situation that the Democrats like. We believe we should have fixed terms. Nonetheless, that is not a situation we have.</para></talk.start><para>The budget tonight has of course increased speculation that arrangements are being made to set things up for an August election. That may be the case and it may not. From the point of view of the Democrats, I assure the public and the Senate that we will continue to do our job regardless and at the pace necessary to ensure that the responsibilities of the Senate are fulfilled—that is, the appropriate and complete scrutiny of all of the budget proposals. It should be emphasised that the budget is simply a range of proposals. It is a bunch of proposed spending measures contained in appropriation bills and other proposed revenue and expenditure measures that will be brought forward later in other pieces of legislation. It is constitutionally appropriate, and indeed important, that the Senate fulfils its function of examining those proposals.</para><para>The Treasurer made a fair bit of note, as Treasurers are wont to do, of the good economic fundamentals underpinning this budget and of the current economic situation of the country. I would have to say that there are some good economic fundamentals underpinning this budget and that good, sound economic management is important. That is why the Democrats have always emphasised the need to be responsible in our balance of power role in the Senate. As part of acknowledging that there are some good, sound economic fundamentals, the Senate should take an appropriate degree of credit for those fundamentals. The government cannot have it both ways: it cannot complain that the Senate stops it from doing its job but when the Senate does pass all those different legislative and expenditure measures and economic levers that enable these conditions to come into place say that it is all the government's doing and that the Senate had nothing to do with it. Of course the Senate has had an essential role, as it should, in ensuring that the overall appropriate balance of economic, social and environmental priorities is as right as is possible.</para><para>So, given that we have held that key balance of power role for many years now, sometimes on our own and sometimes in a shared capacity, the Democrats unashamedly assert some credit for some of the good economic components and underpinnings that this budget outlines. As we never tire of saying, there is a lot more to good governance than a nice set of statistics. The fact is that the strong call from a large proportion of the community for significant resourcing and investment in services for the entire community has been pretty much totally ignored by this government, and that is a grave disappointment. In a range of areas the Democrats outlined and costed responsible measures as proposals that could be put forward by this government to invest public money back into the overall public good. The ongoing gaps in Medicare, the continual problem of affordable housing, the problem of inadequacies in education, university costs, ongoing support for training and the lack of investment in the environment have all been pretty much ignored in this budget, and that is a grave disappointment and a major failing. Indeed, for a government that started out eight years ago talking about budget honesty, the degree of dishonesty and doublespeak contained in all the budget materials seem to get worse every year. </para><para>The budget for the environment is a classic case: there is virtually no significant new money, and any significant extra amounts are three or four years into the future. Most of the other amounts are, to use that quaint phrase, `reprioritised money', which is a nice phrase for stripping money from one program and putting it into something else—rebadging it and making it sound as though you have a great new spending measure. This environment budget is littered with those. We have something that at first glance looks good in terms of extra resources for the Great Barrier Reef. I know that that is an area dear to your heart, Madam Acting Deputy President McLucas, and it is also an area that the Democrats have campaigned on long and hard. We have given the government credit for expanding the number of protected areas—as I am sure Senator Ian Macdonald would acknowledge, also coming from that part of Queensland. But we also called for extra resources to ensure that those extra protected areas were properly managed.</para><para>Some of that extra money will be provided to the marine park authority, and that is welcome, but what we find it is that that money has been taken out of the existing funding for the Natural Heritage Trust. We also find that the only new money has been provided to be paid to commercial fishers to restructure them and compensate them for their inability to fish in those areas. It is appropriate that they get money, but that money comes from the environment budget; it does not come from the forestry and fisheries budget. There is extraordinary deceit and false labelling throughout this budget. I am sure that we will find more over the coming month or so as the Senate does its job of scrutinising it.</para><para>As I have emphasised, the Senate and the Democrats unashamedly take some of the credit for the positive economic position that this country is in. That is because of the responsible role that we and the Senate have played, and we will continue that approach. We will take a responsible, constructive approach and do our job. Our job means scrutinising the expenditure, as we do and as the Labor Party does. It also means examining the proposals, and that includes the proposed income tax cuts. Doing our job means not supporting unfair measures—measures that will increase the gap between rich and poor. I find it extraordinary that everybody earning less than $52,000 a year will get nothing in terms of income tax relief. Instead, those people will get family assistance. The family assistance changes are positive overall, but they still fall short of the fundamental of putting in place a workplace entitlement of paid maternity leave. It astonishes me that this government continues to avoid that fundamental. </para><para>The Democrats will expand further and respond more fully at the usual time—on Thursday evening—with our more comprehensive budget reply. But, given the prospect of the Prime Minister putting an early election in front of the Senate—trying to bully and rush us into passing these measures so he can give out his big handouts to people in the lead-up to the election—I simply say that, while we will not hold things up, we are certainly not going to be rushed in doing our job. We are not going to rush through measures to meet the Prime Minister's electoral timetable or fit in with what suits his electoral needs in terms of doling out the cash grants leading up to an election. We will do it at the appropriate pace to ensure proper scrutiny.</para><para>There is all this talk about tax relief for middle- and high-income earners. We have not said that we will be obstructionist and oppose all income tax changes. We have acknowledged that income tax relief for middle Australia, middle-income workers and lower income people is welcome and desirable. But we need to look at what a middle-income earner actually is. The change that the Prime Minister wants to bring in from 1 July relates to people who earn more than $70,000. According to statistics from August 2002, only 20 per cent of people earn $1,000 a week through employment income. So only 20 per cent of people actually earn over $50,000-odd a year—or perhaps $55,000 a year, to adjust a bit since those statistics came out. A lot of people below that income are missing out. Also, let us not forget single-income people without children, who will not even get the benefits of the extra family payments. There are a lot of gaps here for lower income people. That is what we will focus on before we determine the most responsible approach for the Senate to take in response to some of the key measures in this budget.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 8.35 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>22823</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title> Health: Parkinson's Disease</title><page.no>22823</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>22823</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have further information in answer to a question asked by Senator Allison on 29 March 2004 concerning Parkinson's Disease.

I seek leave to incorporate the answer in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The answer read as follows—</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">SENATOR ALLISON</inline>—My question is directed to Senator Campbell, representing the Minister for Health and Ageing.</para><para>Can the Minister explain' why consumers were not told that some batches of the prescription drug, Codalgin Forte, lacked its most important ingredient Codeine, despite the fact that a recall of 240,000 packages was ordered? Is the Minister aware that pharmacists say that patients who do not know about this problem may be upping their dose to get the pain relief that they need and that this has the potential to cause liver damage? Is the Minister aware that pharmacists are also concerned that these patients may be in great danger of overdose and breathing difficulties if they now take Codalgin Forte with codeine? Why has the TGA failed to provide consumers with potentially life saving information?</para><para>Given the massive recall undertaken with Pan Pharmaceuticals where, in fact, no contamination or danger in natural supplement tablets or capsules was ever detected, can the Minister assure us that the lack of public recall here—when we know there was, in fact, a real danger and a real safety and quality issue—is not due to the fact that Sigma is a business at the big end of town?</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">SENATOR IAN CAMPBELL</inline>—The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para><para>Sigma Pharmaceuticals initiated a retail-level recall of the medicine Codalgin Forte (containing paracetamol and codeine phosphate), which is used as an analgesic, because of problems associated with the manufacture of the medicine.</para><para>It was discovered that a small percentage (&lt;1%) of Codalgin Forte tablets were erroneously substituted with tablets containing only paracetamol as the active ingredient.</para><para>There were no safety issues leading to this recall. There could have been issues around pain management for some patients. It is true that the addition of codeine does improve pain control for most patients, above that expected from paracetamol alone. All doctors and pharmacists were informed of the nature of the recall by Sigma, so they could take this into account in pain management decisions for patients presenting with residual pain. Codalgin Forte is a prescription medicine, so most patients would go back to their doctor or pharmacist if they were experiencing problems.</para><para>A consumer level recall was not initiated because there was no risk of injury from the lack of codeine, and, as a prescription medicine, patients on Codalgin Forte would be under supervision of health professionals. Given the small extent of substitution a large number of patients could have been unnecessarily inconvenienced by a consumer level recall. </para><para>Unlike the circumstances surrounding the recent recall of products manufactured by Pan Pharmaceuticals, this recall was initiated by Sigma. There is no evidence of fraudulent behaviour on behalf of the company, and Sigma have been open and honest about the circumstances surrounding the recall of the medicine.</para><para>The recall arose when a pharmacist advised Sigma on 23 February that a consumer had found a paracetamol tablet in their pack of Codalgin Forte. Sigma advised the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) on the same day and voluntarily ceased operations at its Croydon Mount Dandenong Road site immediately.</para><para>Sigma worked over the next few days with the TGA, to investigate the cause of the problem and to identify whether there was a need for any recall action. It was found that this was an isolated incident, where 13 000 paracetamol tablets were mixed with 1.4 million Codalgin Forte tablets.</para><para>Both Sigma and the TGA agreed that the plant affected would not reopen until both were satisfied that all issues had been addressed. Sigma had also agreed with TGA that it would not ship any stock from its Croydon site until the matter was resolved. The issue is now resolved, with action undertaken to prevent recurrence, and manufacturing has recommenced.</para><para>This is how it should work when companies are acting responsibly. Problems that may arise are identified early, remedial action is taken, and steps are put into place to prevent recurrence. The contrast with Pan Pharmaceuticals couldn't be greater.</para><para>Senator Allison's question suggests there was no danger posed by the Pan Pharmaceuticals' products. Clearly there is danger when:</para><para>	The endemic bad practices of the manufacturing company, Pan Pharmaceuticals, included:</para><para>-	substitution of ingredients</para><para>-	falsification of records to say products contained ingredients in the specified amounts when they did not</para><para>-	no testing of the quality and quantities of ingredients before manufacture and records fraudulently produced to say final product testing bad been undertaken</para><para>-	no cleaning of machines between batch runs, which produced the possibility of the contamination of some low-risk products with prescription medicine ingredients and even veterinary medicines.</para><para>	An example of a dangerous outcome from these practices is where Pan products, claiming to have the necessary amount of folate in them to prevent neural tube defects if taken by women before and immediately after pregnancy, do not contain the required `levels of folate.</para><para>	The expert advisory group, comprised of five Professors plus the Chair of the Medicines Evaluation Committee, all expert and eminent in their field, stated `that the multiple failures of GMP identified in the auditors' report, in the opinion of the Expert Advisory Group, create risks of death, serious illness, and serious injury ... and that the risk will increase over time and that the risk could be realised at any time'.</para><para>The risks posed by the Pan products was best summed up by The Business Review Weekly article of 4-10 October 2004 with its story of the Clover Corporation clinical trial, which was testing whether increasing doses of omega 3 fatty acids in pregnancy reduced the likelihood or symptoms of post-natal depression. The sunflower oil capsules were to be given to the placebo group. To make the capsules, Pan used tuna oil that Clover had delivered to it in August 2002. The sunflower oil was from Pan's own stock. But when the university took delivery of the capsules, the contents of the sunflower and tuna oil capsules were rancid. In addition—unknown to Clover—in the process of making the capsules, the tuna oil had been diluted with sunflower oil. Clover had to recall the capsules.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>22825</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>22825</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The

These arrangements constitute core and ongoing business for the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (the Department).</para><para>Various areas of the Department, most notably Product Integrity Animal and Plant Health (PIAPH), the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) and Biosecurity Australia, are in regular contact with a wide range of parties on matters relating to animal health. Domestically, the Department liaises with State and Territory agencies, rural groups and veterinary practitioners and, internationally, with overseas authorities and trading partners and international animal health organisations. The frequency and breadth of this contact makes it impracticable to fully list the interactions between the Department and animal health stakeholders.</para><para>Consultative arrangements for the management of animal disease outbreaks have been established since the early 1940s. Pivotal to these arrangements is the peak national technical and scientific advisory group the Consultative Committee on Emergency Animal Diseases (CCEAD). This committee is chaired by the Australian Chief Veterinary Officer, Dr Gardner Murray and comprises all State and Territory Chief Veterinary Officers, a representative of the Australian Animal Health Laboratory, a representative of the Animal Biosecurity and representatives of affected livestock industries.</para><para>As of 16 March 2004, CCEAD has met on 63 occasions since January 2000 and has dealt with a wide range of prevention, preparedness and response issues. These include the development of risk containment measures for events such as the Sydney Olympics and the international spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, foot and mouth disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza as well as emergency responses, such as the recent porcine myocarditis outbreak and full-scale responses to Newcastle disease and anthrax outbreaks. </para><para>In 2002, the Commonwealth, States and Territories and 11 livestock industries signed an agreement that further enhanced Australia's emergency response arrangements. This agreement formalised cost sharing arrangements for disease outbreaks and the emergency response consultative infrastructure. It established a new senior managerial committee, the National Emergency Animal Disease Management Group (NMG), which is designed to make decisions on response strategies, including the commitment of resources. The NMG is chaired by the Secretary of the Department, Mr Michael Taylor and consists of the chief executive officers of all State and Territory agricultural agencies and the peak councils of national livestock industries. As of 16 March 2004, NMG has met on 11 occasions where disease outbreaks invoked the NMG Cost Sharing Agreement as outlined in AUSVET PLAN since its inception. In addition NMG has come together informally 15 times as a consultative body to discuss animal health issues where a formal decision on cost sharing arrangements for disease eradication was not called for.  </para><para>The agreement also formalised the involvement of industry technical representatives in CCEAD meetings. These representatives are usually private veterinary practitioners, nominated by industry groups, who have been trained in CCEAD operating arrangements.</para><para>Consultation mechanisms are also in place for aquatic animal disease emergencies. As of 16 March 2004, there have been nine CCEAD meetings involving aquatic animal disease issues.

However, even if there were evidence of damage in animals, it is well recognised that extrapolation of these findings to human patients is very difficult. The work at CSIRO was simply a small contribution to the international community's body of evidence used to set standards for diagnostic ultrasound power levels.

The system comprises a number of components, is flexible and can be adapted to both therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Research within CSIRO Telecommunications and Industrial Physics (of which the National Measurement Laboratory is a part) on both therapeutic and diagnostic ultrasound has terminated, but the characterisation system is to be maintained and possibly developed further at some future time as part of a more general `metrology in medicine' program within the new National Measurement Institute.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry: Committee Vacancies</title><page.no>22847</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2121)</subtitle><id.no>2121</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>22847</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, upon notice, on 18 September 2003:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	When in 2003 did the department seek applications for eight part-time vacancies.</para><para>(2)	In what newspapers and other media did the department place advertisements seeking applications.</para><para>(3)	How many applications did the department receive from applicants nominating qualifications in respect of the following positions designated in section 64 of the Plant Breeders' Rights Act 1994: (a) representatives of breeders, and likely breeders' of new plant varieties; (b) a representative of users, and likely users, of new plant varieties; (c) a representative of consumers, and likely consumers, of new plant varieties or of the products of new plant varieties; (d) a representative of conservation interests in relation to new plant varieties and the potential impacts of new plant varieties; (e) a representative of indigenous Australian interests in relation to new plant varieties and the source, use and impacts of new plant varieties; and (f) others with appropriate experience or qualifications.</para><para>(4)	How many people did the department interview in relation to each designated position.</para><para>(5)	Can details be provided of each industry, consumer, conservation, indigenous and/or other organisation consulted prior to the appointment of the current committee members.</para><para>(6)	When did the Minister appoint the current members.</para><para>(7)	(a) What is the name and business address of each member; (b) what interests do they represent pursuant to section 64 of the Plant Breeders' Rights Act 1994.</para><para>(8)	Which organisations provided letters of support for each member.</para><para>(9)	Since its appointment, when has the current committee met.</para><para>(10)	What are the names and terms of appointment for all members of the committee since its formation in 1994.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>22847</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Applications for eight part-time vacancies were sought from February extending up to the 30 April 2003 deadline. </para><para>(2)	Applications were invited in the media through advertisements in the Australian, the Koori Mail ~ The Voice of Indigenous Australia, Australian Horticulture, the Grains Research and Development Corporation's Groundcover and the department's website.</para><para>(3)	Twenty-five applications were received.</para><para>(a) Ten.</para><para>(b) Four.</para><para>(c) Two.</para><para>(d) Two.</para><para>(e) One.</para><para>(f) Six.</para><para>(4)	None.

Regional NRM plans must be consistent with and contribute to the implementation of agreed national NRM strategies. The Australian Government, together with the relevant state or territory, works with regional bodies to assist them to prepare regional NRM plans that meet both Australian Government and state/territory requirements, including in relation to agreed national strategies. The accreditation criteria for NRM plans specify that the plans must demonstrate consistency with agreed national strategies. In relation to the National Water Quality Management Strategy, regional NRM plans must comply with the policy objective of the Strategy, which is: `to achieve sustainable use of the nation's water resources by protecting and enhancing their quality while maintaining economic and social development' [ANZECC and ARMCANZ 1994:6]. Similarly, regional plans are assessed against the goal of National Principles for the Provision of Water for Ecosystems: `to sustain and where necessary restore ecological processes and biodiversity of water dependent ecosystems' [SLWRMC (SWR) 1997:iii and 6]. In relation to the National Framework for the Management and Monitoring of Australia's Native Vegetation, regional NRM plans must be consistent with the national goal of reversing the decline in the extent and quality of native vegetation.</para><para>(3)	In considering an investment plan for a particular region, the Australian Government will make an assessment as to the balance of investments, including the areas for which the Australian Government has responsibility. In making its funding decisions, the Australian Government will have regard to both Australian and State Government priorities as well as regional priorities. Government investment in accredited NRM plans will be consistent with the goals and objectives of the relevant program:</para><para>	-	investment under the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality will focus on action to prevent, stabilise and reverse trends in salinity and to improve water quality and reliability that affects sustainable production, biodiversity and infrastructure;</para><para>	-	investment under the Natural Heritage Trust will focus on actions which are consistent with the Trust's objectives relating to biodiversity conservation, sustainable natural resource use, and capacity building and institutional change.</para><para>(4)	(a)	Yes.</para><para>	(b)	Some States and Territories are slow in implementing strategies consistent with the national goal of the National Framework for the Management and Monitoring of Australia's Native Vegetation to reverse the decline in the extent and quality of native vegetation by 2001. To accelerate progress, the Australian Government is negotiating reforms with States and Territories to reduce land clearing. The National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality has secured commitments from governments to institute controls on land clearing, which at a minimum prohibit land clearing in the priority catchments and regions where it would lead to unacceptable land or water degradation. Through the extension of the Natural Heritage Trust all governments have agreed to implement measures to prevent all clearing of endangered and vulnerable vegetation communities and critical habitat for threatened species, and limit broadscale clearing to those instances where regional biodiversity objectives are not compromised. In each jurisdiction, the Australian Government has negotiated specific actions to implement these commitments.</para><para>In New South Wales, the Australian and New South Wales Governments recently announced plans to end broad-scale land clearing. The Australian Government is contributing $45 million through the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality and the Natural Heritage Trust to implement these vegetation management reforms. </para><para>80 per cent of land clearing in Australia occurs in Queensland. To address this threat, the Queensland Government has committed to phase-out broad-scale land clearing by December 2006. </para><para>As part of the National Competition Policy, the National Competition Council (NCC) assesses the States and Territories progress with implementation of the 1994 COAG Water Reform Framework, including the implementation of the National Water Quality Management Strategy and compliance with the National Principles for the Provision of Water for Ecosystems. </para><para>NCC annual assessments are guided by an assessment framework, which varies from year to year focusing on particular commitments made under the Water Reform Framework and outstanding issues from previous assessments. The last full assessment of the water reforms was in 2001 and the next one will be in 2005.</para><para>Currently the NCC is reviewing progress against the 2003 assessment framework (details at www.ncc.gov.au). National Competition Policy tranche payments to the States and Territories are dependent on a favourable review by the NCC.</para><para>(5)	The regional delivery model requires regional communities to develop regional NRM plans that cover the full range of NRM issues - across terrestrial, freshwater, coastal, estuarine and marine ecosystems where relevant. In relevant regions, water quality in, and environmental flows to, coastal Ramsar wetlands, will be addressed in the regional NRM plan and will be prioritised for funding through the regional investment strategy. </para><para>(6)	(a)	Matters of national environmental significance (as listed in Part 3, Division 1 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999) were considered in establishing the goals and objectives of the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality and the Natural Heritage Trust. The Australian Government and the relevant State /Territory governments are responsible for accrediting NRM plans, on the basis of the accreditation criteria agreed by the NRM Ministerial Council. The criteria include issues for which the Australian Government has responsibility such as the matters of national environmental significance. An Australian Government priority when determining its investment in implementing an accredited NRM plan will be to give effect to these Australian Government responsibilities. </para><para>	(b)	Funding for priority projects may be provided prior to the accreditation of a regional NRM plan, where the agreed framework for an integrated catchment / regional NRM plan exists. In this instance, the Australian Government and the relevant State/ Territory government jointly agree on actions that are a priority from a national or regional perspective. </para><para>(7)	Regional NRM plans are assessed against a set of accreditation criteria endorsed by the Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council in May 2002. When these criteria are met the plan will be accredited. In summary, the accreditation criteria require regional bodies to demonstrate that their plans:</para><para>	cover the full range of natural resource management (NRM) issues;</para><para>	are underpinned by scientific analysis of natural resource conditions, problems and priorities;</para><para>	have effective involvement of all key stakeholders in plan development and implementation;</para><para>	focus on addressing the underlying causes rather than symptoms of problems;</para><para>	include strategies to implement agreed NRM policies to protect the natural resource base;</para><para>	demonstrate consistency with other planning processes and legislative requirements applicable to the region;</para><para>	set targets at the regional scale, consistent with the National Framework for NRM Standards and Targets; </para><para>	identify strategic, prioritised and achievable actions to address the range of NRM issues and achieve the regional targets: this includes an evaluation of the wider social, economic and environmental impacts of such actions, and of any actions needed to address such impacts; and</para><para>	provide for continuous development, monitoring, review and improvement of the plan.</para><para>(8)	In considering an investment plan for a particular region, the Australian Government will make an assessment as to the balance of investments, including the areas for which the Australian Government has responsibility. In making its funding decisions, the Australian Government will have regard for both Australian and State Government priorities as well as regional priorities. Government investment in accredited NRM plans will be consistent with the goals and objectives of the relevant program:</para><para>	-	investment under the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality will focus on action to prevent, stabilise and reverse trends in salinity and to improve water quality and reliability that affects sustainable production, biodiversity and infrastructure;</para><para>	-	investment under the Natural Heritage Trust will focus on actions which are consistent with the Trust's objectives relating to biodiversity conservation, sustainable natural resource use, and capacity building and institutional change.</para><para>Matters of national environmental significance were considered in establishing the 10 priority areas under the Natural Heritage Trust and the objectives of the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality. </para><para>(9)	Approximately $54 million has been spent to date under the second phase of the Natural Heritage Trust on priority projects.</para><para>(10)	Priority projects are undertaken to address natural resource management issues prior to the completion and accreditation of regional plans. Consequently, it is not expected that resource condition targets would have been set before priority projects are funded. However, as resource condition targets will be set during the development of regional plans, it is expected that priority projects would contribute to matters for which a target would be set during the planning process, and therefore in the longer term, will contribute to meeting resource condition targets. </para><para>(11)	Projects funded under the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality and the Natural Heritage Trust are intended to achieve outcomes consistent with the goals and objectives of the relevant program. These projects include activities such as planning, implementation, monitoring and reporting. However the expenditure on these activities is not specifically reported across projects at a whole of National Action Plan or Trust level.</para><para>(12)	See 11.</para><para>(13)	Compliance with the terms and conditions of the Bilateral Agreements is monitored on an annual basis as part of the annual reporting process. </para><para>(14)	The Government has not identified any major breaches of the conditions of the Trust and National Action Plan bilateral agreements. However, in some instances timetables for the completion of activities, such as planning processes and development of strategies, have not been met. In all of these cases the Australian Government is working with States and Territories through relevant Joint Steering Committees to address these issues and complete the agreed activities.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Natural Heritage Trust </title><page.no>22852</page.no><subtitle><inline font-weight="bold">(Question No. 2317)</inline></subtitle><id.no>2317</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>22853</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator Bartlett</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 22 October 2003: </para></talk.start><para>(1)	With reference to the second phase of the Natural Heritage Trust (NHT): How much money has been spent: </para><para>(a)	on the National Vegetation Initiative;</para><para>(b)	on the Murray- Darling 2001 Program;</para><para>(c)	on the Coast and Clean Seas Initiative;</para><para>(d)	on the National Land and Water Resources Audit;</para><para>(e)	on the National Reserve System;</para><para>(f)	on `environment protection' (as defined under section 15 of the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Act 1997 (NHTA Act);</para><para>(g)	on supporting `sustainable agriculture' (as defined under section 16 of the NHTA Act);</para><para>(h)	on `natural resource management' (as defined under section 17 of the NHTA Act);</para><para>(i)	on purposes that are incidental or ancillary to any of the purposes outlined in subsections 8(a) to (h) of the NHTA Act;</para><para>(j)	for the purpose of making grants of financial assistance for any of the purposes outlined in subsection 8(a) to (h) of the NHTA Act;</para><para>(k)	for accounting transfer purposes (as defined in section 18 of the NHTA Act).</para><para>(2)	How much money in the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Reserve that represents proceeds of the sale of shares in Telstra has been debited for the purposes of: (a) the National Vegetation Initiative;

The following 10 areas of activity define the scope of Trust investment:</para><para>i.	protecting and restoring the habitat of threatened species, threatened ecological communities and migratory birds;</para><para>ii.	reversing the long-term decline in the extent and quality of Australia's native vegetation;</para><para>iii.	protecting and restoring significant freshwater, marine and estuarine ecosystems;</para><para>iv.	preventing or controlling the introduction and spread of feral animals, aquatic pests, weeds and other biological threats to biodiversity;</para><para>v.	establishing and effectively managing a comprehensive, adequate and representative system of protected areas; </para><para>vi.	improving the condition of natural resources that underpins the sustainability and productivity of resource based industries;</para><para>vii.	securing access to natural resources for sustainable productive use;</para><para>viii.	encouraging the development of sustainable and profitable management systems for application by land-holders and other natural resource managers and users;</para><para>ix.	providing land-holders, community groups and other natural resource managers with understanding and skills to contribute to biodiversity conservation and sustainable natural resource management; and</para><para>x.	establishing institutional and organisational frameworks that promote conservation and ecologically sustainable use and management of natural resources.</para><para>6.	Natural resource management priorities will vary between regions and between States/Territories, as will the extent to which the areas of activity identified for Trust investment are addressed in regional plans. It is, therefore, not anticipated that each regional NRM plan will necessarily address all of the ten areas of activity. Similarly, equal emphasis may not be applied to all components of a single area of activity within a regional plan.</para><para>7.	Investment under the Trust will be available for salinity and water quality measures across Australia, including in NAP regions. At least $350 million of the Trust funds will be invested directly on measures to improve water quality.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Levels of investment</inline></para><para>8.	Investment under the Trust will occur at three levels: national/state; regional; and local. Transitional arrangements will be necessary to provide support for ongoing work consistent with expected regional priorities, to build on the outcomes of existing Trust investments, and to maintain momentum and continuity within communities.</para><para>9.	National/State Investments</para><para>Investment at this level will address activities that have a broadscale, rather than a regional or local, outcome. This will include activities at the state-wide level, as well as those that cross over state and regional boundaries. It will also address matters of direct Commonwealth jurisdiction, such as those relating to Commonwealth waters. </para><para>10.	National/State investments can be grouped together into three sets:</para><para>	 Commonwealth activities: giving effect to Federal Government environmental and natural resource responsibilities and priorities, and implemented solely by the Commonwealth or in partnership with other jurisdictions;</para><para>	 Joint Commonwealth and State/Territory activities: including cross-jurisdictional activities, identified and agreed jointly by the Commonwealth and the States/Territories; and</para><para>	 State-wide and within-State activities: identified and agreed to jointly by the Commonwealth and the States/Territories.</para><para>11.	Investment priorities are likely to cover National / State activities such as resource assessment, research, industry strategies, innovative approaches to managing NRM issues such as weeds, marine species and protected areas, reserve acquisitions, training and information, and national coordination/facilitation.</para><para>12.	While at the National / State level the four programs will form four discrete funding sources, complementary outcomes will be pursued. Investment priorities will be funded from one or more of the four programs depending on the nature of the activity in question.</para><para>13.	Regional investments </para><para>This will be the principal delivery mechanism for the Trust and will follow, as far as practical, the model developed for the NAP. Under this model, investment is made on the basis of an accredited, integrated NRM plan and investment strategy/proposal developed by the region.</para><para>14.	Plans which seek accreditation for Trust investment will identify all of the NRM issues in a region (based on the best available scientific and technical information), develop actions to address these issues and then prioritise the most important issues for action. They will also set resource condition and management action targets based on agreed national standards. </para><para>15.	The requirement that plans be based on rigorous scientific and technical information, and that they set achievable natural resource condition targets, will require the Trust to invest in research. As many plans will be based on existing regional and catchment plans, the nature and subject of the research for which funding may be provided will need to be carefully targeted and determined on a case by case basis.</para><para>16.	Investment proposals for Trust funding submitted to the Commonwealth and relevant State/Territory after plan accreditation must demonstrate how the actions for which funding is sought meet the areas of activity for investment established for the Trust. </para><para>17.	In the NAP priority regions the delivery of Trust and NAP funding will be integrated, subject to the requirements necessary to meet separate auditing and evaluation requirements for the two programs.</para><para>18.	A process is currently under way to review the accreditation criteria developed by the NAP to ensure that plans accredited under the criteria can be used as a basis for investment under a range of programs including the NAP and the Trust.</para><para>19.	At the regional level the four programs will be integrated and complementary outcomes will be pursued.</para><para>20.	Regional boundaries will be established using the following principles:</para><para>i.	regions will be based on integrated NRM considerations;</para><para>ii	regions reflect, where possible, existing regional arrangements; and</para><para>iii	relevant regions incorporate coasts and adjacent waters.</para><para>A consequence is that the NRM regions used for the Trust will not be inconsistent with the NAP arrangements.</para><para>21.	Where regional arrangements are less well defined, for example in the rangelands, the Commonwealth, rangelands States and the Northern Territory will jointly determine the approach to be taken. Cross border arrangements for any region would need to be developed on a case-by-case basis.</para><para>22.	Rangelands</para><para>Trust investment in the rangelands may occur outside a regional framework, but still within the areas of activity identified for Trust investment.</para><para>Delivery of the Trust in the rangelands will build on existing national, state and regional strategies and initiatives and follow the principles agreed for accreditation and investment in integrated natural resource management strategies.</para><para>Attention will be given to gathering and sharing information to promote cost effectiveness and consistency across jurisdictions. Funding at the regional level will incorporate a flexible approach to accommodate the particular characteristics and needs of the rangelands.</para><para>This flexibility will be agreed bilaterally and consider issues such as sparse populations, indigenous communities, organisational structures, priority actions and partnerships. </para><para>23.	Interim Regional Arrangements </para><para>A process for managing the transition to regional implementation is a high priority. Arrangements will need to be flexible to provide a level of certainty and predictability for regions, support for ongoing work consistent with expected regional priorities and to build on the outcomes of existing projects.</para><para>24.	Funds will be available for some activities prior to accredited plans being in place.</para><para>25.	There will be investment against two categories of activities in this interim period:</para><para>	Foundation funding to support the process of developing or refining a regional integrated NRM strategy, including support for the regional organisation to undertake activities such as evaluating existing plans, information gap filling, plan development and community consultation; and</para><para>	Priority funding for regions to continue to address pressing NRM issues through large-scale actions, prior to the accreditation and implementation of a regional NRM plan, as well as technical support and capacity building.</para><para>26.	Continued funding for facilitators and coordinators is needed during the interim period to facilitate community input into the development of regionally strategic NRM plans, assist community groups with Australian Government Envirofund projects and project reporting, assist the community to finalise projects and submit final reports for the first phase of the Trust, provide technical support and community development needs, and support Commonwealth obligations.</para><para>27.	There will only be one interim funding round (2002-03), unless circumstances in some regions justify a second round. Any project extension would be subject to review against progress in completing regional plans and implementing individual projects. Overall investment in interim projects will be small in proportion to investment following the accreditation of regional plans. Interim projects should address the most time critical priority issues in a region, clearly demonstrated through sound scientific and planning processes.</para><para>28.	Approved interim projects will need to demonstrate:</para><para>	contribution to the objectives of the Natural Heritage Trust and consistency with the identified priority areas of activity;</para><para>	that the range of natural resource management issues were adequately considered in putting together the bids;</para><para>	consistency with existing plans;</para><para>	consultation with stakeholders and community support;</para><para>	a need for early commencement (such as the opportunity to avoid more significant impacts, the window of opportunity is small, or the opportunity to link with other activities);</para><para>	support for continuity and momentum in existing community capacity;</para><para>	value for money;</para><para>	approval for the work from the land manager; and</para><para>	receipt of any statutory approvals that may be necessary, and compliance with any relevant legislation.</para><para>29.	The process for managing this funding will involve seeking bids from each region (principally from established regional groups), assessment and prioritisation of bids on a state-wide basis by a panel with a majority community membership and a community chair, and consideration of the recommended bids by the Commonwealth and relevant state and territory as joint investors. Where regional arrangements are less well established, the Commonwealth and States will discuss arrangements further. </para><para>30.	Australian Government Envirofund</para><para>These grants will provide the opportunity for community groups, in particular those that have had little or no previous engagement with the Trust, to build capacity through:</para><para>	gaining experience in addressing NRM issues on a relatively small scale;</para><para>	finding out about the range of approaches to addressing these issues;</para><para>	building networks with others addressing similar issues; and</para><para>	participating in the development and implementation of broader regional approaches to natural resource management.</para><para>31.	The Australian Government Envirofund will assist groups to undertake:</para><para>	small on-ground projects tackling local problems;</para><para>	projects in areas where regional plans are not yet well developed; and</para><para>	important local projects.</para><para>Activities should not be inconsistent with regional plans.</para><para>32.	A process for managing this grants program will be negotiated with those jurisdictions willing to administer the grants on behalf of the Commonwealth.</para><para>33.	While at the Australian Government Envirofund level the four programs will form four discrete funding sources, complementary outcomes will be pursued.</para><para>34.	The Australian Government Envirofund will not be addressed in either State/Commonwealth bilateral agreements or regional agreements.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Funding</inline></para><para>35.	The Trust is only one of a range of potential sources of investment funds for any individual integrated natural resource management plan, and regional communities are expected to seek, as they consider appropriate, investment for different activities and outcomes under their plans from different sources.</para><para>36.	Up to 3-year funding will be provided for funding based on accredited regional plans subject to annual review against milestones.</para><para>37.	In principle and subject to negotiations concerning implementation arrangements and the provision of information on the allocation of funds to regional programs:</para><para>i	States and Territories will match from their budgets the Commonwealth's investment in delivery of the NHT at the regional level;</para><para>ii	Investments at the regional level will be managed under plans jointly accredited by the Commonwealth and the relevant State/Territory;</para><para>iii	Matching funding arrangements will not normally apply to projects the States and Territories have already announced they will proceed with. For new and already announced funding by the States and Territories to be eligible as matching funding it must be:</para><para>a.	directly attributed to the region in question; </para><para>b.	directly relevant to activities in the regional investment strategy being funded; and</para><para>c.	for jointly agreed activities in the region in question.</para><para>Subject to the above, where a state/territory reduces its allocation to a pre-existing/announced State/Territory activity, the Commonwealth will not make up the shortfall.</para><para>iv.	There will be full transparency of the source, quantum and expenditure of all resource contributions under the NHT including for funds that are managed jointly under accredited plans or resources that are matched on an agreed project by project basis; and </para><para>v.	Auditing and reporting arrangements will be agreed between the Commonwealth and each State and Territory to give effect to iii above.</para><para>38.	Matching investment agreed by the States and Territories may include both cash and appropriately costed and audited in kind contributions (except for purchases of land under the National Reserves System where only cash matching will be accepted).</para><para>39.	At the regional level Trust investment will be determined on the basis of each region's investment strategy. The Commonwealth and State/Territory will each contribute 50% of the resources to be allocated. The Commonwealth and State can contribute differentially to jointly agreed activities within the investment strategy, provided their total contributions are equal.</para><para>40.	At the national level, for State-wide and within-State investments within the National/ State investment stream, the Commonwealth and State/Territory will each contribute 50% of the resources required. Contributions for multilateral investments will be as agreed by the parties.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Bilateral and Regional Agreements</inline></para><para>41.	The Trust bilateral agreements will be based primarily on the structure used for the NAP bilateral agreements, and will draw on the existing Trust Partnership Agreements and Memoranda of Understanding.</para><para>42.	The bilateral agreements will establish a framework under which the Parties will work cooperatively for the purposes of section 19 of the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Act 1997.</para><para>43	The bilateral agreements will address institutional change required to underpin Trust delivery. This will include the institutional reforms agreed under the NAP IGA being applied to Trust regions.</para><para>44.	Where coastal areas are included in NRM regions, the NRM plans to be accredited under the extended Trust are to be developed in cooperation with the land managers/agencies that have statutory coastal management responsibilities within each jurisdiction.</para><para>45.	All jurisdictions support the engagement of local government in the delivery of the Trust. To implement regional delivery of Trust investment, agreements will be developed with each agreed local government/regional group describing the management and accountability arrangements. The process for developing the agreements within each State and Territory will be determined through the bilateral agreements.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Monitoring and Evaluation</inline></para><para>46.

If using a multiplier then they need to determine their State multiplier. Such a determination should include discussion with the regions.  The components of the multiplier are the base salary of the project worker on a per year basis, operating costs, direct overheads and indirect overheads. To assist States in determine their multiplier the components and their maximum relative weight is given in the table 1 below. For example the maximum for salary related on-costs is 19%. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Using the Multiplier</inline></para><para>Once each State has determined its multiplier then the gross salary (salary paid before tax but excluding any on-costs) of those involved in directly delivering project outcomes must be calculated for each project. Salaries of managers etc are excluded unless they also directly delivering the project. The method to determine salary is to first determine the salary of the project officer on a per year basis (eg $50,000 per year). Then determine the percentage of time each project officer works on the project.  For example if a person is working 100% on the project with a yearly salary of $50,000, then $50,000 is the figure for salary costs. If a person is working 50% of their time then the salary is $25,000.  For most projects there will be more than one person.  It is the total salary cost that is multiplied by the State multiplier. Thus if the total salary costs equal $200,000 then the project is valued at $500,000.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Assumed Non-Productive Time</inline></para><para>Even if a person works full-time on a project it is understood that the person will not actually work everyday they are paid on the project. The assumed non-productive times are annual leave (20 days per year), public holidays (10 days per year), sick leave (average of 6 days per year) and training and administration (average 10 days per person).  This means that a person working full time on a project actually works 214 days as the average year has 260 paid days and there are 46 days in total that are non-productive.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Capital Rich Projects</inline></para><para>Salary multipliers alone are not appropriate for capital rich projects. Capital rich projects would only involve a small number of projects where there is large capital expenditure (eg buying land, buying pumps to move saline water etc).  In cases where there is a large capital cost and this capital is totally consumed in delivering the project outputs, then an estimate of full costs would include labour costs by agreed multiplier plus agreed total capital costs. It is noted that capital costs such as agency infrastructure (building, cars etc) are excluded as they are not totally consumed by the project service and a depreciation component is included in the multiplier of salaries.

Regrowth will be significantly accelerated by this action, leading to increased habitat and the limiting of erosion on these steep slopes. Existing vegetation will be protected from stock trampling and foraging. The recognised koala corridor will be strengthened. All 750m of the riparian zone will be fenced thereby limiting stock to off stream watering points and improving platypus and other aquatic species habitat. Environmental weeds such as Camphor Laurel will be controlled by use of herbicides to accelerate native vegetation regrowth and vigour of established vegetation.

Particular attention will be given the Little Penguin, the Platypus, and fresh water lobsters, all of which have a special presence on the coast. To be sited on coastal land reclaimed after former use as an industrial complex, the Centre will provide a 'soft' opportunity to display the regions diverse and unique plants and animals. While the centre is intended to deliver a package experience in its own right, it is also proposed to become a learning and participation resource for the local community. It will be staffed to provide interpretation, and to assist field visits to viewing sites on a self-guide or guided basis. Sites of remnant native vegetation within and adjacent to established urban areas of Burnie will be targeted for rehabilitation and re-vegetation.

These objectives are compatible with the target themes and first order objectives for the three catchments involved ie Border Rivers Catchment Management Board, Upper North Coast Catchment Management Board and the Gwydir Catchment Board. The proposed projects aim to start on-ground works to address erosion control which will reduce sedimentation of major waterways; to increase riparian and corridor vegetation which will also improve biodiversity; to minimise roadside erosion entering waterways where there are known platypus pools; and to release dung beetles for improved soil structure and soil fertility. These projects involve a number of Landcare Groups as well as providing for revegetation works for the whole community.

A key focus will be habitat protection for waterbirds, swans and platypus, the establishment of linking corridors and the maintenance of Aboriginal culture. It aims to achieve this by reversing the loss of native vegetation, initially through the eradication of weeds such as prickly and rope pear, blackberries, willows and Osage Orange (which has recently emerged as a major threat). Corridor planting will then help to link native vegetation and enhance the biodiversity and habitat value of remnants surrounding the Lake reserve area.</para><para>State 	NSW</para><para>Proponent	GWYMAC Inc</para><para>Project Title	The Macintyre River Urban Riparian Zone Biodiversity Project</para><para>Approved Funding

Hence, any drop in student numbers between 2000 and 2001 may have been as a result of the definition change.</para><para>Strategies</para><para>	Indigenous education is and continues to be an important focus of the Australian Government. There is a strong recognition of the need for rural and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to undertake health related courses and the need for development of support programs to enable students to receive training and education.</para><para>	Between 1996 and 1998, the Australian Government provided funding to establish six Indigenous Higher Education Centres. Three of these (at the University of South Australia, Curtin University of Technology and the University of Newcastle) included a focus on health issues. A fourth centre, established through a consortium of the University of Queensland and Queensland University of Technology, focused specifically on Indigenous community health. A key objective of this Centre was to provide opportunities for Indigenous students from North Queensland and the Torres Strait Islands to undertake health courses in tertiary education. The total sum spent on the six centres was $11,811,000. </para><para>	From 1998 to 2001, funding of $300,000 from the Higher Education Innovations Programme was provided to the Australian National University for the Masters of Applied Epidemiology (Indigenous Health).  In 2001, funding of $171,153 was also provided to the University of Queensland for the development of a Postgraduate Programme for generic rural health practitioners.</para><para>	Since 2001, there has been an agreement with James Cook University Medical School to reserve five places for Indigenous students to undertake medicine.</para><para>	From the beginning of April 2004, DEST will continue to fund, at a cost of $102,300, a nursing initiative initially established through Enterprise and Career Education Foundation. The purpose of the initiative is to address a number of the issues highlighted in the National Review of Nursing Education, including national nursing shortfalls, by developing strategies to attract and retain young people in the profession. The aim of the project is to establish nursing pathways within VET in Schools programmes, particularly for Indigenous students, thus making a valuable contribution to improving health outcomes in Indigenous communities across Australia. The Nursing Initiative is expected to be completed at the end of November 2004. </para><para>	Under the new Higher Education reforms, fees for nursing will be exempt from any additional increase in an effort to provide more opportunities for students to take up nursing studies. This will be of particular interest to Aboriginal Health Workers wishing to further their careers and move into nursing.</para><para>	Also under the reforms, Commonwealth Learning Scholarships will be available for full-time undergraduate Commonwealth supported students from rural, regional, and Indigenous low socio economic status backgrounds. Indigenous and rural students in health courses will therefore be able to apply for assistance with education ($2,000 pa) and students from rural and regional areas who have left home to study may be eligible for accommodation assistance ($4,000 pa).</para><para>	Institutions receive funding under the Indigenous Support Funding (ISF) and Higher Education Equity Programmes (HEEP).

Therefore they have the major responsibility for ensuring that adequate numbers of these health professionals are recruited and retained over time.</para><para>The Australian Government plays an important role in developing the future health workforce through the provision of funding to universities for undergraduate places for study in all courses, including the health disciplines. Under the higher education reforms announced in Our Universities: Backing Australia's Future, an additional 9,100 Government supported places will be introduced in 2005, rising to 24,883 places as students continue their courses. The Minister for Education, Science and Training and his Department have consulted with the States and Territories on the criteria to be addressed by the universities in making bids for these places. This has provided an avenue for the States to seek additional places for professions like pharmacy.</para><para>Additionally, the Australian Government has developed a range of strategies in response to recommendations concerning shortages in the radiation oncology workforce outlined in The Report of the Radiation Oncology Inquiry. These include funding 114 radiation therapy undergraduate places for the 2002 and 2003 intake years, as well as an additional 30 places for the 2004 intake at Newcastle and the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology universities. This will assist in increasing the number of radiation therapists practising in Australia, including in public hospitals.</para><para>The Australian Government also provides funding through a number of scholarship schemes to assist in the recruitment and retention of health professionals in rural and remote areas, including public hospitals.

This has increased the number of new CNG-powered buses by about 170% (to 1088) from the 400 that were operating in 2000. This significant investment in CNG-powered buses over the last four years has meant that, in many cases, future infrastructure costs will be reduced or eliminated. At the same time, the potential for savings in operational costs has been proven and consumer expectations for CNG buses have been raised. For these reasons, public transports authorities are expected to continue to purchase an increasing proportion of CNG-powered buses.</para><para>(2)	According to transport authority reports, currently there are approximately 6 500 buses operated by public transport organizations in urban areas around Australia.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Alternative Fuels Conversion Program</title><page.no>22911</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2604)</subtitle><id.no>2604</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>22911</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 1 March 2004:</para></talk.start><quote><para>“With reference to the Alternative Fuels Conversion Program: </para></quote><para>(1)	As of 30 June 2003, how much of the expenditure on the program has been on administration.</para><para>(2)	As of 30 June 2003, how much of the expenditure on the program has been spent on: (a) the purchase of new vehicles; (b) the conversion of existing vehicles; and (c) the development and testing of engine technologies.</para><para>(3)	(a) When were the program guidelines changed so as to allow for manufacturers developing and testing engine technologies that can demonstrate greenhouse gas benefits and maintain air quality emissions performance; and (b) why were these changes to the program guidelines made. </para><para>(4)	Can details be provide of the funding provided to date for to (sic) manufacturers to develop and test engine technologies under the program, including details of the manufacturer and a description of the work to be undertaken as a result of the grant.</para><para>(5)	Is operating a vehicle (rather than simply having the capacity to operate a vehicle) on compressed natural gas (CNG) or liquid natural gas (LNG) a condition of funding for new vehicle purchase under the program; if not, why not.</para><para>(6)	What monitoring mechanisms, if any, are in place to ensure that those who receive funding for new vehicle purchases under the program actually run their cars on CNG or LNG, as opposed to petrol.”</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>22912</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for the Environment and Heritage has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	$1 141 000 to 30 June 2003.</para><para>(2)	(a) Grants for new engines (which may include engines placed in new or existing vehicles): $10 642 200.</para><para>(b) Grants for converted or upgraded engines: $959 126, plus $2 855 000 for research projects that included converted or upgraded engines as part of the output.</para><para>(c) $3 384 427.</para><para>(3)	(a) New guidelines came into operation on 1 November 2003.

Most complementary medicines are considered to be lower risk medicines and are Listed in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG).</para><para>	Listed medicines may only contain ingredients approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) as being suitable for use in low risk medicines. New ingredients for use in Listed medicines are evaluated by the TGA in response to an application from a sponsor. Based on the data supplied by the sponsor and other data, a comprehensive evaluation report is prepared by the staff of the Office of Complementary Medicines. The evaluation report is also put forward for consideration by the Complementary Medicines Evaluation Committee (CMEC), an independent, expert committee. </para><para>	The key factors considered when evaluating a new complementary medicine substance are quality and safety. Adequate quality control ensures that products contain the correct amounts of specified ingredients and do not contain unsafe amounts of ingredients or contaminants. The safety evaluation determines whether the substance is of sufficiently low risk so as to allow its inclusion in lower risk complementary medicines.</para><para>	Since its establishment in 1998, the CMEC has recommended to the TGA that, based on the data available at the time of review, eleven substances are not suitable for use in Listed medicines. These substances are as follows: </para><para>- Arginine;</para><para>- Conjugated linoleic acid 75%;</para><para>- Conjugated linoleic acid 60%;</para><para>- Chemically treated petroleum ether extract of conifer needles;</para><para>- Tryptophan;</para><para>- Calcium glucarate;</para><para>- Potassium chloride;</para><para>- Red yeast rice;</para><para>- Isobutylene-isoprene copolymer (butyl rubber); </para><para>- Commiphora mukul oleo-gum resin ethyl acetate extract; and</para><para>- Active hexose correlated compound.</para><para>	All therapeutic goods must be included in the ARTG prior to entering the marketplace. The TGA does not evaluate Listed complementary medicines prior to inclusion in the ARTG. Rather, they are automatically included in the ARTG following on-line application to the TGA by the sponsor and self-certification that the product is eligible for Listing, provided the required fees have been paid. If an application to List a product does not conform with particular requirements it will not be accepted by the on-line Electronic Listing Facility. Following Listing, a statistically significant proportion of these medicines undergo post-market review on a random or targeted basis, to ensure they conform with the legislative requirements for Listed medicines. Regulatory action may be taken against products that do not conform, such as cancelling or proposing to cancel a product from the ARTG.</para><para>	Decisions by the TGA in relation to certifications made for Listed medicines are reviewable under Section 60 of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989.</para><para>(2)	This information is unavailable, as neither New Zealand nor the United States maintains a national register of such products. In addition, the name of a product available in Australia may not be the name used for the same product in other countries.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Shipping: Customs Staff and Facilities</title><page.no>22915</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2634)</subtitle><id.no>2634</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>22915</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator Ludwig</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Justice and Customs, upon notice, on 2 March 2004:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	How many container examination facilities are now operational around Australia.</para><para>(2)	(a) How many full-time Australian Customs Service (ACS) personnel are employed at these facilities; and (b) at what Australian Public Service (APS) levels are these personnel employed.</para><para>(3)	(a) How many part-time ACS personnel are employed at these facilities; and (b) at what APS levels are these personnel employed.</para><para>(4)	Is it still intended that industry will bear the costs associated with the logistics operations for the facilities.</para><para>(5)	What percentage of the cost is currently borne by industry.</para><para>(6)	(a) How many full-time ACS personnel are employed in the Profiling and Alerts Section of the ACS and at what APS levels are these personnel employed; and (b) is this expected to change in the near future. </para><para>(7)	(a) How many part-time ACS personnel are employed in the Profiling and Alerts Section of the ACS and at what APS levels are these personnel employed; and (b) is this expected to change in the near future.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>22916</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Ellison</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's questions is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	There are four container examination facilities now operational - in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Fremantle.</para><para>(2)	(a) There are 121 full-time Customs personnel employed at the facilities.

Eighty industry clients are currently registered to test Release 2 messages. Of those 80 clients, 20 are currently sending regular electronic data interchange (EDI) messages through the test environment. The system is stabilising and it is anticipated a date for implementation will be agreed with software developers in the near future.  </para><para>(2)	In terms of application development, delivery of exports functionality was scheduled for    1 April 2003 and it was delivered on 29 May 2003. It was first promoted to industry test on 18 August 2003 and a supplementary delivery was loaded in the test environment on 21 January 2004. Delays in actual cutover to the new exports system have been experienced due to the complexity of integration with the Customs gateway - the Customs Connect facility. Initial cutover was planned for 1 December 2003 but the system was not robust and reliable enough to achieve this date. Customs has been working with industry to agree on system stability. The new approach requires criteria to be met in order to provide the necessary point for commencement of the three month industry testing and deployment period.</para><para>(3)	The development of the Integrated Cargo System was contracted to a consortium led by Computer Associates in February 2002. At the end of February 2004, payments of approximately $40 million have been made to Computer Associates for the development against contract payments of approximately $48 million. </para><para>(4)	Full analysis of the effectiveness of the Integrated Cargo System cannot be made until it is in production. The systems features will provide:</para><para>	Communication options. Industry clients will have choice as to how they report to Customs including the ability to report directly over the Internet.</para><para>	Enhanced security for all electronic transactions with Customs. </para><para>	New functionality that will greatly improve the ability of both Customs and industry to track and monitor cargo movements while at the same time facilitating early status and early clearance for reported cargo.  </para><para>	Sophisticated profiling and targeting features that will improve Customs ability to protect Australia's borders whilst providing for rapid clearance of low risk cargo. </para><para>	Improved control over all goods intended for export. </para><para>	Improved peripheral services that will reduce or simplify current industry practices. Examples include the introduction of;</para><para>		- new payment options including autopay and BPay.</para><para>		- a diagnostic facility that is available to industry with greatly enhanced status checking features.</para><para>		- a new reference library that provides mandatory reportable information that was previously not freely available to industry.</para><para>(5)	Release 3 of the Integrated Cargo System has two stages. The first covers import cargo reporting. It was scheduled for completion in October 2003 and was loaded into industry test in January 2004. The second stage is large and involves import declarations. This stage of the application is built and is in testing phase. Final delivery of this application is anticipated on 29 April 2004. Once fully integrated with the Customs Connect Facility, it will be made available to industry for testing. This is anticipated for early June. </para><para>(6)	See answer to question 5.</para><para>(7)	The total cost of the Cargo Management Reengineering project, to the end of the current financial year will be approximately $146 million. Of this, $48 million will be paid to the Computer Associates Consortium for the build of the Integrated Cargo System, and $47 million to IBM, Securenet, Novell and EDS for the Customs Connect Facility. The remaining $51 million relates to the cost of supporting the transition to the new systems for industry and Customs staff, business reengineering within Customs and the development of the International Trade Modernisation Legislation.  </para><para>(8)	Unlike the current connection arrangements to Customs existing cargo systems, under the Integrated Cargo System, the trading community will have a choice about how they will communicate to Customs - either interactively using an Internet dial-up, by sending EDI messages over the Internet or via a bureau service or for high volume users by a direct line to Customs. Each method will attract different annual fees depending on the volume of messages sent and the methods used to send them. The cost to an industry user to use the Integrated Cargo System via the Customs Interactive facility over the Internet will be limited to the cost of a digital certificate (approximately $180 for 2 years) plus any costs imposed by the chosen Internet Service Provider (ISP). The annual cost to an industry user who elects to use a commercially available EDI package is the annual cost of maintaining any EDI software, plus the cost of digital certificates (from $180 depending on the size of the business and the number of certificates required) plus any costs imposed by the chosen ISP or bureau service. The annual cost for those high volume users with a direct line to Customs will be approximately $10,000 plus the cost of required digital certificates.</para><para>(9)	The first release to become publicly available to industry was Release 2. The latest version of Release 2 exports functionality was made available to Industry for testing on 21 January 2004. The earlier version, released in August 2003, did not meet industry's requirements for a robust system due primarily to performance issues experienced in integrating the Integrated Cargo System with the Customs Connect Facility. The latest release is stabilising and it is anticipated a date for implementation will be agreed with software developers in the near future. With improvements in system performance in industry test, response from industry is more positive. Industry is reacting positively to the functionality that will be available when Release 2 is fully implemented. It is expected that reporting of exports will be easier and faster for exporters. The exporting community welcomes the availability of the system over the Internet and the new `easy to use' windows type application. </para><para>(10)	When the ICS is fully implemented both Customs and industry will benefit from the electronic capability the system will bring about. Full electronic message capability will enable the full spectrum of cargo processes to be completed with relative ease, including electronic lodgment, status checking, transhipment and underbond reporting. The ICS will significantly enhance the ability of both Customs and industry in tracking cargo movements more efficiently. The new ICS will make it easier for exporters and importers to declare their goods to Customs. Availability of the ICS over the Internet will provide many in industry with the directly ability to report their goods to Customs electronically for the first time, reducing the need for a service provider and reducing the costs of doing business. The system will also greatly improve the accuracy of data reported to Customs. Combined with sophisticated validation and profiling engines that exist within the ICS, this will also enhance Customs ability to undertake its border protection role and will improve Australia's standing and reputation in the international trading environment.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Customs Service: Patrol Boat</title><page.no>22918</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2638)</subtitle><id.no>2638</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>22918</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator Ludwig</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Justice and Customs, upon notice, on 2 March 2004:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Has any estimate been made of the annual cost of leasing the ice-strengthened patrol boat for which the request for tender was issued last week, for duties in the Southern Ocean. </para><para>(2)	Will the vessel be added to those under the direction of the National Marine Unit.</para><para>(3)	Are there any plans to acquire more vessels of this type.</para><para>(4)	How many crew is the vessel expected to require.</para><para>(5)	Will these crew be drawn from existing Australian Customs Service (ACS) personnel.</para><para>(6)	Will the entire crew, or just the boarding party component, be made up of ACS personnel.</para><para>(7)	Will these crew require additional training for working in arctic conditions.</para><para>(8)	Has any estimate been made of how much this training might cost; if so, what is the estimated cost.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>22919</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Ellison</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	The tender has called for proposals from industry for the provision of an appropriate vessel, crew, and a `steaming party'.

Employee positions were made available but the positions were not filled. Considerable use was made of a local Aboriginal-owned business in providing accommodation and catering throughout the construction period and a subcontract for weed control was awarded to a local indigenous firm.</para><para>(2)	Defence is not aware of any indigenous business having submitted a Registration of Interest or Tender for the construction of the Victoria River Bridge at Bradshaw Field Training Area.</para><para>(3)	(a)	The following major contracts have been let for work on the Bradshaw Project:</para><para>	Project Management - Connell Wagner Pty Ltd - $1.208 million (m);</para><para>	Design of Building Works - Spowers Architects (Darwin) - $0.82m;</para><para>	Project Management of the Victoria River Bridge construction - Department of Transport and Works, Northern Territory - $0.73m; and</para><para>	Construction of Victoria River Bridge - Steelcon Constructions (Northern Territory) Pty Ltd - $8.332m.</para><para>	(b)	Defence has no visibility as to the number of Indigenous people who are employed by these companies.</para><para>(4)	Defence is currently undertaking tender negotiations with a preferred tenderer for the civil works component. However, this contract will not be awarded until such time as the Bradshaw Partnering Indigenous Land Use Agreement is registered by the National Native Title Tribunal. </para><para>(5)	Due to ongoing negotiations with a preferred tenderer for the civil works component, the tender documents remain Commercial-In-Confidence.</para><para>Tender documents for the vertical works have not yet been prepared. It is proposed that the vertical works will be tendered as two separate packages with approximate values of $5m and $11m each.</para><para>(6)	Under the arrangements agreed with traditional owners in relation to the Bradshaw Partnering Indigenous Land Use Agreement, the Commonwealth has agreed to maximise the involvement of, and employment, training and business opportunities for, traditional owners and Aboriginal businesses. For the purposes of the Bradshaw Partnering Indigenous Land Use Agreement, an Aboriginal business is one that has significant traditional owner involvement.</para><para>	(a)	Tenderers are required to provide details of their proposal in relation to traditional owner employment, training and business opportunities.</para><para>	(b)	Tenderers are not required specifically to subcontract to indigenous companies. However, participation of traditional owners and Aboriginal businesses is a highly weighted evaluation criterion for tenders.</para><para>(7)	No. Commonwealth Government Procurement Guidelines require Defence to procure the works utilising best practice methodologies. The composition of civil works and vertical works packages has been determined with regard to industry capability, time requirements and value for money considerations. Indigenous outcomes are encouraged through tender requirements that ensure participation of traditional owners and Aboriginal businesses is a highly weighted evaluation criterion.</para><para>(8)	(a)	The Bradshaw Partnering Indigenous Land Use Agreement has not been registered on the Register of Indigenous Land Use Agreements under the Native Title Act 1993. </para><para>	(b)	There are no `issues of contention' between the department and the relevant Indigenous people. The Agreement was signed by the parties (the Commonwealth, the Northern Land Council and the Traditional Owners) in mid-July 2003. Under the Native Title Act 1993, before an area indigenous land use agreement can be registered on the Register of Indigenous Land Use Agreements, the Native Title Registrar must give notice of the agreement (including public notice) and give any person claiming to hold native title in relation to any of the land or waters in the area covered by the agreement three months to object to the registration of the agreement. The notification period for the Bradshaw Partnering Indigenous Land Use Agreement closed on 10 December 2003. Prior to the closing date, the Registrar received an objection. The question raised in that objection goes to whether the making of the agreement was authorised by all those persons who hold or may hold native title in the area covered by the Agreement as required under the Native Title Act. The Northern Land Council, which certified that the making of the agreement was authorised, is in the process of providing the Registrar with additional information as to why it formed this view.</para><para>	(c)	The statutory notification period closed on 10 December 2003. Had there been no objections to the registration, it would have been expected that the agreement would have been registered soon thereafter.</para><para>	(d)	As noted above, the decision about whether to register the agreement is currently with the Native Title Registrar. It would be inappropriate to comment about expected timing.</para><para>(9)	The budget for 2003-04 has been revised due to the delay in registering the Bradshaw Partnering Indigenous Land Use Agreement.</para><para>(10)	As noted above, due to the delay in registering the Bradshaw Partnering Land Use Agreement, no contracts have been awarded for any construction works on Bradshaw with the exception of the construction of the bridge across the Victoria River and approximately 3km of road up the escarpment. </para><para>(11)	Construction of the initial infrastructure development of Bradshaw Field Training Area will commence shortly after the registration of the Bradshaw Partnering Indigenous Land Use Agreement and the grant of a Defence Purpose Lease.</para><para>The first contract to be awarded will be the civil construction contract for approximately 200km of roads within Bradshaw to allow access to the Angalarri Valley to the east of the training area for military training.</para><para>Following sufficient progress on access road work construction in 2004, it is anticipated that the following two contracts will be awarded for the vertical works in either late 2004 or early 2005:</para><para>	the construction of the Range Control facility and caretaker residences; and</para><para>	the construction of Scale A Camps, and the Training Force Maintenance Area.</para><para>(12)	The initial infrastructure development is currently programmed for completion by the end of 2005.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Employment: Work for the Dole</title><page.no>22930</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2674)</subtitle><id.no>2674</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>22930</page.no><name role="metadata">Webber, Sen Ruth</name><name role="display">Senator Webber</name><name.id>00AOT</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment Services, upon notice, on 8 March 2004:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	What Work for the Dole projects have been conducted in the Yanchep/Two Rocks area of Western Australia.</para><para>(2)	Were any projects conducted in areas contaminated by unexploded ordnance.</para><para>(3)	Do Work for the Dole participants have the right to refuse to participate where health and safety concerns exist.</para><para>(4)	Were participants notified that the area was contaminated by unexploded ordnance.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>22930</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Employment Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	There have been 21 Work for the Dole activities operating in the Yanchep or Two Rocks area since the Commonwealth contracted Community Work Coordinators to manage the programme in 2000.

Eleven separate ranges were located within the area, comprising air gunnery, aerial bombing, naval gunfire impact areas and artillery ranges.</para><para>Historical, unexploded ordnance recoveries from the area are reported to have included 250 pound high explosive aerial bombs, 25 pounder high explosive artillery and 6 inch high explosive naval projectiles. While current recoveries of potentially hazardous items indicate that contamination levels are not significant, discoveries are likely to continue with further development of bushland areas.</para><para>(2)	Defence is aware of a number of unexploded ordnance assessment surveys within the former range area. In 1993-1994, Commonwealth-funded assessment searches were conducted by the Western Australia Fire and Emergency Services Unexploded Ordnance Service over a proposed development area of between 30 and 40 hectares to the south of Yanchep township. While no hazardous items were recovered, evidence of ordnance impact was detected. The St Andrews development is located within an impact area. The requirements of the Western Australian Government and the recommendations of Defence are that no change in land use should occur until a detailed assessment of the area proposed for development has been undertaken and, where found to be required, remediated. While no such action can provide a 100 per cent guarantee that all hazardous items have been found and removed, the required measures reflect world's best practice to minimise human exposure to unexploded ordnance hazards.</para><para>(3)	No. However, given that the appropriate site assessment and, where required, remedial measures are undertaken prior to commencement of development and that appropriate action is taken on discovery of such an item, the indemnity provisions contained within the Commonwealth Policy on the Management of Land affected by Unexploded Ordnance may apply.</para><para>(4)	Yes, because the action taken by the Authority was in response to advice from Defence.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Military Detention: Australian Citizens</title><page.no>22931</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2676)</subtitle><id.no>2676</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>22931</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 8 March 2004:</para></talk.start><quote><para>With reference to the prospective trial of Mr David Hicks, an Australian citizen, before a United States of America (US) Military Commission:</para></quote><para>(1)	Is Australia a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</para><para>(2)	Is the US a party to the same International Covenant.</para><para>(3)	Does this International Covenant provide that in the determination of a criminal charge against a person, `everyone shall be entitled to a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law'. </para><para>(4)	Will the proposed military commission to try Mr Hicks, established under and governed by the procedures of the Military Order on the Detention, Treatment and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism, signed by President George W Bush on 13 November 2001, constitute an `independent and impartial tribunal' as required by the International Covenant.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>22932</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Ellison</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Yes.</para><para>(2)	Yes.</para><para>(3)	Yes.</para><para>(4)	This calls for a legal opinion which is precluded by the Senate Standing Orders.

The purpose of these guidelines is to ensure that applications are dealt with effectively and sensitively.</para><para>.2	In recognising that women may experience persecution and discrimination differently from men, the guidelines provide advice on how decision makers can best approach claims of gender-based persecution. It should be noted that claims of gender-based persecution can be made by both men and women. However, the feminine pronoun is used in relation to the applicant throughout the guidelines in recognition of the fact that most gender-based claims are made by female applicants.</para><para>.3	The guidelines provide practical guidance on procedural issues which can influence women applicants and which may affect their ability to present their claims, for example, in relation to receiving applications, managing interviews and ensuring confidentiality of information. They also offer assistance with the interpretation of the regulatory requirements of the various protection, refugee and humanitarian visa classes as they relate to claims put forward by applicants with gender-based claims, with the aim of ensuring that the assessment process is sensitive to gender issues.</para><para>.4	The information provided in this guide should be read in the context of the Department's broader guidelines on refugee and humanitarian decision-making:</para><para>.	for applications in Australia for protection visa: Onshore Refugee Procedures Manual, relevant chapters of the Procedures Advice Manual (PAM III), including the Refugee Law Guidelines;</para><para>.	for applications under the offshore Humanitarian Programme: relevant chapters of the Procedures Advice Manual (PAM III), including the Generic Guidelines B2: Offshore Humanitarian Visas. </para><para>.5	This document aims to give decision makers an additional level of understanding of the particular needs of women within existing policy frameworks for refugee and humanitarian applications; as such, it does not replace other relevant policy advice, but is intended to complement it.</para><para>.6	These guidelines are designed to apply to officers in Australia and at overseas posts. Accordingly, they acknowledge that often different operational decision making environments exist. The advice contained in these guidelines should be adopted as far as practicable. </para><para>1 	BACKGROUND</para><para>The international protection framework</para><para>1.1	The international community's response to refugees is based on the 1951 Convention and 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees (Refugee Convention) and the principle of non-refoulement. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is the international body that is responsible for providing international protection to refugees and promoting lasting solutions to their plight. </para><para>1.2	There are a number of international instruments in which obligations to protect the human rights of women, including refugee women, may be found. They include: </para><para>.	Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)</para><para>.	International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)</para><para>.	International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR)</para><para>.	Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT)</para><para>.	Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD)</para><para>.	Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW)</para><para>.	Convention on the Rights of the Child (CROC)</para><para>.	Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage and Registration of Marriages</para><para>.	Convention on the Nationality of Married Women</para><para>.	1949 Geneva Conventions on the Laws of War and the two Additional Protocols of 1977</para><para>.	Declaration on the Protection of Women and Children in Emergency and Armed Conflict</para><para>.	Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women</para><para>1.3	The international community has devoted a considerable amount of effort and resources to refugees and displaced people. As a result there now exists a complex, if at times fragile, network of institutions, laws and agreements specifically designed to meet the needs of people who have been forced to leave their homeland. Refugee protection has thus taken a number of forms: </para><para>.	admission to safety in the country of asylum and observance of the fundamental principle of non-refoulement; </para><para>.	temporary protection until a lasting solution may be found - this may be (in order of preference) voluntary repatriation, local integration or resettlement in a third country; and </para><para>.	the development of new strategies on prevention which are designed to address the causes as well as the consequences of forced displacement. </para><para>There is also an awareness in the international community that lasting solutions to the problem of human displacement will only be found if a concerted effort is made to protect human rights. </para><para>1.4	Recently there has been an increasing awareness and focus on the particular vulnerability of refugee and displaced women.</para><para>Recognising the needs of refugee and displaced women</para><para>1.5	Women compose the majority of people in vulnerable situations because they have been displaced or are refugees. UNHCR indicate that of an estimated 27 million refugees and displaced people in the world, the vast majority are women and children. Women are often particularly vulnerable - after fleeing persecution and violence they may face new threats of violence and abuse in their country of asylum. In addition, due to social and cultural mores they may not necessarily have the same remedies for state protection as men, or the same opportunities for flight.  </para><para>1.6	The issue of gender persecution and problems facing women asylum seekers have received attention from the Executive Committee of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees' Programme (EXCOM), UNHCR and some governments. UNHCR adopted Guidelines on the Protection of Refugee Women in 1991. A number of EXCOM Conclusions have been adopted recommending the development of appropriate guidelines, culminating in 1995 with EXCOM's recommendation that:</para><para>“In accordance with the principle that women's rights are human rights, these guidelines should recognise as refugees women whose claim to refugee status is based upon well-founded fear of persecution for reasons enumerated in the 1951 Convention and 1967 Protocol, including persecution through sexual violence or other gender-related persecution”.</para><para>1.7	International concerns regarding the plight of refugee women have not been confined to the mechanisms surrounding refugee protection. The 1995 World Conference of Women in Beijing drew attention to the violation of women's human rights experienced by refugee women and recommended the development of gender guidelines. The development of this document should be seen in this international context.</para><para>Australia's response</para><para>1.8	Australia accords a high priority to the promotion and protection of human rights in the international sphere. Australia also has a long-standing commitment to assist international efforts to prevent and alleviate humanitarian crises through diplomatic initiatives, participation in peace-keeping forces, aid, resettlement of refugees and other humanitarian cases through the offshore Humanitarian Programme and the granting of permanent residence to individuals who have been found in need of protection in Australia in accordance with our international obligations under the Refugee Convention. </para><para>1.9	Persons requiring resettlement from overseas may apply under the offshore Humanitarian Programme, which is subdivided into the Refugee component, the Special Humanitarian Programme and the Special Assistance Category. Australia has historically recognised some special needs of women via the Woman at Risk visa subclass of the Refugee component, which is specifically targeted at woman refugees or women registered as 'of concern' to the UNHCR who are in danger of victimisation, harassment or serious abuse because of their sex. In addition, overseas staff of the Department who will be assessing applications under the offshore Humanitarian Programme receive cross-cultural and gender sensitivity training prior to taking up their positions overseas. In terms of the processing of applications by women for protection visas in Australia, officers have also received training in cultural and gender sensitisation.</para><para>1.10	Whilst women represent the majority of refugees worldwide, they represent a smaller proportion of the refugees who are resettled in Australia under the offshore Humanitarian Programme or granted protection visas in Australia. This may be a result of many factors, including women's inability or lack of resources to travel unaccompanied or the tendency of applications to be made by the male head of the household. Nonetheless, women's vulnerability remains.  </para><para>1.11	Guidelines for officers which specifically address women's needs are important if women's claims of persecution, including gender-based persecution, are to be properly heard and assessed. When applying for humanitarian visas, women may face particular problems, such as difficulties in making their case to decision makers, especially when they have had experiences which are difficult and painful to describe. There may also be social and cultural barriers to lodging applications and/or pursuing claims related to their own experiences. For example: in families where the male head of household seeks asylum, claims relating to female members of the family unit may not be mentioned, may be ignored or may not be given any weight by either the male head of household, or the decision maker, or the female applicant herself. </para><para>1.12	Barriers to accessing the refugee and humanitarian visa system and the failure to fully explore women's claims can be compounded by difficulties in gaining recognition of the particular forms of persecution or discrimination manifested against women. </para><para>1.13	Guidelines for decision makers which focus on these gender-related issues assist in promoting a consistent, sensitive approach to women's claims. They are also consistent with international practice and meet the Government's objectives to provide equitable and accessible services. </para><para>1.14	The following chapters focus on two main areas where women may face difficulty in gaining recognition of their claims for protection:</para><para>.	procedural issues; and</para><para>.	the assessment of claims.</para><para>Focusing attention on gender-related persecution/discrimination will ensure that officers are conscious of forms of harm that may be inflicted on a woman uniquely or more commonly than on a man. </para><para>1.15	It should be noted that these guidelines do not advocate gender as an additional ground in the Refugee Convention definition. However, it should be accepted that gender can influence or dictate the type of persecution or harm suffered and the reasons for this treatment. Even where gender is not the central issue, giving conscious consideration to gender-related aspects of a case will assist officers to understand the totality of the environment from which an applicant claims a fear of persecution or abuse of their human rights.</para><para>2	PROCEDURES</para><para>2.1	The following procedures are primarily focused on women applicants for protection visas in Australia and women applicants applying under the offshore Humanitarian Programme. They may also be applied to male applicants who make claims of gender-based persecution. While procedures differ between Australia and overseas posts, reflecting the different criteria for each visa class and decision making environments, there are common elements that can be applied by officers required to examine and process visa applications, regardless of the particular visa class applied for.</para><para>2.2	The procedures outlined below should, nonetheless, be read in conjunction with the other instructions relating to specific visa classes. For example, applications for entry into Australian under the offshore Humanitarian Programme should be considered with regard to the Generic Guidelines B2: Offshore Humanitarian Visas and guidelines on specific visa classes and subclasses; applications lodged in Australia for protection visas should be considered with regard to the Onshore Refugee Procedures Manual and the Refugee Law Guidelines.</para><para>Preparing the case</para><para>Researching claims</para><para>2.3	Adequate research of the claims made in the application and an understanding of the situation in the country of origin of the applicant is important for the full exploration of a person's claims. Where gender related claims are raised, or suspected, an understanding of the role, status and treatment of women in the country of origin is particularly important.  Adequate preparation allows a relationship of confidence and trust with the applicant to be developed and allows an interviewer to ask the right questions and deal with any problems that arise during an interview.</para><para>Sources of information</para><para>2.4	There are a variety of sources of information available, depending on the location of the decision maker. Officers in Australia have access to the online information databases of the Country Information Service Section of the Department (CISNET). Officers at overseas posts have access to a variety of local sources, including Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officers, UNHCR and access to CISNET on CD-ROM. </para><para>2.5	The types of information which may be relevant in assessing gender-related claims are often similar to that relevant for other types of claims. However, research should also focus on the following areas:</para><para>.	legal, economic and civil status of women in the country of origin</para><para>.	the incidence of violence against women in the country of origin, including both sexual and domestic, and the adequacy of state protection afforded to women</para><para>.	cultural and social mores of the country with respect to such issues as the role and status of women, the family, nature of family relationships, attitudes towards same-sex relationships, attitudes to `foreign' influences, etc</para><para>.	respect for and adherence to fundamental human rights</para><para>.	the differential application of human rights for women</para><para>.	issues directly related to claims raised in the application</para><para>2.6	It should be noted that violence against women, particularly sexual or domestic violence, tends to be largely under-reported or ignored in many countries. </para><para>The absence of information on the above topics for any particular country should not necessarily be taken as an indicator that abuses of women's human rights do not occur. </para><para>2.7	Identifying these issues will enable an officer to become aware of the cultural sensitivities and differences in a particular country before considering the applicant's claims.</para><para>Using the information</para><para>2.8	When assessing a woman's claims of well-founded fear of persecution (for the protection visa class and refugee visa subclasses), the evidence must show that what the woman applicant genuinely fears is persecution for a Convention reason as distinguished from random violence or criminal activity perpetrated against her as an individual. The general human rights record of the country of origin, and the experiences of other women in a similar situation, may indicate the existence of systematic persecution for a Convention reason.</para><para>.	A more detailed examination of assessing claims and facts against the refugee definition can be found in Part 4 `The Assessment of the Claims', the Onshore Refugee Procedures Manual, Refugee Law Guidelines and in PAM3 Generic Guidelines B2 - Offshore Humanitarian Visas.</para><para>.	Only the refugee subclasses of the offshore Humanitarian Programme (subclasses 200, 201, 203 and 204) require applicants to demonstrate that they are subject to persecution (ie for a Convention reason). The other visa classes and subclasses of the offshore Humanitarian Programme refer to criteria where applicants are subject to `substantial discrimination' or who are in vulnerable situations. Policy advice for interpreting these criteria may be found in PAM3 Generic Guidelines B2 - Offshore Humanitarian Visas and the PAM3 guidelines on specific visa classes.</para><para>Interviews</para><para>2.9	The objective of an interview is to obtain further information from the applicant on her claims and to clarify any details that are uncertain or ambiguous in the application. Interviewing officers should seek to clarify all matters material to the final outcome of the application.</para><para>2.10	It is important to identify the person included in an application who has the strongest claims. An application written by, or an interview with, a male head of household may place little or no emphasis on a female family unit member's experience of persecution or discrimination, even though her experiences may carry the most weight. A woman who is included in the application as a member of a family unit should be given the opportunity of a separate interview so that she is able, with appropriate assurances of confidentiality, to outline her experiences.  </para><para>Interview Process</para><para>2.11	Interviewing a woman who has/or may come forward with gender-related claims must be done in a sensitive and sympathetic way, with respect for confidentiality. </para><para>2.12	Many women face particular difficulties when discussing gender-related claims which may include rape, or other forms of sexual violence, domestic violence and discrimination. In particular, women may experience difficulty in recounting sexual torture or rape in front of family members. Some women, because of the shame they may feel over what has happened to them, may understandably be reluctant to identify the true extent of persecution they have suffered because of their continuing fear and distrust of people in authority. They may also be afraid to reveal their experiences because they are so traumatised by them or because they fear reprisals from their family and/or community. Female applicants who are survivors of torture and trauma, in particular, require a supportive environment where they can be reassured of the confidentiality of the gender-sensitive claims they are making. </para><para>2.13	Officers should be aware that female victims of violence, discrimination and abuse often do not volunteer information about their experiences and may be reluctant to do so in the presence of family members. In particular, during interviews where an interpreter is used, a woman applicant may be reluctant to divulge information for fear that the interpreter may be an informer for the authorities in the country of origin or that they will divulge their story to others in the community. The applicant should be assured of the confidential nature of the interview process.</para><para>In the vast majority of cases women who have experienced torture and/or trauma have suffered these abuses at the hands of men. Coupled with a fear and distrust of authorities, this fact is likely to seriously inhibit the capacity of a female applicant to divulge details of her experiences to a male interviewer.</para><para>2.14	It will be a matter of the officer having prior appreciation of women's issues in the country of origin, skilful and sensitive interviewing and an understanding of the psychological effects of torture and trauma that will assist these issues to come forward. </para><para>Physical environment</para><para>2.15	In order to facilitate discussion of gender-related claims it is important that the interview room and surrounding environment be conducive to open discussion. The interview room should be arranged in such a way as to encourage discussion of the claims, promote confidentiality and to lessen any possibility of perceived power imbalances. </para><para>Use of interpreter</para><para>2.16	Before scheduling the interview, ensure that appropriate arrangements have been made for interpreters who are sensitive to any special requirements of the applicant regarding language, dialect or ethno-cultural sensitivities. If an applicant has made claims of a sensitive or traumatic nature every effort should be made to ensure an interpreter and interviewing officer of the same sex. </para><para>2.17	Where an officer suspects, as a result of researching the country information relating to the case, that gender-related claims may be raised or discussed, every effort should be made to engage an interpreter of the same sex, with regard to any cultural or religious sensitivities, wherever possible.</para><para>2.18	During the interview, both the interviewer and interpreter should be aware of the possible difficulties in interpreting particular words, such as `rape' or `assault', which may have different meanings or connotations in the applicant's language.</para><para>Establishing rapport</para><para>2.19	Establishing good rapport with an applicant is very important and begins with the first contact. At the interview, the interviewer should take the time to introduce him/herself and the interpreter, explain clearly what his/her role is and the exact purpose of the interview. The applicant should be assured that her claims will be treated in an absolutely confidential manner. </para><para>2.20	Officers should behave in a culturally and gender sensitive manner throughout the interview. It is essential that the interviewer remain neutral, compassionate and objective during the interview. </para><para>2.21	However, it should be remembered that no matter how supportive the interviewing officer and the environment may be, the interview process (because of the imbalance of power between participants) will impact on how women may respond.</para><para>Culturally sensitive communication</para><para>2.22	Officers are required to deal with a wide range of people and as such they should have a well developed understanding of cultural differences, especially in relation to the way they communicate with others.</para><para>2.23	Body language can be interpreted in many different ways. It is therefore important that officers ensure they avoid gestures which may be perceived as intimidating or culturally insensitive or inappropriate. Whilst it is important that officers maintain control of the interview, it is also important to ensure that body language does not inhibit the discussion by making the applicant feel uncomfortable. </para><para>2.24	Similarly, an approach which is too relaxed may create the impression that the officer is not listening. The officer should allow the applicant to present her claims with minimal interruption.</para><para>Active listening skills play an important part in the flow of the interview and can assist an applicant who may be finding it difficult to recall painful or sensitive events associated with her claims. </para><para>2.25	Being aware of cultural sensitivities during the interview may provide the applicant with reassurance. As with most interviews this can most appropriately be demonstrated by attentive listening, including the following:</para><para>.	reflective listening (ie. paraphrasing what has been said by the applicant)</para><para>.	not talking at the same time as the applicant</para><para>.	not making judgemental comments</para><para>.	maintaining composure if the applicant gets angry or upset</para><para>.	nodding affirmatively when appropriate</para><para>.	ensuring minimum interruptions and/or distractions</para><para>.	ensuring the interpreting is an accurate reflection of the applicant's testimony (eg relative length of translation, reaction from the applicant)</para><para>2.26	If an officer feels that a female applicant has further claims of a sensitive nature that have not been discussed during any stage of the interviewing process, the applicant should be encouraged to provide any supplementary information that she feels may support her claims. Alternatively, if an applicant has difficulty in speaking about her persecution, she may be more comfortable putting her claims in writing.</para><para>Assessing and handling information</para><para>Credibility/Demeanour</para><para>2.27	In many societies the stigma attached to victims of sexual assault are such that women cannot bring themselves to discuss such events. In addition, the effects of abuse and trauma may make it difficult for a woman to accurately recall the details and dates of the events when they finally recount their experiences.  It may be that a woman is either unable to discuss a particular experience or may not see its relevance to her claims. It is also unlikely that a woman whose written claims are part of an application supplied by other members of her family unit or who is interviewed in the presence of other family members will discuss the circumstances surrounding a sexual assault. </para><para>The fact that a woman failed to raise a gender-related claim of persecution on several occasions should not necessarily cast doubt on her credibility if it is raised at a later date and should not be responded to as if it does. The pertinent issue, of course, is whether or not the claimed event occurred and, in the protection visa class and refugee visa subclasses, whether it was for a Convention reason. </para><para>2.28	If such claims are revealed separately from the rest of the family, officers must treat the information provided with great care. This is particularly necessary if the woman has indicated that other members of the family are unaware of her experiences. In some cultures rape and other forms of sexual assault are seen as the women's failing to preserve her virginity or marital dignity - disclosure of this information to family members may have adverse consequences to the applicant.</para><para>2.29	Similarly, the level of emotional distress exhibited by a female applicant during the recounting of her experiences should not automatically add more credibility to her claims than that of another who may be very calm and quiet when describing a similar event. A lack of emotion displayed at interview does not necessarily mean that the applicant is not distressed or deeply affected by what has happened. Cultural differences and trauma can often play an important role in determining demeanour.</para><para>2.30	In some circumstances, it may be reasonable to seek, and accept, objective psychological evidence. It is unnecessary to establish the precise details of the sexual assault as opposed to the fact of its occurrence and the motivation of the perpetrator. In some circumstances it should be noted that a woman may not be aware of the reasons for her abuse.</para><para>Confidentiality</para><para>2.31	Any applicant who has provided gender-related claims should be reassured that the details will not be provided, in any form, to another member of their family unit. All information both written and audio taped should be marked “Not for release to anyone except with the agreement of the applicant”.</para><para>2.32	All confidential information provided by female applicants, particularly that of a gender-sensitive nature, is protected under the Freedom of Information Act. The only circumstances in which another member of a family unit can obtain access to the gender-related claims (or indeed any claims) made by a female member of their family is with the written consent of the female applicant concerned.</para><para>2.33	If a visa is refused, some applicants who have provided gender-sensitive claims may wish to personally collect their notification letter and copy of the decision record, or nominate a separate address for the letter to be sent.  These issues should be discussed with the applicant at the interview stage.</para><para>3	THE ASSESSMENT OF CLAIMS</para><para>3.1	The following section provides guidance for officers assessing applications for protection visas and applications for entry to Australia, under the offshore Humanitarian Programme, as a refugee (ie under visa class 866 and subclasses 200, 201, 203 and 204). These types of applications centre on the definition of `refugee' in the 1951 Convention and 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees (Refugee Convention). </para><para>.	Women outside Australia who are refugees or who are registered as being of concern to UNHCR may also be eligible for entry to Australia under the Woman at Risk (WR) 204 visa subclass of the offshore Humanitarian Programme. This visa reflects Australia's response to the circumstances of certain women outside their home country who are in danger of victimisation, harassment or serious abuse because of their gender. Further policy advice in deciding applications of this visa subclass can be found in PAM3 Schedule 2 - Permanent Visa (Migrant) Woman At Risk - Visa 204.</para><para>.	Under the offshore Humanitarian Programme, applicants who meet the Refugee Convention definition of a refugee must also satisfy the other criteria of the visa subclass before they may be granted a visa.</para><para>.	Officers should also refer to other sources of guidance for processing these applications, including: Onshore Refugee Procedures Manual; Refugee Law Guidelines; PAM Generic Guidelines B2: Offshore Humanitarian Visas. </para><para>3.2	The non-refugee components of the offshore Humanitarian Programme (the Special Humanitarian and Special Assistance Categories) are designed for people who do not meet refugee criteria but who, nonetheless:  </para><para>.	are subject to substantial discrimination amounting to serious human rights violations and for whom resettlement in Australia is the appropriate solution; or </para><para>.	are suffering some form of disadvantage or hardship meriting a humanitarian response and who have close links to Australia. </para><para>Although discrimination, disadvantage and hardship constitute lesser tests than persecution, assessment of applications for these visas will also involve an examination of the human rights environment in an applicant's country of origin. Officers should be aware that women may experience not only persecution but also discrimination, disadvantage or hardship in a manner qualitatively different from men as a result of their gender. </para><para>The Refugee Convention is intended to provide protection to persons who have a well founded fear of being persecuted on specified grounds. Recognising that treatment or discrimination amounts to persecution is the first step. An officer must also be satisfied that this fear of persecution is `well-founded' and that is `for reasons of' a Convention ground.</para><para>Persecution and gender-related persecution</para><para>3.3	The types of persecution inflicted on individuals may differ because of their gender.  It is important to bear in mind that gender-based persecution is only one of many types of persecution a woman may encounter.</para><para>.	Accordingly, officers must carefully consider all general claims of persecution before turning to consider gender-related claims, otherwise there is the possibility that a woman's claims of persecution unrelated to gender will be ignored.</para><para>-	this will also avoid unnecessary retraumitisation of applicants over their experiences related to sexual violence.</para><para>3.4	The process of identifying every abuse of human rights against internationally agreed standards of human rights (the human rights protected in the International Bill of Human Rights which includes the UDHR, ICCPR and ICESCR - see 2.2 above) should allow a decision-maker to properly consider all serious forms of harm a person may face, including those harms that are gender-based.</para><para>.	the further step of focussing on gender-based persecution will ensure that officers are conscious of forms of harm that may be inflicted on a woman uniquely or more commonly than on a man.</para><para>.	this emphasis on gender-related persecution, combined with the appropriate techniques and awareness, may assist a decision-maker to elicit such claims which would otherwise have remained untouched. </para><para>Increased emphasis on the role of gender in persecution is not intended to alter the ordinary meaning of persecution. Rather it is intended to ensure that all of the applicant's claims of persecution are fully considered. </para><para>3.5	Australian case law has referred to internationally agreed standards of human rights in recognizing persecution. Whilst there are areas of uncertainty, it can generally be stated that the more fundamental the right threatened, the more likely that the breach of that right amounts to persecution.</para><para>Persecution by torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment or treatment</para><para>3.6	Rape and other forms of sexual assault are acts which inflict severe pain and suffering (both mental and physical) and which have been used by many persecutors. Such treatment clearly comes within the bounds of torture as defined by the Convention Against Torture (CAT). Furthermore, sexual violence amounts to a violation of the prohibition against cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, the right to security of person and in some instances the right to life, as contained in a variety of international instruments. There are many other types of treatment that are specific to women, such as female genital mutilation and forced abortion, that also constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. </para><para>3.7	Rape is often used to punish a woman for her actions or to encourage her to put pressure on others whose activities meet with State disapproval. Systematic rape has also been used as part of “ethnic cleansing”.</para><para>3.8	It should also be remembered that in many nations victims of sexual assault become outcasts or are considered to have committed a criminal offence. This fact can be part of the persecutor's motivation in choosing this form of persecution.</para><para>Restrictions imposed by legal, social or religious mores</para><para>3.9	The status of women in some societies may be restricted and dictated by legal, social or religious mores. The restrictions will vary from mere inconvenience to oppression. In addition a broad range of penalties may be imposed for disobeying restrictions placed on women. Officers should carefully assess the available country of origin information on those issues.</para><para>Possible persecution by violation of thought, conscience and religion</para><para>3.10	Gender-based persecution is sometimes more subtle than other forms. It can take the form of restrictions on the way a woman behaves or it can involve forcing her to act in a certain way. It may affect a woman's ability to participate in the public life of a society.</para><para>Some examples of gender-based treatment against women which may constitute persecution in particular circumstances are:</para><para>.	societal oppression of women - in some communities the status and behaviour of women has been dictated by a State sanctioned religious hierarchy. </para><para>.	denial of participation by women in the political, civil or economic life.</para><para>.	forced marriage - many societies practice arranged marriage and this in itself may not be a persecutory practice. However, the consequences of defying the wishes of one's family when viewed against the background of the State's failure to protect a person should be carefully considered. </para><para>.	infanticide, forced abortion, female genital mutilation, which has serious impact on a woman's physical and mental health.</para><para>Agents of persecution</para><para>3.11	A Convention refugee is someone who is at risk because their country of nationality has failed to protect them from persecution. A failure to protect can occur in several ways. It may be that the authorities are themselves the perpetrators of the persecution. However, it may be that the persecutor is another party from whom the authorities do not protect the person either because they are unwilling or unable to do so. Claims of gender-based persecution often involve persecution committed by non-state agents.</para><para>In assessing gender-based persecution it is important to research the accepted norms of the relevant societies to determine how they operate both through legislation and in terms of actual practice in order to determine the degree of protection available to women.</para><para>3.12	In some societies, particular types of violence against women may be officially condemned or even illegal but in fact be so endemic that local authorities turn a blind eye to its occurrence. Sometimes these forms of abuse are systemic or culturally acceptable so that local authorities may actively participate or be complicit in the harms suffered.</para><para>3.13	It is important to remember that the international protection of the Refugee Convention is only available to those who are not able to gain protection from their national authorities. Where a non-state agent of persecution is involved there is a need to establish that the state is “unwilling or unable” to protect the applicant. Clearly, this is established if the authorities were aware of a person's need for protection (either because of her approach or by some other means) and none was forthcoming. </para><para>3.14	It should also be noted that it is not always reasonable or possible for a woman to alert the authorities to her need for protection. State protection should be effective - with provision of mechanisms for dealing with complaints and also assurance that such avenues for redress are realistic and accessible to a woman of her culture and position.  </para><para>.	Officers should investigate why a woman did not seek the protection of the state, as her inability to even request protection may in itself be indicative of a failure of state protection.</para><para>Cumulative grounds</para><para>3.15	An applicant may put forward accounts of different types of harm, none of which, taken individually, will amount to persecution. In these cases it is necessary to consider the cumulative effect of the individual instances of harm.</para><para>3.16	This principle is not gender specific. However, the forms of harm directed against women may be more various and more subtle. This may reflect the fact that the woman may not be the primary focus of the persecutory behaviour, which may be directed primarily at male family members.</para><para>Well-founded fear</para><para>Past persecution and the “changed circumstances” test</para><para>3.17	There are two ways that a well-founded fear of persecution can be established:</para><para>.	there is a “real chance” of future persecution; or</para><para>.	a person has been persecuted in the past and the “changed circumstances” test (set down by the High Court in Chan) has not been satisfied.</para><para>3.18	There is a significant difference between the two. A person who has suffered persecution in the past does not have to prove that there is a “real chance” of future persecution. Rather, a continuing well-founded fear of persecution should be accepted unless the officer can establish that there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances in the country of origin.</para><para>3.19	The application of the “changed circumstances” test must be carefully applied in cases of gender-related persecution. The subjective state of mind of the applicant has obvious implications for gender-related persecution, especially in cases of sexual assault, where the effects on the victim are long lasting. In addition, an overall understanding of the role and perception of women in the applicant's society will demonstrate the extent of the persecution a woman would face if she were to return.</para><para>3.20	Officers must also carefully consider what circumstances, if any, would satisfy the “changed circumstances” test in cases of gender-related persecution. Many cases of gender-based persecution occur at the hands of non-state agents of persecution whose actions are ignored or condoned by the authorities. Even where changes in the national legislation or other state of affairs have occurred, such agents of persecution are seldom brought to justice and there is no accountability by the state for the acts of persecution inflicted on the applicant.</para><para>Relocation</para><para>3.21	An important consideration in gender-related persecution, as with other persecution, is whether the persecution occurs nation-wide or whether it is regionalised. It may be for example that a person is able to access protection in urbanised parts of the country where there is a real chance of persecution in the rural areas. If so, officers should consider whether the applicant could reasonably be expected to relocate within her own country. </para><para>In considering the issue of relocation the relevant issue is whether the applicant could safely live in another part of the country. Officers must carefully consider gender-related issues when applying this test. Financial, logistical, social, cultural and other barriers to reaching internal safety may significantly affect persons of one gender over another. In addition, gender-based persecution may be systemic and no protection may be available from the authorities in any part of the country.</para><para>Convention grounds</para><para>3.22	There are five Convention grounds: race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group and political opinion. In addition to actual membership of a Convention ground, a well-founded fear of persecution may be for reasons of an imputed Convention ground. A woman's claims for refugee status may rest on one or more grounds of the Convention even where the persecution is gender-based. </para><para>3.23	Where the persecution of women is concerned, it should be recognised that an imputed Convention ground is an important aspect to consider. Women in many societies are forced into a subordinate role in many areas of life. Therefore, the opportunities to assume a publicly recognisable profile do not occur frequently and women are often aligned with the views of their male relatives.</para><para>3.24	The added difficulty is that, in many societies women have little or no information on the activities of their male relatives and may find it difficult to explain the reasons for their persecution. They may not realise that the authorities, for example, impute a political opinion to them because of their association (by marriage, family links etc) with others who have attracted the authorities' attention. </para><para>Political opinion</para><para>3.25	In some societies, overt demonstration of political opinion by women may not be possible as women are not allowed to formally participate in political life. However, there may be country information about the existence of covert political organisations involving women or about the suspicions of authorities that such organisations exist. Furthermore, the fact that a woman may challenge particular social conventions about the manner in which women should behave may be considered political by the authorities and may attract persecutory treatment on this basis.</para><para>In some societies an organisation of women who are not seeking a public or political profile but who may, for example, possess a feminist ideology, may be viewed as espousing a political opinion hostile to the current administration and persecuted for that reason.</para><para>3.26	In many cases there is a societal assumption that women defer to men on all significant issues and that their political views are aligned with those of the dominant members of their family (usually husbands, fathers or brothers). They may thus experience persecution for this reason, ie imputed political opinion. </para><para>3.27	There are also cases where persecutors are aware that a woman possesses no political opinion but persecute her as a means of demoralising the rest of her family or community who do hold a political opinion hostile to the current administration.</para><para>3.28	The difficulty in assessing claims of imputed political opinion, of course, is that the woman may not be aware of the reasons why she has been persecuted. Officers faced with unexplained instances of persecution should look to whether the explanation may be traced to her family's political opinion or another Convention ground. </para><para>Race</para><para>3.29	Race is a Convention ground based on readily identifiable characteristics. In general racism knows no gender, however persecution may be expressed in different ways against men and women. For example the persecutor may choose to destroy the ethnic identity and/or prosperity of a racial group by killing, maiming or incarcerating the men whilst the women may be viewed as capable of propagating the ethnic identity and persecuted in a different way, such as through sexual violence. </para><para>Religion</para><para>3.30	In certain societies, the role ascribed to women may be attributable to the requirements of the state or official religion. The failure of women to conform to this role or model of behaviour may then be perceived by the authorities or other agents of persecution as the failure to practise or to hold certain religious beliefs and as such an attempt to corrupt the society or even as a threat to the religion's continued power. This may be the case even though the woman actually holds the official religious faith but it is not outwardly evidenced by her behaviour.</para><para>Nationality </para><para>3.31	Gender-based persecution for reasons of nationality may have its genesis in laws which deprive a woman of her citizenship in certain situations (eg marriage to a foreign national). Alternatively, a woman who has married a foreign national may not be able to live with him in her country of nationality. Rather than the loss of citizenship itself, officers should enquire into what harm results from this loss. For example, whether it leads to loss of right of residence or loss of other privileges or benefits.</para><para>Membership of a Particular Social Group</para><para>3.32	The Australian Federal Court has laid down some essential principles in the interpretation of the particular social group ground. Those principles are summarised as follows:</para><para>.	the claimed particular social group must be cognisable </para><para>-	a group is cognisable if there is a common unifying element binding the members of the group because of shared common social characteristics and/or shared interest or experience in common (Morato's case);</para><para>-	cognisability does not require a voluntary association amongst the members of the group (Morato's case);</para><para>-	a group is not cognisable where the sole criterion defining the group is a common act although it is possible that, over a period of time, individuals who engage in similar actions may form a particular social group (Morato's case);</para><para>-	the group is not defined solely by the persecution feared (A&amp;B's case).</para><para>.	the nexus between the particular social group and the fear of persecution must be established. That is, there is a well-founded fear of persecution “for reasons of” membership of that group (Ram's case); and</para><para>.	the individual is (or is perceived to be) a member of that group, ie there is a common unifying element binding members together (Ram's case).</para><para>3.33	While `gender' of itself is not a Convention ground, it may be a significant factor in recognising a particular social group or an identifying characteristic of such a group. Officers should bear in mind that there is no Australian jurisprudence on the issue of `women' as a `particular social group'. The Refugee Review Tribunal has found that whilst being a broad category, women nonetheless have both immutable characteristics and shared common social characteristics which may make them cognisable as a group and which may attract persecution. In addition, gender may be combined with certain other characteristics which could define a particular social group in situations where there is evidence that this group suffers or fears to suffer severe discrimination or harsh and inhuman treatment that is distinguished from the situation of others of the same gender. The important principle to consider is whether the persecution suffered or feared is for reasons of membership of a particular social group. </para><para>Officers should consider this Convention ground on a case by case basis which takes account of the totality of an applicant's claims and the situation in the applicant's country of origin.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Greenham Bicentennial Cattle Drive</title><page.no>22953</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2707)</subtitle><id.no>2707</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>22953</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 18 March 2004:</para></talk.start><quote><para>With reference to the Minister's rejection of the application by the Tasmanian Aboriginal Land Council for protection under section 9 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 of an area in Tasmania to be traversed by the Greenham Bicentennial Cattle Drive:</para></quote><para>(1)	(a) What was the Minister's reason for rejecting the application; and (b) can a copy of any information used to support that decision be provided.</para><para>(2)	What was the exact route assessed by the Minister. </para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>22954</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for the Environment and Heritage has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	(a) My reason for deciding not to make the declaration sought by the Tasmanian Aboriginal Land Council under section 9 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 was that I was not satisfied that the area specified in the application was a significant Aboriginal area within the meaning of the Act.</para><para>(b) If Senator Brown wishes, I will seek permission of the authors to provide him with relevant documents.

Sea-going crewmembers of the NMU are not trained in or equipped for hostile boarding operations. However the Customs Marine Superintendent or a Customs Operational/Chief/Commander (after consultation with the Marine Superintendent) may, approve ACV participation in a hostile boarding.

Engagement of counsel</inline></para><quote><para>6.1 Counsel are to be engaged by or on behalf of an FMA agency in accordance with the Directions on Engagement of Counsel, at Appendix D. </para><para>6.2 Briefs to counsel in matters covered by the model litigant policy are to enclose a copy of the Directions on the Commonwealth's Obligation to Act as a Model Litigant, at Appendix B and instruct counsel to comply with the policy.</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Appendix D</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">DIRECTIONS ON ENGAGEMENT OF COUNSEL </inline></para><quote><para>1. The Commonwealth policy in relation to engaging counsel is to seek to rely on its position as a major purchaser of legal services in agreeing on the level of fees payable to counsel engaged on behalf of the Commonwealth or its agencies.</para><para>2. Commonwealth agencies and legal service providers are encouraged to brief a broad range of counsel and, in particular, women. While the selection of counsel needs to take into account the interests of the Commonwealth in securing suitable and expert counsel in a particular case, this should not occur in a manner which results in a narrow pool of counsel who regularly undertake Commonwealth work. </para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Application</inline></para><quote><para>3. The policy applies to the engagement of counsel by agencies themselves, by the Australian Government Solicitor (AGS), or by private lawyers who are acting for the Commonwealth or its agencies. The policy applies to lawyers who, although not from the bar, are briefed as counsel in lieu of a private barrister to conduct or advise on litigation for the Commonwealth or its agencies.</para><para>4. The policy applies to briefs to advise and briefs to appear before courts, tribunals and inquiries. It also applies to the use of counsel to represent the Commonwealth and its agencies in arbitration and other alternative dispute resolution processes. Briefs should ordinarily be marked with an hourly rate up to a maximum daily rate inclusive of conferences, consultations, preparation and other necessary work. A fee on brief (inclusive of preparation time) is to be marked if it is considered more economical than agreeing to pay a fee based on the appropriate hourly or daily rate for the counsel.</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Fees payable to counsel</inline></para><quote><para>5. Senior counsel are not to be paid a daily rate above $2400 (inclusive of GST) without the approval of the Attorney-General or the Attorney-General's delegate. Junior counsel are not to be paid a daily rate above $1600 (inclusive of GST) without such approval. Any out of chamber fee is to be treated as part of the daily rate for the purpose of considering the appropriateness of that rate. Where an out of chamber fee is agreed or approved, it is to be marked separately on the brief. </para><para>6. Hourly rates greater than one-sixth of the daily rate are not to be agreed with counsel unless approved by the Attorney-General or the Attorney-General's delegate.</para><para>7. A cancellation fee is to be agreed with counsel only in exceptional circumstances (eg to cover the possibility of a matter being resolved shortly before a lengthy trial). Any such fee is to be agreed at the time counsel is engaged for a trial. A cancellation fee greater than 2 days of counsel's normal Commonwealth rate is to be approved by the Attorney-General or the Attorney-General's delegate before it is agreed with counsel.</para><para>8. Payment of retainers (concerning counsel's availability for future matters), both new and renewed, is not ordinarily to be agreed with counsel and, if considered to be justified, the terms of the agreement are first to be approved by the Attorney-General or the Attorney-General's delegate.</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Approval</inline></para><quote><para>9. Unless agreed otherwise by the Attorney-General, requests for approval to pay counsel amounts higher than the rates referred to in paragraphs 5 and 6, and approvals required by paragraphs 7 and 8 for cancellation fees and retainers, are to be made to the Office of Legal Services Coordination (OLSC). Proposals to pay senior counsel in excess of $3800 per day (inclusive of GST) will be referred by OLSC to the Attorney-General for consideration.</para><para>10. Approval is to be sought as far as possible in advance of the scheduled date for the delivery of a brief to counsel. In considering a request to pay counsel above the specified rate, the following factors will be taken into account:</para></quote><para>(a) the special expertise or skill of the counsel who is proposed to be briefed, </para><para>(b) the availability of counsel generally to appear in the matter, </para><para>(c) the probable total cost of counsel's fees in the matter, </para><para>(d) the specific request of an agency that a particular person be briefed and the reasons for that preference, </para><para>(e) the importance of the matter, including any special sensitivity, and </para><para>(f) the normal market daily fee at which the relevant counsel is briefed. </para><quote><para>11. If approval for a daily fee in excess of $2400 or $1600 (as applicable) has been given, subsequent approval for using the same barrister at the approved rate is not required unless, at the time the approval is given, the fee is designated as a `one-off' rate.</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Other matters</inline></para><quote><para>12. The fees referred to in paragraph 5 are not to be regarded as the standard or starting point for fee negotiations. In many cases, particularly in relation to junior counsel, the normal market rates of counsel may be less, or even considerably less, than the `no-approval' threshold fees. In cases where the ordinary market rate of counsel is lower than the no-approval fee, counsel should be engaged at, or below, their normal rate.</para><para>13. Counsel are not to be paid more than reasonable costs of accommodation and travel, taking into account levels applicable to Senior Executive Service officers in the Australian Public Service. Accommodation and class of travel is not to be approved so as to increase the approved Commonwealth daily rate. </para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Administration of the policy</inline></para><quote><para>14. OLSC will normally consult AGS, in light of its experience with the conduct of Commonwealth litigation and with the engagement of counsel generally, in considering whether a fee in excess of the `no-approval' limits should be approved and in making recommendations to the Attorney-General in respect of a request to approve a fee in excess of $3800.</para><para>15. Subject to the availability of counsel at the approved rates, the choice of counsel is a matter for individual agencies, taking into account any advice from AGS or private lawyers. However, agencies and their instructing solicitors are invited to inform OLSC, either in general terms or in relation to a specific matter, if they consider that the approved level of fees is inhibiting their engagement of counsel.</para><para>16. To facilitate administration, agencies are to provide OLSC, upon request, with information or access to information about the engagement of all or certain counsel. </para><para>NOTE: Expenditure of public moneys in a manner inconsistent with this policy by an agency covered by the Financial Management and Accountability Act may constitute a breach of the Regulations under that Act. The Regulations require that a person to whom they apply must not approve a proposal to spend public money unless satisfied, after making such enquiries as are reasonable, that the proposed expenditure is in accordance with the policies of the Commonwealth. (The Regulations also require approval of a proposal to spend money before an FMA agency enters into a contract, agreement or arrangement involving the expenditure of public money.)  </para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>United Nations Security Council</title><page.no>22972</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2804)</subtitle><id.no>2804</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>22972</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator Allison</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 1 April:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Is the Government aware of the great concerns that exist concerning the content of the draft resolution on non-proliferation presented by the United States of America (US) to the United Nations Security Council.</para><para>(2)	Does the Government support the resolution; if so, why; if not, why not.</para><para>(3)	Does the Government share the concerns of the non-permanent members of the Security Council and the concerns of the experts in international law and others concerning the content of the resolution.</para><para>(4)	(a) How does this resolution assist in the realisation of international law in this area; and (b) does the Minister agree that the resolution as drafted has the potential to undermine other international law; if not, why not.</para><para>(5)	Will the Government at the UN urge members of the Security Council, including the US, to ensure decision-making and commitments in the framework of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons are also emphasised; if not, why not.</para><para>(6)	Will the Minister urge the members of the Security Council, including the US, to meet the concerns mentioned above.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>22972</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The following answer has been provided by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	No. The Government does not consider views expressed on the draft resolution, which is supported by all five Permanent Members of the UN Security Council, to amount to “great concerns”. </para><para>(2)	Yes.
