                        <para>-  I ask a question of the Minister for Customs and Excise. My question concerns censorship of literature. Has the Minister's attention been directed to an advertising folder bearing the picture of a nude woman adorned only by a twig and very small leaves held in the hand? The folder has been posted from the United States of America to many men in Australia. It advertises a new magazine which is said to be devoted to love in its infinite variety. The name of the magazine is "Eros". I have a copy of the folder before me now. If the Minister will train his bi-focals  in my direction he will be able to see it. After inspecting the folder, which  I  will give to the Minister, will he give an opinion on whether it is obscene or is designed to appeal to the baser instincts? Does the Minister agree that this folder is not the type of thing that should be allowed to come into the hands of excitable and impressionable youth? I do not expect the Minister to  be a  conservative moralist, but does he agree that there is a line of demarcation between exposure of feminine beauty and obvious appeal to the baser instincts? In part the folder reads </para>

                        <para>The honorable senator says that the folder comes by mail. Any suggested action which would involve tampering with mails would certainly give rise to difficulties. In no circumstances would the censorship authorities have anything to do with examining the mails in search of the folder. However, if any of the susceptible and impressionable young senators send their eight dollars to America with the idea of getting the magazine, and if copies arrive in Australia, customs officers will be alerted to examine them under the normal procedures prescribed by the Customs Act. </para>

Will the Minister indicate whether it is still intended to serve the north-west coast of Tasmania from the television station  now  being erected  on  Mount Barrow? When will this station be in operation? Is it still proposed to erect a relay station at Burnie to transmit programmes from the Mount Barrow station? Has the Australian Broadcasting Control Board abandoned phase four of its programme which envisages a separate television station at Burnie? Is it correct that the booster station to be erected on Flinders Island will be used only to relay programmes from mainland stations occasionally and will not transmit continually so as to enable viewers to tune into it at any time? Can the Minister provide any information concerning the proposed booster station on King Island? </para>

                        <para>-  I understand that it is the intention of the Postmaster-General's Department to service the north-west coast of Tasmania with a television station now being erected on Mount Barrow. I have been advised that when this station is in operation, the total population of Tasmania, with the exception 20,000 people, will be serviced. The commercial station on Mount Barrow will come into operation in May, 1962, and I think the national station there will come into operation in July, 1963. I have no knowledge of the plans to cover Flinders Island and King Island, but I shall refer that portion of the question to my colleague and get his reply for the Senate. </para>

                        <para>-  My question is directed to the Minister for National Development. Is it a fact that the the United States of America Atomic Energy Commission has a division called Operation Plowshare, which is concerning itself with the development of peaceful uses of nuclear explosions? Is it a fact that Dr. Higgins, the director of this division, is at present in Australia advocating techniques and quoting costs which probably could be realized in the construction of dams, canals, water storages and harbours, as well as various applications in mining, by the use of underground nuclear explosions? Also, is it a fact that the costs quoted indicate that these new methods are very much cheaper than the present conventional methods? Is it a fact, too, that a dam such as the proposed Chowilla dam in South Australia could be constructed for approximately £1,000,000 instead of the £14,000,000 that has been, estimated by the River Murray Commission? Could the expected loss by evaporation be greatly reduced and the capacity increased by deepening the floor of the storage by a series of similar, if smaller, nuclear explosions? Would any danger to human, animal or vegetable life be caused by radio-activity in the water thus stored and eventually released for irrigation, industrial or domestic use? If the Minister's answers indicate that the Plowshare operations are a successful revolution in hydrological and mining engineering, will he request the River Murray Commission to investigate the possibilities immediately? </para>

                        <para>-  I had an idea that this question would be asked, and I prepared some notes so that I could answer with reasonable accuracy. I was asked a question on this subject the other day. Since then I have had an opportunity to meet Dr. Higgins and to have a discussion with him. I have not the slightest doubt that his visit to Australia is an important event which could have far-reaching effects on Australian development: I think that two great factors which will influence Australian development are the best use of our water resources and the development of port facilities in the north. The indications are that the use of nuclear explosives would lead to a substantial reduction of the heavy capital expenditure involved in the construction of large water storages. I hesitate to confirm the figure given by Senator Buttfield - I should like first to have advice from my professional officers - but there is little doubt that with the use of nuclear explosives, the capital costs of large - I emphasize the word large - water storages would be dramatically reduced. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The reduction of costs is not the only thing involved. It is more than possible that, as a result of the development of this new technique, it should be economically feasible to put water storages in existing flood plains. I would describe such storages as being in the nature of deep ponds, adjacent to an existing river flow. That method could be used when no suitable site for a conventional dam was available. The present thinking is that this would enable a new approach to be made to the use of river waters. In the case of the river Murray, for instance, a large surplus of water flows out to sea, and by building water storages of this kind great waste would be avoided. Another interesting point is that deep water storages would prevent the very large losses of water that now occur as the result of evaporation. In places like South Australia, not only would losses from evaporation be reduced, but deep water storages might inhibit, or prevent, losses due to the salt content of the water. </para>
                    <para>As to the safety aspect, I am assured that the experimental work that has been carried out shows that the danger from radiation is very small, even now. In the course of the experimental work men have worked normal shifts on the excavations, without any ill effects. I do not understand this personally, but I am advised that the radiation following a nuclear explosion is immediately absorbed by the rock structures surrounding the site of the explosion. </para>
                    <para>Dr. Higgins
                        was invited to come to Australia by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. He will deliver a series of lectures to professional men.
                        Senator Buttfield
                        has requested that he communicate with the River Murray Commission. I hope and expect that the members of the River Murray Commission will meet
                        Dr. Higgins
                        and perhaps attend his lectures. I am sure that they will be greatly interested in this new approach. I have arranged, of course, for officers of my department to keep in close touch with all developments that occur. I have been informed that it may be two or three years before the Plowshare group will be in a position to make a detailed estimate of costs for a major engineering proposal.</para>

                        <para>-  My question is directed to the Acting Minister for Trade. Is the Government giving a very special welcome to the Canadian trade mission which has arrived in Australia to investigate opportunities for increasing Canada's exports to Australia? As Australia's adverse trade balance with Canada has exceeded £100,000,000 in the last ten years, is the Government doing everything possible to help this trade mission to exploit the Australian market, which the Canadians delightfully describe as Canada's fifth most important export market? Does the Government realize that Canada has always been one of Australia's worst markets? Is it a fact that Australia's exports to Canada are falling at an alarming rate and that for the first six months of the current fiscal year Australia's exports to Canada have dropped by more than £1,000,000? What does the Government propose to do to rectify this most unsatisfactory situation? </para>

                            <para>-  That is a matter for debate. A mission was sent from Australia last year and its members have reported on certain trade contacts that they established in Canada. I trust that those contacts will lead to an increase of exports to Canada. The honorable senator says, quite rightly, that our trade balance with Canada is too adverse and that Australia must increase its exports to Canada. We started to explore that matter about eighteen months ago.  I  am sure that the mission in Australia will find Australian exports lines that will interest Canada just as much as it will find markets for Canadian goods in this country. </para>

Senator Laught has asked for a time-table for the capital cities, emphasizing the claims of Adelaide. I cannot give him a time-table, but I can say to him that plans are in hand for the extension of the system to all capital cities. I detect in his question some desire to have this programme speeded up. That desire is logical because the new system will bring great benefits to subscribers in both speed and economy. </para>

                    <para>I am afraid that in reply to a question without notice I cannot give a detailed answer about the formula to be adopted for charging; but I can give a simple analogy, using the present base rate of 4d. for my purpose. For instance, let us take a trunk call, which at present costs 6s. If a subscriber can complete in ten seconds a call to a place for which the charge is at present 6s the charge will be 4d., which means that the cost of the call will be based on the unit of 4d. If any one is of the opinion that that will reduce the Postal Department's revenue, let me say to him that the whole scheme is designed to provide a service and to make channels available for the use of more subscribers. A subscriber will be able to make a call at a much cheaper rate if he can reduce the time involved. That will be in his own interests and at the same time make the channels available for a greater volume of business. </para>

                        <para>- I would not be expected, I am sure, to have in my mind full details of all the costs over the last ten years involved In buying, running and maintaining motor cars in all the missions which Australia has abroad. It may well be that the cost averages £100,000 a year, which is the figure given by the honorable senator, but I shall be glad to see whether the figures for that period can be found for him. I shall supply him with a list of the missions which use exclusively Australian motor cars, such as Holdens. </para>

                        <para>- I address a question to the Minister in charge of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. Is it a fact that the rabbit population in Australia is on the increase? If so, is the increase due to the fact that rabbits are becoming immune to myxomatosis? Also is it a fact that the C.S.I.R.O. has developed a new virus to overcome the immunity which has been built up to myxomatosis? If such a virus has been developed, is it available for general use, and can the Minister indicate the results that have been obtained from its use? </para>

                        <para>- Yes, the rabbit population in Australia is definitely increasing. The reasons are partly because of the growth of resistance to myxomatosis and partly because of very good breeding conditions over the last year or two. No new virus has been developed by the C.S.I.R.O., nor is there a reasonable chance of one being developed, but this and other methods of rabbit control are constantly under study by the organization. The last two parts of the honorable senator's question therefore do not arise. </para>

We have done a fair amount of seismic work; but, of course, you have to drill a hole before you can get the oil. It was for that reason that we extended the subsidy system to cover the drilling operation for the wildcat hole. I shall get the information as quickly as I can and let Senator Brown have it. </para>

Mr. Higgins referred to the relation of nuclear energy from underground atomic explosions and the production of fresh water from sea water. Dr. Raggatt is reported to have said that South Australia faced a prospect of having to reduce agricultural production because of lack of water, and that nuclear explosion was a practical way for that State out of the difficulty. Can the Minister say whether there are any plans to embark on a programme of study relating to this matter, especially in relation to South Australia? </para>

But I should think it would be impossible for Dr. Raggatt or any other Australian to think or speak about this matter without having at the back of his mind the South Australian position. South Australia, with its lack of natural water resources and the problem of salinity in the Murray River, is the natural place in which this new approach could be made. </para>

Mrs. Wilson is, I understand, the first woman to be appointed to such a position. We all hope that she will be very successful in her work.  Her  remuneration is the same as that of male marketing officers. I am sure that that information will give great satisfaction to the women senators.

I cannot deal with the matter until I know the precise terms of the proposal. However, I can assure the honorable senator that this Government's policy always has been to assist the needy people in the community. That matter is always in the forefront of the Government's mind. This Government's policy has never been to try to bridge the gap between payments from medical funds and the cost of medical treatment. The Commonwealth has no authority over the medical profession. Doctors come under the jurisdiction of the States. I assure the Senate that if the Commonwealth ever attempted to bridge the gap between doctors' fees and payments made by medical funds, the taxpayers would be called upon to carry an intolerable burden. </para>

I understand that until the very great obstacle of high costs is reduced, colour television will not be considered seriously in Australia.

Will the Minister inquire into the reason for the discrepancy in payments made by these funds for the services of physiotherapists and doctors? There is a very big gap between the amounts paid for a doctor's services and the amounts paid for the services of a physiotherapist. Will the Government endeavour to have increased payments made to sufferers who have recourse to physiotherapists? At the present time those payments are very low compared with the payments made in respect of a doctor's services. </para>

                        <para>- I can only repeat in different language what I said a few minutes ago. This Government's view has been and always will be that the members of the medical profession - indeed, of any profession - shall have the right to fix their own fees. That is one of the basic principles of private enterprise and one on which this Government stands very firmly. For that reason there well may be a gap between the contribution that we make to the patient and the amount charged by the doctor or the physiotherapist. I make the point that under the system adopted by this Government room exists always for negotiation. Much can be done by the Government and the professional people concerned in negotiating a common policy for the benefit of the people concerned. </para>

                        <para>- I ask a question of the Acting Minister for Trade. I refer to an announcement made by the Minister only yesterday of the recent opening of two sub-offices of the Australian Trade Commissioner Service in America. I refer particularly to the office established in Los Angeles and referred to earlier by Senator Wedgwood. The office is staffed by one person - Mrs. Beryl Wilson. She is an Australian living in the United States of America. She has the official status of Australian Marketing Officer. Recently I made a courtesy visit to her office and in the course of my inquiries she informed me that during the first six weeks that her office was open she received 79 inquiries from prospective migrants. In addition, she received many inquiries from television engineers and personnel who expressed a desire to come to Australia rather than to emigrate to Europe or South America. Will the Minister confer with the Minister for External Affairs or the Minister for Immigration to see whether it is possible to extend our activities in the United States of America in order to take advantage of this golden opportunity to add desirable citizens to our population? </para>

It is interesting to hear that she has had a number of inquiries about emigration to Australia. I do not know what the position is in the United States so far as our Department of Immigration is concerned but I will be happy to bring Senator Wardlaw's comments to the notice of the Minister for Immigration and ask him to give some consideration to them. </para>

My question relates to the appointment of Miss Cynthia Nelson to a very high diplomatic post abroad but at a salary less than would be paid if the position had been filled by a male. Will the Minister confer with the Acting Minister for Trade to see whether the same satisfactory result may be achieved with regard to Miss Nelson as was achieved with regard to the appointment of Mrs. Wilson?</para>

                        <para>-  The treaty obligations with regard to access to Berlin by the Western powers are, in the opinion of the Western powers and, I think of all impartial observers, because no other interpretation can be placed on the wording of the treaty, that the Western powers shall have free and unimpeded access to the city of Berlin. Lately a number of attempts have been made by the Soviet Government to interfere with and impede access to Berlin via the air corridors. That interference first took the form of notification to the Western powers that certain areas and certain heights would be required for use by the Soviet air force and therefore should not be used by civil aircraft operated in and out of Berlin by the Western powers. That proposition by the Soviet Union was rejected by the Western powers. After that rejection there were instances of Soviet aircraft flying dangerously close to aircraft belonging to the Western powers and engaged in their lawful occupations. Lately, I understand, although I have not had confirmation of this fact, what was known in the last war as "window" - that is, aluminium foil strip - has been dropped in the corridors in an effort to interfere with navigational and safety aids. That action has been taken by the Soviet with callous disregard for the safety of persons using the air corridors. The Western powers maintain and will continue to maintain their rights of access over these corridors. </para>

                        <para>- My question is submitted to the Minister for National Development. It relates to planning by the respective States for the establishment of atomic reactors for industrial power. Will the Minister inform the Senate whether any of the States are at the moment planning for the use of atomic power, and can he give any information to the Senate about the future planning of the States in this matter? I assume that the policy is the same as has been announced many times by him - that this is a matter for State action. Also, will the Minister say how long it will take from the time planning commences until a reactor can be built in Australia for industrial purposes? Would the Minister like to comment upon the possibility that within, say, the next ten or fifteen years the production of power from the atom could be cheaper than thermal power in Australia? Will the Minister also tell the Senate what encouragement and assistance are likely to be given by the Commonwealth to any of the States that are now prepared to plan for atomic power for industry? </para>

                        <para>- This is quite a comprehensive question but I shall do my best to answer it in short terms. The first consideration is that the cost of atomic power should be competitive with that of other forms of power. The present indications are that the cost curves will meet in 1968, 1969 or 1970. Great Britain has committed itself to a programme for the production of, I think, 5,000 megawatts by nuclear power stations by the end of 1968, in the belief that at that time the costs will be competitive. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>One cannot answer this question in general terms. The circumstances vary from place to place. The circumstances in New South Wales, which has very large coal deposits that are quickly won, are very different from those in other States. The great need in Australia is the evolution of a small reactor of from 20,000 to 30,000- kilowatt capacity which could be used in outlying areas for mining and other activities. </para>
                    <para>I do not think I can say more than that. The problem is constantly under consideration. As Senator Vincent knows, we have quite a large establishment at Lucas Heights which is engaged in research into the production of a small reactor such as I have mentioned for Australian purposes. It is expected that this research programme will be completed in 1964 or 1965, and then we will consider the next stage to be undertaken. I should think that the period from the time a reactor plan is put on the drawing board until the reactor is actually built and comes into operation is about five years. </para>

                            <para>As the honorable senator will appreciate, I cannot disclose the detailed information of a confidential nature that the British Government has been conveying to the Australian Government. I can say, however, that the negotiations, which have been proceeding in Brussels since last October, have concentrated up to the present on an examination and an exchange of views between the participants, on the issues involved. Because of the complexity of the issues, this necessarily takes  a  good deal of time. The negotiations are now expected to proceed at a faster tempo. </para>
                            <para>As honorable senators will be aware from statements made both by British and Australian Ministers, the British Government fully shares the concern of the Australian Government to maintain the long-established flow of trade between their two countries. It is the intention of Britain in its negotiations to secure special arrangements to protect these important trading interests. </para>
                            <para>This Government is concerned that not only the British Government but also the governments of the Six Community countries and the United States Government should be made fully aware of Australia's interest in the negotiations which Britain is conducting. This is a principal purpose of the talks that the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade will be having in North America and Britain and Europe during the next few weeks. </para>
                            <para>The honorable senator's second question was whether a decision had been made on whether the Australian Minister for Trade will be given access to the conference table. That is not what the Australian Government has sought. We do not and cannot claim to take a full part in the negotiations. The status which Australia seeks, and which Britain supports, is one that would give Australian representatives an appropriate basis - for example, in certain committees and working parties - to speak on matters that bear directly on Australian trade interests that stand to be affected. </para>
                            <para>The request that Britain put forward on our behalf has been discussed at a meeting of Ministers of Britain and the Six. No decision has been taken. The matter is to be considered further at  a  similar meeting later this month. In the meantime the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade will be talking on this matter wilh British Ministers. </para>

Previously this authority has been vested only in the Excise Regulations. The validity of the regulations is questionable and, to remove any doubts, it is proposed to include an appropriate section in the Excise Act. </para>
                    <para>Regulations to be promulgated under the proposed new section 78 will cover the procedures and conditions which will apply. In general these will be on similar lines to the existing Excise Regulations with the exception that special provision will be made to cover refunds on  manufactured  tobacco products. So far as tobacco products are concerned it is proposed to provide in the regulations for refund of the excise duty paid on manufactured products that are returned to factories for treatment or  remanufacture,  because of deterioration after delivery from customs control. Because of this latter proposal sections 73 and 74 (and related regulations') will be redundant and they are being repealed. </para>

The reasons given are not adequate. One objection - we hear it repeated ad nauseamis that this committee is merely a study group. If that were true, that would be a reason for joining and not for abstaining from joining. </para>

                <para>Some members of the Opposition ma think that they have sufficient knowledge of foreign affairs to make it unnecessary for them to join such a study group. I have been reading seriously on foreign affairs ever since I could read. To-day I read the newspapers and reviews and follow the foreign politics of many countries, but I have not sufficient knowledge to dispense with the support that I find in the committee. If this committee is really a study group, that is a reason for joining the committee and not for abstaining from joining it, because the information that is given is of such value that every honorable senator would benefit by having it. </para>

                        <para>- Some one once said that there is no bad beer; there is simply some beer that is better than other beer. Some knowledge is more useful than other knowledge. It shows a complete misunderstanding of the terms of appointment of the committee to say that its members are not allowed to use the information they obtain. They are not allowed to inform people how they obtain the information. There are certain confidential matters that they are asked not mention at all. I can remember one confidential piece of information which I obtained ten years ago and of which I have never spoken to anybody at all. But in the general give-and-take in the debates that take place - frequently debates do take place - everybody's knowledge is increased and everybody's capacity to understand foreign affairs is augmented. </para>

                <para>It is not true to say that the committee has no influence. Since I cannot say what confidential knowledge we have obtained in the committee, I cannot give the Senate proof of this statement; but it is a fact that the committee has had an effect and an impact on policy. That is a fact that every person who has been on the committee for any considerable time knows. I was a member of the first committee; I was not a member for three years; and I am a member now. </para>
                <para>It is important that we obtain a bilateral foreign policy. There should be a certain uniformity of Australian opinion, perhaps not in every respect, but in matters on which we have to negotiate with other powers. Recently I had the opportunity to talk about our policy to a good many people in the United States of America. Some of them were people with power and influence. They said to me, quite rightly, " We would like to see from your country a uniform voice on this matter or that matter." There is no such thing, and there never has been. Of course, the point is that we had no real foreign policy- </para>

                        <para>- It is a good thing to have a uniform and correct policy. That can be obtained only by the free exchange of views. If a man is so sufficient in his opinions that he will not condescend to argue, he will never condescend to compromise. There can be no foreign policy without that. It may be very good for the electoral success of people such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hendrickson</inline> and it may be good for the electoral success of one party or the other, but it is no good for the Commonwealth of Australia that it should speak with a divided voice in foreign countries. Nothing is more important at this moment than that we should speak with one voice to the United States of America. I am not saying that there is a monopoly of wisdom or knowledge on this side of the chamber. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to say, if I may be allowed to finish the sentence, that in the Labour Party there have been and still are men who have given good service in presenting the Australian viewpoint. Among those men I include my friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Norman</inline> Makin, who, as Australian Ambassador in Washington, presented the case for Australia in the highest quarters in a very convincing way. I obtained that information in the United States of America when talking to an ex-senator. I was told that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Makin</inline> was held in very high regard by the congressional leaders and the  President  himself. It is essential that we should have a foreign policy which is the foreign policy of Australia and not of any political party. I can only give my own opinion - and it is an opinion based on knowledge, not on prejudice that if the members of the Opposition were to serve on the Foreign Affairs Committee the value of that committee would be greatly increased and its influence on opinion and policy would be what it ought to be. </para>

                            <para>- I rise to take the opposite view and to oppose the motion on behalf of the Opposition, That will not surprise the Senate because I have had that duty to discharge on a number of occasions, particularly in 1956, when the matter was thoroughly canvassed. In February of that year I placed on record every view that the Opposition held on this matter, and I stated at length our reasons for those views. In 1959, on 26th February, which was the last occasion that the matter was before us, 1 again addressed my mind to it. 1 incorporated in " Hansard " what I had said in 1956 and really only summarized the view of the Opposition on that occasion. I do not see any reason to recant anything that I said on both those previous occasions. The attitude of the Opposition has not varied throughout the intervening period. </para>

                        indicated that he thought there was at least virtue in knowledge and that knowledge could be gathered from the deliberations of a committee, even if it functioned only at the level of a study group. That is true. I agree that knowledge is power. I acknowledge that there is virtue in discussion. I merely put the view that, vis-st-vis this particular committee, our own party committee which is concerned with the subject of external affairs is just as meritorious and certainly not as expensive, because the members of our committee devote their time and energies to their task on behalf of the party without any particular emolument and without any particular facilities. So, the advantages of a study group are immediately available to the Australian Labour Party, and it does not feel at any disadvantage in not having the facilities of the Foreign Affairs Committee available to it.

I can summarize the attitude of the Australian Labour Party by saying that this is not a true joint committee of the Parliament at all because it has no right to report to the Parliament unless the appropriate Minister consents, and it may do so then only if its report is concerned with a subject matter that the Minister has referred to it. We heard the  President  read out all the conditions governing the functions of the committee. </para>

                            <para>- I say to the honorable senator that we are canvassing a motion which includes the conditions I have mentioned. We are considering a resolution to that effect, and we are to say " Yes " or "No" to it. </para>

                    <para>If there is to be a change, let us know about it quickly so that we may make up our minds on it. But we are certainly not going to regard the committee as a proper parliamentary joint committee, when it has no right to report to the Parliament except with the consent of the Minister. Again, it is not a type of committee on which the Australian Labour Party could be represented, because the moment representatives of our party were appointed to it they would become prisoners of the committee in the terms of the motion before the Senate. They would have to sit in secret and keep as secret the information that was conveyed to them. They would not be free to communicate to their party their knowledge, the contents of documents that were before them, or the particulars of evidence given to them. Therefore, the moment they joined the committee they would cease to function as representatives of the party and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hendrickson</inline> reminds me, of the people we represent. </para>
                    <para>Having been inveigled on to the committee, they would be immediately muzzled. They would not be free to convey to the people they represented the information they received. Surely those two factors - the lack of the right to report to the Parliament, and the inability to convey information to the people that we are supposed to represent - would make a farce of our participation. The two factors that I have mentioned reduce the committee to a study group, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McCallum</inline> said. </para>

But here where is the qualification in relation to that type of situation? The whole thing is completely in the hands of the Minister. The committee has no real power of its own. In the view that the Opposition takes, it just comes down to being a useful study group. We are quite content to pursue our own studies. If your opinion is formulated and moulded by a witness or written evidence it is very important to the acceptance of your viewpoint that you indicate the source! upon which you base your opinion or belief. </para>

I have stated, perhaps in some more details, our objections, perhaps in some more detail, our objections. We voiced them in discussions with a private conferences with him. I repeat what I have said on many occasion - that I was most anxious to have our party join a committee of this type if we could get the right conditions. We stated them again and again to the Minister. We thought from time to time that we had made some progress with him; but we are left in the position indicated in the motion. I merely say that those terms are quite unacceptable to the Opposition. </para>

                        <para>. -  I have a few brief observations to make following the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna).</inline> The honorable senator commenced by saying that he felt it was his duty to discharge his obligation to explain the views of the Opposition. I appreciate the way in which he put them, because I sometimes feel that the heart of the Leader of the Opposition is not in what he says. In those few words to which I have referred I think he conveyed completely to us on this side of the chamber the fact that he did not like this idea very much himself. </para>

                            <para>- I suggest that the Leader of the Opposition regarded it as his duty to say what he said. I place it no higher than that. In the circumstances, it was a difficult duty, because I suggest that what he said was not the true view of a great many people in the Labour movement. The honorable senator omitted to explain the real reason why the Australian Labour Party will not join this committee. There is a very obvious and palpable reason why it will not do so. It is this: As a party, it is controlled and managed by an outside authority. </para>

                            <para>- There is the rub. There is the reason. That is something which the Opposition does not like very much, but it is true. The Opposition is responsible to and is governed by a body higher than itself, to which it must answer. In those circumstances, how can an opposition join a committee which conducts its affairs in secret? It cannot do so. I suggest that the Leader of the Opposition should have been a little more frank about this and should have explained to the Senate that it is in a dilemma in this case because it cannot afford to join a body and debate or discuss something which is not available to its own masters. Unfortunately, that is the main reason why the Labour movement cannot come in on this committee. </para>

                    <para>I repeat that that is the reason, but let us consider the excuses - they are not reasons - for the Leader of Opposition taking the stand that the Opposition could not join this committee. Aided by interjections from our mutual friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hendrickson, Senator McKenna</inline> uttered a lot of nonsense about the idea that this committee was only a study group. How can any member of the Opposition make any assessment of what this committee does or what its effect is when Opposition members have never sat on it? Any such assessment is pure surmise. </para>

In those six years I have gleaned a little idea of what does happen inside the doors of the committee .room. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hendrickson</inline> has never been inside those doors during those six years, yet he poses as the authority on what the committee does. That being so, are we not getting down to rather childish elements in this debate? Opposition members cannot say what happens inside those doors, because they have never been inside. </para>

                    <para>I repeat that this committee is not a study group. Any member of the committee starts off by learning something. Do not tell me that we all cannot learn something. This committee exercises a considerable influence in this country and on the Government, and very properly so. If the Labour Party could alter its policy, cut adrift from its own masters, become a true political party responsible to itself, and join the Foreign Affairs Committee, the committee would be even better than it is. It could be improved by having members of the Opposition included in its membership; we admit that. I express great regret at the fact that, because of this rigid midVictorian idea of party organization, this aged, conservative party still flounders and is unable to take part in the activities of such an important committee. This committee cannot act otherwise than behind closed doors, as everybody in the Opposition knows. Will the Leader of the Opposition say that when he was a Minister of the Crown he informed other members of his party or outside interests of what took place behind the doors of the Cabinet room? </para>
                    <para class="block">Would he suggest that that happened? Of course, he would not. Would he say that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt,</inline> when Minister for External Affairs - and a very competent one, too, at times - could not very well carry out his obligations as Minister because, having taken an oath of secrecy, he could not inform other people of what had taken place inside his own office? Why do the members of the Opposition come along  with the feeble argument that the principles they applied when in office cannot apply in this case? </para>
                    <para>In matters of external affairs, there has to be a degree of secrecy. An oath of secrecy has to be taken by members of this committee. Members of the Opposition are fully aware that some matters of high national import cannot be discussed openly, as can other political matters. That is why it is so essential that this committee should work behind closed doors. It would be a mockery of a foreign affairs committee if it did not do so. It could not discuss important national questions without this degree of secrecy. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The Leader of the Opposition has said that the Opposition had its own study group, which does just as good a job. That epitomizes the ideas of the Labour movement. It cannot get away from its own party, or from the direction of its masters. Even at the international level, it must obey. It is ironical and regrettable that this is so. In every other country the left-wing Labour movement, or what passes for it, has broken away from the mid-Victorian tradition of being answerable to some other authority. In Great Britain, foreign affairs are discussed behind closed doors by the members of all parties, who take an oath of secrecy. The members of the Opposition come up with this cock and bull story that they have their own party committee, which does work that is just as good as that done by the Foreign Affairs Committee. That is a lot of nonsense. </para>

                    <para>On these national questions we should have the benefit of the informed views of every party. How can this committee work without being given information of a secret nature? As a member of the committee I have had many documents marked not only " confidential " but also " secret ", the contents of which I cannot disclose. It is obvious that members of the parliamentary committee of the Labour movement do not have access to those. It is unfortunate that they cannot have such access. If they had, they would be better informed on foreign affairs. It is nonsense to say that a parliamentary party committee can inform itself fully on such matters, without proper information. If that is one of the arguments that the Labour Opposition is using, it is a pretty poor one. </para>
                    <para>Finally, I want to refer to a matter mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKellar</inline> - that is, the importance of the political parties in this country having some common ground on international affairs. It is time that we in this country grew up. A great deal of harm is being done by the Labour movement in keeping apart from the three other parties - the Liberal Party, the Country Party and the Democratic Labour Party - on matters of international importance. For example, it is obvious that there could have been a common policy, with basic principles - perhaps we could have differed in detail - in relation to New Guinea. History will show how much harm has been done to Australia by some unfortunate utterances of the Leader of the Opposition in another place. He made some unfortunate and ill-informed utterances which, I suggest, would never have been made if members of the Labour movement had been on this joint committee. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hendrickson</inline> is interrupting all the time. He has been overseas as a member of a joint delegation on matters relating to international affairs. I am informed to his credit, that when he was overseas he spoke as with one voice with his colleagues on this side of the chamber, and with considerable distinction. Why could he not do that in Australia? We find that at any time when members of the Opposition go overseas with Government supporters to represent this country at meetings such as those of the Inter-Parliamentary Union and the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, they become part of a team, and the team speaks with one voice. Why, in the name of all that is sane, is that not done inside Australia in relation to international affairs, when men like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hendrickson</inline> can do it overseas? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hendrickson</inline> is a little critical of us to-day, in his usual way, but overseas he spoke as a member of a team, which hammered out a joint policy. I suggest that it is time the Labour Party abandoned its mid-Victorian ideas and did something about this. For too long we have been playing with these very serious matters. Perhaps we have not had enough experience; perhaps the Labour movement has not had enough experience. Perhaps we have not had the responsibility for our external affairs for long enough to learn, as we must learn eventually, to speak with a common voice on matters of high principle. </para>

                            <para>- When the sitting was suspended I was replying to some of the points made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> with regard to the Opposition's attitude to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. It is stretching the imagination somewhat to refer to this committee as a joint committee. Traditionally a joint committee is one comprising members of both parties in both Houses A joint committee has parliamentary authority to subpoena witnesses, to expend money in travelling expenses and even to pay witnesses' expenses if necessary. It is a parliamentary institution. The vital element in a joint committee is that it be fully representative of both sides of both Houses. I contend that when a committee does not represent both sides of the Parliament, it has no authority to function. </para>

                    <para>One of this committee's greatest sins is that it has failed to achieve any worthwhile purpose. A joint committee of the Parliament should be able to keep the Parliament informed of what is happening. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKellar</inline> said yesterday, the primary producers of Australia are bewildered and confused by the Government's banking policy. Well, the entire population is confused and bewildered by the Government's foreign policy. Members of the committee have done nothing to inform the Parliament on foreign affairs matters for the simple reason that important matters are not discussed by the committee. During the life of this committee Australia's foreign relations have deteriorated consistently and progressively. The methods adopted to solve many of our international problems should be made known to the people. The Government's attitude towards <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Verwoerd's</inline> policy in South Africa reflected not the views of the Australian people but perhaps those of the select few members of the Foreign Affairs Committee who were briefed on this subject. People may gain the impression that tried, trusted and intelligent men are selected by the Government for membership of the Foreign Affairs Committee so that they may be spokesmen for the Government within their party and, if necessary, in other places. But it is impossible for the ordinary man to comprehend what is the Government's policy in relation to foreign affairs. The Government blows hot and cold on its foreign affairs policy. Its policy is a stop-and-go policy. The present situation in West New Guinea may be attributed directly to the activities of our Foreign Affairs Committee. The views of the committee are not those of the Australian people. The Indonesian problem that been allowed to get out of hand. Over the years the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Government have supported the Dutch; but in more recent times they have not given the Indonesians or the Dutch any hint of the direction in which we were going. In our own long-term interests we should have taken the initiative and supported the Dutch when they sought to have the administration of West New Guinea taken over by the United Nations. From our point of view that would have been a most satisfactory solution. </para>

But I do not think they have set their sights in the right direction. I do not think their views represent those of the Australian people. The Australian people do not know what goes on in the committee because all meetings are held in camera. The committee has some of the qualities of the Ku-Klux-Klan when we see that under the terms of the motion -   the Minister for External Affairs shall make available to the committee information within such categories or on such conditions as he may consider desirable. </para>

I have had a lot of experience on committees and know what an advantage it is for both sides of both Houses to I look upon my colleagues on the Government and welfare of this Commonwealth. 1 know what good results can be achieved. ] look upon my colleagues on the Government side who have served on various committees of which 1 have been a member, such as the Public Works Committee, with the greatest of admiration and respect because of their attitude to positive matters. ] have seen the unity of purpose that can be achieved and the value of it. But they are positive things. Then we come to the field of the abstract, where there are human differences because of the lack of understanding of meanings and of where we are going. Just take the contentious words that we use every day, such as " freedom ", " liberty ", and " democracy ". Any statement made on foreign affairs is crammed full of these abstracts. They are on the level of the airy-fairy. No one ever gets down to tin tacks and says what we mean or where we are going. Yet to-day the Government's foreign affairs policy is going along the lines that lead to the final impact between two of the greatest forces that the world has ever known - the United States of America and the Soviet Union. That is a nihilism. It is going towards an inevitable clash, and it is utter, crass stupidity for any government to take a negative line. Yet, the line-up to-day is all in the direction of that ultimate crash. I believe that men of goodwill, Christian men, should be working towards the great principle of Christianity - peace on earth, good will toward men - in terra pax hominibus bonae voluntatis. </para>

                            <para>-  It means, in simple language, the Australian Labour Party's policy: Peace on earth, good will toward men. I put it to honorable senators that a foregin affairs committee could have a most important function in our Parliament. I am all in favour of joint committees that assist in the government and administration of this country, not in any superauthoritative way, but as co-operators in the government. That is the principle of democracy - bringing the people and their representatives to participate in the government of their own country; government of the people, by the people, and for the people. Yet here we have a Cabinet that is suprademocratic or supra-parliamentary, which meets in conclave a«d makes its own decisions. It asks the people for a blank cheque at election time, and it indiscriminately writes out its own cheques. As a further buffer, it wants to set up committees like this, which are completely circumscribed by ministerial discretion. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> was speaking he implied, by one of these subtle and insinuating references, that the Labour Party is not answerable to the people and that we are governed by an outside body. </para>

                            <para>- That is a point which I want to take up with the honorable senator. We are not answerable to any international body. We are Australians by birth, we are Australians in purpose, and Australia's destiny is our main interest. This implication that we have connexions with international bodies is beneath contempt, You speak about outside bodies, yet you know in your own heart, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent,</inline> that your Liberal Party organization has copied our procedure and our practice of party organization in every particular. Your colleagues saw it so effective in the organization of another political party when yours had nothing. When your colleagues were in the political wilderness they had no political organization and found that the only way to win an election was to go to the people, to form branches, to get the youth of the country behind them. They had to get all the instrumentalities, including men's and women's organizations sympathetic te them, gradually extending the carrot in front of them on the end of a stick. But it has taken them only a short time to catch up with you. You can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time. They are catching up with you now. So, when you speak about an outside body, you should turn your conscience within. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Philip</inline> McBride - I have the greatest admiration for his intelligence, standing and Australianism - is virtually the unpaid governing director of the Liberal Party, and his close associates outside the political sphere have influence over the members of this Parliament who sit on the Government side which is equal to if not greater than any influence that is held over members on this side. </para>

                        knows also that in any organization there must be discipline, whether it is the home or the community. The party that he supports has its discipline, because I understand that it was even able, through the party and through its caucus, to prevent a humble Opposition senator from obtaining leave to make a statement. There can be a very close vote on it, but the forms of the Parliament can be completely by-passed by pressures that are not applied from the Senate itself but come from an outside body composed of other people from another place, which I shall not mention in this austere and august chamber.
                    </para>
                    <para>However, I must get back to the debate again. We cannot participate in the activities of this committee. We cannot afford the risk of public condemnation by associating ourselves with and placing our imprimatur on the activities of this committee while it is completely circumscribed by the discretion of the Minister. We do not know which Minister it is. We do not know whether it may be the Right Honorable Lord Casey, whether it may be the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> the next day, or whether it may be <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> Barwick the next day, each one of them with different approaches to foreign affairs. For instance, Lord Casey was influenced by what was known as the Poona psychology - " Put a whiff of grapeshot into the rabble, and back to the residency for tiffin, old boy? " He had the mid-Victorian idea of running the native peoples. Yet on the other hand, when the Prime Minister was Minister for External Affairs. he was too busy, because his essay into foreign affairs at Suez was suez-cide to him politically as a foreign affairs minister. He made a Nasser himself on another occasion, and then had to give up the ghost. </para>

                        <para>. -  I rise to express my surprise at, and my absolute disapproval of, the excuses - not reasons - given by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> for the action of the Opposition in not joining the Foreign Affairs Committee. I feel that the excuses he made indicate a distinct lack of interest in national affairs on the part of the Opposition and, what is perhaps much more serious, a distinct lack of interest in international affairs. We are living at a time when both national and international affairs are of primary importance. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I want to deal with only two of the excuses that the Leader of the Opposition mentioned. He stated - it was not completely true, but true only in part - that the Foreign Affairs Committee, as it has been constituted for some years, has been only a study group. If that is so, it was rather sad to hear a confession by the Leader of the Opposition that honorable senators opposite do not wish to be educated on national and international affairs. </para>
                    <para>The other excuse given was that the Opposition had a foreign affairs committee of its own. It would be interesting for us on this side of the chamber to know whether that foreign affairs committee sits behind closed doors and whether any of its conclusions are published anywhere or are ever quoted by members of the Opposition. </para>
                    <para class="block">It would be interesting also to know whether the damaging statement that was made publicly by the Leader of the Opposition in another- place on New -Guinea was inspired by the Opposition's foreign affairs committee.- Or was the statement merely a venomous attack on the present Government in an attempt to complicate international matters? </para>
                    <para>In the light of what has been stated, the Opposition might like to answer some questions. First, has it a foreign policy at all? Secondly-, if it has, when can we expect to hear the substance of that foreign policy? </para>

I should like to pay a tribute to the members of the committee, and particularly to the  chairman  whom we have had for so long, for the wonderful work that has been done in the interests of international understanding. I deplore exceedingly the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne,</inline> and also the attitude that the Opposition is adopting at this time of great international stress. It will not join this committee, which could help in presenting a united front by this very important country, of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- My interpretation of the word " Communist ", as it is used to-day, is that it relates to those people who took over the control of Russia and committed atrocities in 1917. I venture to say, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that nobody can truthfully say that similar incidents occurred in mainland China. People like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannan</inline> say that we would' not recognize mainland China, but when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Philip</inline> McBride says, " Be quiet, son ", they do as they are told and they do recognize mainland China. We are very fortunate to have a market in mainland China, but let me get back to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent's</inline> statement on the matter under discussion. </para>

                            <para>- Tell me when. There is no honorable senator in this chamber who can say that I have ever deviated from the platform and the policy of the great Australian Labour Party. But I venture to say that I could point the finger at many honorable senators on the Government side of the chamber. Let me get back to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent's</inline> statement. He said that our attitude to the suggestion is dictated to us by outside powers or foreign interests. The caucus of the Australian Labour Party is constituted by men who are selected by the rank and file of the Australian Labour movement to represent them in this and the other House of Parliament. We make up our own minds on whether we will accept the invitation of the Government to join this committee. </para>

                    <para>I am very anxious that some organization should be set up to help us in the defence of this great country. When I was a delegate to the United Nations General Assembly I went to the trouble of finding out why the Minister for External Affairs should have such dictatorial powers as to be able to direct that nothing submitted to the committee could be divulged to the parties represented on that committee. An eminent man from the Department of External Affairs told me that the members could report to their parties on the activities of that committee. I now find that the terms of appointment emphasize that the committee and its subcommittees will sit in camera and their proceedings shall be secret. </para>

The point I am making is that I was making inquiries and investigating every avenue by which we could take part in a committee such as this, which would be in the interests of the defence of Australia. I made inquiries from people who I thought would know, but evidently they did not know because they told me that I or a member of my party could be a member of that committee and report to our caucus on the proceedings of the committee. However, that is forbidden. </para>

The exhibitions of the Prime Minister at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' conference and the United Nations General Assembly were also disgraceful. At the General Assembly the present Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Garfield Barwick)</inline> had his speech prepared and delivered to the capitalist press of the United States of America when he received a telephone call from the Prime Minister to this effect: " Don't you say a word. I will be there." The Prime Minister flew to the United States and stopped the present Minister for External Affairs, who was then only Attorney-General, from making his statement. The statement had to be withdrawn from the press. What happened when the learned gentleman, who had been told all the facts and what should be done in the interests of this country by the Foreign Affairs committee, made his speech in the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York? What was the result? </para>

                            <para>- Remember that when those boys went to the islands in 1942 our party had been in government for only about five minutes. We had to send them and all that we had to send with them were broomsticks and some rifles, but they had no ammunition to put in the rifles. I agree with that. That is why we are worried about what we are being asked to do, namely, to join this fascist organization that has been set up by the Government under the dictatorship of the Fuehrer, the Minister for External Affairs. </para>

                            <para>- All right, I will withdraw it. I was saying that he was a leader using tactics similar to those used by a person who was called " The Fuehrer " in the 1930's. He has a committee to camouflage from the people of Australia the fact that the Government has no idea of defending Australia. The Government is not genuine in its defence policy. There is no sincerity in this Government, lt is not concerned with defending Australia any more than were governments of the same political colour in the 1930's and at the outbreak of the Second World War. </para>

                    <para>We would be happy to join any committee that would obtain information to help to defend this country. But what is the good of gaining knowledge if you cannot let somebody else learn from the knowledge that you have gained? What is the good of all the knowledge that the people on the Foreign Affairs Committee gain? What is the use of it to the defence of this country? Who knows what is in their minds? Do we believe that they are organizing ways and means, under the guidance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannan,</inline> of having submarines to torpedo the ships taking Australian wheat to mainland China? Is that in their policy? I dare say that it may be. </para>

Whatever we may think of one another, we are the trusted representatives of the people of Australia. If there is anything secret that we should know, the Parliament can be assembled in secret conference. When that happens, every member is on his honour not to divulge what is discussed. You cannot have eight or ten men meeting and deciding on most important issues, and then having the boss cocky, the Minister for External Affairs, saying that the matters discussed shall not be divulged. We will not accept that. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, it is quite true that that is important. If there was anything disturbing the minds of the members of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and if it were desirable to bring the matter before the Parliament so that something might be done about it, then the Parliament could be called into secret session and information about the matter given to it. But what does the Prime Minister want to do? He sees failure right in front of him. He has seen it there ever since 1949, because the bosses that control him are the real bosses overseas to-day. He has seen disaster there. </para>

                    <para>When this Government gives us an opportunity to do so, we will take an active part in any committee that is serving the defence interests of this country, but we are not prepared to take part in an organization which is going to be a fill-in, or a cover-up, for people who were unable to defend Australia. We are prepared to co-operate at any time with any committee that can function as a committee should and which is able to bring important questions before the Parliament, whether in public session or in secret session; but we are not prepared to accept the conditions embodied in the dictatorial motion which has been proposed by the Leader of the Government in the Senate to-day. I wholeheartedly support the case that was so ably put by my leader, and later by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne.</inline></para>

                        <para>.- I rather regret the tone which has developed in this debate. After all, the discussion is concerned with a simple motion of the re-appointment of the joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. I should think that events that happened at Suez, in the First World War and in the Second World War, were beyond the range of the motion. We should forget past struggles and party differences where international affairs are concerned and apply ourselves in a spirit of goodwill and unity of purpose to the solution of the great problems which beset this troubled world to-day. There are big problems which invite the earnest consideration of every member of this Senate, of the Parliament at large, and also of the members of the Foreign Affairs Committee. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Some of those problems are known to all honorable senators, but I shall recount them to refresh our minds. Instead of worrying about our political differences in the past we should be meeting together to try to solve them, or to make some contribution to their solution. There are the problems of nuclear tests, disarmament, neo-colonialism, captive nations, subversion and wars in South-East Asia and, above all, the development of atomic missiles, weapons and vehicles of war which could de-fertilize large regions of the earth and destroy millions of human beings. They are the great problems to which every thoughtful Australian should apply himself at this stage of history. Ample scope is provided in the discussions of the Foreign Affairs Committee for a consideration of these matters. Only a limited number of excellent men can be elected to the committee, but good men from both sides of the Senate elected to the committee could apply themselves to these matters and perhaps come up with an idea that would be helpful in promoting goodwill and in trying to avoid the commotions which incite so many races of people to-day. </para>
                    <para>I say proudly that I was a foundation member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. My colleagues have been good enough after each election to send me back to the committee. During my membership of it I have held the offices of  chairman  and  deputy chairman.  I forget which of those offices I occupied when the formation of a joint committee was first considered. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey,</inline> who is now Lord Casey, was then the Minister for External Affairs. At that time there were very interesting discussions, which almost succeeded, between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>
                    <para class="block">Gorton and myself, who represented the committee, and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Calwell,</inline> who is the present Leader of the Opposition in another place. We met in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey's</inline> office, and I can assure you that there were very animated discussions. I am pleased to be able to say that, although since then <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt</inline> has been condemned on so many counts, at that time he adopted a broad view and stood solidly for the appointment of a joint committee on foreign affairs. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt</inline> was experienced in that field. He had been the Minister for External Affairs in the Chifley Government, had travelled widely, and had been at the United Nations conference in San Francisco when the charter of the United Nations was first adopted. Therefore, his view had to be respected. </para>
                    <para>To my great regret, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Calwell</inline> led the forces within the Australian Labour Party which were hostile to the formation of a joint committee. We narrowed down the points of difference and, if I remember rightly, the matter was taken back to the Labour caucus by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Calwell</inline> at least three times before the door finally was slammed against those of us who were eager to see formed a joint committee on foreign affairs. Now, because there is not in the Labour Party a forceful character like <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt</inline> to promote the formation of a joint committee, it seems, to my very great regret, that we have got further apart than ever. </para>
                    <para>One of the points made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Calwell</inline> at the time was that the Labour Party objected to proceedings of the committee being held in secret. He said that the committee's deliberations should be open to members of the press and the public. He suggested that anybody who wished to do so should be able to come along and hear the proceedings. The committee took the view - I think it is widely shared by supporters of the Government - that it would be quite wrong for proceedings relating to foreign affairs, which touched upon delicate subjects and our relationships with foreign countries, to be brought out into the open. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Calwell</inline> said that the committee should be modelled on the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate of the United States of America. It is not for me to condemn the methods that are employed in a friendly country, but I would be horrified to think that we had  a  committee before which </para>
                    <para class="block">Army, Navy and Air Force chiefs could be summoned and questioned in public - grilled, one might say - about the strength and weaknesses of the armed forces. That would have been the effect of the proposal advocated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Calwell</inline> and those who now so strongly oppose the formation of a joint committee unless provision is made for publicity and for nothing to be withheld from the public. That was, and I think still is, the fundamental point of difference between the members of the committee and those who support the Government on the one hand, and members of the Opposition on the other hand. </para>
                    <para>Let me put to reasonable, thinking members of the Opposition how absurd the position would be. Perhaps a member of the committee could be approached by representatives of the enemies of our country and could be persuaded to ask embarrassing questions in public of service chiefs. That just will not go down. It is opposed to all British methods of dealing with matters of high international value. We would not surrender on that point. We did not want to have a committee which would be a publicity hunting ground for those who wanted to have their names printed in the press and have their photographs published, and those who made wild statements such as those which are made frequently in another place right here in Canberra. </para>
                    <para>It has been the custom of the committee to invite distinguished gentlemen from foreign countries to come before it and to address members on problems which affect their own countries and their relationships with contiguous or distantly separated countries, as the case may be. Is it likely that ambassadors or their nominees would come before a committee which made no provision for secrecy and submit themselves to a public examination during which they would have to state their views in the full glare of publicity, have their opinions broadcast throughout the world and get themselves into trouble with their own governments because of statements they might make under cross-examination? Such a procedure just would not work. I should not like to think that we would invite the ambassador for South Viet Nam or for Thailand to come before a committee without any provision being made for secrecy and with some member on the committee being free to divulge what the ambassador said. </para>

                            <para>- No - only those within the restricted circle, including the committee, the Minister and the Government. We must not forget that the final word on any matter relating to foreign affairs does not lie with the committee. The committee can express a view which may go to the highest place; but in the final analysis it is the Cabinet, the Government, which makes a determination on these matters of high policy. It is quite right that it should be so; I would not have it otherwise. We are in the position of wanting to hear the views of distinguished representatives of the governments of countries which may be in grave fear of attack by contiguous or nearby countries. Where is the diplomat who would be prepared to open up his heart to us, tell us what his Government expected and prepare us for what was likely to happen, if he thought that what he said could be divulged by some member of the committee? There must  be  secrecy in these matters. </para>

                            <para>- No, not at all.  We  discuss them. We often invite the Minister in to hear us, so that we may state our case to him. As may be seen from the motion, there is a form whereby we can make a statement to the Minister or to the Parliament in certain circumstances. These matters are handled much better away from publicity, because they must  be  handled delicately. I am fully in agreement with the methods adopted. If members of the Opposition were to join the committee and share with us the knowledge that we gain, much good could  be  done quietly through their party and ours. We would be much stronger in placing emphasis on a particular aspect and in stating the view  of  the committee,  having  studied all the information available and all the circumstances surrounding any particular matter. </para>

                    <para>In the committee, we look at the problems in all the hot spots throughout the world. Wherever in the world our minds rove, there are wars and threats of war. We try to get down to the cause of the turbulence, to find out what is happening and the reasons for it. We make ourselves well informed. The committee is certainly a study group. I went into the committee, one might say, without any knowledge at all of foreign affairs except what I had read in the newspapers. As I often read as I run, I had never applied myself with any particular purposefulness to a study of these matters. In the committee, being one of a group of individuals dedicated to the study of these problems, and hearing each man's point of view, after a year, two years or three years, one becomes very much better informed about world affairs. Since I joined the committee, I have noticed that every member has improved greatly in his grasp of these problems. Brilliant young fellows come into the committee and, having watched them for three, four or five years, I am satisfied that they are the material of which ministers for external affairs are made, and that they are qualifying themselves for office eventually by the acquisition of a great fund of knowledge of happenings of a turbulent character throughout the world. </para>
                    <para>This is a committee that should be encouraged. With the inevitable swing of the pendulum, sooner or later it will be the turn of the Opposition to take office. It is therefore highly important, in my judgment, that the men in opposition to-day who have a flair for foreign affairs should have a chance to join the committee, participate in its proceedings, and qualify themselves, by the knowledge that they gain, for the higher offices which involve the fate and future of our country. I should like to see the Opposition link up with us in this committee. This is a world of great uncertainty, and in the future we will face enormous problems. Populations are increasing all over the world. Pressures of every kind are upon us. We want our best men, to whichever party they belong, to stand together, to face these problems and to find some solutions. </para>
                    <para>The fears of the Opposition about joining this committee are not warranted. They would not have to identify themselves with the opinions of government supporters on the committee. It is a good thing to have a refreshing, opposing line of thought. Differences inside the committee could be hammered out. I remind honorable senators opposite, who have fears about associating with Government supporters on a committee of this kind, <inline font-style="italic">meeting</inline> behind closed doors, that there is an old saying to the effect that the worst never comes. They would gain much if they were to grasp the nettle and join with us in this committee so that Australia would have some chance of unity in its external policies. In view of the disturbed conditions that exist in the world to-day, that is important, I support the motion. </para>

                        <para>. - I had not intended to speak on this motion until I heard some Government supporters discoursing on it. This is a matter that should be viewed in perspective. It is a proposal to set up a joint committee on foreign affairs. As has been asked from this side of the chamber, what purpose would be served if the Australian Labour Party elected members to the committee, when anything that those members might find out from their association with Government members on the committee and from their investigations of foreign affairs, could not be divulged, even in our own party room when we might be discussing very important matters pertaining to foreign relations? According to the constitution of the committee, members of this party who participated would have to sit dumb in the party room, unable to reveal, perhaps, very important information obtained through the committee. </para>

                        <para class="block">The Committee or any sub-committee have power to adjourn from place to place and to sit during any recess or adjournment of the Parliament and during the sittings of either House of the Parliament. </para>
                        <para>The Committee and its sub-committees will sit in camera and their proceedings shall be secret unless the Minister at the request of the Committee otherwise directs. </para>

                    <para class="block">Even if the committee makes a request, power rests with the Minister to refuse to permit the committee to divulge anything that it desires to be divulged. The motion continues -   . . The Committee shall, for consideration of national security in all cases forward its reports to the Minister for External Affairs, but on every occasion when the Committee forwards a report to the Minister it shall inform the Parliament that it has so reported; except that in the case of matters not referred to it by the Minister for External Affairs, the Committee shall not submit a report to the Minister nor inform the Parliament accordingly without the Minister's consent. </para>
                    <para class="block">So the committee is absolutely useless as an effective body for dealing with foreign affairs. In the world in which we live today - a powder-keg world with difficulties everywhere, with conflicting ideologies and very little hope of getting agreement among heads of state - what purpose would be served if we were to join this committee? The purpose would be purely and simply to give an already dictatorial Minister information gleaned by the committee. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> claimed that the Australian Labour Party was dictated to by outside interests. That is to-day's funny story. If Little Audrey were here she would laugh and laugh. As has been pointed out before, the people who sit on the other side of this chamber are dictated to far more than are we who sit on this side. The federal  president  of the Liberal Party, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Philip</inline> McBride, forbade Liberal candidates to appear on television during the last election campaign. Some of the people who sit opposite and who thought they were photogenic would have rushed the opportunity to appear on television, but the order went out from the federal executive, through <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Philip</inline> McBride, that no Liberal candidate was to appear on television. Was that not a dictatorial act? Nothing like that has happened within the Labour Party. Its candidates were free to appear on television if they wanted to and they did in fact appear on the programme arranged by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. But although Liberal candidates were anxious to participate in that programme, they were not allowed to do so. </para>
                    <para>According to newspaper reports, the federal executive of the Liberal Party has, since the election, called Ministers of this Government before it. I do not know whether the Ministers called before the federal executive include the hill-billy Ministers in the Government, but at least the Liberal Party Ministers were called before the executive because of the terrific setback that the Government received on 9th December. Apparently Ministers were required or will be required to give an account of themselves. </para>
                    <para>On the subject of foreign policy, whenever red China is mentioned, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator "</inline> McCarthy " Hannan comes in hook, line and sinker.

The Hobart conference recommended that red China be admitted to the United Nations. Such a suggestion sends a shudder down the Hannan spine. Why should we oppose the entry of mainland China or red China - call it what you will - to the United Nations? </para>

                    <para>The admission of red China to the United Nations is a matter very pertinent to this debate because it is a debate concerning the formation of a Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. As far as I know, mainland China is a foreign country. If any reference to the admission of red China to the United Nations is irrelevant to this debate, then  I  do not know what I am talking about. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> has, by way of interjection, referred to the Hobart conference. The resolutions adopted by my party at the Hobart conference stand. The decisions taken at the Hobart conference with regard to foreign policy have proved to be correct. Honorable senators opposite should tread warily when they talk about foreign relations. At any time of crisis this Government has blundered badly as far as foreign relations are concerned. I cannot be upbraided for telling the truth no matter how often I tell it. Apparently honorable senators opposite need constant reminders of these facts. In 1941 the government of the day, which was supported by the parties that support the present Government, did not have a foreign policy. The Labour Party had to come to Australia's rescue. I hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mattner</inline> grumbling. </para>

I repeat what has already been said often, that the) Australian Labour Government under the late lohn Curtin, one of the greatest statesmen Australia has ever had, had been in power in this country for only a few months. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mattner</inline> that not only the equipment but also the general provisions for the troops were in a very bad state at that time, duc wholly and solely to the inaction of the Menzies' Liberal Government over two years of warfare to which this country had been subjected. I think it called itself a Liberal government then. </para>

                            <para>- They might have called themselves members of the United Australia Party or Nationalists. The Right Honorable Robert Gordon Menzies was Prime Minister of this country at the outbreak of war. He is such an egotist that he always uses the first person. It has always registered very clearly in my mind that on Sunday evening, 3rd September, 1939, I was listening to my radio in Melbourne when the Right Honorable Robert Gordon Menzies came on the air and said, " I am your Prime Minister ", and went on to tell us that we were_ at war with Germany. He was Prime Minister from then until 1941, when, as every one knows, because he had lost the confidence of his own party and was unable to carry on, it devolved upon the Labour Party under the leadership of John Curtin to take over. It is history that the Australian war effort under Labour administration not only was one of the greatest in the world but it also earned the admiration of every other country. No one can deny that. Therefore, when you little <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Echoes</inline> over there talk about foreign policy you need to take your minds back to periods of crisis and realize that on each and every occasion of crisis in this country you people, whatever name you masqueraded under at the time, have invariably failed Australia, as no doubt you would do again. </para>

                    <para>It was only when the last shot had been fired, when a very war-weary people were tired of economic controls which were absolutely essential in war-time, that members of the Liberal Party and Country Party were able to climb on the bandwagon and win an election with a lot of spurious promises that they never intended to keep, could not keep, and never have kept. They came into power in 1949. As has been pointed out by other honorable senators from this side, it is absolutely futile for members of the Labour Party to associate themselves with this Foreign Affairs Committee. Any information that members of the committee gather cannot be divulged without the express consent of the Minister for External Affairs, whoever he may be at the time. We do not know much about the capacity of the present Minister for External Affairs in this sphere, because he has had that portfolio for only a short time, but we do know the tragic mess that his predecessor made in that position. There is no need to rehash the tragic failures of the present Prime Minister in the field of foreign affairs, when he held the portfolios of Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs. We know what happened at Suez and in the United Nations' consideration of the South African apartheid policy. All of the Prime Minister's statements overseas were quite obviously accepted by other countries as being the voice of Australia. It is absolutely necessary that we know that the correct opinions are being voiced by the responsible Minister, whoever he may be. </para>
                    <para>I do not intend to delay the Senate at any great length; the whole subject has been canvassed fairly extensively, but I must repeat what other honorable senators from this side have said, just to show that there is unanimity amongst us and that this is not the opinion of only one or two. We believe that there is nothing whatever to be gained from members of our party belonging to this Foreign Affairs Committee, when the committee is tied hand and foot and not allowed to express an opinion except with the express permission of the Minister for External Affairs. </para>

                        in his contribution to the debate, said that we oppose a joint committee on foreign affairs. We do not actually oppose such a committee at all, provided it is properly constituted and its members are given a reasonable amount of freedom without, of course, endangering the security of the country. We are just as aware as honorable senators on the Government side of the necessity to safeguard the security of this country.

If we joined this joint committee and it summoned before it some of these responsible heads of Services to give evidence, and if we found that we were gravely short of certain defence requirements, we would have to sit dumb and say nothing whatever about it.

                            <para>- Let us assume that it was referred to the Minister and he refused, as he has power to do, to grant permission to mention it to anyone. In spite of the fact that members of the committee knew that a dangerous situation existed, they would not be permitted to reveal their knowledge anywhere, even in their own party rooms where such vital questions were discussed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maher</inline> concluded by saying that if Labour senators were members of this committee they need not identify themselves with the opinions of the government members. However, the same argument applies. We could not identify ourselves with anyone because we would be under the absolute control of the Minister for the time being. I repeat, with emphasis and sincerity, what other senators on this side have said. It is absolutely useless to try to form a committee comprised of members from both sides of the Parliament to consider such vitally important matters, when the members of the committee will be tied hand and foot by the Minister. They cannot move, they cannot express any opinions, indeed, they cannot do anything at all without the express direction of the Minister for Externa] Affairs. </para>

                            <para>- I withdraw and apologize. 1 called him William. It should have been Walter. I apologize to ali the Williams in the Senate. If you look at the returns issued by the Commonwealth Electoral Office, you will see that they disclose that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charles</inline> Walter Sandford was elected on the bulk of the preferences of the Communist Gibson. Of 13,000 preference votes cast by those who supported Communist Gibson, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charles</inline> Walter Sandford received just on 8,000. That is real help and real assistance from the Communists. There is a complete rebuttal of the statement that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hendrickson</inline> made. </para>

                    <para>I realize that in dealing with figures and with matters such as defence, political philosophy and, particularly, foreign affairs, the Labour Party is not circumscribed by facts. That is of great assistance in putting up some sort of a case. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hendrickson</inline> repeated what his leader in another place had said - namely, that the Government has its majority because of Communist preferences "in the Moreton electorate. That, of course, was' a complete falsehood. The statement was carefully designed to suggest some lack of sincerity in the Government's ideological approach. I know that Labour senators are not particularly interested in accuracy, but if they refer to the records they will find that 694 votes were cast for the Communist candidate in Moreton, and that approximately 600 of the Communist preference votes went to the Labour Party. If that is the sort of support that my party receives from the Communists, good-oh! That is the sort of support I want. I want to see the Communists on the other side. </para>

                        was pleased to make some reference to my attitude towards red China.  1  do not intend to deal with that subject at great length, but it strikes me as odd that people who claim to be interested in Australia's welfare, in the development of Australian trade and in Australian employment can wax lyrical about the prospect of a market in red China and about the cultural and social benefits that would flow from social intercourse with that nation. They wax lyrical about those things, although red China has not a cracker to pay for our products and certainly there is very little that it can export to this country in the way of ideological philosophy. The people who applaud and cheer red China are the very people who in this chamber, with their colleagues in another place, attacked the trade treaty with Japan. Japan has money with which to pay us. Japan does buy our goods. Japan is outside the red orbit - and that, of course, is the cardinal offence that it has committed. Japan has refused to truckle to the reds in Asia, and that puts it outside the pale of the Labour Party's foreign policy.

                        was thoroughly misleading in reference to the state of the nation's defences when John Curtin took office. I agree with
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sandford</inline>
                        that John Curtin was a great Australian. I am not being mealy-mouthted. Not only do I concede that he was a great Australian, but I am proud of it. When Curtin took office, he said, being an honest man, that the nation's defences had never been sounder and that he was taking over a good Army, a good Navy and a good Air Force and was completely happy with the way that the munitions industry had been organized.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sandford</inline>
                        is interjecting. Is he calling Curtin a liar? That is a discreditable suggestion.

                                if you had been here earlier in the debate you would know that in their speeches honorable senators have ranged over a very wide field. I do not want to confine the debate strictly to the question of the formation of the foreign affairs committee, because that question raises questions of defence and other questions. I have decided not to ask honorable senators to confine their remarks directly to the proposed resolution before the Chair. I think I must allow considerable latitude in this debate.

                            <para>- Before adverting to the proposed work of the committee, and to the Labour Party's excuses for refusing to join the committee, I am duty-bound to refer to some remarks which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hendrickson</inline> made about my father. It is true that my father was a member of the Labour Party. It is true that he stood for Parliament under the endorsement of John Lang. But he belonged to a Labour. Party which had nothing whatever to do with unity tickets. He belonged to a Labour Party which did not have its foreign policy determined by the Healys and other Communists on the waterfront. He belonged to a Labour Party which was a party of moderation and reform. If it is of any interest to the Senate, let me say that I was a boy of, I think, seven when my father began his political activities. </para>

                        made one other reference to me. I am sorry that he is not in the chamber, because I feel that I should not tell him of his somersaults in his absence. There is this one other matter to which I must refer, apart from his reference to my father. I object most strenuously to a senator standing up in this place and making a dirty, rotten, sectarian insinuation in an attempt to refute something I said in an interjection which I made on political grounds. There is no other way of interpreting

                        remark that my colleagues on this side would be anxious to see my back. In the heat of debate, he may call me a McCarthy. I will pass that, although it is offensive. I am glad that the honorable senator has returned to the chamber. For his benefit, I shall repeat that the part of his speech to which I took violent objection was the dirty, rotten, sectarian insinuation in the statement that my colleagues on this side of the chamber would be glad to see my back.

I remind him that ten or twelve years ago he did not have the same point of view as he has now, when he went crawling on his hands and knees to Santamaria to get endorsement in the Labour Party Senate team in Victoria. </para>

Having obtained preselection, the honorable senator was elected to the Senate. Then there was a big split in the Labour Party. In order to show how militant, how vigorous and how left-wing he is and how well he fits in with the junta that controls the Australian Labour Party in Victoria, he now has to turn around and continuously use the name of the man, who put him here in a sense, using it as a symbol of disrespect and as something like an epithet. I ask you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President:</inline> Is that any way for him to treat his benefactor? </para>

                    <para>It is a great pity, of course, that because of mental stumbling blocks of that type the Parliament has been unable to achieve a bipartisan foreign policy. The position is quite different in England. In that country the Labour Party presents no alibis for running away from co-operating in foreign affairs. If my memory serves me rightly, the late Ernest Bevin, as foreign minister, took up an even more forthright position in regard to Communist aggression than the conservative foreign minister of a slightly later day took up. I believe it is highly desirable that the Labour Party should get rid of its old hag-ridden, redcontrolled shibboleths, come out into the open with the Government and formulate a sensible Australian foreign policy. One big advantage of a committee composed of both Government and Opposition members would be that Labour senators would not make such silly speeches on foreign affairs in this place. That in itself would be something of value. </para>
                    <para>When the present Government came into power at the end of 1949 it was in considerable difficulties on foreign affairs because of the unreliable image that had been created in the minds of our allies by the preceding Labour Minister for External Affairs. Rightly or wrongly, the Americans had the idea that Comrade Healy, so beloved of the Earl of Warwick on the other side of the chamber, was running our foreign affairs because he dictated which ships would sail and which ships would bc repaired and completely controlled activities on the waterfront. The simple truth of the matter was that our allies just could not trust the Australian Labour government of the day on foreign affairs. </para>
                    <para>When the Menzies Government came into power it was able to negotiate the great Anzus treaty and also the Seato treaty, which, however, is not quite so important because it is not so strong. Unfortunately, for this nation, the Labour Party policy was hammered out - I use the words " hammered out " in a euphemistic sense - at Hobart in 1955- </para>

                            <para>- Let us say that it was cut out with a sickle. That policy embodied certain matters that are cardinal features of Communist Party foreign policy; for instance, the recognition of red China. That is not just a plank in the Labour Party's platform. If one looks at the Labour Party's little handbook, which can be bought for ls., one finds that it is referred to as a cardinal plank; that is, one of the most important planks in its platform. One could mention seven or eight other matters, such as the recall of troops from Malaya and truckling to Communist aggression where it shows its head. So much of Labour policy formulated at the Hobart conference was in tune with Communist ideas that Comrade Sharkey was able to say after 1955, "Now the Labour Party and the Communist Party can go forward hand in hand ". What a marriage! </para>

                    <para>Such policies would be disastrous for Australia if they were ever foisted upon it. Labour's foreign policy does not win many friends even among its own supporters. If you look around you see daubed in whitewash on bridges, culverts and public buildings this sort of useless left-wing slander that is designed solely to split the nation on the issue of foreign affairs. In this chamber and in another place the Labour Party continuously attacks the defence vote. It says that we should not spend £200,000,000 a year on defence and that we should devote that money to social services. The Labour Party having said that for about the last ten years, we now find that the leader of that party in another place <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> wants to attack Soekarno. He wants to go to war over West New Guinea almost before any one has considered it. The truth of the matter appears to be that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> was quite right. The Labour Party has no foreign policy, despite what is written in the little shilling book, except what twelve good men and true, or twelve men, anyhow, tell it from time to time, and that is one of the real reasons why honorable senators opposite feel themselves obliged to refrain from joining the Foreign Affairs Committee. </para>

                            <para>- The Australian Labour Party, as my friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> points out, has dredged the gutter in this debate. As in most foreign affairs debates, it finds itself pathologically incapable of thought not only on matters of an economic nature but also on those relating to foreign affairs. Whenever one puts up a rational argument in relation to such matters it is disposed of, or an attempt is made to dispose of it, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> did this afternoon, by the use of the single word " McCarthy ". 1 do not know exactly what the honorable senator intends to imply by the word " McCarthy ", but I think it is intended to be offensive and to act as a rebuttal of any form of logical argument. I believe it is intended to be used as a complete and absolute substitute for thought. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> uses it very frequently for that purpose. </para>

                    <para>I notice that the honorable senator has been preparing himself assiduously for this debate for the last hour or more. He has been hoping to be able to wait until I have said my piece, so he can get up and' scream "McCarthy" all the louder. I therefore feel compelled, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> to make some reference to the ineptitude of this parrot cry, or should I say, galah cry, in relation to foreign affairs. The fate of a nation should not be determined by the simple use of a silly slogan, a silly epithet, or a silly term. </para>

                            <para>-  As my friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dittmer</inline> put it, " How silly can you get? " I thought that that matter was disposed of yesterday. Since my friend the Earl of Warwick ran away from the position earlier in the afternoon, I thought that I should put these ideas before him, to give him something to go on in a few minutes. The alibis which have been put forward by the Labour Party sound totally unconvincing. As I have said, they are obviously galah cries by people who are not thinking for themselves, and they provide absolutely no genuine reason why the Labour Party should not nominate members to sit on the Foreign Affairs Committee. </para>

                        <para>. - This is a most interesting debate. I am delighted, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, that</inline> you have taken the very wise course, if I may say so with the greatest respect, of allowing the debate to cover a wide field. It would be most unfair if honorable senators were not given an opportunity to discusss statements made earlier in the debate which perhaps might not have come within the standards of procedure that you normally encourage in this chamber. The debate has arisen because the Australian Labour Party has seen  fit  to refrain from appointing representatives to the Foreign Affairs Committee proposed by the Government. It is well to remember that the Labour Party is just as interested in the foreign policy of this nation as are its political opponents. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>We refuse to join the Foreign Affairs Committee on the grounds that it is not like any other committee which is appointed by the Parliament, that the whole structure is under the control of one man, and that witnesses may appear before it only if he says so. If the committee desires to obtain information, the Minister for External Affairs must agree. The Labour Party representatives who serve on parliamentary committees are appointed by the party. They put the views of the party before those committees, and the party is entitled to be informed of any decisions that are arrived at. Surely there is no thought that any member of a political party in this Parliament would do anything to endanger the safety of the nation. If the Labour Party were to appoint members to the Foreign Affairs Committee, why should they be able to discuss only those matters approved by the Minister for External Affairs? I believe, as every one else believes, that Australia has to be extremely careful about its foreign policy, particularly in view  of  our isolation from our allies. </para>
                    <para>If the Government wishes to have a joint committee on foreign affairs, it should be prepared to give the committee a degree of freedom. It must be prepared to trust the members of the committee and to have faith in them, from whichever political party they come. It should recognize that they would do nothing to harm the safety of Australia. If the Government was prepared to appoint a committee in the normal way and to allow members to take back to the parties appointing them information about the matters discussed, and in that way guide the party in forming its views, I believe there would be a case for such a committee. Let us be honest with ourselves. I cannot see any hope of a foreign policy being agreed upon between the two major political parties. With all respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannan,</inline> I declare that the Labour Party has not been in the habit of using Communism to win elections. But the Government parties have done so over the years. It has even had a Petrov inquiry to help it win an election. To be quite honest, we do not trust you people over there. If there was another election, to save your seats and remain in office you would, if it suited you to do so, without any evidence whatever, label the party to which I belong, or individual members of it as being allies of a foreign power. You do so because you know quite well that it helps you. </para>

                            <para>- That was proved conclusively during the last election when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McEwen,</inline> I think, at a meeting in the country said it was about time people stopped saying that if the Labour Party was elected to office this country's safety would be endangered. It is pleasing to hear that said at last. One does not expect that kind of statement from small men. One expects from them only the same old Com attitude, the McCarthy attitude, which is paying handsome dividends to those who adopt it. In a number of instances it gets them into an unwanted position. Fortunately, there is every chance, by a stroke of fortune, of their not being here within a few years. </para>

I used it for one reason. Everybody knows that I have never been connected with the Communist Party and that I fought against its influence in the organization to which I belonged for a long period. Everybody knows why I mentioned here the case of Healy. I mentioned it from a personal standpoint, not a political standpoint. </para>

                    <para>In the interests of the nation, it is about time that we said whether we believe it to be desirable that we become members of a joint committee. As late as  3fh  December last, the people of Australia did not seem to think that we had done anything that was very wrong in not joining the Foreign Affairs Committee. The number of votes received by the Labour Party totalled hundreds of thousands more than those received by the two Government parties. Let me assure everybody, particularly those who unfortunately have no political convictions but who continually attempt to brand others, that you will not find a member of the Labour Party who will damage the prestige or safety of this country. </para>
                    <para>I ask all fair-minded persons to read the motion. Can any self-respecting person join a foreign affairs committee which is not allowed to consider matters unless a particular person says it may, and which cannot interview anybody unless that same person is prepared to say that it may? Sub-paragraph (e) of paragraph four reads -  the committee and its sub-committees will sit in camera and their proceedings shall be secret unless the Minister at the request of the committee otherwise directs; </para>
                    <para class="block">Sub-paragraph (g) provides, inter alia -  the committee shall not submit a report to the Minister nor inform the Parliament accordingly without the Minister's consent. </para>
                    <para class="block">The motion also provides that the committee shall not invite persons to give evidence before it without the consent of the Minister for External Affairs. A similar provision applies to calling for official papers. </para>

My friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent,</inline> wanted to know what was the Labour Party's defence and external affairs policy in 1955.

The Federal Government took no action in this respect, and in the end - five years later - the Indo-China conflict had to be settled by negotiation. The result was a settlement which was infinitely worse than would have been the case had United Nations intervention taken place in a prompt and timely manner.

                        <para>Indo-China is typical of those cases where inexcusable delay in recognizing a genuine Nationalist anti-colonial movement in Asia resulted in Communism gradually capturing the Nationalist movement. The result was that democratic Nationalism suffered a severe setback. </para>

This is only part of our task. Asian peoples also demand - in accordance with the United Nations Charter - the end of colonialism whenever and wherever the people are fit for self-government. Even more, Asia rightly demands recognition of the dignity and self-respect of Asian nations and peoples. Unless all these principles are fully acknowledged, Western Nations will find it impossible to achieve that real cooperation of Asia which is basic to the maintenance of peace. </para>

                        <para>This Conference is firmly of the opinion that there is a grossly inadequate understanding of Asian problems in Australia and of Australian problems in Asia. Therefore, it establishes the policy of encouraging exchanges of official and unofficial visits between our countries. In particular, the Australian Labour Movement itself should seek direct contact with Asian countries. In this connection, no Asian country should be excluded from such exchanges. </para>

I  have not heard, as yet, any great objection. Certainly one senator said that I was getting hot, but he has since become silent. </para>

                            <para>- Up to date the Government has not sold the Formosans to mainland China, though I do not know what it will do in the future. One wonders just how far the Government will go. I could never understand the Government's attitude. Honorable senators will recall that diplomatic relations with Russia were abruptly cut off on account of the Petrov inquiry, and it- was the present Government that renewed them. Whether the Government was prepared at that time to back Stalinism against the Communist philosophy of Mao Tse-tung, I do not know, but it seems fantastic to me that Government members were prepared to bring into their own land one brand of communism . yet will not allow the other people to sit in the United Nations. I said one brand of communism; I do not know whether there are two brands of communism. I do not know much even about one brand, but I have read something about it in years gone by. One wonders what exception <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> or any other supporter of the Government can take to the Labour Party's 1955 decisions, which he was so keen to hear. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think the honorable senator would accuse me of not stating the decisions faithfully. I got the book containing them from the Parliamentary Library, and if the honorable senator wants to look at it he is at liberty to get it. I went to the trouble, also, to get a copy of the foreign policy - or external affairs policy, call it what you will - of the Labour Party, as amended by the 1961 conference. I have also a copy of the Liberal Party's foreign policy. I do not see anything in either of them that one could honestly say would harm this nation. True, there are matters in the Liberal Party policy that are not in ours, but I suppose the only big difference between the two is their attitudes towards Seato and Anzus.

I make a very earnest appeal. This nation needs the constructive thought of all parties. It is much harder than one would imagine to state a reason why the Labour Party will not join this committee, without being subjected to misrepresentation. As the press of this nation, with the exception of one newspaper in the last two or three months, has seen fit to keep up the barrage against this party, I think we are entitled to say that our reasons for not joining the committee are valid within our own party. They have been amply stated by the Leader of the Opposition and others. Speaking from a personal point of view - the party has not made a decision on this - I sincerely believe that if there were a foreign affairs committee representing both sides and all schools of thought in the Parliament, with the freedom of thought and action that it should have and the trust that it ought to get from the Minister, irrespective of the colour of the government, that government should at least have enough trust in members who are elected to the National Parliament to know that they would not do anything that would in any way injure Australia. </para>

                        <para>. - This debate has ranged widely over the subject of foreign affairs, though we should be discussing the appointment of the Foreign Affairs Committee. I believe that I am able to give a better opinion of this committee than are most other members of this Parliament. It could be said that I am half-way between those who oppose its appointment and those who favour it. In addition, I have had a good deal of experience of the committee. Opposition senators have explained why, in their view, there should not be a Foreign Affairs Committee, and Government senators have given reasons for the formation of such a committee. I have watched the committee work for a number of years now, and I am in full agreement with those honorable senators who have said that the committee should continue. That does not mean, however, that I think the committee could not be improved. Whether the Opposition wishes to join the committee or not is its own business, but if it does not join, I think it will be the loser. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The committee deals with a variety of subjects and its activities are not circumscribed so much as some honorable senators seem to think. In fact, I have never found the committee to be circumscribed at all. All kinds of subjects have been dealt with very fully, without the consent of the Minister. Sub-committees have been formed and discussions have taken place. Information has been obtained from personages in high positions, and in many cases the requests for those personages to give information have not been made through the Minister. The Minister realizes that the committee has a job to do, and he has given it broad subjects to deal with, thus allowing the members to consider many aspects of those broad subjects. </para>
                    <para>A great deal of freedom has been given  to  members of the committee to study and to make the results of their study known for the benefit of others, including, incidentally, many of their colleagues. Everything dealt with by the Foreign Affairs Committee is not necessarily secret. Members keep secret those things they are asked to keep secret, but with their education in relation to the various aspects of foreign affairs, they can do a great deal to help in educating others. I think it is a very good committee in that respect. I agree with the Opposition that the committee should have great power, because a lack of power may be one of its weaknesses at present. I admit that the powers of the committee have to be circumscribed because it is dealing with foreign affairs, and with information that cannot be bandied about, but I think that the committee should be given greater strength. </para>
                    <para>It has been said that the committee is merely a study group. Naturally, it is a study group in the first place, but it has reached some very sound findings, in some cases after up to two years of study of a particular subject. I think there should be some means by which the findings of the committee can be implemented, and not, as at present, merely placed before the Minister with a statement to the effect, " This is the result of our study over two years; will you do something along the lines that we suggest? " At present, the Minister is in a position to say either " Yes " or " No ". That is why I say the committee should be given more power. If it had been a joint parliamentary committee in the fullest sense of the term - and that almost came about in the 1950's, as those who were in the Labour caucus room in those days will remember - I believe the committee would have really amounted to something and would have been given a great deal more power by the Government. </para>
                    <para>It was a mistake for the Opposition not to join the committee in the first place, and it is even more foolish to perpetuate that mistake. It has been said that you cannot tell your colleagues in the caucus room what you have been discussing in the committee. The Foreign Affairs Committee is not unique in that. The executive of the Labour caucus frequently makes certain findings which it does not pass on to the ordinary members of caucus. A similar situation exists with the Foreign Affairs Committee. </para>
                    <para class="block">You cannot expect to go out after a secret meeting and tell every Tom, Dick and Harry what has been discussed. During the past six or seven years there has never been, to my knowledge, one case of leakage of information from the committee. That indicates that the people on the committee have taken their work seriously and have realized their responsibility to the Government and to Australia. At times the committee has been supplied with secret information that could have been of use to people who were not very friendly to this country. </para>

                        I believe that for the good of the Parliament itself, this committee should continue. It could be a means whereby the two warring sections of the Parliament, if you like to put it that way, could get together in the interests of a mutual understanding of Australia's dangers and of making an effort to overcome them. If the Government and Opposition parties joined together in the work of this committee, trying to arrive at a mutual understanding, that would be the first step towards the formulation of a unanimous policy on foreign affairs. I believe that will come about by force of circumstances in the not far distant future. By refusing to join this committee, the Labour Party is being foolish and is doing an injury to the future welfare of Australia. Unless we get together now and formulate a common policy for the defence of this country, we shall endanger not only ourselves but those who come after us. I support the motion.

                        <para>. - The purpose of the bill before the Senate is to amend the Commonwealth Banks Act 1959-1961 by making a further addition of £5,000,000 to the capital of the Commonwealth Development Bank. lt will be recalled that last October a similar amendment was made, and £5,000,000 was also added to the capital of the bank at that time. I congratulate the Government on making available to the bank the sum of £10,000,000 in six months, giving the bank a total capital of £25,857,000. The bank is in a very healthy position, therefore, so far as its capital is concerned. In addition, it has available to it substantial assets, and it has been able to borrow large sums of money from the Commonwealth Savings Bank. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Before I proceed to say something of the operations of the Development Bank, I want to <inline font-style="italic">refer to some</inline> of the points made by Opposition senators during the debate. In opening the discussion for the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> stated that he and other members of the Opposition had complained, during the course of a debate on this subject last October, that the Government, instead of proposing to increase the capital of the bank by £5,000,000 at that time, should have been increasing it by £10,000,000. The honorable senator may have been genuine in his attempt to have the amount increased, but I point out to him that it is the prerogative, of the Opposition to oppose and to suggest to the Government that amounts proposed to be provided in such circumstances should be increased. I remind the honorable senator that the Government has always recognized that the time would arrive when the capital of the bank would need to be increased to meet applications for advances as they came forward. In answer to questions that have been asked in the Senate from time to time, the appropriate Minister, on behalf of the Government, has always made it clear that should the time arrive when the Development Bank required more capital, the Government would see to it that additional capital was provided. I also remind the honorable senator that at no time during the operations of the bank has it suffered from lack of capital. </para>
                    <para>I want to refer to the claim made by members of the Australian Labour Party that that party was responsible for the establishment of the Development Bank. During the current sessional period of the Parliament, claims have been made on a number of occasions by honorable senators opposite that legislation introduced in the Parliament was in accordance with the policy of the Labour Party, but little did I think, when this debate commenced, that the Labour Party would go so far as to claim that the establishment of the Development Bank was a part of its policy. True it is that the Labour Party was responsible for establishing the Commonwealth Bank, and it is also true that in the Commonwealth Bank there was formerly a Mortgage Bank Department; but I suggest to honorable senators opposite that the charter of the Development Bank differs greatly from that of the old Mortgage Bank Department. In fact, the Development Bank is a new type of bank amongst banking institutions. During this debate I have not heard honorable senators opposite mention the fact that for two years the Labour Party delayed the implementation of the Commonwealth Banks Act. For two years, that party prevented the primary producers, who required money to carry out developmental work, from obtaining it. Now, they claim that it is their party which is helping the primary producers. </para>
                    <para>I turn to the problem of the costs that primary producers have to meet. A great deal has been said on this matter. I agree that one of the biggest problems which confront the primary producers to-day is that of costs. We all know that the gap between the cost of production and the price that the grower receives overseas for his product has closed to such an extent that there is practically none left. We all know, too, of the important part that the primary producers are playing in earning export income for this country. It would be a tragedy if costs were allowed to continue to rise and eventually to prevent the primary producers from producing the commodities we need. I know that the Labour Party is worried, to a degree, by this problem. Nevertheless, it amazes me that time and again members of the Opposition should come into this chamber and weep crocodile tears for the primary producers. When it suits them to do so, they support the sections and the forces that are seeking to increase the costs that primary producers have to meet. </para>
                    <para>
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne,</inline>
                        when replying to
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKellar's</inline>
                        speech last night, said that the private banks had treated the primary producers very badly. Nothing could be further from the truth than that statement. The private banks have played a very important part in the development of this country. I know that in recent times, during the period of restriction on credit, a great number of people engaged in primary production complained that their opportunities to obtain credit were restricted. During that time I received only two letters on the subject. Upon asking for further information, I found that one man who was making the complaint had had his overdraft reduced by only £50 and that his overdraft had stood at the same figure for approximately twelve years. I do not think any private bank could be blamed for that sort of treatment. The policy of the Government differs from that of the Labour Party. We on this side are in favour of the continuation of the private banking system.
                    </para>
                    <para>I turn now to the functions of the Development Bank. It is interesting to note that the Commonwealth Banks Act provides, in section 72 - </para>

                    <para>Section 73 sets out the matters to be taken into consideration in providing this finance. It reads -  (1.) In determining whether or not finance shall be provided for a person, the Development Bank shall have regard primarily to the prospects of the operations of that person becoming, or continuing to be, successful and shall not necessarily have regard to the value of the security available in respect of that finance. </para>
                    <para>The overriding consideration is that the lack of security need not necessarily be the debarring factor. </para>
                    <para>The Development Bank has functioned very well during the two years it has been in operation. I have travelled throughout Western Australia and have noticed the tremendous amount of development in the clearing of properties. Upon making inquiries about where the finance came from, I have been told that it came from the Development Bank. I take advantage of this opportunity to congratulate the personnel of the bank upon the work that they have done. It will be recalled that when the bank was set up just over two years ago it was a new type of banking institution and that there were very few men who had the experience needed for the kind of activity that was envisaged. The bank had to set about the task of training additional personnel. </para>
                    <para>I repeat that the bank has functioned very well. But I want to make one qualification. I believe it has paid too much attention to the lending of money to men who are established on farms. The number of applications that have been approved looks rather good. Indeed, it is good. But I believe that too many farmers who are established and who perhaps are working on a rather substantial overdraft and cannot get further finance to do developmental work have approached the Development Bank to obtain money for that work. The position of young farmers is not so happy. I have received a number of letters from people who have submitted to the Development Bank applications which have been rejected. Upon looking through those applications, I found that a number of them were for activities that were outside the scope of the bank. They were applications for finance for carry-on expenses or to buy land next door, or something of that kind. </para>
                    <para>Amongst them were a number from young people each of whom has a block of land which is partly paid off, an overdraft with a private bank, and stock and plant which perhaps is under lien to a stock firm. When it is all added up, the security is not as good as it seems to be. 1 believe the bank should extend itself to cope with such applications. </para>
                    <para>Let me refer to my own experience. When I returned from the war I bought a block of land which I paid for in part. I had to obtain liens from the stock firms to buy sheep, and I had to buy my plant gradually. However, my overdraft would not allow me to do more than carry on and meet my repayments. I worked under those conditions for a number of years. A new bank was opened in the area and the manager offered to give me an overdraft which was double my existing overdraft if I would transfer my business to his institution. That increased accommodation gave me an opportunity to go ahead and develop my property. As the years went by I was able to pay off the property and other debts. Many young farmers are handicapped by lack of capital. That is particularly so in Western Australia where, in recent years, the State Government has thrown open large areas of land for selection. Many young farmers have taken up areas, but some are struggling to hold them. </para>
                    <para>Then again, there is the case of young farmers who have been brought up on farms but who lack capital and cannot take up a block of land. Many of us in Western Australia remember the days when the old Agricultural Bank was in existence. That bank has been responsible to a great degree for the development of the wheat belt. It allowed men to go on to the land, some of them having no security whatever. After they had cleared 50 or 100 acres they applied to the bank for a long-term loan. After the clearing had been inspected and passed, the bank advanced money to the applicants at the rate of 30s. an acre. The applicants were then in a position to clear other portions of their farms and to apply for further advances. However, over the years we have seen a change in bank lending. Some of the sources from which primary producers used to obtain finance have dried up. About the time to which I refer, private banks provided finance, not as long-term loans, but in equivalent form in the way of overdrafts. Those overdrafts carried the man on the land through his operations until he had developed the farm. In the case of farmers who could not get further finance, storekeepers very often carried them through until they received after-harvest payments. </para>
                    <para>However, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, to-day</inline> we find that the private trading banks are reluctant to lend on long terms. Only the other day I was talking to a farmer who wanted money for development. He said, " I can get plenty of money till after harvest, but what good is that to me for developing my property? " Development work cannot be carried out with short-term loans. I listened very carefully to the points made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKellar</inline> and I must agree that something should be done about rural finance. I hope that the Government will have a very close look at this matter and, perhaps, do something in the future to improve the position. </para>
                    <para>I want to make another point in regard to the Development Bank. From experience and from talks I have had with people having close associations with it, both applicants and bank officers, I believe it would be a very good thing for the bank to appoint in each district a retired farmer of great experience and high integrity, who knows the people and the district and what it is able to do. That man having been appointed, on an honorary basis or at a small remuneration, his job would be to inspect and report on the property of an applicant for finance. He would have a good idea of the capabilities of the property, and having lived in the district all his life, possibly, he would be in a good position to know applicants from the area. I believe that in this way we would get much further along the road towards establishing young men successfully on the land. I hope that the Government will have a look at that proposition. </para>
                    <para>
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline>
                        raised the subject of interest rates. He said that, in his opinion, the average maximum rate of 6 per cent, now operating was far too high, and he suggested a reduction to 4± per cent, to  coincide with the rate paid for Commonwealth housing loans. All of us would like to see lower interest rates. All primary producers would like to see long-term loans at low interest. If this bank functions as I think it should, it will become a risk bank and, therefore, perhaps, be entitled to higher interest than would normally be paid. But the bank, as it functions at present, does not take a risk, and therefore the interest rate should be reduced. I want it to take a risk on a young man who goes on to the land with a thorough knowledge of farming but who has not the security that banks like applicants to have. If the Development Bank will take the risk of seeing that man over the hump, as I call it, it will be entitled, I believe, to  6  per cent. interest. But, in present circumstances, I am inclined to agree with
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline>
                    </para>
                    <para>In relation to the established farmer, this bank has functioned very well since its introduction. I should like to see its functions extended to take care of the younger farmer who has not the equity that the bank wants at present. The personnel of the bank have done a particularly fine job in bringing it to the position it occupies at the present time. I support the bill. </para>

                    </list>
                    <para>Before proceeding further, it is as well that I suggest to the House some fundamentals which should bekept in mind when Australia's policies arc in discussion. Australia has no territorial claims to the territory of West New Guinea; nor has it any right or claim to dictate or to compel the manner in which those having the administration of that territory should govern or administer it. Australia, of course, has views as to how its own best interests could be served by or in that territory and also as to what ought there to be done for the benefit of the indigenous inhabitants. But the achievement of these views, however strongly held and however closely they touch Australian interests, may only be pursued by diplomatic activity through the ordinary channels of international intercourse and in the United Nations. </para>
                    <para>The Commonwealth of Australia has itself no land boundaries with its neighbours. Consequently the need to accept the outcome of history in the distribution of territories amongst its neighbours has not to be considered by Australians with any frequency, if at all. But we are mindful, I am sure, of the course enjoined by the preamble to the charter, and intend, in conformity with it, " to practice tolerance and live together in peace with " our neighbours, as ourselves, good neighbours. This we have done and will do in our Territories of Papua and New Guinea, where we do share a land frontier. As to those territories, we have territorial rights which we will defend to the utmost, in which proper task we would expect, and have no reason to doubt, that we will receive the full assistance and support of our great allies. The quite different situation which exists in respect of West New Guinea will be obvious to honourable members. </para>
                    <para>Sovereignty and its recognition are the very essence of international relationships and particularly of the United Nations organization, a circumstance which article 2 (1) of the charter underlines by stating, " The organization is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its members ". To Australia, as to all others of the smaller powers, including Indonesia, the maintenance of sovereignty is of the utmost national importance. No doubt, increasing areas of international agreement may call increasingly for some surrender of sovereignty in particular respects, but, if it does, that surrender will itself be by an exercise of sovereignty, by the free will of sovereign peoples. Of course the possession of sovereignty does not preclude, indeed in these days it involves, due consideration of the rights and aspirations of dependent peoples. </para>
                    <para>The policies with respect to the NetherlandsIndonesian dispute, of which I have reminded the House, were adopted against the background of an intention on the part of the Netherlands to apply the principle of self-determination to its territory of West New Guinea and to remain in administration until the indigenous people had advanced to the point where they were fully able to govern themselves and to choose for themselves their international associations. Indeed, the jointly agreed principles adopted by the Netherlands and Australian governments, in November, 1957, and announced to the House at that time, contain the following three clauses: - </para>

                    <para class="block">I should perhaps remind honorable members of what the charter has to say on this matter and on the obligations of nations towards the people of their dependent territories. </para>
                    <para>The second of the purposes of the United Nations, as set out in article 1, is: " to develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace ". </para>
                    <para>But West New Guinea is a non-self-governing territory; and it is to the chapter of the charter directed specifically to such territories to which we must turn in order to find the charter obligation of the Netherlands towards the people of West New Guinea. It is provided in article 73 (b) that administering states " accept as a sacred trust the obligation "... " to develop self-government (not, it may be observed independence), to take due account of the political aspirations of the peoples, and to assist them in the progressive development of their free political institutions, according to the particular circumstances of each territory and its peoples and their varying stages of advancement ". </para>
                    <para class="block">These are the obligations which the Netherlands assumed towards the people of West New Guinea so far as the United Nations charter is concerned. Of course the Netherlands may choose to accept for itself a greater obligation to the dependent people if it considers it right to do so. And, indeed, by its actions and declarations to which I have already referred, it has done so. </para>
                    <para>By way of comparison I should say that the obligation of the administering power in respect of a trust territory such as Australian New Guinea is, as might be expected, more definitely stated in the United Nations charter. The basic objective of the trusteeship system is to promote the progressive development of the inhabitants " towards self-government or independence as may be appropriate to the particular circumstances of each territory and its peoples and of the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned, and as may be provided by the terms of each trusteeship agreement ". I may remark in passing that even in this case the grant of independence is not made obligatory by the charter. </para>
                    <para>In the case of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea, the United Nations charter provides one set of obligations in respect of Papua and another in respect of the Trust Territory of New Guinea: The Government's general policy in respect of both is as the Prime Minister told the House last year " to promote the advancement of the people so that ultimately they will choose for themselves their own constitution and their future relationship with us". A full presentation of Australian policy objectives was made by my colleague, the Minister for Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hasluck),</inline> in this House on 23rd August, 1960. </para>
                    <para>Thus, we have a situation under which the Netherlands Government is subjected to one definition of obligations in the United Nations charter but has voluntarily entered on a wider programme; the Australian Government is subjected to the same obligation in respect of Papua and to a different and more specific obligation in respect of the Trust Territory of New Guinea - territories which we administer under the Administrative Union with a policy and an objective common to both - to bring the people as soon as we can to the point where they are able to make a free choice of their future, both in form of government and in international relationship. </para>
                    <para>What I think it important to point out is that there is no simple definition of the meaning of self-determination: For its precise meaning in relation to any dependent territory one must look to article 73 (b) of the charter and to any statements which the responsible administering power has made in explanation of the way in which it intends to put this obligation into effect. </para>
                    <para>I referred earlier to the main elements of Australian policy as recapitulated by the Prime Minister in April, 1961. Since April last several changes of the utmost importance have taken place in the attitudes of the parties principal - Indonesia and the Netherlands. These changes of attitude have been so fundamental that the situation itself has undergone a radical change. No discussion of the present situation or consideration of Australia's attitude in the matter can properly take place without these events in mind and without observing the implications they involve. </para>
                    <para>In September, 1961, the Netherlands presented to the United Nations the dramatic proposal to pass to an international administration its declared role of preparing the 800,000 Papuan inhabitants for the exercise of self-determination, and to transfer the sovereignty of the territory to those inhabitants. The proposal, no doubt, resulted from the very great pressure which the very existence, but particularly the increasing intensity of the dispute with Indonesia, placed upon the Netherlands and from its desire to ensure, notwithstanding the growing pressure for early Netherlands withdrawal, that the inhabitants would have the opportunity to choose their own future. </para>
                    <para>The Netherlands had already entered upon a ten-year plan, to end in 1970, for stimulating the economic, social and cultural development of the territory; and had offered in 1960 to have the United Naitons scrutinize Netherlands administration of the territory. Legislation was passed in November, 1960, by the States General of the Netherlands - No. 5970 of 1960 - which recited the adoption of policies " to accelerate the political development of West New Guinea aimed at self-government " and which provided for the creation of the Netherlands New Guinea Council. The council was in fact established in April, 1961, with a large majority of Papuan members. Immediately upon its establishment, the council was charged with making known to the Netherlands Government within twelve months its views as to the manner in which, and the possible desirability of fixing a term within which, self-government was to be realized. These views were to be formulated against the background of the ten-year plan which was to end in 1970. </para>
                    <para>I might mention that the council reported on 16th February, 1962, that " it was of the opinion that the year 1970 was the limit of the term within which self-determination could be exercised by the population of the Territory.". </para>
                    <para>The Netherlands had indicated that the adoption of the ten-year plan did not mean that the Netherlands would necessarily retire from the territory upon its accomplishment. The Netherlands still asserted that it would remain until the process of bringing the indigenous people to a sufficient state of development to fit them for self-government and, if they chose it, for independence, was complete. </para>
                    <para>The proposal of September, 1961, however, to " internationalize " the administration of the territory of New Guinea was of a different order. </para>
                    <para class="block">It appeared to presage a shorter period of preparation of the population for self-government and the attainment of independence. It seemed that it might well represent notice that the Netherlands was preparing to quit the territory at a much earlier date than had theretofore been envisaged. </para>
                    <para>I pause, if I might, to observe that the Netherlands programme of November, 1960, however suitable in West New Guinea involved an accelerated time-table which we would not feel justified in applying in our own New Guinea territory where we aim to endow the people with a reasonably developed economy and unified society when they take political control of their affairs. But the implications of the Netherlands proposal of September, 1961, by which West New Guinea might be set on its feet and depend on its own resources even earlier were wider than those of the accelerated programme which had preceded it - the more so if Indonesian goodwill and concurrence were not to be forthcoming. The full implications of a defenceless and economically unstable state of West New Guinea in such circumstances could not be left out of account. </para>
                    <para>Before continuing my recital of events since April, 1961, it might not be out of place for me to say that Australia intends to fulfil its voluntarily assumed obligation to the people of East New Guinea. Although, as the House is fully aware, that is a course which is now and will increasingly be burdensomely costly and devoid of any prospect of material gain, we shall carry on until the people are themselves fully capable of self-government and able to choose their future associations. In the midst of this dispute between the Netherlands and the Indonesians, it is right to reassure the people of our own territories of Papua-New Guinea that we shall stand by them and shall remain so long as they as a people wish that we should. </para>
                    <para>However, although aware of the potential difficulties to which I have called attention, the Government recognized that the proposal of the Netherlands to the United Nations was conceived as a means of giving the Papuans of West New Guinea a prospect of self-government and of freedom of choice, and did suggest a solution of the Dutch-Indonesian dispute which might well be accepted. </para>
                    <para>Meanwhile the Indonesian Government had strongly opposed these several developments. It took the view that the Indonesian people alone had the authority to form a national government in the territory. It claimed to see in the self determination policy an attempt by the Netherlands to create a " Katanga " situation by separating from Indonesia a territory which it claimed should be Indonesian, an attempt at dismemberment. It saw the promotion of self determination as the promotion of a separatist movement; it said that pursuit of the policy would "lead only to trouble in the future " and that the policy must be opposed no matter by what means this was done. The Indonesian Government vowed its attachment to a policy described as economic, political, and military confrontation of the Netherlands. This policy was intended to achieve Indonesia's demand for the incorporation in Indonesia of West New Guinea as portion of the former Dutch possessions, a portion which had not been included in the agreed transfer of sovereignty in 1949. In the United Nations discussion the Indonesian Government took the view that the Netherlands proposal completely ignored Indonesia's claims, and it rejected the Netherlands proposal in emphatic terms. </para>
                    <para>The debate in the United Nations arising out of the Netherlands proposal was inconclusive. Competing resolutions unacceptable respectively to the Netherlands and to Indonesia failed to gain the necessary two-thirds majority. It is worth recalling to the House the terms of the respective resolutions and the numbers, and the identity of the members of the United Nations who voted for or against them. </para>

On the other hand the Netherlands draft resolution did not sufficiently recognize the existence of Indonesia's interest in the territory. The Assembly should not be asked to accept either the Netherlands or the Indonesian claim to sovereignty.

Without that support no effective resolution could be carried. </para>
                    <para>Notwithstanding the impasse thus reached, the Netherlands indicated that it would continue to work for an international settlement of the dispute. At the same time the movement towards self-determination proceeded at a further accelerated pace. On 1st December, 1961, following a decision of the Netherlands New Guinea Council, a flag for the territory was flown and a territorial anthem sung publicly for the first time. The Indonesian Government for its part reiterated its demand that the territory be passed to Indonesian control and set forth in increasingly uncompromising terms its intention of enforcing compliance with that demand. ' It saw in the Netherlands Government permitting a Papuan flag and a Papuan anthem an attempt to forestall the possibility of Indonesian success by any means, peaceful or otherwise, in obtaining administration of the territory and an attempt to present Indonesia with an independent State of West New Guinea as a fait accompli. It thus felt that it had less time in which to pursue its demand. </para>
                    <para>On 19th December  President  Soekarno issued what was officially termed a people's iri-command calling for readiness for general Indonesian mobilisation, for the unfurling in West New Guinea of the Indonesian Mag, and for the defeat of the formation of what the  President  called " the puppet state of Papua ". The President's statements indicated that a military enterprise against the Netherlands would be regarded as an exercise to " liberate " West Irian, as Indonesia consistently styles West New Guinea. It is not without significance that the Soviet leaders, in formulating their more recent views as to the possibility of co-existence between the Communist and the non-Communist world, have excepted from the proposition that war is not inevitable and should be avoided, wars of " liberation " which they applaud and are willing to encourage. Statements of the Communist bloc, both by the Soviet and by the Communist Chinese, have consistently indicated support for Indonesia, with promises of military aid, in any attempt to incorporate West New Guinea in the Republic of Indonesia by armed conflict, a course which both members of the bloc would regard as a war of liberation. 0,  ,n . .   </para>
                    <para>The President's statement of December, 196L and subsequent statements of other Indonesian leaders were received by the Australian Government with the greatest disquiet. The Government entertained, and still entertains, the view that armed conflict in the- areas to the immediate north of Australia in connexion with this dispute would be most detrimental to the best interests of Australia - and that whether or not the conflict extended to involve the Communist powers, but particularly if it did, such conflict would both in the short and in the long run more likely than not ensure for the benefit of those powers and result in the spread of communism in .  the  'areas close to our shores. The Government was thus most concerned with Indonesia's declarations of intention to resort to armed force -and in addition was shocked and dismayed that the  President,  should make these threats, having regard to the numerous solemn assurances , given . to  Australia,  .and also to the United Nations, that there would be no resort to force to enforce Indonesia's claims to the territory of West New Guinea, Australia was the more concerned since the matter had so recently been the subject of consideration in the United Nations itself. </para>
                    <para>Having in mind the considerations that I have already mentioned, the Government on 30th December, 1961, publicly commended to both parties a negotiated settlement and took the opportunity not only to express its condemnation of any use of armed force but also to remind the Indonesian leaders of the solemn assurances which had been given to and accepted by Australia. It would be as well if the House had before it the statement which I then issued, and with the consent of the House, I incorporate it in " Hansard ". </para>
                    <para>STATEMENT MADE BY THE MINISTER FOR EXTERNAL AFFAIRS ON SATURDAY, 30th DECEMBER, 1961.  " The Minister for External Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> Barwick, said to-day that he fully realized the concern with which the Australian public viewed the present state of the controversy between the Netherlands and Indonesia over West New Guinea. Australians had welcomed and indeed relied upon the reiterated and unqualified declaration by Indonesian leaders that Indonesia would not resort to force in an endeavour to achieve its aims in West New Guinea. These declarations were made at times when the opportunities for and the prospects of negotiations of the rival points of view of Indonesia- and of the Netherlands were not as favorable as they are at the present time. Australia had indicated that there should be no armed conflict between two nations with both of whom it was friendly and that it regarded the issue between them as susceptible of a peaceful solution. " Consequently Australians were shocked and dismayed that Indonesia should openly declare its intention to resort to force as a means of concluding the issue in its own favour. For any country to resort deliberately to bloodshed to gain such an objective could not fail to lose its respect and sympathy within the international community. Further, to introduce warfare and the abiding animosities which it was prone to generate into this hitherto peaceful region could create intolerable burdens for all the peoples of the area and for their descendants for generations to come. And not only was the threat or use of force expressly forbidden by the U.N. Charter but in this case the use of force would be a direct breach of faith with Australia having regard to the assurances which had been given at the highest level. " The Minister said that along with all Australians he hoped that Indonesia and the Netherlands would enter such negotiations, preferably under the aegis of the United Nations in one form or another, and that they would both pursue these negotiations patiently to a conclusion satisfactory to themselves and to the community of nations. "The Minister pointed out that Australia was not a party principal in the dispute, but had, nonetheless, a great interest in the ability of the indigenous people of West New Guinea to have the ultimate choice of their own future whether it be for integration with Indonesia or for independence, with or without any relationship with the people of East New Guinea: Australia intended to lead the peoples for which it was at present responsible in East New Guinea to the point of exercising their own choice. It found it difficult to believe, particularly in the present state of world opinion, that Indonesia would wish ultimately to deny the people of West New Guinea a like opportunity for national choice. " So far the Australian Government had not sought to interfere in the course pursued by either of the parties to the dispute. But the inescapable fact was that there was a threat of armed conflict between the disputants and possibly between others who would come to their support. The Minister said he had taken steps to convey to the Indonesian and Netherlands Governments respectively the Australian view that there should be no resort to force and that both governments should open negotiations without any preconditions but with neither party unmindful of the Charter principle that the indigenous people should ultimately be afforded an opportunity of choosing for themselves their future government and their international relationships. " While the path to negotiation was open, as he believed it still was, the Minister thought it neither helpful nor appropriate to publicly canvass those courses of action which Australia might pursue in other eventualities. Apart from all else, Australians would recognize that in some, at least, of those eventualities, the interest and course of action of the governments of countries outside the immediate region would have great significance. "The Minister said that the Indonesian Ambassador had asked to see the Prime Minister personally and had done so this Saturday afternoon. The Prime Minister had conveyed to General Suadi the substance of the views set out in the Minister's statement." </para>
                </quote>
                <para>I would like to point out to the House that the action thus taken by the Government was wholly in accord with our frequently enunciated policy in the West New Guinea dispute. It was wholly consistent with the Government's statement of April 1961. On both occasions we said we opposed force; on both occasions we said that we had a great interest that the people of West New Guinea should ultimately choose their own future; and on both occasions we said that we stood for peaceful negotiation, though in April we recognized that it was for the Netherlands as the sovereign power to decide whether to negotiate or not, whereas in December we knew that the Netherlands was prepared to do so. We have reason to believe that the Government's commendation of negotiations on 30th December, 1961, was welcomed by both parties and was not without consequence. </para>
                <para>On 2nd January, 1962, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands indicated that his Government sought " negotiation in a wider framework ", that it did not set the principle of self-determination as a pre-condition of negotiations, but that in any discussions it had to consider the interests of the population in the first place. </para>
                <para>Arising out of the Government's action of 30th December, 1961, the Indonesian Foreign Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Subandrio,</inline> appealed to us for understanding of the Indonesian position. I pointed out on 4th January, 1962, in a statement directed to that appeal, and plainly not a recapitulation of the total position of the Government, that the Australian Government's commendation of a peaceful and patient negotiation sprang from an understanding of the Indonesian and of the Netherlands point of view, and that our attitude in the dispute, including our disapproval of the use of armed force and the threat of it, did not derive from any hostility towards Indonesia. The precise terms of my statement might be incorporated in " Hansard ". </para>
                <para>Shortly thereafter Cabinet undertook a most exhaustive review of the situation. Following that meeting the Prime Minister set out on behalf of the Government once more the firm principles guiding our approach to the dispute, and the consistent manner in which these principles were being applied to the developing situation. On 25th January, I declared publicly that the Government's policy as stated by the Prime Minister on 12th January was unchanged. That declaration stands. The statements that were issued on 4th, 12th and 25th January, were as follows: - </para>
                <para>STATEMENT MADE BY THE MINISTER FOR EXTERNAL AFFAIRS, ON THURSDAY, 4th JANUARY, 1962.  " The Minister for External Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> Barwick, said to-day that he had no official confirmation of a published report that Indonesia had modified its claims to West New Guinea so as to make room for the eventual choice by Papuans of their own future. " He said he hoped that the report had a sufficient foundation to indicate that the two parties would proceed to the conference table as he had suggested in his earlier statement. " Referring to the hope expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Subandrio</inline> that Australia would understand Indonesia's position, the Minister said that the Australian Government's commendation of peaceful and patient negotiation to harmonize the respective views of Indonesia and of the Netherlands sprang, not from any misunderstanding of the Indonesian position, but rather from an understanding both of the Indonesian and of the Netherlands points of view. " As long ago as the occasion of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Subandrio's</inline> visit to Australia, the Australian Government told the Indonesian Government that it would respect an agreement in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter made by Indonesia with the Netherlands in their dispute over West New Guinea provided that agreement was arrived at freely, not under duress or the threat of force. " <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> said that Australia had demonstrated in many ways its desire to promote and maintain the friendliest relations with the people of Indonesia and the Government did not underestimate the value of Indonesian friendship or of the continuance of peaceful relations between Indonesia and the Netherlands. " He said he desired to make it clear that neither his comment on the declared intention to resort to force nor the commendation of negotiation without pre-conditions was made in any spirit of hostility towards Indonesia. " Australia was unquestionably opposed to the use of force to settle international issues and was devoted to the peaceful solution of international problems. Indeed, it was with respect to the use of force that the Indonesian Government had sought from the Prime Minister and had received Australia's views. " Australia was anxious that the real opportunities and prospects for successful negotiation which now exist should not be lost. "The Minister emphasized that there was no present occasion for inflammatory or exaggerated statements as to the effect of the dispute on Australia. In particular, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> said that he saw no evidence whatever of any present threat to Australia or to any Australian territorial interest. " He felt sure that Australians realized the great importance of inducing a calm atmosphere in which both nations, with each of whom Australia was friendly, should be able to pursue their negotiations." </para>
                <para>STATEMENT MADE BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RIGHT HON. R. G. MENZIES, ON FRIDAY, 12lh JANUARY, 1962.  " 1. The Cabinet has devoted a long time to a review of the more recent developments affecting Indonesia and West New Guinea. It was greatly assisted by a full factual review submitted by the Minister for External Affairs. The  President  of Indonesia has not only repeated his nation's claims to the sovereignty of West New Guinea, but has made statements of intention to assert those claims by force of arms unless the Netherlands gives ground. " 2. We are not a party principal to this dispute, but we have a lively interest in its settlement. As good friends and neighbours of the Dutch, and good friends and neighbours of the Indonesians, our great desire is for a peaceful settlement, not one compelled by threat or duress. " 3. Looking at the matter in a world setting, we point out that the Charter of the United Nations requires the peaceful settlement of international disputes, and imposes obligations upon member nations to refrain from the threat or use of arms for the enforcement of territorial claims. "4. Australia, as a loyal member of the United Nations and as a nation vitally concerned with the preservation of peace in South-East Asia and the South-West Pacific, believes that it is essential for civilization that all nations should settle any differences by negotiation and not by force or the threat of force. " 5. In the matter of West New Guinea, we have repeatedly made it clear that should the Nether lands and Indonesia come to an agreement, without force or duress, we would respect that agreement; and that  we were and are deeply attached to the attainment by- under-developed peoples, after adequate and helpful preparation,, of the right to choose their own future. We ourselves have for many years followed and will, of course, continue to follow these ideas in the Australian territory of Papua and the Australian Trust Territory of New Guinea. " 6. Our support of these ideas is not based upon hostility to any other nation, for we wish to live at peace with all. In our own case, we apply them out of a humane desire to raise the standards of living and of government among people for whom we feel a great moral responsibility. " 7. We were on more than one occasion pleased to receive and to accept from the Government of Indonesia explicit assurances that arms would not be employed to enforce territorial claims to West New Guinea, and that Indonesia did not and would not make any claim to that portion of Papua and New Guinea for which we have direct responsibility. We feel that we are entitled to rely upon the performance of those assurances, to which we have attached and still attach the greatest importance. " 8. We are reluctant to believe that the threats of war now being made by the Indonesian Government, in breach of these assurances, arc to be followed by action. War in this corner of the world is quite unnecessary, for the doors to free negotiation are wide open. Such a war would solve no problems, but would create animosities from which nobody except the Communist powers could profit. The paramount interests of the people of New Guinea, both West and East, and indeed of South-East Asia generally, cannot be served but must be damaged by war. " 9. This is not a time for either bellicose or extravagant comments. The Government of Australia simply says that it recognizes and will discharge its prime responsibility for the security of Australia, its territories and its people. Having regard not only to our treaty rights and responsibilities but also to the hard facts of international life, we act in close consultation with the great free powers, particularly Great Britain and the United States of America. No responsible Australian would wish to see any action affecting the safety of Australia on the issues of war or peace in this area except in concert with our great and powerful friends. " 10. It is for this reason that we are in constant contact with London and Washington and the United Nations Head-quarters, steadfastly maintaining the basic principle that the peaceful settlement Of disputes is the central theme and the supreme mission of the United Nations and indeed of any civilized order in the world, and that we are therefore deeply anxious that the West New Guinea problem should be resolved by negotiation, not under threat, but with a desire to do the best for the human beings who make up the population of the disputed territory. "11. We are constantly exploring with our principal allies the possibilities of securing United Nations activities in bringing about free negotiation and a peaceful settlement." </para>
                <para>STATEMENT MADE BY THE MINISTER FOR EXTERNAL AFFAIRS ON THURSDAY, 25th JANUARY, 1962.  "The Minister for External Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> Barwick, referred to-day to reports claiming that the Australian Government was due to change its attitude on the West New Guinea issue. ' These reports, acknowledged to be unofficial, are speculative ', <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> said. ' The Government's position in respect of the dipute was set out in a statement made in Canberra by the Prime Minister on January 12th after Cabinet had discussed the matter. That statement makes it clear that the Government desires settlement of the dispute by peaceful means and not under duress or threat of war. The Prime Minister's statement also makes it clear that Australia pre-eminently desires that the Papuans of West New Guinea should, in due course, be given the right to choose their own future. The Government has made no other decision. " In conformity with this unchanged policy, on the one hand steps have been taken to persuade the parties to go to the conference table, and on the other the Government has expressed its disapproval of resort to war or threats of war. However, the ultimate resolution of the matter is one for the parties themselves with the assistance, the Australian Government hopes, of the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Australia, not being a party principal to the dispute, is not itself involved in these negotiations. It has made it abundantly clear that it will respect the voluntary agreement of the parties in conformity with the principles of the Charter'." </para>
                <para>I should like at this point to invite the attention of honorable members to suggestions made in some quarters that Australia should initiate action in the United Nations to ensure the application of Charter principles in the case of West New Guinea. The House will be aware of important changes in the composition and complexion of the United Nations, resulting from its greatly expanded membership in recent years. In 1945 there were 51 members. By 1957 the number had grown to 82. To-day the United Nations numbers 104 sovereign states. The great majority of the new membership is made up of countries which have newly achieved independence. Australia has welcomed their accession to independence and has voted consistently in favour of their admission to the United Nations. Australia believes that the new members have it in their hands to make important contributions to the work of the world organization and to strengthen the purposes and principles for which it stands. </para>
                <para>At the same time, it is a simple fact of international life to-day that many of the new nations which have lately emerged from colonial rule quite understandably bring to the consideration of problems which have colonial aspects attitudes strongly influenced by past experience. In this they are under constant pressure and incitement from the Communist powers who see in the colonial question an instrument for the advancement of their own interests. In the presence of strong anti-colonial attitudes and the desire to maintain the territorial integrity of newly independent nations, the principles of self-determina tion are apt to receive less emphasis and indeed to be regarded as merely competitive with, and certainly not paramount to, what are considered to be the necessities and urgencies of anticolonialism. </para>
                <para>This is not the place to discuss the apparent trends in the interpretation of the charter but it will not have escaped the notice of honorable members that there is a growing tendency to argue that sanctions may be imposed in the name of anti-colonialism - even resort to armed force for the purpose of " liberation " - that word of glorious history with which some countries try to justify acts of conquest or dispossession. </para>
                <para>In such a situation, Australia must view the political realities clearly, without self-delusion that the organization is the same as it was in 1945. The relevance of the voting upon the Netherlands proposal will not escape the House. </para>
                <para>There seems to be little point in courting the exercise of a veto by the Soviet Union in the Security Council, and whilst other possibilities of peacefully resolving the dispute remain open, we might well avoid presenting the Assembly with risks of a failure to resolve, or of an unsatisfactory resolution of, the dispute. It is not without significance that neither of the parties, nor any member of the organization, has seen fit to refer this dispute either to the Security Council or to the Assembly. Nonetheless, the desirability or otherwise of a reference to the United Nations has been considered carefully by the Government at each stage of the developing situation, and it has maintained regular diplomatic contact with our allies and friends in the United Nations in relation to the suitability and timing of a reference of the dispute to the organization. </para>
                <para>I have felt compelled to say these things lest there may be a too facile belief in the efficacy of a reference of the West New Guinea dispute to the United Nations, but this does not mean that we should take a too tragic view of the effectiveness of the United Nations in the long term. We believe - and the record of the 16th Session gives a firm foundation for this belief - in the basic good sense and good faith of the great majority of the non-Communist members of the United Nations, and we believe that in general, policies which combine patience and moderation, with a firm attachment to principle, will come to command the support of the great majority of the members of the organization. </para>
                <para>Australia's support of the United Nations has never been in question. We have taken and will always take, our Charter responsibilities seriously. We have shown, and will continue to show in practical ways the high importance we attach to maintaining it as an effective instrument for the preservation of international peace and security, and for the economic and social advance of mankind. </para>
                <para>I take leave now to refer to another matter. At one stage there were suggestions in certain quarters that this Government should not only publicly address itself to the situation which would arise in the event of hostilities but also make public commitments about what it would do in that event. In addition to what I have already said, there are two observations here to be made - </para>
                <list type="loweralpha">
                    <item label="(a)">
                        <para>No responsible Government anywhere would contemplate doing that at a point of time when serious and sustained efforts are being made under the aegis of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to find a negotiated solution; and when responsible international opinion generally is overwhelmingly in favour of a peaceful settlement by negotiation, and is most deeply concerned that any outbreak of hostilities should be prevented from spreading into a general conflagration. Intense diplomatic activity to discourage resort to force, and the threat of it  -  a course in which the Government has quite vigorously joined - is, of course, a quite different matter. </para>
                    </item>
                    <item label="(b)">
                        <para>In terms of the hard facts of international life and in terms of our obligations to the international community, the actions of this Government must at the critical time take full account of the attitudes of our great allies and of the United Nations. </para>
                    </item>
                </list>
                <para>There can be no mistake about where we stand on this issue of force. No country has emphasized so consistently or so often in public statement and in private diplomacy the paramount need of removing any danger of a breach of the peace in our area. To this end we have addressed ourselves to the parties to the dispute, and in particular to Indonesia, and to our allies in this region. </para>
                <para>I have traced for the House some of the events which have occurred since the visit of General Nasution last year. I have indicated to the House some of the considerations which must be in mind in the discussion of the dispute and of our attitude to it. </para>
                <para>The Government has continued to press upon the parties that the paramount interests of all the people concerned is that there should be a just and peaceful settlement. It has continued to press very strongly, through dip lomatic channels, that the parties negotiate and that force be not resorted to, nor threat of it preclude or prejudice negotiations. For too long war-like threats were employed. Not the least of the dangers of such a course is that in arousing great emotion an atmosphere may be created in which negotiation becomes impossible. The deliberate parading of military potential in support of a political and diplomatic objective, even where that objective is sought urgently and with great emotion and conviction of its justice and justification, is not to be condoned. This Government condemns it. </para>
                <para>But at the same time such a parade is not to be taken as a certain sign of crisis. Still less should it be taken as an occasion for bellicose statements which can only exacerbate the tensions of the moment and needlessly damage the goodwill we seek with our neighbours and with their and our friends of Asia. In all this Australians must not lose sight of our major interest in reducing the spread of communism to our north-west, in preventing hostilities in an area so proximateto our shore, and in promoting and extending our friendship with the people of Indonesia, with whom we desire to live, through the generations, in terms of good neighbourliness, both peoples, we would hope, bent on arresting the southward thrust of communism. </para>
                <para>As 1 said on the 4th January, what is required is a calm atmosphere in which the parlies may advance peacefully to a negotiated agreement to resolve the dispute. </para>
                <para>I would like, in making this statement to the House, to emphasize to both the parties that they should approach the negotiating table with goodwill, patience and flexibility, eschewing rigid altitudes which preclude progress. Each party, neither being excepted, carries a heavy responsibility not to remain obdurate and thus to expose the peoples of this area to hostilities, either as an incident, or as a means of the resolution, of the dispute. The enduring consequences, as well as the immediate risk of extension, of such hostilities, make imperative demands upon the parties to leave no stone unturned in the endeavour to reach a negotiated solution. </para>
                <para>Australia, both under the prior Administration, and under the present Government, has made it perfectly clear that it regards the future of West New Guinea as a matter" for the determination of Indonesia and the Netherlands. I take leave, however, once more to say that Australia wants to see self-determination in New Guinea and to impress on both parties that whatever the outcome as to the immediate administration of the territory, the course which has already been commenced towards self-government and free choice of their future for the Papuan population of West New Guinea should be maintained. Indeed, the parties, both of them, might well recognize that the legitimate aspirations of the Papuans themselves have been so far aroused that, no matter how other circumstances may change their aspirations, they are likely now to persist with increasing strength until the day of their satisfaction. </para>
                <para>The present situation is most delicate and most complicated. It is, on appearances, a paradoxical situation. On the one hand there are threats of force and apparent preparations for its use and for defence against its use. On the other hand, these activities are accompanied by avowals by the parties principal that hostilities are not desired or intended, and by expressions of optimism that a peaceful settlement will be reached and, indeed, that progress is being made towards such a settlement. </para>
                <para>Negotiations proper have not yet begun, but there have been separate discussions with the Dutch ' and the Indonesians by U Thant and others and various informal contacts. The search for a basis for negotiations is continuing and there are improved prospects of the parties coming together in the reasonably near future for substantive discussions. </para>
                <para>Public statements in the last few days by the two Governments indicate that they have now agreed to enter secret preliminary discussions. The Australian Government welcomes this agreement wholeheartedly and hopes it may constitute a significant step towards a just and peaceful  settlement. For the Australian Government's own part this development confirms it in its view of the wisdom of the policy which it has adopted towards the dispute and which I have just now recapitulated to honorable members. But progress will require not only goodwill but great discretion on the part of both Governments. In Indonesia and the Netherlands, national interests and public sentiment are high; and the two governments have no diplomatic relations. The procedure they are now apparently adopting - and it seems a wise one - is to explore in private and without publicity the possibilities of agreement. In these circumstances the absence of public evidence will not necessarily mean that progress is not in effect being made towards a settlement. This Government will of course keep the House as fully informed as circumstances allow consistent with its obligations to preserve the confidence of the two governments. </para>

                        <para>.  - Prior to the adjournment of this debate I said that the Australian Labour Party welcomed the bill. I said also that, as the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt)</inline> stated in 1959 when he introduced the Commonwealth Banks Bill, the Development Bank is an amalgamation of what was the Mortgage Bank Department and the Industrial Finance Department of the Commonwealth Bank. It is true that there have been some alterations. In the original measure establishing the bank, there is a safeguard for the protection of private banks. One would readily expect that, because many of my friends opposite would not be here but for the finance and work of the private banks. The act prohibits the Development Bank from dealing with people with whom the private banks want to deal. The Development Bank is told, in effect, that it need not be much concerned about the securities offered; that it must be prepared to lend money after having had a look at the applicant and judging whether he is likely to make a success of his undertaking. If the bank believes that he will be successful, it is to give him the money and, in effect, wish him godspeed. That, of course, has never been the principle of a private bank. The first thought of private banks is whether the security offered is adequate. </para>

If his eyeballs are all right, he is a likely looking fellow, and there is some chance of his success, he gets the money. </para>

                            <para>-  If it came to looks, the honorable senator and I would nearly have a photo finish. The Government, also, has made the private banks agents of the Development Bank. Before this bank was established, private banks usually sent clients to their hire-purchase departments. If a person were badly in need of money, he would just have to pay interest at the flat rate of 6 per cent, or 7 per cent, which, as every one knows, works out over a period of years at 16 per cent, or 17 per cent., or sometimes more. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue>
                    <para>We welcome the bill and we ask why the Government does not place the Development Bank in the same position as a private bank, which can lend money to any person engaged in primary production or, in fact, to any person who, for instance, needs machinery to help him either in primary production or in an industrial enterprise. There is nothing in the legislation to prevent the bank from lending money to city industrial concerns that cannot obtain money elsewhere. </para>
                    <para>The act gives the bank the right to receive money on deposit. I should like the Minister, when replying, to state the number of depositors and the gross amount deposited with the Development Bank. The latest report of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation does not show these figures. The bank is told that it cannot have as a client a person who can get elsewhere the money that he requires. A person who can be induced to go along to the hire-purchase departments of private banks is not likely to be passed up by them. Altogether, the Government has done as much as it could do to circumscribe the Development Bank. I believe that but for the Country Party there would be no Development Bank. To be quite candid, I could not see the Liberal section of the Government establishing such a bank. </para>
                    <para>As far as I can ascertain, the present capital of the Development Bank is £21,700,000, and its liabilities total £45,000,000. But the Commonwealth Trading Bank, the capital of which is £11,300,000, has liabilities of £360,000,000. This situation, I think, requires some explanation by the Minister. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> is concerned about the interest rate. The Government has the final say on the bank interest rate within the nation. It can decide what the rate is to be. Seemingly, in this instance, it has fixed the rate at about 6 per cent, or 7 per cent. I understand that the average rate charged by the Development Bank is 6£ per cent., but I agree that if this bank were allowed to operate in the same manner as other banks, the interest rates could be reduced. That would mean providing the bank with a much larger amount of money for lending purposes. I think everybody will agree that interest payments are a crippling cost to the farmer. Admittedly, the farmer must rely on the seasons for the success or otherwise of his labours. But he seems to be in the hands of banks much more than other persons in the community. In view of the state of our overseas balances, I think it would be a good thing if the farmer could obtain loans at lower rates of interest. </para>
                    <para>The farmer does not like to be forced to borrow money and he finds himself in his present predicament because of the action of this Government in removing all economic controls. I marvel how any young man to-day can contemplate going on the land. How much would he need to set himself up on a property? It would cost thousands to set him up in wheat growing or sheep raising in Victoria. I venture to suggest that the cost of placing a yong man on the land with any hope of making a success of the venture, taking into account the seasons, would be as high as £15,000 or £20,000. The small holdings in Victoria that were created by breaking up the very big stations are being merged into big holdings. No one wants that to happen, but the cost factor is forcing the amalgamation of small holdings. The Government must accept a lot of the blame for what is happening because it has placed votes before principles. It removed economic controls. It would cost a very great deal of money to place a young man on the land to-day and give him an even chance of success. </para>
                    <para>The Labour Party wants the Development Bank to expand so that it will be able to compete successfully against the fringe banking institutions. The Government, while  it  can fix bank interest rates, will not attempt to alter the Constitution in order to gain power over the fringe banking institutions. As was pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> and other honorable senators, interest rates charged by fringe banking institutions are much higher than those charged by the orthodox banks. I class as fringe banking institutions the huge corporations - the insurance companies and the big wool brokers, such as Goldsbrough Mort and Company Limited, New Zealand Loan and. Mercantile Agency Company Limited and a number of others. </para>

                    <para>To-day Victoria is suffering one of the dryest periods in its history. A tribute should be paid to the persons responsible for controlling Victoria's water resources for having so organized things as to allow the metropolitan area to use the amount of water that it is permitted to use, having regard to the very small amount of rain that has fallen in the last six months. The dry conditions are also affecting the country areas. It is true that wheat planting may be delayed for a few weeks yet, but the lack of rain is causing a great deal of concern to people who want to grow grass for fodder. If the farmer is forced to buy fodder in order to hold his stock rather than sell it at depressed prices, he will need to raise money. </para>
                    <para>Undoubtedly, the farmers would like to obtain their finance from the Commonwealth </para>
                    <para class="block">Development Bank, but the bank cannot lend money to them if they are able to obtain their requirements from private banks. Any farmer who obtains his finance from the Development Bank will get a better deal than he would have obtained from a private bank. But how many people will the extra capital of £5,000,000 accommodate? In the financial year ended 30th June, 1961, the bank approved loans to 2,060 persons. Of that number 961 persons sought loans of amounts between £2,001 and £5,000. The total value of loans to those 961 persons was £3,348,000. Of the 961 successful applications for loans between £2,001 and £5,000, 53 were for industrial purposes. </para>
                    <para>The Commonwealth Development Bank should be given every encouragement. I should like to see it become the main banking institution for our primary producers. Everybody knows that rural borrowers may obtain money from hire-purchase companies at <inline font-style="italic">Ai</inline> per cent. - a flat rate of interest - for the purchase of farm implements. I know that it adds up to between 12 per cent, and 14 per cent, by the time the loan is paid back. </para>

                            <para>- I was given those figures by a man who has taken out a loan. He is a member of another place, and I thought he would know. However, I am delighted that it is 9 per cent, or 9i per cent. That makes a great difference to those who cannot come within the ambit of the bank's loans. If this nation wants anything to-day, it wants production, particularly of those products that can be exported. Therefore, we should enlarge the capital of the Development Bank when additional capital is needed. This is its second enlargement by the Government in this financial year, but I should like the Government, when it considers this legislation in the future, to take away many of the impediments that can stop primary producers from obtaining loans from the bank. </para>

                    <para>In the main, primary producers are unfortunate people because they get the rough end of the stick. We in the cities, with our unions, do not get all we want, but we look after ourselves. There are ways of doing this, though some honorable senators might not like them. However, if we think we can win, we do not argue about the way in which we should achieve our objective, if we think we are entitled to strive for it. I do not disagree with that, but the farmer is not in the same position. He has to put up with a lot of things. It is true that the Government looks after the wheat farmer to some extent by guaranteeing the cost of production of 100,000,000 bushels for the export trade. A sum of £13,500,000 goes each year to the dairy industry, but not necessarily to the dairy farmers. The consumers get a fair share of it, because if the subsidy were not provided and they had to pay the cost of production of butter they would pay a great deal <inline font-style="italic">more</inline> for it than they now pay. </para>

I recall that when I spoke on this subject a couple of years ago I went to the trouble to ascertain the amount of butter consumed per head in Australia at that time compared with consumption ten years previously. The drop in consumption really surprised me. It is silly to say that any person, whoever he is, would eat margarine if he could get butter. The only thing that prevents people from buying butter is the cost of production. </para>

                    <para>I would not say that wool-growers are in a bad plight at the moment, but they are not far from it. The wool industry will doubtless be in trouble if nothing is done to prevent the operation of pies, irrespective of the proposals contained in the recent report of the committee of inquiry on that industry. The Government can give that report away as far as its helping the woolgrower is concerned. I read in one newspaper - it was not the "Sydney Morning Herald "; it was an evening newspaper in Sydney, for what that is worth - that the wool-growers are complaining very bitterly about the recent wool sales. Honorable senators opposite can place as much reliance on that report as they wish. I am always a bit careful about accepting the accuracy of these reports, but I read this one with interest because it dealt with a matter that is of grave concern to Australia. It stated that the Japanese are still operating pies at the New South Wales wool sales. I do not say that the report' is right or wrong; I was not present at the sales. But the allegation is serious enough for some of us to try to find out whether or not it is true. </para>
                    <para>When the Senate is considering an amendment to this legislation one has an opportunity to study Australia's rural industries. Though some of them are being helped, others are not. Meat seems to be holding its own at the moment, and let us hope it will continue to do so. But the observations that have been made about this industry and other primary industries have not taken into consideration what may happen if, as seems certain, the United Kingdom joins the European Common Market. Unfortunately for Australia, the Minister for Trade <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen),</inline> according to reports of his visit to the United States of America, has not met with much success. So Australia seems to be in rather a bad position; we do not seem to be holding the sixteen alley, if I may use that term. Last year's report of the work of the Development Bank is most interesting. One portion of it states - </para>

                        <para>In determining whether or not to make finance available, the Development Bank is required to have regard primarily to the prospects of the borrowers' operations being successful and not necessarily to the value of the security available to support the loan. While the Bank seems to obtain the best security available for its loans, it nevertheless attaches primary importance to efficiency, managerial capacity and integrity of applicants, as well as their capacity to repay their borrowings within a reasonable time. </para>

                    <para class="block">I agree with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> said about short-term loans. Having a little knowledge of rural industries in my own State, I quite agree that the lending of money for a few short months would be of no great advantage to a person who wants to develop a rural property. It might tide him over until he sells his fat lambs or gets his wool cheque, but for the real development of his property he needs a loan for a reasonable period. Private banks are a bit wary and want to know what is most likely to happen, being concerned, as they always are, with only one thing - the profit motive. They might think that confidence will be restored. All of us, as Australians, hope that it will be. The people will then start to buy. In the main people buy to-day only on hire purchase. It is rather worrying to see the receipts of the savings banks going up and the hire-purchase debt going down and down, because that is not good for the economy of the country. People got into the frame of mind - I do not altogether agree with it - that it was good to earn as much as you could and to owe twice as much as you earned. I was never brought up to believe that that was a good thing, but in my younger days life was a lot tougher than it is now. The difficulty then was to find some one to owe money to. </para>

                        <para>. -  I cannot allow this opportunity to go by without saying a few words on this measure in support of the Government. I do not think that what I have to say has been mentioned by any one to whom I have listened. This is one of the measures which were forecast in the Governor-General's Speech. It is being brought down by the Government in an endeavour to relieve the present unemployment position. The Governor-General said that an amount of £5,000,000 would be allocated to the Development Bank by way of capital so that the bank could make advances for developmental purposes, both rural and industrial. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I have no doubt that when this bill is passed many of the applicants who will receive advances will convert their money into man-hours, as it were. Many people now unemployed will be employed in helping to develop industries and properties. I, for one, am pleased to be associated with a measure designed to help the development of Australia. It can be fairly said that the Development Bank is playing - an ever-increasing role in the development of this country. Before an applicant can obtain an advance from this bank for developmental purposes, he must have been refused, an advance by a private trading bank or other money-lending institution. </para>
                    <para>I think that in the old days (he trading banks assisted persons on rural properties to a much greater extent than they are doing at present. I can say with safety that 20 or 30 years ago private trading banks had a much greater part in the banking structure of Australia than at the present time. 1 have read that in the last year or so the amount of capital provided for the community by the private trading banks has dropped from about 50 per cent, to about 25 or 30 per cent, and that more and more finance is being obtained from the fringe banking institutions. </para>
                    <para>With the large-scale development that is taking place, it is essential that farmers who require finance should be able to obtain it. Evidently the best method of obtaining finance, in the initial stages anyway, is through the Development Bank. Largescale development is taking place throughout Australia, but particularly in Western Australia. Over the last three years the Government of that State has thrown open new areas of land at the rate of about 1,000,000 acres a year. We should realize the need for finance to develop those areas. Some completely new areas are being taken up. Usually those areas are allocated by the State Government through a board to people who can show that board that they can provide sufficient finance for at least the initial stage of the development of their properties. </para>
                    <para>In 1949-50, in the southern part of Western Australia many people, with the best intentions in the world, took up blocks of 2,000, 3,000 or <inline font-style="italic">5,000</inline> acres with about £4,000 or £5,000 to invest. They spent that money on their properties in clearing the land and buying plant. Then they ran out of money. They did not have enough money to buy seed and superphosphate for the first year's operations. The then State government made finance available through the State Treasury. Those advances were administered by the Rural and Industries Bank of Western Australia in order to help those people carry on with the development of their properties. Finance amounting to £2,000 or £3,000 per settler was made available. </para>
                    <para>The spending of that money achieved the desired result of enabling those farmers to plant their crops and take them off. The result is that the farmers are still on their properties, whereas if that finance had not been made available they would not have been able to carry on and their properties would have been sold up. Since that time the State Government, through the Rural and Industries Bank, has made finance amounting to more than £100,000 a year available to farmers in those areas in special circumstances. The farmer is not required to pay interest for the first three years or to repay the capital for five years. If we want to put people without finance in new areas that is the type of finance that will have to be provided by the Development Bank. </para>

                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline>
                        said that he did not want to engage in party political tactics, but felt bound to say that the financial policy of the Development Bank was restricted by the Government through the Reserve Bank of Australia. He quoted various statements to that effect. I do not deny that for one moment. That was mentioned in the report of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation. In the introduction on page 5 of that report it is stated that Australia had quite a degree of inflation when those restrictions were imposed. I quote the following passage from the report: -
                    </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>By the end of 1960-61, inflationary tendencies arising from excess demand had almost disappeared . . . </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That means that after the Government's restrictive credit policies had been in force, by the end of that year the inflationary tendencies had almost disappeared. The report continues -   . . and the balance of payments outlook was considerably improved. However, production in certain sectors, particularly of some building materials, textiles, motor cars and durable consumer goods, was depressed through falling demand and unemployment had risen very significantly. </para>
                    <para class="block">The report goes on to refer to the balance of payments position. It shows that in the year 1959-60 Australia had a net trading deficit of £219,000,000. The report says that Australia faced a very bad result. However, the Government took the right steps to correct the economic trends at that time, harsh as those steps were. It appears that the steps that the Government took on that occasion had the desired effect. </para>
                    <para>The report of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation also mentions one other matter to which I should like to refer before I conclude my speech. I believe it should be mentioned. The Development Bank supplies technical officers to advise people engaged in various industries on the best ways of conducting their businesses. Although it is specifically stated that the bank makes finance available for mining, I believe that its capacity to do so is very limited. The limitation is not so much on the finance as on the ability of technical officers to assess whether or not the bank should make finance available to a particular project. I strongly urge the Government to suggest that the Development Bank endeavour to obtain technical officers who are associated with and know the mining industry so that those officers can go out and investigate particular mining jobs and possibilities. </para>
                    <para>In my travels throughout Australia, I have come to know of quite a few people who have every chance of success but who cannot find the money to install the necessary plant. I know that some people will say that that is a job for a company; but as you know, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> no one has money to invest in ventures such as gold mining prospects in the north of Western Australia. People can invest their capital at 7, 8 and 9 per cent., and at 7 per cent, with a good deal of security. Such risk capital is not available at the moment. I could take honorable senators to places in the north of Western Australia which have large deposits that could be worked. They have been assayed and there are thousands and thousands of tons of ore that will average an ounce of gold to a ton of ore. I think those deposits should be exploited. There are many other matters that I should like to discuss, but the hour is late. I conclude by commending the Government on its action in stepping up the capital of this most important bank by £10,000,000 this year. I understand that that represents an increase in the capital of the bank of almost 40 per cent. As further finance is required, I am sure that the Government will see that it is forthcoming. I support the bill. </para>

                        <para>. -  lt is gratifying to the Australian Labour Party to see that the Government is again following the advice of the party regarding the Commonwealth Development Bank. It is also gratifying to know that the Government parties, particularly the Australian Country Party, are hanging ontenaciously to the great banking structure that was founded and developed by the Labour Party - the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Nobody can speak in other than the highest terms of the service that the Commonwealth Bank has given to Australia ever since its inception. To see a government of the character of the present Administration lauding, in small measure at this stage, of course, the efficiency and the value of the service of and the great necessity for, the Commonwealth Bank is indeed encouraging. But the Government has not stopped there, of course. It is carrying on the semi-nationalization of the private banks. To see the Government relying, to a large extent, on the Commonwealth Bank to save it from economic pressure is really good. </para>

                    <para>When a similar transfusion of £5,000,000 in the capital of the Development Bank was made at the end of last year, I think I said at the time that it was a puny effort in relation to the magnitude of the developmental needs of a country with as much potential as Australia has, but that nevertheless it was a step in the right direction. If it is the true function of the Development Bank to assist industries that are screaming out for development, then the provision of £5,000,000 on this occasion is the very least that should be done. As a matter of fact, if the business of development was to be dealt with on a really national scale, this bank would have to be expanded immensely. </para>
                    <para>There is one factor about this legislation that intrigues me. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Arthur</inline> Fadden, when he was Treasurer, was very keen on the establishment of a Development Bank. The Country Party has wanted to see such a bank established and has pursued the matter. After the attempt that was made in 1961 to put the bank on an operational footing, the Minister for Trade and  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> went about the country promising rural industries and those engaged in them that if they  were suffering  embarrassment because of a lack of finance - to develop their undertakings, or if they - had been badly treated because of the financial credit squeeze imposed by the Government, he would see to it, through the medium of the Development Bank, that they obtained the relief they sought. I should like to know whether the Minister for Civil Aviation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Paltridge),</inline> who is in charge of the bill, would be kind enough to let me have figures showing how many applications were made to the bank for assistance and how many were refused, together with the number of instances in which the bank took over the liabilities of persons who had been seriously hurt financially because of the pressure of the credit squeeze. No doubt many of those who suffered financial embarrassment because they could not borrow from the Development Bank for development purposes, submitted applications to the private banks which, in turn, sent them on to their susidiaries. As we know, the private banks conduct an illicit type of money lending by means of institutions which carry on business done by registered money lenders under the money lenders acts in the States. Those institutions operate under the auspices of the banks. </para>
                    <para>I have had several cases submitted to me concerning people who had written to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McEwen</inline> and had their cases examined by the Development Bank, but who were unable to obtain assistance from the bank. In one case, I went to the trouble of obtaining from the individual who had made such an application the name of the bank with which he had transacted his business. It was a private bank. The bank said that, although his personal integrity was high and he was a hard worker, it was not within its power to assist him, though it gave him a very good reference. The case was referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McEwen,</inline> who has political influence/ of course, and who had promised iri the first place that he would see that finance was made available in such circumstances. The person concerned went back to the Development Bank, only to be told: " We cannot change our decision. It was made properly and honestly according to the policy on which ve are obliged to operate. But, of course., <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McEwen</inline> or the </para>
                    <para class="block">Treasurer might give other directions," The matter went back to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McEwen</inline> and to the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt),</inline> but a reply ultimately came back that nothing could be done. Yet, this was a hardworking man who was engaged in a developmental project. He was paying 121 per cent, interest on short-term loan money money that he had raised from a private finance company. He had a quantity of crop sown, but it was not nearly sufficient to cover the developmental work that he wanted to undertake. In two cases of which I have knowledge, cases of purely developmental nature, those concerned were not able to get the bank to do anything for them. </para>
                    <para>I have no quarrel with the Development Bank. It is most efficient and has done an excellent job in every field in which it has operated, but it is restricted in a very real sense. In effect, it must take over from the private banks business about which those banks have said: " We do not propose to enter that field. We cannot assist in it in any way." It is easy to see why the Government has decided to release credit and to relieve the economic situation that has arisen. Let me refer to the bankruptcy statistics contained in the thirty-third annual report of the Attorney-General. It is astounding to note that while the number of bankruptcies in this country was 206 in 1946-47, 271 in 1947-48, 302 in 1948-49, and 333 in 1949-50, at the present time it is 2,368, or over 2,000 more than in each of the years to which I have referred. Those figures are to be found in the information on classified bankruptcies in the eighth schedule, at page 10 of the report. That increase in bankruptcies has occurred at a time when, according to the boasts of the Government, our rural industries have been solid and when, it is said, such industries should not be embarrassed by want of finance; when prices have been good, and, according to the Government, our economy has been on top of the world. Of 40 farmers who went bankrupt during the year ended 30th June, 1961, five were dairy farmers, eleven were poultry farmers and one was a cane grower. Twenty-four graziers went bankrupt. There was a total of 114 bankruptcies in 1945-46. In 1960-61, of the persons who went bankrupt 81 were engaged in rural industries. So, I say there is a real necessity for this Development Bank. </para>
                    <para>A feature of this legislation which should be considered is that if we propose to engage in development in the real sense of the word we must give more generous treatment to the less affluent people, the pioneers who undertake development with little capital. Because of the instructions issued by the Government, a man who has established himself on a farm and who has been able or even forced to arrange for finance at an exorbitant rate of interest cannot get any relief at all. The bank cannot go in and take over the liabilities that have been created because the farmer has been forced to enter into hire-purchase agreements. That applies, of course, not only to farmers but to others who are engaged in developmental work. It is all very well to say that the bank may step in and help a person who is taking over virgin land or is engaging in some other new project, provided there is no private bank which would accept his proposal. If he can get accommodation elsewhere, he is made to go elsewhere. The Government is trying to make the private banks think that they are free, private enterprise organizations. All that has happened is that there has been an almost total nationalization of banking in its legitimate form. The banks have been issued with directions from the Government. They are being regulated or rationalized. That is a nice word, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Minister,</inline> is it not? </para>

                            <para>-  The meaning of rationalization is that an industry is nationalized, but any plums must go to those who have invested in the industry privately. In other words, a dividend must be paid to the private investor at the expense of the whole community, even though the risk is spread over the whole industry. The banks can conduct banking as banking and do quite a lucrative business as registered money-lenders at a flat rate of interest of 6 per cent, or higher. The true rate of interest charged is about 15 per cent. A rate of 12} per cent, is not uncommon. </para>

                    <para>I really think that the Minister for Trade <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> thought he could get away with his proposal. What was intended to happen and what actually did happen are entirely different, but it was not the fault of the Development Bank. The Government has adopted a credit policy which has the effect of restricting the availability of capital in order to allow part of the financial operations of this country to be placed in the hands of people who are not doing legitimate banking but who are moneylenders in the real sense of the term. This Government has given that section of the community a privilege and a protection, but it is not prepared to say that that privilege and protection must be utilized to help the man who is trying to develop with a small amount of capital. </para>
                    <para>I am pleased to be able to say that the Commonwealth Development Bank has been able to operate successfully within the restricted field that is open to it. It has done an immense job. But a still greater job remains to be done. The Government has the great task of ensuring that financial relief is given to remedy a situation in which the number of bankruptcies has risen from approximately 114 in 1945-46 to 2,368 at the present time. I do not say that all those bankruptcies were the result of financial pressure, but the increase has been far too large for the Government to be able to deny that there is something wrong with our credit structure. </para>
                    <para>The Development Bank should be made really strong and should be able to relieve any approved developmental project of the high rate of interest that is forced upon it by either the hire-purchase organizations or institutions which engage in other forms of banking and which are able to extort unreasonable rates of interest for short term loans. I do not think the Development Bank is <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> a position at present to do as I have suggested. I do not think that, under the present structure, it can extend its horizon to enable it to meet the demands of this young country which has the greatest potential in the world and which is screaming out for development. On the last occasion I went around the world I visited countries that were supposed to be poor, but their expenditure on various projects was £27,000,000 or more. I saw in West Germany, Beirut, Iraq and Iran development which leads me to say that we are just tinkering with the game, lt rests with us to decide whether we should develop the country vigorously, and whether we should do something for the people who, because of the restrictions that have been applied to our banking system, are paying exhorbitant and crippling rates of interest on short-term loans. </para>
                    <para>The bill does not provide the Development Bank with an opportunity to do the task that needs to be performed. This Government, and members of the Australian Country Party in particular, have submitted this proposal to the public and are saying "We are correcting the situation". But the bankruptcy figures and the high number of disillusioned applicants show that the bank is not doing the job adequately. Whilst I am very pleased to know that an extra sum of £5,000,000 is to be made available to the Development Bank, that sum is really only another pint of blood, as it were, infused into the system. I hope that the Government will soon make a worthwhile institution of the Development Bank. The bank is capable of doing things, but the Government's policy is hindering it. </para>

                        <para>. - in reply - It is always a matter of considerable satisfaction to a Minister to find that a Government measure is not opposed. Indeed on this occasion, as I understand the situation, it attracts the support of honorable senators in all parts of the Parliament. The Commonwealth Development Bank is a special purpose bank which was established only a couple of years ago to fill what was recognized as being a gap in the national equipment for the provision of finance. Because of the existence of that gap we as a nation had been unable to develop our resources to the extent that was considered desirable. I repeat that it is a special purpose bank. There is a disposition in the community and, if I may say so with respect, in the Parliament <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> regard this bank as being comparable wilh a bank in the ordinary sense of the term. </para>

                            <para>- You just keep quite. I suggest that that very significant fact underlines the difference between this bank and other banks. This misconception to which I refer runs to extremes. In some comments that have been made about the bank, there is the suggestion that the bank itself is not completely fulfilling the function for which it was set up. Suggestion is made that some types of advance which should attract Development Bank support have been rejected. That sort of criticism we get at one extreme. At the other extreme we get the sort of criticism that was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> and echoed by other Opposition speakers, who seem to regard this institution as a medium which should be developed into a banking organization in the widest and most usual sense. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> made the remark that in certain circumstances it could possibly put the other banks out of business. </para>

He said, " out of business ".I quote <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> on this, because it represents an opinion that is all too frequently held about the purpose of the Development Bank. The bank is established to fill a gap. It is a special purpose bank. It is not to enter into competition with the Commonwealth Trading Bank, the Rural and Industries Bank of Western Australia, the Rural Bank of New South Wales, or any private trading bank in the Commonwealth. That is not the purpose of the Development Bank. So important do I regard a proper understanding of this that, without apology, I propose to read a paper prepared and issued by the Commonwealth Development Bank, which puts on record the bank's policy and practice in respect of loans.

                    <para>This advance of £5,000,000 in additional capital has been described by some as a small advance. Other senators have said, "Last year we told you that you would want more money ". In reply to that sort of argument, I can only say that when this Government established this bank two years ago, and began its operations by a transfer from the Reserve Bank of £5,000,000, which was added to the then existing resources of the bank, the Government stated that as this bank required more capital it would be furnished with more capital, and the Government has done just that. As more capital has been required, it has been provided. As I sat here and listened to some of the early criticism that came from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey,</inline> who led for the Opposition, it appeared to me that he was advocating a policy of transferring to this bank not what it wants now, not what it has a need for now, but an amount which will look after its requirements for the next two, five or ten years. I submit that as the bank's capital is appropriated from the Consolidated Revenue Fund - as it is taxpayers' funds - there is absolutely no merit in transferring now an amount that is not required for a specific purpose. The right and proper thing to do is to increase the bank's capital as capital is required consequent upon expanding business. </para>

                        referred to the fact that some applicants may have been denied advances. Not at any time has the bank been unable to meet applications for overdrafts because of shortage of funds.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooke</inline>
                        asked particularly about the number of loans that have been made by the bank. The most recent figures that I have are for the year 1960-61 in which no fewer than 2,060 applications were granted. That number represented about two-thirds of the number of applications received. No application was rejected for reasons that the bank was short of funds. I suggest that on any objective view of the matter the Government behaved reasonably in the matter of providing capital for the bank. It has not taken money from Consolidated Revenue before there has been a real demand for it.
                    </para>
                    <para>There was some criticism of the part the trading banks have played in the provision of long-term finance. The varying pattern of the provision of finance over a long period of years makes interesting history. lt is true that at one time the banks did make a practice of providing long-term finance. In the post-war years that policy has been modified - greatly in some cases. But, in the circumstances in which they find it necessary to operate it is not true to say that the banks have in any way failed to make available finance to the community generally. It must be acknowledged that this matter of provision of long-term finance - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> made a particularly direct and pertinent reference to it - is one in which there is an opportunity to strengthen the facilities that we have avail able. I remind the Senate that as recently as 7th February last the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> announced on behalf of the Government that discussions with the private banks were continuing in respect of a number of matters, including the all-important subject of the provision of long-term finance and practicability of the trading banks being -more active in this field. It may well be that quite soon we will be able to say something about that aspect. </para>
                    <para>Some comments were made about the interest rate charged by the Development Bank. According to the view taken the interest rate was claimed to be high to penal and it was claimed that the bank should not seek to make a large profit from its operations. The truth is that the bank docs not make a large profit. I am delighted to note - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> remarked on this fact - that a profit was made, but I think even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> will agree that a profit of £612,000 last year on funds employed of the order of £45,000,000 cannot be regarded as a large profit. It is interesting to observe that the rate charged  -  6 per cent, on overdrafts - results in a loss in respect of rural business. So, in criticizing the bank for charging a high rate of interest to primary producers, honorable senators must remember that the rural business of the bank returns no profit at all. In considering the rate charged by a bank one must have regard also to the cost of some of the money that is employed by the bank. A study of the balance sheet will show that the bank has on loan from the Commonwealth Savings Bank a substantial amount of money- about £16,000,000. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot say offhand but in order to meet its own interest commitment the Commonwealth Savings Bank would have to charge about 5 per cent. The Development Bank gets at 5 per cent, that portion of its funds that it acquires for lending purposes and re-lends it at 6 per cent. I mention this fact to indicate to honorable senators, particularly those from the Australian Country Party who commented on the interest rate, that the rate charged, far from being a penal rate, is one that does not show a profit in respect of rural business. As a matter of interest let me refer also to the hire-purchase rate. The' rate charged is 4i per cent, flat for rural borrowers and 4i per cent, for other borrowers. Those rates are equivalent to  a  true rate of 9 per cent, or <inline font-style="italic">9i</inline> per cent. </para>

                        <para>- People do not go along with money to a bank, knowing in advance that it does not have the ordinary banking facilities. What attraction is there for a depositor to bank his money with the Development Bank? What rate of interest could it pay if it is to let out rural loans at a rate which is already involving it in some loss? It is far better, I am sure every one will agree, that it continue to have access to the funds of the Comonwealth Savings Bank for this sort of deposit money. Indeed, the suggestion that it should be got from the public is impracticable, for the very good reasons that I have stated - this bank does not have the facilities that the people want when they conduct deposit business with a bank. </para>

                        referred also to the Development Bank's ratio of liabilities  to  capital and compared that with the ratio of liabilities to capital of the Commonwealth Trading Bank. He pointed to the fact that the Commonwealth Trading Bank's liabilities ran to some £300,000,000 - I am quoting from memory - as against a capital of £11,000,000. He said, "Why cannot the Development Bank have the same sort of ratio? " The answer lies in the fact that the Commonwealth Trading Bank's liabilities arise from the deposits it has received from people who bank with it, but the Development Bank, for the good reasons that I have stated, does not have that sort of deposit money.

                    <para>I wish to speak for a few minutes only on the interesting speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman.</inline> He raised the important subject of the position of the young farmer with his wife starting out on a block of land. He drew the picture, as all honorable senators knew it 30 or 40 years ago, of an institution such as the Agricultural Bank in Western Australia making an advance of 30s. an acre against land cleared. Of course, times and circumstances alter. There is no doubt that in their day the agricultural banks did a remarkably good job, but the plain fact is, as I am sure any farmer will agree, that people do not do that sort of pioneering to-day. Even if the rates of the agricultural banks were upgraded to make some comparison with what they did 30 or 40 years ago, they could not to-day provide the sort of finance which would attract young men to the land. I should like to make it perfectly clear, particularly for the benefit of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman,</inline> that the newness of a man on the land does not disqualify him from assistance by the Development Bank. Indeed, in its annual report last year, it laid down the standards that it adopts. It said - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>In determining whether or not to make finance available, the Development Bank is required to have regard primarily to the prospects of the borrower's operations being successful and not necessarily to the value of the security available to support the loan. While the Bank seeks to obtain the best security available for its loans, it nevertheless attaches primary importance to the efficiency, managerial capacity and integrity of applicants, as well as their capacity to repay thenborrowings within a reasonable time. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">There is another aspect of assistance to the new farmer which is personal but is of vital importance. A bank has to be very careful indeed that it saves the over-ambitious new farmer from overstretching himself. I ask the members of the Senate who are familiar with farming how many personal tragedies have they seen in rural areas because, unfortunately, young men have overstretched themselves financially. Necessarily, when assisting young men on the land, a bank must sometimes exercise a restraint which, in the short term, the applicant regards as something of a hardship but, in the long term, turns out to be very much to his benefit. </para>

                        mentioned the possibility of the Development Bank employing, in particular areas, men who have a special knowledge of those areas, to report to the bank on the possibility of applicants making a success of properties. It may come as somewhat of a surprise to some honorable senators when I say that the Government does not interfere in any way with the management or the administration of the bank, but I have taken a note of that suggestion so that the Treasurer might forward it to the bank for consideration and evaluation of its merit. I think I have covered the major points that were raised in the debate. I again express my satisfaction at the fact that the measure receives the support of the Senate.

From memory 1 quoted the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt)</inline> as indicating that for the September quarter of 1960 vehicle registrations were at the rate of 330,000 per annum, and that he regarded that as an excessive level. I find that my memory did not betray me, because the Treasurer, on 21st March last, dealing with the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Bill had this to say - </para>

                        <para>Registrations of new motor vehicles had, by the September quarter, 1960, risen sharply to a rate in excess of 330,000 a year. In November, I960, the month in which the increased tax was applied, they were 23 per cent, higher than November, 1959.

                    <para class="block">It is clear that, in the circumstances of that time, the production and registration of 330,000 vehicles a year was regarded as being of inordinate proportions. In recent months, discussions have taken place between the Government and the motor industry. Surely some understanding was come to about what represented a proper level of production in the industry. Surely the industry was not left to run free, without some indication from the Government of what a proper level of production would be. I merely ask the Minister whether there was any such discussion. If not, why not? If, in the circumstances of November of 1960, 330,000 registrations were regarded as inordinate, what is regarded as a satisfactory figure in the circumstances of to-day? </para>
                    <para>Am I right in assuming that the motor industry has a capacity production of 375,000 cars per annum? What I foresee, frankly, is that if the motor industry is left entirely to its own devices, without any indication from the Government, we will have a running free of production again, now that no restriction is imposed upon hire-purchase companies. If an inordinate demand was generated a year or two ago, it seems to me that the stage is set for that demand to be generated again. I believe it would be helpful to the trade, and to the community, if some idea were given of what the Government thinks is right in this matter. </para>
                    <para>Surely some discussion has taken place on this subject with the industry. I do not know how many Ministers were engaged in the conference that took place with the industry representatives, but I do know that a number of Ministers were present. Was any understanding arrived at? If the figure is confidential, I cannot ask that it be stated, but at least we should be told whether any understanding was arrived at. </para>

He will recall, I am sure, that when I spoke on this matter recently I indicated' to him that the fixation of sales tax at any time - past, present or future - is naturally related to the economic circumstances that exist at that time. The honorable senator refers to a situation that existed in September of 1960, when car registrations were running at the rate of 330,000 a year, and points to a statement made by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt)</inline> in respect of that rate. He must, if he is trying to present the whole picture, have regard to the other circumstances which existed at the time in the general economy and in the particular industry. </para>

                        asks: What is the Government going to do in the future? What rate is it going to tell the motor industry is acceptable for the present, for three months' time, for six months' time, and for twelve months' time? I put it to the honorable senator that that is not a reasonable or a practicable request. Private enterprise must have regard' to circumstances as they change. Private enterprise itself has a responsibility to forecast conditions, and to meet those conditions It is not for a government to move in and tell private enterprise what it regards as an acceptable limit. Assuming that it were the responsibility of a government to do that, would it go to the Ford company, the Chrysler company or whoever else manufactures motor cars and say, in effect, "This is it chaps; 300,000 cars a year". Having that number in mind the Government would then have to say to one company, "You can make 100,000"; to another, "You can make 125,000"; and to another, " You can make only 50,000 ". As I said the other night, that is not a practicable proposition, at least from this Government's point of view.

                    <para>The Government will continue to keep in close touch with the industry. It has made no prediction of what is a desirable rate. I do not doubt that the motor-car industry, having regard to the problems from which it is now ' emerging, will itself exercise a little care as to its rate of production in the future and, without anything but an exchange of ideas between the Government and itself, will produce cars at a rate which will be proper and appropriate to circumstances as they change. </para>

                        <para>. -  I am indebted to the Minister for Civil Aviation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Paltridge)</inline> for the time he took to give me that explanation, but it does not console me in the least. One of the factors at which' the industry would have looked in September of 1960 was the state of mind of the Government which induced it to take the drastic action which it took in so many directions. I would say that that was the most important factor in the situation at that time. It was an extraordinarily good guide to the trade to know that registrations of the order of 330,000 per annum were regarded as inordinate. If, after all the measures that were taken, the Minister is not in a position to say now - in the light of the altered conditions of to-day - what he regards as reasonable, then he is not giving leadership, and the Government is not giving leadership or proper guidance, to the industry. </para>

                    <para>The Government should be in a position to indicate what it thinks, in the circumstances of to-day, is a reasonable rate of production. The industry should know what is in the mind of the Government. Because of an absence of that knowledge, the industry will have no confidence. The industry may fear that the Government has in mind a much lower rate. It will be afraid to expand for fear the Government will rush in with another severe tax increase or with credit restrictions. I would say that, in the interests of the economy of the nation, the Government should give some guidance to an industry which is responsible for so much employment. It is really vastly important that the Government should give a lead to this industry by giving it some idea of the rate of production that is regarded as reasonable. Members of the Government have one figure in their minds. The figure of 330,000 was inordinate eighteen months ago and no expression of opinion comes from the Government to the industry. 1 say that that is not proper leadership from the Government to one of the most important industries in the country. </para>

                            <para>- I am not dealing with the virtue of what he said. The facts, as I recall them, are that we resumed, in committee, the consideration of the nine sales tax bills. I spoke on two occasions and completed what I had to say. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> rose and before he had spoken at all the Temporary  Chairman  of Committees addressed him. He referred to what had happened last Tuesday night and told <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> that he would not allow him to make a second-reading speech, that he had to confine his remarks to the ambit of the bill, that he could ask a question and so forth. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> expressed resentment at that approach, said that this was not the first time that this had been done and alleged bias against the Temporary  Chairman  of Committees. </para>

                            <para>-  All I say is that at  a  stage when nothing had happened he was not entitled to anticipate that there would be a breach of the Standing Orders. In my view, his action was precipitate and drew from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> a natural resentment. This case might well be met, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> if the Temporary  Chairman  of Committees were to see some degree of haste in his attitude. If he were to advise you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that there might have been some element of precipitance in what he did, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> might then be prepared to cancel, as it were, his part in the proceedings to date and we all might be able to get back on an even keel without the Senate being unduly disturbed. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </interjection><para>This is not a case of the fault or the matter originating on one side; there was some cause for resentment. For a senior member of the Senate who has an official position to be lectured before he had said anything at all was plainly not right, and it was bound to draw some resentment from the honorable senator. I shall not go into the question of terms and that type of thing. I believe it would be very much in the interests of the Senate if the two parties involved recognized that there had been a little haste or somewhat precipitate action. We could cancel out the whole transaction and start all over again, as I said. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> I should like to say that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> thought I had bias against him, that is not correct. I have not any bias against any one in the Senate. My reason for rising as I did and speaking in the manner in which I spoke was that, as I mentioned when I rose, last Tuesday night <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> asked whether he would  be  given an opportunity to ask a question if the committee took the bills as a whole. I assured him that he would be given that opportunity. As I said to-night, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> asked that question at some length. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </interjection><para>As I also said to-night, the question was followed by speeches by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> and, I think, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong.</inline> I am not sure whether it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline> or another member of the Opposition. Again, as I said to-night, in my opinion those speeches were more in the nature of second-reading speeches than speeches that should have been made in committee. My object in rising to-night was to prevent  a  repetition of that. I did not rise just on account of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly.</inline> I rose in case other members of the Opposition wanted to speak in the way I have indicated. That was my sole purpose. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> thought that I had taken the opportunity just to pick him out, I sincerely assure him that such was not my intention. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna's</inline> suggestion is quite acceptable to me, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President.</inline></para><continue>
