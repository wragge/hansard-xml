          <para>- Honorable senators, I thank you very much for the great honour you have conferred upon me in electing me your  President  for a further period. It is indeed a great honour to serve in this chamber, and I trust that my occupancy of the chair during the coming three years will do nothing to detract from the great responsibilities and standards that surely are associated with a Presiding Officer&#39;s position. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator SPOONER</inline>(New South WalesVicePresident of the Executive Council and Minister for National Development). - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> may I take this opportunity, at least on behalf of honorable senators on the Government side - I believe I do it also on behalf of all honorable senators - of congratulating you upon your re-election as  President  of the Senate. It is a great thing to have been  President  of the Senate for as long a period as nine years and then to be re-elected for a further period of three years. I am sure it is something that you will look back upon throughout the rest of your life with great satisfaction and with very great pride indeed. We all congratulate you very sincerely. </para>
        <para>I think also that we can take satisfaction in the thought that over the years in which you have held this very high office you have not only acquitted yourself to our satisfaction, as honorable senators bowing to your decrees from time to time, but have also done credit to the Senate in the responsibilities you have undertaken so successfully in the wider sphere of parliamentary work outside the Senate itself. I refer in particular to the fact that you held the very high and distinguished office of  Chairman  of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. </para>
        <para>This is one of those occasions on which you hold not only the respect of the Senate but also the personal goodwill of all members on both sides of the Senate. I confess that we on this side of the Senate would rather wish that our numbers were a little greater than they are to-day, but we face that position and go into the next three years, as I think members of the Opposition do also, with confidence in the knowledge that you will discharge the responsibilities you assume as  President  of the Senate impartially and to the benefit of the Senate as a whole rather than to the benefit of any one particular group of senators. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKENNA</inline>(Tasmania - Leader of the Opposition). - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> may I take this opportunity to offer to you, on behalf of myself and my colleagues of the Opposition, our very sincere congratulations upon your re-election to the office of  President.  In view of our long and happy experience of your occupancy of the chair in the past, we of the Opposition are confident that you will continue to carry out the important duties of that office not only with distinction to yourself but also with complete satisfaction to all members of this chamber. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator ARNOLD</inline>(New South Wales).May I add my congratulations to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> on your re-election as  President.  It is a great honour to hold that office for the long period for which you have distinguished the Senate by holding it. You have given great service to the people of Australia. Although I feel that in this chamber there are 32 people who could be a little better educated, in the circumstances I am sure that my colleagues as well as the members of the Government parties realize that over the years you have given the Senate good leadership in the office of  President.  I congratulate you and wish you well in the coming three years. </para>

I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKellar</inline> goes into the chair with a great desire to do well, and I have every confidence that he will do so. </para>

It demands a judicial quality, and many other strains are imposed on the occupant of the office. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKellar</inline> has the difficulty that he follows one who set very high standards. However, he has had some experience in the chair when relieving the former  Chairman  of Committees and this, no doubt, will stand him in good stead. On behalf of the Opposition, I offer him our co-operation to ensure that the work of this chamber is done well. He is starting off with an entirely clear slate. We wish him well and trust that he will succeed in his high office. </para>

          <para>- by leave - It is with regret that I advise the Senate of the death on 22nd May last of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator the</inline> Honorable Albert David Reid, M-C. He was elected to the Senate as a senator for New South Wales at the general election in 1949. He was a Temporary  Chairman  of Committees from June, 1951, until March, 1953, and Vice-Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works from June, 1951, until September, 1953. He was  Chairman  of Committees and a member of the Senate Standing &#34;Orders Committee from September, 1953, until his death. He was a member of the parliamentary delegation to the Coronation of  Her  Majesty the Queen in 1953. Prior to being elected to the Senate he was a member of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales and a Minister of the Crown of that State. I am sure, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> honorable senators will agree that this is not only a long record of public service but also a distinguished record in many spheres of activity. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline>was  Chairman  of Committees in this Senate for approximately nine years, and I venture the opinion that as a result of his temperament and long parliamentary experience in the State Parliament and in this Senate he was indeed a distinguished  Chairman  of Committees. But perhaps most of us will remember him even better as a friend and a loyal colleague. He was the type of man who was always ready to lend a helping hand. That helping hand was so valuable because it was supported by such a long period of experience and natural capacity. For my part, I shall always think of him as a Light Horse man. He seemed to have the simple philosophy that it was his task to do the job which was put before him. </para>
        <para>We send our sympathy to his wife and family. We express the hope that the sadness they feel will be softened by the knowledge that all of us in this Senate thought so well of him and that, on his passing, he has left in this Senate a reputation which every one of us present would like to earn.

He was subsequently  deputy president  of the Burrungong shire and an alderman of Murrumburrah. He was also closely associated with the Farmers and Settlers Association of New South Wales. In 1914 he joined the Australian Imperial Force and was in the first convoy to sail from Australia. He fought at Gallipoli and later served with the First and Fourth Light Horse Regiments in the Palestine campaign. As a captain, he won the Military Cross on 31st October, 1917, while leading the second squadron of the Fourth Light Horse Regiment in the famous charge at Beersheba, south of Damascus. For 4 miles he led his men against the Turkish defences in the face of heavy machine gun fire. In the words of the &#34;Official History of Australia&#34; in the 1914-18 War- </para>

          <para class="block">Many horses in the leading line dropped but there was no check in the charge. The enemy fire served only to speed the gallop. The Turks, surprised and bewildered at the sheer audacity of the charge, failed to change the sights of their rifles, and for the last half mile their fire passed harmlessly overhead. From the time that the Fourth Light Horse received orders to saddle, to that of entry into Beersheba, less than an hour passed. It was a glorious hour filled not only with military achievement of a very rare kind, but with memorable deeds of individual officers and men which served vividly to demonstrate the spirit which alone made success possible. </para>

        <para>As the Leader of the Government has said, he entered the Federal Parliament in 1949 following the retirement of the late Honorable Frank Brennan. In the twelve years during which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bird</inline> occupied the office of Federal representative I am confident no one could say that he did other than make friends. He certainly contributed to the dignity of the Parliament and took an extremely keen interest in its proceedings. Alan Bird made contributions on a wide range of subjects but, in the main, concentrated on two or three important matters. &#39; Finance for local government, repayment of petrol tax to the States, improved road construction, and the Colombo Plan featured again and again in his speeches. In some ways his career in Canberra was an extension of his work in the municipal sphere in the city in which he lived, for it was in Parliament that he voiced the difficulties of municipal management which he knew so intimately from practical experience. This interest in local government matters was not in any way a reflection of a limited vision. Rather did it spring from his profound understanding of and kinship with the people among whom he lived. Their difficulties were those of unemployment, housing, street construction, the provision of schools, hospitals, libraries and so on, that are so very close to the ordinary man. In Canberra, he advocated the imposition of a tax on diesel fuel, the return of the full amount of petrol tax to the States, and a fairer distribution of State allocations as between municipalities. Some of these things have been achieved, and much of the credit for their achievement must go to Alan Bird. From the first, he was a strong supporter of the move to establish the Preston-Northcote Community Hospital, and he played a very prominent part in persuading the State Government of the day to advance sufficient money to enable it to be completed. </para>
        <para>Alan Bird was a conscientious member of this Parliament and always held himself available to help the people he represented. He was admired and respected for his great personal integrity, his compassion and his work to overcome those difficulties most closely touching the lives of the common man. In the death of Alan Bird, the Labour Party and this Parliament have suffered a great and serious loss. On behalf of his Senate colleagues, I tender our sin- &#39; cere sympathy to his widow. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator WADE</inline>(Victoria - Minister for Health). - Members of the Australian Country Party had a very high appreciation of the qualities that made Alan Bird such a distinguished Australian. He was a quietly spoken, sincere man who had a tremendously high appreciation of his civic responsibilities, and his contributions both in the National Parliament and in local government stamped him as a man who displayed vision and an understanding of the needs of the people whom he represented and who will always be grateful for his great work. Alan Bird was an ornament to the Parliament and the Australian Labour Party. We say to his sorrowing widow, his relatives and his colleagues of the Australian Labour Party that we would like to record our extreme regret at his untimely passing. </para>

          <para>. - by leave - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> I have moved two formal motions of condolence in respect of a senator and a member of the House of Representatives who died while they were members df this Parliament. Shortly I will suggest that, in accordance with our usual custom, the sitting of the Senate be suspended as a mark of respect to them. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Before I do that I should like to mention three other people who have passed on since we last met, and who at one time were members of this Parliament although not members at the time of their death. I refer to Herbert Victor Johnson, George James Bowden and Rowland James. I wish to say &#187; few words about each of them. </para>
        <para>The  Hon.  Herbert Victor Johnson, who died on 10th July, was one of the distinguished members of the Australian Labour Party. He was a Minister of State. He held the portfolio of the Interior; he was Assistant Minister for Works and Housing; at one time he was Acting Attorney-General and at another time he was Acting Minister for External Affairs.  His  long record of service includes the chairmanship of the Board of Management of the Australian War Memorial from 1945 to 1949. He represented Kalgoorlie, Australia&#39;s largest electorate in area. He left behind him a great name in his State of Western Australia, and I hope that those who mourn him will take comfort in the thought that he was so well regarded in this Parliament during the years in which he was a member of it. </para>
        <para>George James Bowden, a Victorian member of this Parliament, died on 8th June. He was elected for the division of Gippsland in 1943. He was another great parliamentarian. He was a Temporary Chairman of Committees from 1946 to 1958; a member of the Public Works Committee from 1950 to 1958; a member of the Standing Orders Committee of the House of Representatives, and a member of the select committee of the House of Representatives that was appointed to report on &#34; Hansard &#34;. Finally - this was his best-known work in the Parliament - he was Chairman of Committees in the House of Representatives from February, 1959 until he retired, on account of ill-health, in March, 1961. </para>
        <para>It is rather coincidental that to-day we are paying tribute to two members of the Australian Country Party, each of whom was  Chairman  of Committees in his House of the Parliament and each of whom had a first-class war record. George Bowden was a captain in the 24th Battalion. He was awarded the Military Cross and was wounded three times during his period of service. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> 1 think we all would like his family to know that we remembered him at his passing and are conveying this token of our respect and, indeed, our affection for him. </para>
        <para>I come now to Rowland James, who died on 4th July. He was elected for the division of Hunter at a general election in 1928. He also had a record of offices held. He was a member of the Public Works Committee - one of the important committees of this Parliament - from 1940 to 1946; he was chairman of that committee from 1943 to 1946, and a member of the Australian delegation to the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Conference in Nairobi. He is remembered as one of the most colourful personalities to come from New South Wales into this Parliament. He represented one of the big coal-mining constituencies for almost 30 years. </para>
        <para>In the early days of my holding of my present portfolio, which includes administration of the Joint Coal Board, I went to Cessnock and other parts of the coalfields from time to time. Needless to say, my political views and those of Rowley James were very wide apart; but I always remember the way he went about introducing me to people whom he thought I should meet on the coalfields. He always tried to present me to those people in the best possible light. He was a friendly soul. I am glad to have an opportunity to put on record something of the feeling of friendship for him that I developed. </para>

          <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> I believe it was proper for the Leader of the. Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> to advert to the recent deaths of three of our colleagues. Like him, I shall refer first to the Honorable Herbert Victor Johnson. All members of the Federal Parliamentary Labour Party were saddened by the news of the passing of our former colleague, who was known to us all as Vic Johnson. He was a colourful man who had had a colourful career. He was born in Western Australia. He commenced his working life as a drover and shearer. At the age of nineteen years he became a foundation member of the Australian Workers Union in his State. As an organizer for the pastoral section of his union, he visited every part of his far-flung State and was known from one end of it to the other. He had an intimate knowledge of the life and habits of the aborigines and of every phase of the great outback. Later he became State secretary of his union and for nine years from 1940 to 1949 he had the very great distinction of being its Federal  president. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>It is not surprising that his association with that union - the most powerful as well as numerically the strongest union in Australia - should have led him into politics, because the Australian Workers Union played a vital part in the formation and development of the Australian Labour Party and still plays a vital role in the support of our party. Vic Johnson had a rapid rise in politics. He entered the Federal Parliament in November, 1940, and less than five years later had the rare privilege of being appointed a member of the national Government, the Chifley Government. Only sterling personal qualities enabled Vic Johnson to win through to the most honoured position in his union and to a Cabinet position. Outstanding amongst those qualities were his interest, his capacity for hard work, his sincere dedication to the cause of his fellow man, his fearlessness, his love of country, his modesty and the rugged Australianism that pervaded every fibre of his being. I recall that my experience of him in those years led me to remark on one occasion that if his veins were opened I would expect to find not blood, but eucalyptus oil. His mateship readily attracted him to the affectionate regard of others. His friends were legion. </para>
        <para>I knew Vic Johnson from the day I entered the Parliament in July, 1944. I had the privilege of sitting next to him in the Chifley Cabinet for nearly four years. Vic Johnson&#39;s deep devotion to his religion and his life of service to others won for him a high place in his last and most important sphere - eternity. We revere his memory. To his widow, affectionately known to nearly all of us, and to the members of his family we extend our warmest sympathy, and trust that they will be given the strength to bear their deep sorrow. </para>
        <para>Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner,</inline> I too refer to the death of George James Bowden, M.C. Just as all members of the Opposition regretted the obvious and rapid deterioration in health of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bowden,</inline> which preceded his retirement in December last, they regret also that he was spared for so brief a time after his retirement. As- was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner,</inline> I was struck this afternoon by the many points of similarity between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bowden.</inline> Both had distinguished military careers in two world wars; both won the Military Cross. One was  Chairman  of Committees in the House of Representatives and the other  Chairman  of Committees in the Senate. Both were members of the Country Party. They died within a short time of each other, and the death of each is the subject of reference this afternoon in the Senate. </para>
        <para>More important, both men were cast in the same mould of character that I described earlier to-day when referring to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid.</inline> In saying that, I pay the highest tribute to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bowden.</inline> I should like to have known <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bowden</inline> better. Unfortunately, our different spheres of activity prevented that, and now it is no longer possible. We of the Opposition in the Senate extend our condolences to the members of the Country Party in the loss of their highly esteemed colleague. We extend to his sorrowing relatives our deep sympathy in their great loss. </para>
        <para>I comment now on the regrettable death of Rowland James. The late Rowley James, as we knew him, was a member of the Australian Labour Party and one of the most picturesque and strongly marked personalities to pass through the portals of this Parliament. He represented the coalmining constituency of Hunter from 1928 until his retirement in 1958 He waged, with vigour, ability and success, an unceasing fight for better wages and conditions for coal miners. He rendered invaluable and devoted service to the nation by acting as liaison officer between the Curtin Government and later the Chifley Government, .and the coal-mining industry from 1943 to 1949. That was a period of the gravest difficulty in the the industry. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline>was as strong in body as he was in mind. We believed that he was indestructible but, unfortunately, injuries received in a road accident impaired his physique and caused him distress in his latest years. Despite his toughness in debate and his forthright speech he was a hearty and amiable companion, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner</inline> earlier remarked. In truth, no more tender-hearted man existed. He was the soul of generosity to any one in distress. He gave the most loyal and valuable service to his party and to the nation. It consoles us to think that his spirit will live on in this Parliament, since his son is present member for Hunter. The spirit and tradition of Rowley James will survive. We offer to his widow and the members of his family our sincere sympathy in their grievous loss. </para>

          <para>- For the first time in the nearly thirteen years that I have been in this Parliament I join in expressions of condolence. In passing, I ask: Does it not strike us how individual in character and personality were these men of whom we are speaking? I wish to refer to one man in particular - the late Victor Johnson. I had known and been associated with Vic Johnson for almost the whole of my life - ever since I was a small boy. Our families were firm friends; his son, Mervyn, who predeceased him by only ten days, was a constant visitor to our town and stayed at our home. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I have seen Victor Johnson under many stresses and strains over a long period. After I entered this Parliament I worked with him in organizing, and was associated with him before that. With due deference to all those people with whom I have been associated in organizing work, Vic Johnson stands out as the best natural organizer of them all. He had an innate ability to get things done. </para>
        <para>We have heard the record read to us by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> and referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner,</inline> but the official record does not bring out the fact that the passing of Victor Johnson marked the end of an era, such as we shall never see again. The record does not show that the whole of his schooling amounted, in broken periods, to a total of eighteen months. At the age of twelve he was away from home, first working at a station in the Hamelin Pool district. On his twenty-first birthday he shore 200 sheep and so rose into that select coterie of shearers known as &#34; deuce-&#39;em &#34; artists, and so became one of the highest class of shearers. </para>
        <para>Vic Johnson told me on many occasions that after he became secretary of the pastoral section of the Australian Workers Union his education was continued by an old man who took an interest in him and made him at night write out the leading article in &#34; The West Australian &#34;. Then the next morning, before work, he would dictate it back to his mentor, who would correct his pronunciation, tell him the meaning of words and so on. I do not suppose that we will ever again find a man with that background - a man whose university training, as it were, was gained in the negotiations on industrial disputes and in appearances before judges of the arbitration courts who were dealing with mining strikes, shearing disputes and such matters - rising to the position attained by Victor Johnson. </para>
        <para>I remember him vividly in the 1930 shearers&#39; strike, when sixteen men were sentenced to gaol for a period of two months as a result of their actions during the strike. Victor Johnson went to a nonLabour attorney-general in Western Australia who, in his wisdom, immediately allowed the men out of gaol after they had served a total of only eight days. One of my prized possessions to-day is the book that they wrote, called &#34; The Gaol Echo &#34;. I do not suppose that it has had a very wide distribution, but it is interesting now to look through it reminiscently and see the photographs of Victor Johnson in it. Characteristically, I was with Victor Johnson when he entered on his most controversial role in recent years, which was over-played in press reports immediately prior to his death, and following it. I was with him in Kalgoorlie on an organizing campaign when he criticized his own leader in a public press statement which caused so much interest and controversy throughout Australia. I suppose it was characteristic that I should be with him following a long association which started when he and my father became friends. Both he and my father were men who knew what mateship meant. After the death of my father the association continued with me, who, of course, was a younger man. I have heard a number of versions of this incident. I mention it to-day not to rake over old ashes or coals. Every one of the versions I have heard has been false. I was in Victor Johnson&#39;s company during the three preceding days. He told me that he was going to make the statement and forthwith made it. He sought no advice from anybody and asked for no comment. It was typical of his bigness that when he was determined to do a thing he thrust the responsibility on nobody else. </para>
        <para>Let me mention another of Victor Johnson&#39;s characteristics which might help honorable senators to understand him better. He was incapable of holding any doubt within his breast. He had to dispel it. Many times in this Parliament he came to me to challenge me or inquire about something I had said which he did not understand, <inline font-style="italic">or</inline> which did not quite please him. Friends as we were, he could not have anything on his mind without bringing it into the open. Whatever anybody might think of the wisdom or otherwise of his statement in the heat of those days, nevertheless he had to make it. As we are paying our final tribute to Victor Johnson I should like to put these remarks on record because I was the only person who was with him at that time. I repeat that he asked no advice and made the statement completely on his own responsibility. He sought to lean on nobody, and I know that he did what he did with a full sense of responsibility. He made the statement in the town of Kalgoorlie which was the head-quarters of his electorate because he felt that he owed it to the Australian electors to make his position clear. </para>
        <para>I know of his preoccupation during the preceding two or three days as he thought over 50 years of active work in the Australian Labour movement in both the industrial and political spheres and looked back through the vista of those years. He realized the troubles the movement was passing through; he knew full well that in spite of 50 years&#39; association with the Labour movement he could well end his life outside the movement and apart from the things for which he had devoted half a century of his lifetime. Fortunately that did not happen. I feel that a great deal of misunderstanding arose over the incident. I mention these things not to rake over dead ashes or to revive a controversy that is now over, but simply to put the record straight and enable people to understand that he did what he did because his conscience dictated such action. </para>
        <para>Finally, I do not think we can refer to the life of Victor Johnson without alluding to his love of Australian poets, particularly Henry Lawson. Those poems engendered in him a nostalgia for the old days. He loved particularly two poems. One was &#34; Bourke &#34;, from which he would often recite the lines - </para>

          <para>They drank - when all is said and done - they gambled, and their speech was rough; </para>

        </quote>
        <para>Vic loved that poem because he was part of that era. He came over from that industrial era which began with the strikes of &#39;91 and 92 and continued to the early part of this century. Almost invariably - and I suppose I have heard him recite these poems more times than I care to count - he would finish up on the lighter poem of &#34;Sweeney &#34;. </para>
        <para class="block">I think this poem brought back to Victor the nostalgia for the old days. He would recite this verse - </para>

          <para>And I wonder why he haunts me more than any other ghost. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">He did not learn those poems in the schoolroom, because he seldom saw the inside of a schoolroom. He learnt them at the time when Lawson&#39;s poems were published in the &#34; Bulletin &#34;. He learnt them in the cool of bark huts and in the shearing sheds. He had an amazing memory and often recited poems that I have never seen in print. I suppose they were published in the &#34; Bulletin &#34; in those days. </para>
        <para>Let me say a final word about Victor Johnson. I look back to the friendship of our families, the friendship between my father and Victor and his close association with me over the years. Of all the people I have known and of all the people who have passed through this Parliament my memory of him will haunt me more than any other ghost. </para>

          <para>-I desire to associate myself with this motion of condolence on the passing of three very respected members of this Parliament. I was very closely associated with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> V. -Victor - Johnson. When we express our sympathy to his widow we address a very gracious lady. I think that Victor would have me say that a great deal of what he achieved in his career was due to the help given him by <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Johnson.</inline> This grand woman stood for the same spirit of mateship that Victor personified during the whole of his life.  His  family life was characterized by love and respect. Because of his public commitments as an organizer and reformer and a worker for the betterment of the people of Australia his family had to make sacrifices. I was  president  of the Labour movement when Victor Johnson entered this Parliament. He had no ambition for politics, but stood for election as a result of an approach made by the then Labour Prime Minister of Australia who suggested to Victor that it would be better if he left his industrial associations and entered this Parliament. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Victor Johnson could hold his place in any company. When the Earl of Listowel visited this country, when he was the Labour Party Whip in the House of Lords, he spent a lot of time in the company of Victor Johnson. He appreciated his basic Australianism, his absolute inherent honesty and his desire without any garnishings to do the right thing. I went with Victor Johnson on a good-will visit to Portuguese Timor and Dutch Timor at the time when the islands of Cartier and Ashmore were taken over by Australia from the United Kingdom. Victor Johnson met the people he had to meet on their own level and created great respect and understanding for Australia and Australianism. </para>
        <para>I think the greatest thing we can say of Victor Johnson is that he had a great appreciation of mateship whether in war or peace.  His  sacrifice on behalf of the people he represented industrially and politically was made unselfishly. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> referred to a time, which some of us remember, when strikers were gaoled for attempting to improve their industrial conditions. Victor Johnson made a submission to the Attorney-General of Western Australia to have those men released from prison because they were imprisoned for striking for just conditions. Without rest, he rode a bicycle 600 miles from northern Australia to Perth in a period that was thought impossibly short in those days. Upon arrival in Perth he presented his case to the Parliament. This occasion was a milestone in the advance of industrial conditions. Victor Johnson will be sadly missed. He was respected both by those with whom he was associated here and by those whose conditions he helped to improve. </para>
        <para>I also had the privilege of friendship with George Bowden and I admired him. He worked sincerely for the party that he represented and, in accordance with his conscience, for the benefit of the people of Australia. </para>
        <para>Rowley James was at one time associated with Western Australian coal mines but was, of course, better known in the eastern States. He was another pioneer of our industrial history. He lived through those times when it was not popular to be a Labour man and a supporter of an industrial union. He was a pioneer in the achievement of improved industrial conditions. Many people have now forgotten the sacrifices of those who fought that fight. In those early days it was common to regard Labour men as not having the highest regard for their nation and to deride them merely because they were reformers, seeking better conditions. Victor Johnson and Rowley James were reformers and pioneers, and were respected in that field of Australia&#39;s advancement. </para>
        <para>I associate myself sincerely with the expressions of sadness at the passing of three great Australians whom we held in the highest respect and I extend my condolences to the bereaved members of their families. </para>

        <para class="block">To-night, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt)</inline> is delivering in another place his Budget Speech for 1962-63. I should like to refer briefly to the main features of the Budget and its likely impact on the economy. </para>
        <para>It is estimated that in the financial year 1962-63 expenditures by the Commonwealth will exceed the total of its revenues, loan proceeds and the cash available to it from trust funds by &#163;118,328,000. I have stated this overall position chiefly as signifying the determination of the Government to follow through with its expansionary programme until the economy is operating at the highest level of activity we can hope to sustain. That is our first and predominant aim. We have, without doubt, gone a long way towards achieving it. In 1961-62 there were big increases in employment, production and the volume of trade and, generally, expansion appears to be proceeding steadily. </para>
        <para class="block">But there is still some way to go. Unemployment has to be reduced further. There is still a fair amount of plant capacity which could be taken up and there is always new labour coming forward and new plant being installed. Therefore, after talking things over with representative leaders from industry, trade and finance and studying a wealth of statistical information, we have decided to continue in full strength all the expansionary measures we adopted progressively through 1961-62. </para>
        <para>There is, however, much more to the problem than simply to keep expansion moving over the next few months. To take one aspect of it: Among the people lately consulted, more than a few said that there was still some lack of confidence in the business world and, on closer discussion, it appeared that several elements were contributing to this. One was a doubt whether the recent expansion, after going some distance, might not flag and peter out. Another was a- fear that the Government might be apprehensive of another boom like that of 1960 and might suddenly and hastily reverse its policies. A third anxiety, very different from the rest, was that something would be done, or allowed to occur, that would jeopardize stability, start prices and costs rising again and unhinge our balance of payments. The spokesmen for rural industry were particularly strong on this. </para>
        <para>Confidence is vital and if apprehensions such as these exist it is for the Government to meet and allay them as far as it is able to do so. This Budget, our chief instrument of policy, has been carefully shaped to do that. As to continuance of expansion the course is, surely, plain enough. We must give the immediate situation all necessary support and it will, I think, be clear that the Budget does that. But we have also to look to the period beyond and establish conditions and put action in train that will encourage and promote and provide a sound basis for continued expansion. Especially by the Budget provisions for development - for projects, large and small, that will open up new and great resources as well as enlarge and modernize the existing facilities of our economy - we will leave no doubts as to our intentions in that direction. We must enlarge the sources of our export income if we are to generate employment opportunities in our rural, mining, manufacturing and other industries on the scale necessary . to match the growth in our work force. </para>
        <para>I  come now to our supposed preoccupation with a future boom and the risk of our reversing current policies. Naturally we do not want another boom like that of 1960. Not many do. But we see nothing in the present situation, external or internal, that will necessarily lead to a boom. On the contrary, we see no reason why, given forethought, responsible management and co-operation between Government and business, expansion should not continue at a good strong pace, absorbing resources as they become available, without running into a condition of excess demand, which is the real essence of a boom. </para>
        <para>We are not ruled by fear of a boom, but when we are told, as we are from time to time, that we are pre-occupied with stability, we readily admit that charge, just as we reject the implications that our critics read into it. To us, stability means three things, all related to and dependent on one another - steady growth, a balance between current supply and demand and stable costs and prices. At that, it is one of the great objects of economic policy. We have pursued it consistently through thick and thin and, despite all the doubts and jeers and recriminations, we have achieved it. </para>
        <para>It would be easy enough to wreck all this by some ill-judged stroke - some action that caused a sudden upsurge of demand or a sweeping addition to costs in industry. It could be eroded, too, by the edging up of prices and costs over a widening field until a rising spiral began again. It could be dissipated in some renewed outbreak of speculation. Those are the kinds of things the Government does not want to see happen, and the great majority of people does not want to see them happen either. From the external standpoint, with trade competition sharpening and likely to sharpen further, and the unknown possibilities of the Common Market ahead of us, it is critically important that they should not happen. Costs are vital both to our exporting industries and to the industries which compete with imports in our home market; and here already our policies have won for us an important advantage. We know that, while costs in countries abroad, especially the countries of western Europe and Japan, have been rising fast, our costs have been largely stable. If our industries, or any of them, have difficult days to come, we can think of no better way of safeguarding them than this; and it is for hard, practical reasons such as these, and not from any morbid fear of past events repeating themselves, that we emphasize the need for stability and plan and work for it. </para>

Pending completion of inquiries into actual outgoings under the programme in the coming year, a sum of &#163;210,000,000, or &#163;6,922,000 more than actual expenditure in 1961-62, has been tentatively included in the Budget for expenditure on Defence Services in 1962-63. </para>

          <title>The National Welfare Fund</title>
          <page.no>18</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>Payments from the National Welfare Fund are estimated to be &#163;387,574,000, an increase of &#163;22,383,000 over expenditure last year. </para>
        <para>Age, invalid and widows&#39; pensions are expected to rise by over &#163;13,000,000. Payments of pharmaceutical benefits under the general scheme are expected to rise by rather more than &#163;5,000,000 and payments of such benefits to pensioners by nearly &#163;1,000,000. Although expenditure on unemployment and sickness benefits will reflect the additions to these benefits announced last February, expenditure on this item is estimated to be about &#163;3,000,000 less this year than in 1961-62. This is because we expect unemployment to be reduced further in the course of the year. </para>
        <para>According to . its practice, the Government has reviewed the social service benefits payable from the National Welfare Fund. In most of its years of office the Government has found it desirable to make some increases in benefits or to broaden their range. Payments from the National Welfare Fund were &#163;92,804,000 in 1949-50; they are estimated to be &#163;387,574,000 in the current year - which is more than a four-fold increase. It may illustrate how largely such payments have come to share in our Budget if I indicate that, in 1949-50, payments from the National Welfare Fund were equivalent to some 47.7 per cent, of revenue from income tax and social services contribution paid by individuals. The comparable figure is estimated to reach 72 per cent, in the current year. </para>
        <para>A most welcome feature of the past year has been that in each quarter thereof, the consumer price index recorded a small fall. Taking into account this experience, the wide-ranging increases in benefits in 1961- 62, the large addition to expenditure this year and the budgetary situation now confronting it, the Government has decided not to vary the current scales of benefit. </para>

        <para>War and repatriation expenditure in 1962-63 is estimated to be &#163;110,701,000, which is &#163;6,363,000 greater than expenditure last year. For reasons similar to those I have just stated in relation to National Welfare Fund benefits, the Government has decided not to alter the current scales of repatriation benefits in 1962-63. </para>
        <para>This item also makes a relatively large call on our budget resources. If estimated expenditure on war and service pensions and allowances, repatriation hospitals and other repatriation benefits are added to National Welfare Fund payments, total expenditures of these kinds would be equal to 91 per cent, of our estimated revenue from income tax on individuals in this financial year. </para>

The grant to the Papua and New Guinea Administration will be increased by &#163;2,700,000 to &#163;20,000,000. </para>
        <para class="block">Payments to the States. </para>
        <para>Payments to or for the States are expected this year to reach a total of &#163; 422,575,000, which is &#163;26,013,000 greater than comparable payments in 1961-62. Within this total, there is the interest-free additional assistance grant of &#163;12,500,000 the Commonwealth is making to the States this year for employment-giving activities, and there is also provision for several amounts of Commonwealth assistance to developmental projects in certain States. I shall refer to these matters in greater detail presently. </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>Expenditure on capital works and services in 1962-63 is estimated at &#163;180,977,000. This amount includes &#163;13,078,000 for certain items of a capital nature which, in previous years, have been charged to ordinary services of the Post Office and broadcasting and television services. Allowing for that, provision for capital works and services is &#163;6,307,000 larger than expenditure in 1961-62. </para>
        <para>An amount of &#163;24,150,000 is proposed for expenditure this year by the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority. Last year the Authority spent &#163;16,010,000. The increase of &#163;8,140,000 is attributable in the main to larger contract payments on the major works comprising the Murray 1 power project, which is scheduled for commissioning in 1966. Some &#163;13,100,000 of. the total will be charged to loan fund, where it will be met from proceeds of the International Bank loan negotiated early in 1962. </para>
        <para>Provision of &#163;4,175,000 is being made for expansion of television and broadcasting services, compared with &#163;2,847,000 last year. Practically the whole increase of &#163;1,328,000 is for the establishment of national television stations in provincial and country areas. </para>
        <para>The Estimates include &#163;3,500,000 for advances to the Overseas Telecommunications Commission, to meet progress payments on the Trans-Pacific cable from Canada to Australia. </para>
        <para>Capital expenditure by the National Capital Development Commission is estimated to be &#163;12,150,000, an increase of &#163;1,150,000 over expenditure last year. Besides these major items, a considerably increased amount is to be made available by the Commonwealth this year for the various developmental projects on which it is giving special financial assistance to the States. </para>

      <para>Earlier I stressed the need to look beyond the immediate situation and shape our policies to ensure support and encouragement for expansion well on into the future. As I see it, this is not a matter for budgetary measures alone. It involves the whole range of economic policy measures and, amongst them, the Government has always given high importance to the immigration programme. Accordingly, the immigration target for 1962-63 remains at the unchanged level of 125,000 permanent and long-term arrivals. Recruiting will concentrate on skilled and semi-skilled workers and their dependants and on reuniting the families of migrants already here. </para>
      <para>So as to furnish the economy with a basic assurance of continuity in growth, the Commonwealth now takes an ever increasing and more positive part in the development of our resources and the general up-building of our economy. I mentioned just now our own large programme of capital works and services. That represents direct participation in development. We have long given massive support to the works and housing programmes of the State governments and will do so again this financial year. At the recent Loan Council meeting, the Commonwealth agreed to support a borrowing programme for State works and housing of &#163;250,000,000 for 1962-63 and, since it is probable that public loan raisings will fall considerably short of that amount, this undertaking means that we will have to call heavily on our own resources to provide money for State development. Over the past eleven years we have in this way pro&#39;vided the States with no less than &#163;800,000,000 to support their general developmental activities. </para>
      <para>Incidentally, although it makes no direct call on our own resources, we agreed at the Loan Council to a borrowing programme of &#163;105,155,000 for State semi governmental authorities, and we also took the initiative in removing the overall limit on borrowings by. authorities which individually seek &#163;100,000 or less in this financial year. I may also say in passing that this year the Commonwealth will provide directly and indirectly over &#163;91,000,000 for housing. Of this, &#163;45,900,000 will take the form of advances to the States under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreements, and is part of the borrowing programme for State works and housing to which I have just referred. The Commonwealth will also be providing &#163;35,000,000 for war service homes, &#163;5,900,000 for housing in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, &#163;3,000,000 for homes for the aged and &#163;1,600,000 for defence housing. </para>
      <para>However, the more characteristic form our recent extensions of developmental activity have taken is that of assistance to the State governments for special purposes or special projects. This kind of assistance is not of course new. Perhaps the best known earlier example is Commonwealth aid for roads, which has been going on for many years. In recent years, however, it has increased very greatly. In 1949-50 the grant was a little over &#163;9,000,000. This year it is &#163;54,000,000 and that grant, of course, forms part of a five-year programme which began in 1959 and under which, subject to certain matching arrangements, the Commonwealth will provide &#163;250,000,000 for road construction and maintenance in the States. In this new phase, however, we have joined with State governments in a series of projects which, from the stand-point of the Commonwealth, aim to further particular purposes. One is to increase exports by opening new resources or facilitating the transportation of exportable products. A second is to promote development in outlying parts of the Commonwealth, especially in the far north and the north-west. In furthering both these objectives we are, at the same time, providing employment on the spot in areas where opportunities for additional employment are not always easy to find. </para>
      <para>Thus, in Queensland, we are providing on a repayable advance basis two-thirds of the finance for the great Mount Isa railway project. In this Budget we are allocating &#163;8,195,000 for this work, compared with the initial amount of &#163;3,750,000 provided last year. There is also the scheme, started last year, for construction of cattle roads in Queensland, under which the Commonwealth undertook to provide &#163;5,000,000 over five years. Last year we contributed &#163;650,000 under the scheme; This year the amount is estimated to be &#163;1,480,000 and we have also decided to provide an additional amount of &#163;250,000 this year for the sealing of roads included in the programme. The necessary legislation will be brought before the Senate at a later date. Under a further agreement with the Queensland Government made last year for the improvement of coal-handling facilities at the port of Gladstone, we are providing &#163;145,000 this year. Following discussion with the Queensland Government, we are including in the Budget this year an amount of &#163;1,750,000 to assist in financing the first stages of a scheme to open up and develop to full production a vast area of the rich brigalow lands in the Fitzroy Basin ..of central Queensland.  We are satisfied, after investigation, that these brigalow lands offer magnificent possibilities for increasing the output of beef for export. A detailed agreement is being worked out with the Queensland Government and in due course legislation will be brought before Parliament. </para>
      <para>In Western Australia the huge project to construct a standard-gauge railway from Kalgoorlie to Kwinana is under way, and there is &#163;4,300,000 in the Estimates to meet the contribution we will be called on to make towards the cost of construction in this financial year. Under the existing scheme for development in the north-west of Western Australia, whereby the Commonwealth undertook to find &#163;5,000,000 over a five-year period commencing with 1958-59, we are making provision for payment to the State this year of the remaining amount of &#163;1,432,000. Last year we made an extra grant of &#163;500,000 to Western Australia for expenditure on cattle roads in the north-west of the State. This year we propose to make a further grant of &#163;700,000 to the State for similar purposes, and appropriate legislation will be introduced accordingly. Further, after discussions with the Government of Western Australia, we are providing an amount of &#163;300,000 this year towards the construction of a new jetty at Derby, to facilitate particularly the shipment of cattle from the region served by &#39;hat port. This also will be the subject of special legislation to be submitted to Parliament for approval. </para>
      <para>Taken with our developmental activities in the Northern Territory - we are allocating &#163;1,000,000 for cattle roads there in 1962-63 - these several projects in Queensland and Western Australia are building up to a fairly substantia! programme for Northern Australia as a whole. For the improvement of coal-loading facilities at certain ports in New South Wales, we are providing &#163;685,000 in this financial year, compared with expenditure last year of &#163;284,000. There will, in addition, be a grant of &#163;415,000 for that purpose from the Coal Industry Fund of the Joint Coal Board. The grant from that source last year was &#163;172,000. Under the agreement reached with South Australia for financing the purchase of twelve diesel-electric locomotives and 100 wagons to transport ore on the Broken Hill to Port Pirie railway, we have included an amount of &#163;1,300,000 in our 1962-63 Estimates. </para>

      </debateinfo>
      <para class="block">The gold-mining industry has made representations for Commonwealth assistance additional to that available under the existing subsidy scheme. Although the subsidy scheme has helped and is continuing materially to help in sustaining the gold mines eligible for assistance, the Government is concerned about the declining trend in employment in the industry and its general outlook as a whole. The industry is, of course, vital to a number of outlying areas, particularly the Kalgoorlie area. The developed ore reserves of the large  unsubsidized  Kalgoorlie mines, expressed in terms of number of years&#39; supply of prepared ore, have been dwindling, while in some of the larger  unsubsidized  mines in other areas the presently-known resources of ore are being worked out fairly fast. </para>
      <para>We propose to give additional assistance in the form of a development allowance to mines not in receipt of subsidy. The aim of the development allowance will be to encourage the mines to increase expenditure on development - that is, the investigation and preparation of ore bodies for future working. Under the proposal a mine not receiving subsidy will be eligible, subject to certain limits, for payment of an allowance not exceeding the amount by which its expenditure on development in a year exceeds the annual rate of its expenditure on development in a selected base period. The cost is tentatively estimated at &#163;300,000 in 1962-63 and somewhat more than that in subsequent years. Legislation will be introduced to give effect to the proposal. </para>

      </debateinfo>
      <para>The discoveries of oil at Cabawin and Moonie have led to a great growth of interest in the search for oil and to a considerable expansion in the programmes of oil exploration companies. These are encouraging developments, towards which the Government&#39;s oil search policy over a number of years has contributed much. The Government considers it highly important that the momentum of exploration activity be kept up. Accordingly, the Budget provides for a substantial increase in the amount of Commonwealth assistance for oil exploration purposes. </para>
      <para>In 1961-62 Commonwealth expenditure on oil exploration was &#163;3,700,000. Of this, &#163;2,500,000 was disbursed as subsidies to oil exploration companies under the Petroleum Search Subsidy Act 1959-61, and &#163;1,200,000 represented expenditure by the Department of National Development on its basic work in oil exploration. The 1961-62 figures were themselves considerably higher than those for 1960-61, which were! &#163;1,400,000 and &#163;900,000 respectively, a total of &#163;2,300,000. </para>
      <para>This year the total estimate for Commonwealth expenditure on oil exploration is &#163;6,674,000 - an increase of almost &#163;3,000,000 on expenditure last year. The amount of &#163;6,674,000 comprises &#163;5,000,000 for payments under the Petroleum Search Subsidy Act and &#163;1,674,000 for expenditure by the Department of National Development. </para>
      <para>By its assistance for these particular activities and undertakings, the Commonwealth is not concerning itself so much with development in the broad; we do that by our support for the State government works and housing programmes and by our Commonwealth Aid Road grants. Rather, we are moving in at points where some new possibility has opened up or some obstacle to expansion can be overcome. As to the significance of these activities for the Budget and, indeed, for the economy in general, </para>
      <para class="block">I may make the point that on the specific projects and special assistance I have been discussing here our expenditure in 1960-61 was only &#163;2,607,000. Last year it increased to &#163;9,798,000 and this year it is estimated to reach &#163;26,837,000, an increase of &#163;24,230,000 over the two years and of &#163;17,039,000 in the current year. Obviously, the direct impact on employment alone must be very considerable. </para>

          <page.no>22</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>The total receipts of the Consolidated Revenue Fund this year are estimated to be &#163;1,665,432,000, which is an increase of only &#163;23,890,000 on actual receipts in 1961-62. </para>
        <para>Within this total, revenue from all forms of taxation is estimated at &#163;1,418,000, an increase of &#163;9,426,000 on revenue obtained  from the same sources last year. </para>
        <para>In making these estimates allowance has ; been made for very considerable increases &#34; in employment; earnings, imports and sales of goods subject to sales tax and excise; but two important factors will be operating this year to keep any increase in revenue over last year down to small proportions. </para>
        <para>One is the fall during 1961-62, compared with the previous year, in incomes that will be assessed for taxation in 1962-63. This applies especially to company taxation. It is estimated that revenue from that source will be &#163;20,688,000 less this year than last. </para>
        <para>The other is the full year effect on revenue in 1962-63 of the major tax concessions made in 1961-62 - chiefly the reductions in sales tax on household equipment in our last Budget, the February reductions in sales tax on motor vehicles and parts, the rebate of ls. in the &#163;1 on income tax on individuals, and the investment allowance on plant for use in manufacturing. Together, such concessions are estimated to cost revenue &#163;75,000,000 in the current financial year, whereas in 1961-62 their cost amounted to only &#163;38,000,000. </para>
        <para>It is anticipated that there will be increases of about &#163;10,800,000 in collections from customs duties, &#163;10,400,000 from excise duties, &#163;6,200,000 from sales tax and &#163;3,000,000 from pay-roll tax. An increase of about &#163;9,000,000 is expected in revenue from business undertakings. </para>
        <para>In accordance with the policy, announced in 1960, of working progressively towards full recovery of the cost of air navigation facilities there will be an increase of 10 per cent, in air navigation charges for airline operators and also certain increases in the charges payable for private aerial work and &#39; charter aircraft. I shall be announcing details in due course. The additional revenue is estimated to be &#163;177,000 in a full year and &#163;89,000 in 1962-63. It has also been decided to increase Commonwealth rates of charges for lighthouse services from ls. to ls. 3d. per net registered ton from 1st October, 1962. The&#39; additional revenue is estimated to be &#163;175,000 in a full year and &#163;131,000 in 1962-63. </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>To estimate public loan raisings is always a difficult matter, because the result can be affected by rapid changes of conditions&#39; in the course of the year that cannot possibly be foreseen at the start. Last year the total, including State domestic raisings, was &#163;243,041,000, but that was altogether exceptional - easily a record for any peacetime year. Our loans had good support from most quarters but particularly from the trading banks. Their liquid funds rose greatly and were largely invested in Government securities. In the current year it is improbable that the trading banks will have as much to invest in Government securities as, in 1961-62. Apart from that, however, we see no present reason why the level of subscriptions from other sources should fall away, and we will also be drawing upon the proceeds of the loan negotiated early in 1962 with the International Bank for the Snowy Mountains scheme. </para>
        <para>Taking these considerations into account, we feel justified in adopting for Budget purposes a figure of &#163;215,000,000 for public loan raisings in 1962-63. </para>

      <para class="block">Altogether, therefore, receipts from revenue, public loan raisings and the other sources just mentioned are estimated this year to total &#163;1,973,432,000. If, as estimated, total expenditure this year is &#163;2,091,760,000 there will be a deficiency of &#163;1 1 8,328,000. This would compare with the actual deficiency of &#163;27,010,000 in 1961-62. As I have said, the main reasons for this increase in the deficiency are to be found in the large increase in the Commonwealth&#39;s total expenditure commitments and in the negligible rise in our total receipts. On the basis of our estimates total expenditures in 1962-63 are expected to rise by over &#163;100,000,000. Total receipts, however, are expected to increase by less than &#163;10,000,000. </para>

Legislation to authorize such borrowings as may be necessary to meet the deficiency will later be submitted to Parliament. </para>

        <title>IMPACT OF THE BUDGET</title>
        <page.no>23</page.no>
        <type>miscellaneous</type>
      </debateinfo>
      <para>I said earlier that although expansion had made good headway in 1961-62 it still had some way to go before reaching the level of activity we desire to see. On estimates we have, there may be a net addition of about 85,000 people to the work-force during the year - the majority of whom will be seeking wage or salary jobs. There is also a certain number of people who do not depend on continuous employment but who will take a job if one that suits them comes on offer. Besides these additional workers there are the unemployed; I have already said that we regard the total of these as being still too high. To cope with this task of absorbing labour it is clear that there has to be a substantial and continuing rise in the demand for labour. </para>
      <para>Spending by the public on consumer goods and services is, of course, by far the largest element in total demand. Recognizing this, the Government reduced sales tax on household equipment in the Budget last year and, in February, we provided the rebate of ls. in the &#163;1 on individual income tax. Since then there has been a fairly strong rise in the total of consumer spending. Provisional statistics of retail sales for the recent June quarter show an increase of 3.6 per cent, over the June quarter of 1961 and, as there has been&#39; some fall in prices since then, the quantity of goods sold has increased, by more than that. </para>
      <para>There should be a lot more to support consumer spending from now on. With employment rising and more overtime being worked, spending in the shops ought to increase further. During the next few months, moreover, there will be a big outflow of tax refunds - estimated to total more than &#163;90,000,000 this year- which always help to boost sales, and these should more than offset, for the time being, the drop back in the rebate on pay-as-you-earn instalments from the temporary level of 3s. in the &#163;1 to ls. in the &#163;1 from 1st July. </para>
      <para>Besides these income factors there is, without doubt, a big accumulation of potential spending power. Savings bank deposits increased during 1961-62 by no less than &#163;157,000,000. Meanwhile, people have until recently continued to reduce their debts on hire purchase and similar contracts, and this has put them in a position to do more buying on credit as and when they are disposed to do so. By and large, therefore, the rise in consumer spending ought to be well sustained. </para>
      <para>Public authority expenditure is the next largest source of demand for goods and services. In 1961-62 it was 8.4 per cent, greater than in 1960-61 and 16.1 per cent, greater than in 1959-60. The State Governments will have available from Commonwealth sources about &#163;34,000,000 more than in 1961-62, and their own revenues will increase this year. Since, on the figures given earlier, Commonwealth expenditure - net of provision for the States - will also rise considerably, it is quite clear that public authorities as a whole will be making substantially increased contributions to demand in 1962-63. </para>
      <para>Other large classes of expenditure have also been rising. Dwelling commencements in the June quarter are estimated at 21,238, an increase of 4.4 per cent, over commencements in the March quarter and 10.7 per cent, more than in the June quarter of 1961. The value on completion of nonresidential buildings commenced in the March quarter of 1962 was 15.7 per cent, greater than in the March quarter of 1961, and the indications are that the upward trend has continued since then. </para>
      <para>Registrations of new motor vehicles in the six months to June totalled 145,575, an increase of 26.3 per cent, over registrations in the first six months of 1961 and of 1.6 per cent, over registrations in the first six months of 1960. Registrations in May and June of this year exceeded those in the corresponding months of 1961 by 40.5 per cent, and those in the corresponding months of 1960 by 7.1 per cent. </para>
      <para>Some doubts have been expressed about the trend in private capital expenditure. In respect of building construction and motor vehicles there seems little reason for concern and these, after all, comprise about two-thirds of what is described as private fixed investment. It seems reasonable also to expect that expenditure on plant and equipment will respond to the investment allowance available since February and to the prospects of expanding production and sales. </para>
      <para>Enough has been said to show that recent trends in most of the chief branches of spending have been headed upwards. They are likely to continue that way. Looking at the financial side of things, it certainly seems that ample finance should be available to support such trends. The great increase in savings bank deposits has already been mentioned. It is also common knowledge that the hire-purchase companies are well supplied with funds to finance an increase in credit buying. The trading banks are abnormally liquid for this time of the year and, through 1961-62, their commitments for future lending increased very greatly. </para>
      <para>As the huge net outflow of cash from the Government occurs, mainly during the next few months, the liquidity of the banking system and the public will certainly increase and, taking the financial outlook as a whole, it is a fair inference that the forces making for expansion are not likely to be checked by any dearth of money for investment or community spending. Output has been rising in most branches of manufacturing - strongly in some - and there is no evident reason why this should not go on. Demand is on the increase, labour and materials are available, industry has wide access to supplies from abroad, a good many firms are said to have some margin of spare plant capacity. All this should help towards a steady growth of  industrial output. In the rural field, seasonal conditions have so far been favorable in most areas. The wool clip is estimated to be slightly larger than last year, when it was a record, and very large plantings of wheat have been reported. A big sugar crop is in sight. There may be some increase in production of beef and it seems possible also that production of mutton and lamb will be maintained at the high level of last year. At this stage prospects seem generally fair in most of the other rural industries. </para>
      <para>Externally, a good many uncertainties overhang world production and trade in  1962-63  and there could be some falling back from the very high point our exports reached last year. On the other hand, imports are certain to increase considerably as industrial activity and demand rise here. There will, however, be some off-setting factors. Capital inflow has continued to be fairly strong, and we will be drawing quite heavily on the International Bank loan arranged for the Snowy Mountains scheme last year. By now, too, it is probable that most, if not all, of the import credits taken out in  1960-61  have been repaid. In point of overseas reserves, our position is very strong. At the end of June our balances of gold and foreign exchange stood at  &#163;561,000,000  and, as we have repaid the  &#163;78,000,000  drawn from the International Monetary Fund in  1961,  our drawing rights with that institution have been restored to their full amount of  &#163;212,000,000.  All told, we started the year with first-line and second-line reserves totalling over  &#163;770,000,000. </para>
      <para>It is, then, in this promising context that the Government has decided to carry on, in certain directions with added emphasis, the full range of stimulatory measures adopted during  1961-62.  This involves budgeting for a deficit, in the accounting sense, of  &#163;118,328,000.  Our  1961-62  Budget was a lot more expansionary than the cash result on an accounting basis made it seem. On that result, there was a deficiency of  &#163;27,010,000.  But, in economic terms, the impact was a great deal larger than that, mainly for the reason that a very considerable amount of government spending was financed by the proceeds of loan subscriptions from trading bank sources, from money market dealers and possibly from other sources which could not be said to represent a subtraction from funds which would otherwise have been used to finance private spending. On the same grounds, the economic impact of this Budget will be greater than the estimated accounting deficit of  &#163;118,328,000  might indicate. This is because the estimated loan raisings included in total receipts allow for some trading bank and similar subscriptions to loans, even though not on the same scale as last year. </para>
      <para>I should also point out that the expansionary effect will be fairly heavily concentrated in the next six to eight months, which is normally the period during which the outflow of cash from the Government greatly exceeds the inflow. For that reason, the Budget can be assumed to provide the greatest stimulus to demand through a time in which it is likely to be most needed. All of the measures we are carrying forward into this year were carefully designed originally to stimulate particular sectors of demand, and they will undoubtedly continue to do that in the current year. In all, the concessions made in  1961-62  are estimated to cost revenue some  &#163;75,000,000  in  1962-63,  and virtually all of this will represent additional funds in the hands of taxpayers. Along with these concessions go the special measures involving expenditure. For instance, there is the grant of  &#163;12,500,000  to the States for employment giving activities and there is the large increase in expenditure this year - from  &#163;9,800,000  to  &#163;26,800,000-  on the special developmental activities and projects described earlier. It has been put to us by a number of people that, besides carrying on the  1961-62  measures, the Government should introduce some new measures to stimulate the economy, preferably in the shape of further tax reductions. We gave a lot of thought to these possibilities, but, on our assessment of how the economy is moving and of the encouragement it is likely to get from the increased stimulus in the Budget we propose, they did not appear to be justified. In fact, we concluded that they could lead to difficulties which might be serious, if not immediately, then at some time not too far ahead. They could be the means of provoking a rise in spending greater than expansion will require and they would almost certainly create major  budgetary problems at some time in the future. For it has to be kept in mind that, in our efforts to promote expansion, we have called upon our budgetary resources very freely. Taking the rise in expenditure last year with the projected rise for this year, our total expenditure will have risen over two years by no less than &#163;263,000,000. Meanwhile tax concessions have made deep inroads into our sources of revenue. To give a further major tax reduction at this stage would make it practically certain that the Budget a year or so hence would be carrying a large builtin deficit - this, quite probably, at a time of high incomes and expenditures. There would then be the choice of either carrying such a deficit, with the risk of inflationary consequences, or else of taking action to bridge an insupportably large gap. </para>
      <para>Summed up, the expansionary action of last year, which is to be continued and amplified through 1962-63, will cost the Budget, and in so doing put into the hands of the community, something above &#163;110,000,000. The comparable figure for 1961-62 was about half that. In fact, then, we are providing the economy with a considerable extra stimulus, both in an aggregate sense and in carefully chosen specific ways. We are doing this at  a  time when the general level of activity is undeniably on the rise, as indeed it has been for a good many months past. </para>

      <para>It is in our conception a key role of the Commonwealth in the economic sphere to provide an environment favorable to private enterprise and all who depend on it for employment and share generally in its activities. This in part involves using the powers and resources of the Commonwealth, within their limits, to encourage enterprise and to open up sound opportunities for it. In that direction this Commonwealth Budget contains an unparalleled range and variety of measures to promote development in all the main regions of the continent. It pays due regard to the need for care that any responsible government must observe, and yet its approach to our national economic problem is, predominantly and in the truest sense, forward-looking and constructive. </para>
