                        <para>- I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry. As it concerns two Ministers, if the Minister representing the Treasurer would caro to comment I should appreciate his remarks also. Is the Minister aware that a conference of the Australian Dried Fruits Association is currently being held in Melbourne and is to terminate on Friday? Is he aware also that the items which will give concern to this conference and to dried fruit-growers generally throughout Australia are the need for greater stability of world prices, the vital necessity to increase sales on the home market, the economic control over expansion of plantings and the search for new markets to replace those that will possibly be lost as a result of the United Kingdom's joining the European Economic Community? Has the Minister any comment to make, or has the conference been advised of the Government's preparations to meet and overcome these difficulties? Will the Minister tell the Senate whether he is again prepared to put up to the Treasurer a proposition to lift all sales tax from foodstuffs containing dried fruits and other fruits? </para>

                        <para>- I am aware that the conference referred to by Senator Cooke is being held in Melbourne at the present time. The next question he has asked refers to orderly marketing in this industry. I am sure that the honorable senator does not need me to remind him that the policy of this Government has always been to encourage orderly marketing under the control of the producers themselves. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator will just contain himself in patience, I shall be very happy to recount some of the history of our attempts to implement orderly marketing in this industry. The honorable senator may not remember the occasion, but some time ago the industry itself came to the Government and asked for a poll of growers. The Government, following its usual policy, consented. Certain conditions for the poll were agreed upon. When the result of the poll was announced it was clearly indicated that the growers had not been sufficiently well organized dr interested to give the Government the mandate that it required to implement a scheme of orderly marketing. The matter has not rested there. A good deal of work has been done by Mr. Turnbull, the honorable member who represents Mallee in Victoria, the home of the dried  fruits industry. Often Mr. Turnbull has pleaded in another place for the growers to adopt a scheme of orderly marketing. Efforts are continually being made towards this end and, who knows, the time may not be far distant when the growers again will come to the Government seeking a scheme of orderly marketing. The Government would welcome any such approach. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    <para>The other matters raised by the honorable senator concerning restrictions on plantings and the problems confronting the industry due to Britain's proposed entry into the European Common Market are under very active consideration. The Department of Trade is losing no opportunity to extend our markets into other areas. </para>
                    <para>The matter of the removal of sales tax on foodstuffs has been before the Government from time to time. This is a matter affecting budget policy and I have no doubt that it will be considered again when the next budget is being drafted. </para>

                        <para>- My recollection of this matter is that this year more nations voted against admitting red China to the United Nations, or abstained from voting, than was the case last year. In other words, the adverse vote this year was greater than it was last year. The conclusions to be drawn from that situation depend, I suppose, on one's judgment of the reasons why the member nations cast their votes in the way they did. However, the effect of their votes is unmistaken. </para>

I reiterate my statement of a few days ago, during the debate on the estimates for the Postmaster-General's Department, that television stations and entertainment houses through the length and breadth of the land invariably give the people what they want. I suppose a cynical person would say that that is a pretty sad commentary on our intelligence. That may well be, but the fact remains that there is always competition between the stations in the televizing of programmes. The Government has encouraged such competition. The stations- could not continue to exist unless their programmes were of a standards acceptable to the public. Of course, they cannot please all the people all the time. But there is an alternative source of. programmes. The Australian Broadcasting Commission broadcasts in all capital cities. I suggest that those who find fault with commercial television have a look at the A.B.C. programmes and relax. </para>

                            <para>- I have not seen the article referred to by the honorable senator. It relates to trials carried out by the Milk Marketing Board in England with, I understand, encouraging results. I do not know whether this ration has been tried in Australia, but I do know that cattlemen generally are showing an increasing interest in lot feeding. I might add that fattening methods are dictated by economics. The Australian farmer is not slow to adopt new methods of production. It may well be that the results of the English trial will encourage similar trials in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Is the Minister for Health aware that in a radio statement the Premier of New South Wales said that the staggering cost of health services can no longer be borne largely by the States? Is it a fact that this year the total health vote in New South Wales will be more than £34,000,000 and that the State Government will pay to hospitals £22,800,000 from its own revenue? Has the New South Wales Labour Government given free hospital treatment to pensioners in public wards in all hospitals since 1953? Further, is it true, as stated by the New South Wales Premier, that the Commonwealth's contribution to pensioner patients will be a mere £1,300,000, at the most, compared with a total cost of about £8,000,000 for pensioner patients alone in New South Wales? Is it not a fact that every State Health Minister objected to the Commonwealth's recent decision and requested an increase in the Commonwealth's contribution of 8s. a day to hospitals for ordinary patients? This rate of contribution, which has stood since 1947 - a period of fifteen years - is regarded as a disgrace to the Commonwealth. Finally, does the refusal of the request of the State Ministers mean that the Federal Government has created a grave situation that will force an all-round increase in hospital charges? </para>

                        <para>- Order! I direct the attention of honorable senators to the fact that in some of their questions they are supplying far too much information. This question is a case in point. Three parts of it refer to the New South Wales Government, although there is a part that refers to the Commonwealth Government. I ask honorable senators to give a little more attention to the form of their questions, to cut out the giving of information, and to make the questions conform more with the Standing Orders. </para>

                            <para>-  I have from time to time read of statements made by the Minister for Health in New South Wales. One must concede immediately that hospital costs are causing great concern to all State governments, and also to the Commonwealth Government. I have no specific knowledge of costs to the Government of New South Wales annually for hospitals, nor do I know the basis on which the costs are assessed, but I do know that, for the first time in our history, the cost of contributions by the Commonwealth Government to hospitals and to our national health scheme will amount to more than £100,000,000 in 1962-63, which is a very substantial sum of money. </para>

        Senator Fitzgerald
                        is not correct in stating that the Commonwealth payment has remained unchanged at 8s. per day since 1947. In actual fact, it was increased to £1 a day in, I think, 1957, which was an additional payment of 12s. That is not an insignificant addition. It is true that the State Ministers for Health presented a case for an increase of the payment of 8s. per day. The Commonwealth Government has always had a policy of directing its assistance and its benefits to the individual. The proposals we made to the State governments recently amplified that policy. An additional £3,200,000 per annum towards hospital costs is being provided. Again, that is not an insignificant sum. While I sympathize with the problems facing
                       Mr. Sheahan,
                        the New South Wales Minister for Health, and other State Ministers, I remind the honorable senator that of the additional sum of £3,200,000 provided by the Commonwealth Government, the New South Wales Government will receive something over £1,200,000.

Therefore, I shall have to ask that the question be placed on the notice-paper. For the record, however, I point out that there has been a very great expansion in the activities of this comparatively new organization. Indeed, the expansion has been so great that I hope the figures, when they are given in answer to the question, will come to the attention of exporters generally, so that they may become better acquainted with the services that are being made available by the Export Payments Insurance Corporation. </para>

I certainly have not available at the moment information regarding the rates of sales tax applicable and the total amount of tax collected, nor am I sufficiently well informed to give him an answer to the general question of the items which attract sales tax. By way of interim answer, I can inform him that the articles used1 by school children and other students which attract sales tax are articles which are not used exclusively in schools. In other words, if the articles have a general use throughout the community, they are taxed. Articles used exclusively in schools, such as specified text books and the like, do not attract sales tax.

                        <para>- I preface my question, which is addressed to the Minister for Civil Aviation, by stating that over the past three years I have addressed questions to him, warning him that the aviation companies within the European Economic Community contemplated an amalgamation which might seriously prejudice Qantas Empire Airways Limited, which would be forced to re-negotiate landing rights once the air union became established. He ridiculed my warnings and told us that everything would be all right in the future. I now ask: Is the Ministeraware that, after five years of hesitation, the French Government has now agreed in principle to joining the air union, a scheme for close co-operation between the airlines of the Common Market countries which would end in one giant European airline? Has he heard that the Ministers of Aviation in the governments of The Six will meet shortly to discuss the scheme? Will he tell the nation what serious effects this will have upon the Qantas organization? </para>

                    <para>The possibility of the formation of an air union, and the inclusion of France in that union is something which is well known to me. I have watched the matter with close interest ever since the proposal to form the air union was mooted. We are not interested so much in whether France or any other continental country joins the air union as in the prospect of the United Kingdom airlines joining it. I can assure the honorable senator that this question has been discussed by me, personally and by correspondence, with successive British Ministers for Aviation. I can assure the Senate that at present there is no proposal before the British Government that British airlines join such a union. I appreciate that this is a most important matter for civil aviation administration in this country. I can tell the honorable senator that its importance has been well recognized by this Government and that we will keep closely in touch with every development that occurs. </para>

                        <para>- By way of preface to a question addressed to the Minister representing the Postmaster-General, I point  out that in a commercial radio news broadcast this morning, within range of Canberra and probably the whole of New South Wales, a news item was issued about a tragic fire in Sydney which was raging at the time the broadcast was being made. It was announced that a person had been killed and a number of others injured. After the news item, a person of European origin was brought to the microphone and, in a hesitant voice, he answered questions about the origin of the fire at a time when he was obviously under great stress. I ask the Minister whether he will discuss with the Postmaster-General the possibility of his colleague expressing a firm view to the Australian Broadcasting Control Board that on-the-spot live radio and television interviews with witnesses to tragedies in which human life and limb are involved should be prohibited by the board. </para>

                        <para>- My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Trade, arises from the proposal by the Department of Trade to organize food and liquor promotions in Malta, East Africa and Hong Kong to stimulate preChristmas buying, and also from a statement which appeared in the Adelaide " News " on 17th October and which was made by Dr. B. G. Tarladgis. He warned that if Australia did" not find new food markets by 1970 some of its important industries would collapse. He also urged the development by the Australian food industry of foods which would suit the eating habits of potential customers in Asia and Africa. I ask the Minister whether any overall plans are in hand, in conjunction with the food industry, to develop and market appropriate foods for export to Asia and Africa to compensate for losses which could arise from Great Britain's entry into the European Common Market. </para>

                        <para>- This trade mission itself is evidence of an overall plan to obtain additional markets for food products in the East. I believe it is reasonable to assume from that that the food products we will endeavour to sell in that area will be in keeping with eating habits in that part of the world. I speak on this matter with a little diffidence because I do not know whether that aspect has been explored. In my opinion the question is of sufficient importance to be brought to the attention of 'the Minister for Trade. </para>

                        <para>- I direct a question to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I refer to the announcement by the Commissioner of Taxation earlier this week of the names of taxation defaulters and the penalties imposed on them. From a reading of the list in the press, it appeared that some people might have been listed as defaulters simply because a family partnership, company or some other arrangement has been disallowed by the commissioner, a board of review or a court. If that view is correct - I am merely seeking information on the point - I ask the Minister whether the Government does not distinguish in guilt between those people and people who deceitfully understate their incomes and falsify their returns. In view of the dictum of a former Lord Chief Justice of England, Lord Goddard, that a man has the right, nay, in some circumstances of family obligation the duty, so to arrange his affairs as to avoid the incidence of taxation, will the Government ensure that people who make full disclosure of their incomes under a scheme which subsequently is disallowed are not classified with people who seek to evade taxation by fraudulently understating their incomes? </para>

I do not know whether the names of people in the category referred to by Senator Hannan are included in the list as defaulters. I shall certainly inquire about that. If that is so, I am sure that the Treasurer would be the first to look sympathetically at this question. </para>

I ask you, first, to talk to the Ministers about this matter and, secondly, to indicate, not so much perhaps to newer senators as to those who have been in the chamber longer and who should know how to ask questions, the form in which questions should be framed. As a result of some of the questions asked last week, I ask you to talk to the Ministers and to seek advice from the  Clerk  concerning the honorable senators who are offending. Will you, Mr. President, indicate that a Minister is bound only to answer questions on matters relating to the department under his administration, and that questions should not ask for an expression of opinion? Will you indicate to Ministers and to honorable senators that on the back of the notice of question form which is to be found on every desk, there are seventeen rules laid down for the guidance of honorable senators on how questions should be asked? In commending you on your interest in this matter, I ask you whether you will take it a step further, particularly in relation to Ministers who have these matters in their own hands, and not throw all the responsibility on honorable senators to stop jumping up and asking questions that contravene the Standing Orders? </para>

                        <para>- I direct a question to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. In view of the increasing viewing of films both on television and in the cinemas, and the impact of these films on the lives of the people of Australia, would the Prime Minister suggest to the State Premiers that it might be advisable or helpful if they could introduce courses on film appreciation at teachers' training colleges and adult education classes? Since seminars and conferences on film appreciation are held overseas from time to time, will the Prime Minister consider directing some person from Australia to attend such conferences and to bring back information to us? </para>

Is it possible that this matter will break down because one State is not prepared to co-operate with the Attorney-General in the preparation of legislation to cover restrictive trade practices throughout Australia? If this is so, is there any alternative method by which the Commonwealth Government can introduce legislation to meet the urgent need for such an act? </para>

Has the Minister noticed that following the publication of a list of names of tax defaulters in New South Wales newspapers yesterday, a Sydney solicitor had to publish a notice in the press to-day to the effect that he was not the person who was named in the list of defaulters? The solicitor happened to have the same surname, initials and profession as one who was announced as being a defaulter. Will the Minister ask the Treasurer to ensure that every possible action is taken to see that if names are published, the persons concerned are readily and clearly identified? </para>

                    <para class="block">The Government has adopted the recommendation of the Tariff Board in its report on copper and brass in sheets and strips, which was tabled in the Senate on 9th October, 1962 for a bounty ob copper and brass strip of specified dimensions. The bill now before the Senate is designed to put this recommendation into effect. </para>
                    <para>In line with the board's recommendation, bounty at the rate of £45 per ton will be paid to producers of copper strip or brass strip not exceeding fifteen inches in width and not exceeding twelve thousandths of an inch in thickness, produced in Australia and sold for use in Australia. The bounty is to operate for two years from 1st October, 1962, and ah annual expenditure limitation of £190,000 is specified. In Common with most other bounty legislation, this bill contains provision for a 10 per cent, profit limitation. </para>
                    <para>At present, there are three companies in Australia interested in the production of copper strip and brass strip including strip of thicker gauge than that covered by the proposed bounty. There is a total investment of approximately £5,000,000 in the industry and the total number employedis about 800 persons. The board considers that the industry is an important consumer of locally produced base metals, and that the levels of employment and investment in the industry render it worthy of assistance. The board's reason for recommending a bounty was to prevent adverse effects on user industries, particularly motor vehicle radiator manufacturers. The principal uses of copper and brass strip are in heating and cooling systems, internal combustion engine radiators, and electrical equipment. The Government believes that the proposed bounty together with the retention of existing rates of duty, excluding the temporary duties, on imported copper strip or brass strip will correct the industry's disability in relation to imported strip. </para>
                    <para>An examination of the question whether further assistance to the industry is necessary will be undertaken by the Tariff Board prior to the expiration of the bounty. </para>

                        bill now before honorable senators proposes amendments of the schedule to the Customs Tariff 1933-1962. It comprises eight schedules with each schedule having a different date of commencement. For the benefit of honorable senators I will outline very briefly the subjects covered by the bill as they appear in each schedule. The first to fourth schedules impose temporary additional duties on -

                <para>With the exception of weedicides and insecticides, these tariff alterations arise from recommendations by the Tariff Board. </para>
                <para>The temporary duty on conveyor belts and belting has been removed in accordance with the Tariff Board's recommendations but the ordinary protective duties on both transmission and conveyor belts and belting have been increased. </para>
                <para>The Tariff Board's recommendations on copper and brass have been adopted by the Government and the temporary duties imposed in August last year have been removed. To assist the local industry without unduly penalizing users of thin copper and brass strip, assistance will now be given by means of bounty. </para>
                <para>The ordinary protective duties are being increased on furnishing fabrics of man-made fibres and on moquettes. The temporary duties have been removed from other manmade fibre fabrics, however, and these goods revert to the previous fixed rates of duty. </para>
                <para>On woollen piece goods the duties now imposed are lower than the former combined ordinary and temporary duties but are higher than those which applied before the temporary duties were imposed. The new duties apply only to fabrics containing 20 per cent or more by weight of wool. </para>
                <para>In a report on weedicides and insecticides, including those commonly known as 2, 4-D and D.D.T, a special advisory authority recommended the continuance of the existing temporary duties. </para>
                <para>The Sixth Schedule provides for a temporary duty on certain forged steel flanges of the slip-on or weld-neck types; whilst under the Seventh Schedule a temporary duty is imposed on vinyl acetate monomer. </para>
                <para>The Eighth Schedule provides for amendments consequent upon Tariff Board recommendations on snap fasteners and eyelets and menthol and thymol. Identical duties are being imposed on snap fasteners and eyelets, representing increased protection for snap fasteners and decreased protection for eyelets. </para>
                <para>In respect of menthol the board recommended increased protection against imports in order to maintain the local industry's position in the Australian and export markets. However, local demand for thymol is so limited that the board considered that the high level of protection needed to protect this small portion of the industry could not be justified. </para>
                <para>Following international consultations arising out of the Tariff Board's report on nitrogenous fertilizers, fertilizer grade urea is made free of duty from all countries. </para>
                <para>The remainder of the amendments in this schedule are of an administrative nature. Certain items have been amended so that freedom from duty may be granted in accordance with two international conventions, These are - </para>

I will restrict myself to those matters that I promised certain of my constituents I would raise in this Senate. </para>

                    <para>The first matter, which concerns the administration of the Postmaster-General's Department, is one which I raised twelve months ago during the discussion of the Estimates. In years gone by the  Chairman  of Committees would restrict us to the particular items before the committee and to the exact amounts of money dealt with in the Estimates, but this year we were allowed to range all over the place. Long ago I reached the conclusion that it was leve's labour lost to raise any matter during the debate on the Estimates. This year <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> raised what I thought was a most pertinent matter concerning the Australian manufacture of goods for the armed forces, but he did not get an immediate reply to his queries. When he insisted on a reply he was told that the atmosphere was not quite right for such a query. In view of what happened to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> I feel that my cynicism of the past thirteen years has been justified. </para>

                            <para>- It is that kind of thing that is ageing me. I am glad to see the Minister representing the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wade)</inline> in the chamber. I want to refer to the employment of officers in the Postmaster-General's Department as policemen. I am well aware that my remarks may apply with equal force to every Commonwealth department. If so, I will be happy for the Minister to pass on my remarks to his colleagues in the Ministry. Under the present system of promotion in some sections of the Postmaster-General's Department certain officers are made investigation officers, which is another name for detectives. These people are Fourth Division officers, according to information furnished to me in reply to a question I asked in this place. The Fourth Division is the general division. It is not the division in which senior officers are placed, which is the Third Division. These people are called upon to investigate all kinds of complaints ranging from petty shortages of cash if a senior officer thinks a malfeasance has taken place to such things as one officer assaulting another either by placing his hand on him or by striking him. The matters investigated by these officers include serious charges relating to offences that come within the criminal code. I am concerned because these men have no special training or instinct for this kind of work. They take the positions as investigators by way of promotion. They could just as easily become linesmen, mail officers or postmen. They could not become clerical officers because they are not qualified for such appointments. I believe that the handling of matters involving what amounts to the civil liberties of people in trouble should be done by people who have had the necessary training in such matters, who possess the necessary instincts for the work, and who know the code of ethics and behaviour which should be observed. I believe also that it is completely wrong that it is not laid down that when cases arise involving boys or girls under the age of 21 years, the parents of the children concerned should be informed of the charges pending against them, in order to give the parents an opportunity to assist the children in their difficulties and to see that their departmental careers are not adversely affected. </para>

                    <para>I have some cases that I should like to put before the Minister. They have been brought to my notice probably because of my association with the trade unions involved with the Postmaster-General's Department. Cases have come to me from all States. One case that was brought to my attention was that of a senior officer who was charged with assaulting a junior officer. The detective handling the case told the senior officer, "You must not discuss this case with anyone until we have made our finding ". I do not believe there is any other sphere in which a man who is charged with an offence can be told that he must not discuss the case with anybody - must not even approach counsel to seek advice. What was said in the case to which I have referred was, in my view, completely wrong. This officer was told that he should not discuss the case with any of his senior officers, with personnel officers or with anybody else. That is the very basis of my complaint. I do not want to rake over the ashes of the famous case that occurred recently in Brisbane, where a junior officer was threatened with the use of the Crimes Act against him if he gave information about a case in which he was involved. The investigation officer in that case completely exceeded his authority. </para>
                    <para>I have raised this matter before. I was foolish enough to raise it during a discussion on the Estimates and I did not get a reply. Having raised it again, I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wade,</inline> who represents the Postmaster-General in this chamber, to convey my remarks to the Postmaster-General and ask him to have a really serious look at this problem. He could well consider the status of the people who have these investigating duties thrust upon them. He could consider whether great benefit would be derived by using Commonwealth police officers. He could consider also whether it would be advisable to advertise these positions outside the department, offering appointments on either a permanent or revolving basis. It crosses my mind that there might be a great advantage in using the services of men who have been in the criminal investigation bureaux of the State police forces. Such men have been trained as detectives, and they know how they should treat a person whom they are charging with an offence, or interviewing in relation to an offence. There might be a great advantage to be gained by rotating such men through the department. Perhaps that would not meet with the approval of the Minster, and I can see some objection to it from the viewpoint of the Public Service. If the </para>
                    <para class="block">Minister does not like that system, I suggest that he consider a system of bringing to these jobs people who have already been trained in the work, and who know how serious the effects may be when they make a charge against a person. After all, even in the Public Service, a man should be presumed to be innocent until his guilt has been proved beyond all reasonable doubt. </para>
                    <para>There are several other matters that I should have liked to raise but I shall not raise them now because I understand that the Senate wishes to get on with other business. However, I shall refer to one matter about which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wade</inline> and I have already had a short discussion across the chamber. I had been pressed about it. I refer to the hiring of television sets. There is a responsibility on the person or firm hiring a set out to pay the licence-fee of £5 a year. I understand that firms that hire out sets have been charging their customers £6 10s. a year in respect of the licence. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wade</inline> will agree that these firms have made a capital investment and that they ought to be able to receive interest on their money. However, I think that a charge of 30 per cent should be regarded as rather stiff, even by a member of a government which professes to find a great deal of virtue in people buying an article at one price and selling it at a higher price. This practice, in my view, is striking at the root of the principle that no one shall make a profit out of services provided by the Postmaster-General's Department. </para>
                    <para>Licences to sell stamps are issued to shopkeepers in many places, but those licences are issued only for the convenience of the people in the areas concerned. The shopkeeper is not allowed to make a profit on the sale of stamps, although he may gain some advantage because people are attracted to his shop. The question of charges for the use of telephones arises from time to time, but this question is always skipped around because it is so difficult. </para>
                    <para>I think that in the case of these television licences a dangerous precedent is being established. First,  a  principle is being undermined, and secondly, a hidden charge is being imposed. I agree that when these hiring firms take out many licences they are involved in a fair amount of capital outlay, and I concede that they should be entitled to some return. However, I think that the department or the Minister should use moral persuasion, and, if necessary, legal persuasion, to see that the charges made are kept within reasonable limits. </para>
                    <para>I shall terminate my remarks now, although I would have liked to raise several other matters, especially as the Minister is in the chamber now. However, I understand that the Senate wishes to proceed with other business. I shall leave my other remarks on this matter until a later occasion. </para>

                    <para class="block">This is the fourth time in the last five or six weeks that I have spoken in the Senate on the question of rail standardization. It is the third occasion that an amendment has been moved by the Opposition, and supported by its members, to various bills, for the purpose of requesting that the legitimate requirements of South Australia in the matter of rail standardization he given consideration. I refresh the memories of honorable senators by recalling that on 16th August last I moved the following amendment to the States Grants (Additional Assistance) Bill: - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>That the bill be recommitted to enable consideration of the adequacy of the grant to South Australia to permit that State to proceed with the standardization of the Broken Hill-Port Pirie railway line. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That amendment was defeated in a division en party lines. Again, on 23rd August, I moved an amendment to the motion that the Estimates and Budget Papers be printed, for the purpose of adding the following words: -   but that the Government be requested to make provision therein for adequate funds to enable the standardization of the railway line between Broken Hill and Port Pirie to be carried out in conjunction with the State of South Australia. </para>
                    <para class="block">I remind honorable senators that that amendment was specifically asked for by the South Australian Parliament. Honorable senators on both sides of the chamber received a copy of it, together with a request that they give it their support. Again, the amendment was defeated in a division on party lines. </para>
                    <para>I come now to what I consider to be a most important point in this issue of rail standardization. I refer to the claim by the Liberal senators from South Australia that had they voted for any one of the amendments which have been proposed by the Opposition, they would in effect have been taking part in a no-confidence motion against their own government. They have taken refuge in that argument on each occasion. It may have had some validity in regard to the amendment to the Government's motion that the Estimates and Budget Papers be printed, which was moved by me and supported not only by my Labour colleagues from South Australia, but also by all honorable senators on the Opposition side of the chamber. </para>
                    <para>It may be recalled that there was a prior amendment to the motion that the Budget Papers be printed which had been moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> for the purpose of censuring the Government on account of certain inadequacies which we on this side of the chamber considered were associated with the Budget. But it is important to remember that when the first amendment was moved on 16th August, no refuge could be taken by South Australian Liberal senators in the argument that to support the amendment moved on that occasion would have been tantamount to taking part in censure of their own government, because that amendment contained no word of censure. All it asked was that the bill, which related to additional States grants, be withdrawn and redrafted in order that consideration could be given to what we regarded as the legitimate requirements of South Australia in relation to the standardization of the rail link between Port Pirie and Broken Hill. I make that point because I think it is important and because due regard should be had to it. Whatever may be said on this occasion, this is not the last that will be heard of the matter in the Senate. It will be raised time and again, until the position in South Australia is rectified and the interests of our State are preserved. </para>
                    <para>It is relevant at this stage to refer to a statement made by the Premier of South Australia in the Parliament of that State within the last two months. He stated - </para>

                    <para class="block">I remind honorable senators that many things have been said during the course of debates on this question of rail standardization.

I am saying, quite properly, that, in referring to the whole of the speech made by the Premier of South Australia, the Minister for Civil Aviation described it as the most unctuous speech ever made in any Parliament.

It would appear that some attention should have been given to the remarks of the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner, who was in a position to know exactly what were the requirements, not only of South Australia but of Australia as a whole. He did mention financial difficulty, but that is not a problem in Western Australia at the moment. Quite obviously, this is not so much a matter of finance as of determining which State is to get priority over others. </para>

                        <para>. The honorable senator has submitted a request for an amendment. I must tell him at once that the Government does not accede to that request. I am sure that does not come to him as any surprise because, as he himself will acknowledge, this matter has been debated, in one way or another, on three or four occasions now and the Government has made its attitude towards the proposal quite clear and quite plain. No one can be in any doubt about where the Commonwealth Government stands. I should, I suppose, refer again just briefly, even though tiresomely, to the last point of the negotiations with South Australia and mention the letter sent by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> to the Premier of South Australia replying to the request of the Premier with relation to rail standardization. As has been stated a dozen times, that letter does not constitute a flat, final refusal of the project; it merely points out, as it properly should in the circumstances, that the Commonwealth will not participate at that time. </para>

                        seems to take great comfort from what was said in 1953 by the then Commonwealth Railways Commissioner. If he had continued his research, he would have found out that the then Commissioner,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hannaberry,</inline>
                        expressed similar thoughts on many occasions. As a railway operator,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hannaberry</inline>
                        was, and still is, a staunch advocate of rail standardization. But the interesting point is that the line in question was a State-owned line and what
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hannaberry</inline>
                        said in 1952-53 about standardizing the gauge of that line was not nearly so important as what was being said or done by the Premier of South Australia about the standardization of the line. As I have pointed out in earlier debates, this enthusiasm on the part of the Premier of South Australia for gauge standardization is something of quite late vintage. Certainly he did not show any indications of it in 1952-53 or even in 1956. It was not until 1957 that
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline>
                        Playford evinced publicly any enthusiasm for the standardization of this particular line. I know from the knowledge I gained of the situation during my term as Minister for Shipping and Transport that the Premier of South Australia was not interested in the standardization of this railway line until 1957 at "the earliest. What is more to the point is that there has been some difficulty in getting from the Premier of South Australia a clear statement of what his priorities are in connexion with Commonwealth-assisted works. It has been stated in this chamber before that
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline>
                        has said that the work on the Chowilla dam is the first priority. He stated that if he got money for the Chowilla dam he would be satisfied with the £1,300,000 that was made available for the provision of locomotives and rollingstock. He got the £1,300,000 for locomotives and rolling-stock, and a further conference on the Chowilla dam is to be held in the near future - on Monday of next week, I believe - in order to make final arrangements so that the project can be put in hand. Any delay that has occurred up to now in putting the project in hand is certainly not the fault of the Commonwealth Government.
                    </para>
                    <para>In conclusion I say that this proposal for the standardization of the line from Port Pirie to Broken Hill is not being proceeded with at this time for the reasons that have been quoted over and over again. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> attempts to make a great deal of the fact that Commonwealth assistance has been extended to Queensland and Western Australia. The Government's overall policy which has been stated and is understood very well throughout the nation - namely that we intend to promote exports - attracted support to the Queensland and Western Australian proposals. The giving of that support does not mean that the South Australian standardization proposal has been thrown out finally and for all' time. Neither has the Government said that that is the position. As a matter of necessity, the proposal has been deferred for the time being. </para>

                        <para>. -  I do not intend to take up much more of the committee's time. Had I had a few more minutes before, I could have concluded the remarks that I wanted to make. I assure the Minister for Civil Aviation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Paltridge)</inline> that the question of water was one of the points that I wanted to make. I believe that the Chowilla dam is of great importance to South Australia. I note that the Liberal senators from that State have interviewed the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> on this matter. I read in yesterday's Adelaide " Advertiser " that such an interview had taken place. I think the question of rail standardization was mentioned at the interview, too. I do not want to pass by those matters. I am not critical of that action. In my opinion that was a proper action for the Liberal senators to take. If any criticism could be levelled at them, it would be that they might have taken that action a little sooner. Nevertheless, they took that action and I accord them the proper degree of recognition for taking it. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>We should not overlook the fact that when we think about water in South Australia we think with a sense of desperation. Those of us who know the expanding requirements of our State and know the paucity of the sources of water in South Australia understand quite clearly what the future is likely to hold for us. Therefore, the importance of the Chowilla dam cannot be over-emphasized. That becomes important in the scheme of things. The Commonwealth Government could have a tendency to say to South Australia, " Having granted you the necessary finance to proceed with the Chowilla dam, that means that you will not obtain the benefit of rail standardization within the measurable future ". </para>
                    <para>I say this to the Minister for Civil Aviation: Whatever might have been said by the Premier of South Australia in 1956 and whatever might have been said by the Premier of Western Australia at any time in the last twelve years - the Minister knows as well as I do that varying viewpoints have sprung from the States at different timeswhat has made this a matter with a deadline date is the fact that now that the standardization of the link in Western Australia has been agreed to by this Government South Australia will be by-passed in respect of national markets. Everybody in South Australia understands that. So the need to standardize the line from Broken Hill to Port Pirie has become more urgent in the last two or three years, and particularly in the last six months, than it was in 1956. It might be said that more foresight should have been shown in 1956. That is perfectly true. That is a reasonable observation. But that does not alter the fact that events in the last six or twelve months have made South Australia believe that the need for this project is impelling. </para>
                    <para>I do not want the committee to think that I am here merely for the purpose of useless or senseless repetition. It may be said that I have no right to make this claim but, regardless of what the Minister for Civil Aviation has said, I have a feeling that work will be commenced on the line between Broken Hill and Port Pirie within the next twelve months. I have that feeling because I believe that the people of South Australia want the work to be done. They demand that it be done in the interests of the State. I believe the people of South Australia, the press of South Australia and the business interests that are so vitally concerned in the question of markets will join with those of us who want to press this matter in seeing that some action is taken by the Commonwealth Government. </para>

                            <para>- Whether he has spent it or not has nothing at all to do with the matter. You might just as well ask whether he has spent the 5s. 8d. that was allocated, if you want to be absurd. The spending of the £50,000 is not holding up the project at all. What is holding it up is the fact that this Government at present is not prepared to allocate sufficient funds to enable at least a practical amount of work to be commenced. I do not think any honorable senator on either side of the chamber would be prepared to stand up and say that any government, by the expenditure of £50,000 on a task of this magnitude, could have begun to do anything practical. So, do not let us be diverted along those lines. </para>

                    <para>I repeat that we should not be diverted from this matter because of South Australia's desperate need for water. I do not think the South Australian business interests will be diverted. I hope that the South Australian press will continue the efforts it has made in the past six months to ensure that this work is undertaken in  a  way that will mean that South Australia will not be bypassed in respect of national markets and its industries will not be threatened. </para>
                    <para>It is quite possible that this request for an amendment will be defeated. The Minister for Civil Aviation has already said that the Government will not support it. He has given his reasons for that. In the light of the way the Government sees the position, it has made its decision. Of course, the Government has the right to make that decision. However, that is not the end of the matter. It certainly is not the end of it as far as I am concerned. The thought that is flowing through my mind is that at some time in the not too distant future, whether or not I bore honorable senators - I will have to take a chance on that - I shall ask my party whether it is prepared to support the submission of this subject for discussion as a matter of urgency. When I go back to South Australia next week, I shall be prepared to explore the possibility of arranging a deputation comprising the Premier of South Australia, the Leader of the Opposition and Government and Opposition members from both Houses of Parliament in South Australia to approach the Prime Minister and to ascertain whether the viewpoint we have cannot be given some consideration despite what has happened. </para>

I think such a deputation would then have more force. That is just  one  of the processes we could go through. Despite the unequivocal statement by the Minister for Civil Aviation that this is the end of the line so far as he is concerned, at this time at least, I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> does not so regard it. She would be prepared to say there has to be some degree of recognition of the old fight-on principle as far as South Australia is concerned. We just cannot afford to accept from the Minister for Civil Aviation an unequivocal statement to the effect that this is the end of the line for rail standardization in South Australia for the measurable future. </para>

                            <para>- Let me put it this way: Work has already commenced on the Western Australian section. If that section is finished twelve months or two years before the section between Port Pirie and Broken Hill, there will be a danger to South Australian industries and South Australian markets. The honorable senator knows that to be so just as well as I do. When I talk about the measurable distance in time, I want to see that section of line completed at least about the same time as the section in Western Australia. If we have that assurance, we will know where we are going and industry in South Australia will know where it is going. The fears of the South Australian Parliament will be allayed. I leave the matter there. I do not want to indulge in useless repetition. At least,  I  have tried to introduce a couple of new angles into the debate on this matter that I might not have introduced on the other three occasions when I spoke on it. I say finally that I, as a South Australian, still refuse to accept the view that this section of line between Port Pirie and Broken Hill should not be commenced in  a  practical way within the next twelve months. </para>

                    <para>The issue was pressed by Sooth Australian Liberal senators at their meeting with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Menzies</inline> to-day. </para>
                    <para class="block">I put it to the Senate that this report obviously has been fed to the press by Liberal senators and if the Government's position is the same as it was when we left the matter in this chamber, in fact the Liberal senators are misleading the South Australian public. I think that any moves that could have been made, first, could have been made on the basis of the 9th August proposal to the State Leader of the Labour Party in the House of Assembly of South Australia when he proposed that there should be a joint deputation to the Prime Minister consisting of himself, the  Speaker  of the House and the Premier of South Australia. When we took up this matter in the House, it became evident that the Liberal members offered the excuse that they were talking to the Government about the proposals. </para>
                    <para>I want to put these points: First, there is an attempt to mislead the South Australian people. Secondly, if the Minister for Civil Aviation is correct in saying that the Commonwealth Government has taken up a stand on this matter, it is the stand that was put to the Premier of South Australia in the Prime Minister's letter when he referred to the need to allocate money for railway works to States which could show that the work would increase export earnings. If this is the position, somebody has been misled because the </para>
                    <para>Liberal senators have said, " We will assist the State when the time is appropriate ". </para>
                    <para>It is not the important test in this matter to say that a State government has to put to the Commonwealth Government its works priorities. I say that rail standardization is the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government. It should initiate a programme to comply with the urgent requirements of defence. That is the sort of reasoning that is contained in the 1956 report of the Government members rail standardization committee. In the 1956 report, the Liberal members including Messrs. Wentworth, Fairbairn, Chaney, Senators Hannaford, McCallum, Maher, Messrs. Anderson, Brimblecombe, Erwin and Fox stated in ending their report - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>We therefore urge immediate action to put our proposals into effect. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">When we raised this question here, Liberal senators said we were trying to blackmail the Government into doing something earlier than the Government was able to do it. From the point of defence and national needs, the Commonwealth Government should promote rail standardization as it has already done in some States. If we study the cost, we find that since 1945 the estimates of cost of standardizing the Kalgoorlie section have more than doubled. On page 26 of the report of the committee of government members it is stated that the estimate in the Clapp report was £7,500,000. In 1956 the members of the committee estimated that the cost of the standardization of the 426 miles of railway had increased to £17,000,000. We know that delays will further increase the cost of the work in South Australia. </para>
                    <para>Let us go back to the proposition of the Prime Minister when he refused to make the money available. He said that the Government had to allocate funds to works which would increase our export earnings. A most important spokesman, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. M.</inline> L.

                            <para>-  I shall not take up much more time, because I know that the Senate's programme is heavy, but I should like to say that in relation to costs which seems to me to be the important part of this discussion, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Eric</inline> Harding, O.B.E., M.M., who made some study of this question and in 1958 published a very interesting book called " Uniform Railway Gauges ", gave some estimates. On the 1945 Clapp estimates, the cost of connecting the Australian capitals and converting the Victorian and South Australian standard gauges would be £45,000,000. In 1958 the cost would have been £84,500,000. This illustrates our point that the longer these tasks are put off the more the cost will inflate. This is another reason why the issue should be faced immediately. </para>

                    <para>This brings me back to the point I made earlier. The point of view of the Minister for Civil Aviation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Paltridge)</inline> was that the decision of the Government had been stated, and that it was in line with the position taken up by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> in his letter of August, 1962. I have already referred to a report which appeared in Tuesday's edition of the "Advertiser", which gives quite a different impression. Consider the various steps which have been taken. There have been Labour senators' overtures and representations in this chamber. The State House of Assembly made requests to South Australian senators again to make represenations on this subject. There was the proposition of the State Leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walsh,</inline> that there should be a delegation comprising the Premier, the  Speaker,  and himself, to federal Ministers on the question. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> made the point that he would be1 happy to join a deputation consisting of all South Australian senators to the Government to urge fresh consideration. The same sort of notion as was advanced in the "Advertiser" was canvassed in last night's " News ". In a leading article dealing with the proposed dam and standardization, the newspaper referred to a conference of the Prime Minister and three State Premiers to be held on Monday. It is reported that at the conference not only will the dam question be the subject of discussion but also the Premier of South Australia will raise the matter of rail standardization, upon which South Australian Liberal senators have made some private representation. The newspaper stated - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The conference represents something of a victory for South Australia's Federal members who, with a degree of urging, have pressed the urgency of the matter with the Prime Minister. </para>
                        <para>With careful politics they have made their representations outside the House in order to avoid embarrassing the Government. But the result is the thing. They have brought finality near. </para>
                        <para>In his pre-conference statement last night, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Menzies</inline> said he would discuss " other outstanding South Australian requests " with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Playford. Chief among these is rail standardization. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">I said originally that I thought that the representations resulting from the decision of the State House of Assembly and the action of Labour senators in raising the question in this chamber had brought this matter nearer to fruition or to fresh consideration. I put again one issue that arises. If the Government is concerned about rail standardization works as a means of ensuring that we shall win a greater export income, it must realize that this work in South Australia ought to be commenced forthwith. </para>
                    <para>It is common knowledge that since the former debate on the subject in this chamber the South Australian Public Works Committee has considered the representations of the Railways Commissioner and the Premier of South Australia.

                            <para>- That is no solution, as the honorable senator ought to know. We are putting up a case which is sound. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> said, this Government must finally admit that it has to assist the State to do the work, not only from South Australia's point of view but also from a national point of view. The case that we have put up has been strengthened by what the South Australian Railways Commissioner said. If the South Australian Government has to do alone some deviation work and alteration of grades, this will impose a heavy strain on the economy. This is what the Labour Party in South Australia and Labour members of Parliament have been concerned about, and it has motivated them to make the request. </para>

                            <para>- That is just sheer nonsense and political stunting, of which we have been accused. The honorable senator knows full well that the real test is the finding of a solution to the problem. It was said that if Liberal senators had supported our previous moves, it would have been tantamount to a vote of lack of confidence in the Government. In fact, if they had been genuine, they would have emphasized that urgent attention should be given to this matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield,</inline> of all Liberal senators, has made specious references to the situation in South Australia which do not answer the question at all. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> asked a question which suggested that the South .Australian Government should reduce the ton-mile charges on the Broken Hill to Port Pirie track because it was getting some special benefit from freight concessions on the transport of Leigh Creek coal. </para>

What we are putting up is what was unanimously supported by the State legislature. I am not misled by the newspapers, because I know that when it suits the press it can build up any topical issue and leave serious matters in the background; but ii is true to say that the press has made a clear-cut case in support of the representations that we have put forward, and that is the way it should be. </para>

                        <para>.- The bill now before the Senate is both voluminous and complex. Because it contains beneficial provisions relating to long service leave, including the removal of a penalty on that benefit, the bill will not be opposed by the Opposition at the second-reading stage. Amendments and new clauses will be proposed by the Opposition. I circulated them this morning so that the Senate would have the earliest opportunity to examine them. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>On perusal I find that the bill is essentially a committee bill. Three main principles are at issue between the Government and the Opposition. The first is the matter of amended section 36 - the new provision introduced by this Government in relation to the suspension of attendance money by way of penalty. Secondly, there is the new provision in proposed section 52A adding to that penalty on a firm or arbitrary basis. Thirdly, there is the question of the type of benefit that should obtain. These are the three main matters at issue. </para>
                    <para>For the most part the bill is directed to altering sections of the 1961 act which provided long service leave for waterside workers for the first time at the level of this Parliament. The Government, of course, was forced into activity in that matter by the very beneficial and enterprising action of the Tasmanian Government in being the first government in Australia to tackle the problem of long service leave for workers in the stevedoring industry. Not only was the Tasmanian legislation the first of its kind but it was introduced entirely without penalties. It was a model act upon which this Government had an opportunity to base its own legislation in 1961. Of course, seeing the inevitability of the benefit of long service leave being introduced on the waterfront, after the Tasmanian effort the Government stepped in, with some haste, I might indicate, in order to prevent other States following suit. If it had not done that it might have been faced with six different State enactments relating to long service leave. So it is the Tasmanian Government to which the waterside workers must look in thankfulness for the introduction of this long-deferred benefit to their industry. </para>
                    <para>The Opposition opposed the 1961 bill because of the faulty nature of the grant of long service leave, because of the penalty imposed on the benefit and because of other penalties added by the bill. Conjointly, they made the whole bill completely unacceptable, not merely to the Opposition, but also to the beneficiaries, the Waterside Workers Federation and the Australian Council of Trade Unions - the leader of the trade union movement in Australia. That our attitude was justified is seen when we pick up this bill of 29 pages, introduced within eighteen months of the passage last year of the bill conferring the initial benefit. If we need justification for the attitude we then took - that the bill should be opposed in its entirety on behalf of the whole of the trade union movement - that justification appears in the bill that we have before us now. The Opposition decided that the 1961 bill was too bad even to attempt to amend. That attitude, I repeat, is justified by the fact that the Minister, after a little more than a year, comes along to this chamber with 29 pages of amendments. </para>
                    <para>Before I deal with this bill itself, I want to say something about the circumstances in which the 1961 bill was introduced. The only discussion that the Government had with the parties that were interested - the A.C.T.U. and the Waterside Workers Federation - was based on a statement of principles affecting the bill produced by the Minister. Neither of those parties had any details of the bill before it at those discussions. The Opposition itself was forced into making a decision on the bill. Only three of its four leaders had even seen a draft of the bill the night before the matter had to be determined by the party. All the members of the Parliament belonging to the Opposition had to pass judgment on the bill on the basis of a draft presented to their leaders close to midnight the night before. Worse than that, they had to proceed that same day into the Parliament to hear the bill introduced and to go immediately into debating it. </para>
                    <para>It was a complex bill. It was quite novel. There was no precedent for it in the Parliament, in relation to this industry at least. The Opposition was mo,;t unfairly treated in being asked to proceed with the debate immediately. The method of proceedings in the other place was that the bill was gagged through ruthlessly, particularly in the committee stage. The House of Representatives never at any time discussed the new clause 52a. That was the clause dealing with penalties for concerted port stoppages. It was one of the key clauses of the bill, containing the provision that has caused* a great deal of the trouble that has happened in the interim. </para>

                            <para>- It had been discussed a good deal, but I repeat that, just as this bill is essentially a committee bill, so too was the original bill. I invite the honorable senator to cast his mind back to 16th May in this place and to the length of discussion that we had here. We were not gagged at all in this chamber, but we were obliged to discuss the bill continuously from about 4 o'clock one afternoon until nearly 2 o'clock next morning. </para>

The debate on the Stevedoring Industry Bill finished at about 2 a.m., but we were kept going continuously on many important bills - the discussion of most of them being gagged - and we continued non-stop until about lunch time the next day. I would say that the behaviour of the Government in relation to the proceedings of that evening and the following day had a very large effect upon its political fortunes at the last election. I think the whole of Australia was shocked by what went on then. </para>

Everybody noted what I have recounted to-day - the lack of proper time for consideration of the bill in the Parliament. I would say that the circumstances conected with that bill constitute one of the worst examples of the arrogance of the Government that I have witnessed in this Parliament. I directed attention to this in the speech that I made at the time. What I said then is reported at pages 1026 and 1027 of "Hansard".

                        <para>The claim of the trade union movement is that long service leave is a right  accruable  to a worker for services rendered to an employer or an industry. Because the legislation of the Federal Government relating to waterside workers does not recognize such a right without disabilities and penalties, the A.C.T.U. Executive expresses its complete opposition to objectionable principles in the Long Service Leave Bill which imposes penalties on entitlement because of industrial action by waterside workers. This provision is diametrically opposed to prevailing State legislation and would deprive some waterside workers of present long service entitlements. We also register an emphatic protest at the manner and procedure adopted by the Government for introducing the bill which denies the Labour movement reasonable opportunity to examine and analyse the full implication of the provisions. We request the Parliamentary Labour Party to oppose the bill in both Houses of Parliament on the basis of the trade union opposition to these provisions. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, it is. The council is completely opposed to the imposition of penalties on attendance money and before I conclude I shall make the position completely plain in that respect. Let me give fair warning to the Government. It has announced that it sees no alternative to the imposition of these penalties. When the Minister replies to the debate, I ask him to tell us whether that is still the position. Does the Government see no alternative? I should welcome an answer to that question, because if the answer is in the affirmative it will confirm my view of the utter barrenness of the thought of the Government in this field and of its basically wrong approach to the stevedoring industry. </para>

It definitely will not do that. The A.C.T.U. recognizes that something has to be done about concerted port stoppages. Every one with any sense realizes that that position has to be faced and met, I concede that that is so, and there is no argument on that point. I shall deal with the matter again before I conclude my remarks. </para>

                    <para>I have been recounting to date the circumstances in which the 1961 legislation was introduced. It is little' wonder that there has been industrial unrest in the interim, having regard to the circumstances I have already outlined. Now, let me come to the presentation of this bill by the Government and the Minister. I have no hesitation in saying that the method of presentation is a disgrace to the Minister and to the Government of which he is a member. In the eighteen years that I have been in this Parliament, I have never seen a more disgraceful presentation of an important bill. The measure came into the Parliament on 4th October, 1962, with 22 pages of amendments, mostly of the long service leave provisions of the 1961 bill. On 7th November, while the bill was in full flight in another place, the Government introduced a further nine pages of amendments and obliged the Opposition in the House of Representatives to debate them the moment they were lodged, which was most unfair. The mere fact that the Minister, after eighteen months, had to produce 22 pages of amendments in the first instance shows how ill-digested and ill considered that effort was. Then, he had to produce another nine pages of amendments within a few weeks. </para>
                    <para>At quite an early stage after the introduction of this measure I concerned myself with it because I regarded it as important. What was my problem? I found there was no consolidation or reprint of the various acts. I needed to have before me six separate documents. There were the 1956 act, the 1957 act and the enormous 1961 act. There were the Government's bill and the Government's pages of amendments to it, together with the amendments which the Opposition itself was proposing. It was a hopeless task until I embarked on the job of consolidating the three acts. It was difficult enough after that had been done. When I inquired quite recently for one more copy - a loose copy - of the 1956 act in order to complete the scissors-and-paste job that had to be undertaken by the Opposition, I was informed that there was not another copy, although the 1956 act is the principal act, available in the Parliament. That was the position right up to late last evening. So, I pity the plight of any honorable senator who waited for this measure to come into the Senate before he began to seek the material that would enable him to form an opinion of it and to understand it. He would have had to go through what I went through. He would have had to spend days and days, and hours of every day, in order to get the material marshalled. I say that that is a most shocking presentation of legislation. </para>
                    <para>Seeing the difficulty, on 31st October I approached the department and asked that a consolidation be prepared and that an explanatory memorandum also be prepared. I was told that the officers were exceedingly busy with amendment's of their own bill. I; was after that that the magic nine pages of amendments were produced. But evidently the department took some notice of my request because late last evening, after the bill had been introduced in the Senate, we received the consolidation. I say to the Minister and the department, "Thanks for nothing for that". All my notes had been prepared on another basis. The memorandum merely shows the incompetence which has characterized the introduction of this bill by the Minister. The House of Representatives had to proceed without it. It is something that should have been done in the first place. </para>
                    <para>The Minister stated in his second-reading speech that this bill had been in his mind since February last and that in February he had agreed to certain amendments. I should say that the presentation of the bill in this condition is completely contemptuous of the Parliament. I certainly do not mind work, bat I object to rinding my work being made unnecessarily difficult. Speaking for myself, I simply say that if ever a bill in this mess comes into the Parliament again I shall refuse to look at it, and I shall move that it be referred back. Honorable senators on the Government side may then accept their responsibility for allowing a bill in such circumstances to come before the Parliament. </para>
                    <para>I concede that we are dealing with a complex industry and with highly complex provisions, and that we are dealing with them as an experiment, for the first time. I should hope that the Government would be thoroughly ashamed of the method of presentation of this measure. We have a Minister for Labour and National Service who, in this instance, has not laboured enough and certainly has not given national service. He has certainly not served the parliamentarians of the Commonwealth Parliament as they should have been served. The whole presentation shows a lack of pride in work and a complete contempt for the Parliament itself. I think the members of the Ministry need to be reminded that they are not masters of the Parliament and the people but have the very great privilege of being the servants of the people at the highest level. It seems to be necessary to remind them or that. </para>
                    <para>Let me pass now to some of the effects that have flowed from this legislation. I do not have to throw stones at it. The Minister has done that himself. In his second-reading speech on the measure - which was repeated here - the Minister referred not once but a number of times to the provisions of the 1961 act as unfair, too severe and - please note this term - unjust. What he has said is true. They are not my terms; they are the Minister's own terms. They can be found in the second-reading speech delivered by the Minister for Labour and National Service in the House of Representatives and in the second-reading speech delivered in this place. At this stage, I am not going into the beneficial provisions of the bill. They have been adequately outlined in the second-reading speeches, and I have no doubt that if honorable senators on the Government side rise we will hear a good deal about the benefits and nothing about the defects. I leave that side of the situation to them. </para>
                    <para>Let me deal next with the effect that this legislation is claimed by the Minister to have had on concerted port stoppages. It is a great pity that this long-awaited benefit should have been received with hostility by the beneficiaries - a hostility justified by the terms in which the legislation was introduced in 1961 and by the behaviour of the Government, through its Minister, ever since. I remind the Senate that as I spoke on the bill on 17th May last, expounding the resolution of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, there was a nation-wide stoppage on the waterfront, called by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, to establish the complete opposition of the united trade union movement of Australia to the measure that was then brought in. There have been concerted port stoppages throughout the year, but mostly in the last quarter. It took time for the defects of this legislation to become apparent. </para>
                    <para>The Minister does not tell us, but I know it to be a fact, that in January of this year he had talks in Sydney with the A.C.T.U. and with the Waterside Workers Federation. He does tell us in his second-reading speech that he announced in February that he had made up his mind to make alterations to cure anomalies. There is no doubt that he had made up his mind in February to do that. It is a part of the announcement made in his second-reading speech. But how long did it take him to do anything about it? It took him from February to 4th October. And he wonders why the men in this industry become disturbed! </para>

I merely make the point that, having made up his mind in February of this year to make certain concessions, then, in all good faith, he should have brought them in at that time. He was reminded of that by me in this place on 10th April, when I asked whether such conferences had taken place, whether he had made an agreement to cure anomalies and whether he would bring in the legislation during that session. It took him from 10th April to 8th May to answer that question. It took him almost a whole month to answer that simple question, and then he said - </para>

                        <para>I and my department have already had discussions . . . about these and further discussions are scheduled for 9th May. It can be expected that the drafting of amendments to the legislation will take some little time. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The Minister's announcement was made in February, but nothing happened until 4th October. Discussions were proceeding and the watersiders and the people associated with them completely lost faith in the Minister's assurance. He could so easily have made himself good with them by clearing up the anomalies which he had agreed in February to clear up. Why, if the thing was unfair and unjust, did the Minister delay in rectifying it? Is that the proper approach for a Minister who is concerned about removing the causes of turbulence in an industry - to acknowledge an injustice and to dither and delay from February to October before bringing a measure into this&lt; place, despite conferences and despite pressures? Is it any wonder that from April onwards there was turbulence in this particular industry? Frustration was felt bv men scattered all over the ports of Australia as, day after day, more anomalies came to the surface and nothing was done about them. I say that if there is any justifiable claim to protest against these stoppages, the blame for them has got to be laid at the door of the Minister because of his mishandling of the situation. </para>
                    <para>Let us have a look at what really did happen during the period. If we turn to pages 116 and 117 of the report of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority we find evidence of a vast improvement in the industrial record of the waterside workers for the year 1961-62, when the percentage of man-hours lost through stoppages was 1.3 - the second lowest in sixteen years. The only year when the percentage was lower in those sixteen years was 1958-59. The matter is seen in perspective if one compares the percentage of man-hours lost through stoppages, which was 1.3, with the percentage of man-hours lost through rain, which was 3.7. Rain caused three times as much loss of man hours as did industrial stoppages. To indicate the improvement, I point out that whereas in 1955-56 the number of man hours lost through stoppages, expressed as a percentage, was 8.6, by 1961-62 the figure had dropped to 1 .3 per cent. That is the first point I want to make. </para>
                    <para>I refer now to pages 104 and 105 of the authority's report, where we get another opportunity to put the quantum of stoppages into perspective. For the year ended 30th June, 1962, the total percentage of nonproductive time was 37.8. Cargo delays and berthing delays totalled 2.8 per cent, between them. The watersiders cannot be blamed for any of that. A far higher percentage of man-hoours was lost through those two causes than was lost through port stoppages by the men themselves. Again, if one refers to the graph setting out the comparative position, which appears at page 65 of the report, one will see the enormously improved performance of the stevedores in 1961-62 compared with performances in 1959-60 and 1960-61. </para>
                    <para>May I show one further thing by way of comparison? I turn now to the annual report of the Joint Coal Board for the year 1961-62, which says this in paragraph 76 - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Once again the Board reports a year of good industrial relations. The percentage of manshifts lost to manshifts possible in underground mines was 1.32, a record low figure. This pleasing state of affairs reflects credit on management and on union leadership. The result in terms of the effect on production is set out in the following table . . . </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The board devotes only five lines to the question of industrial stoppages and hails with joy and complete accord a loss of 1.32 of working time. It is just as well to see things in perspective and to see the magnification that the Government makes of these unjustified - I am speaking in a legal and not a moral sense - concerted port stoppages. One begins to see those stoppages in their proper perspective when one has regard to the facts about which I have been speaking. </para>
                    <para>I shall continue to refer to port stoppages for a minute or two. It is unfortunate that the grant of this benefit should have been bracketed from the outset with penalties on long service leave. The Government now admits that the penalty in the loss of up to 30 days of qualifying period for the benefit was unjust. That is the word that the Government applies to its own provision. </para>

                            <para>- You may disagree with me. I will be very interested to hear the interpretation that you are able to put on those words. They are not words that I have conjured up; they are words that appear in the second-reading speech made by the Minister for Labour and National Service in another place and the second-reading speech made by the Minister  for  Customs and Excise <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Henty)</inline> here. The bracketing of penalties with the grant  of  this benefit naturally led the waterside workers to suspect that these penalties were introduced to help to finance the new long service leave. That was their suspicion; that was their fear. They said that. That was one of the arguments that were addressed in this chamber. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue>
                    <para>Let us see how the financial side works out. At page 51 of the report  of the  Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority one finds these figures. From 6th June, 1961 to 30th June, 1961, the penalties amounted  to  £2,102 8s. For the whole of 1961-62 the penalties amounted to £379,335 lis. Up  to  30th June this year those two amounts made a total of £381,437 19s. </para>
                    <para>What were the long service leave payments and commitments during exactly the same period? At page 81 of the report the authority states that they Were £367,830 16s. 5d. So the amount of penalties deducted and to be deducted from waterside workers under section 52a in the loss of attendance money is more than enough to pay the £367,000 spent on long service leave since the inception  of  the scheme. The men lost £381,000 in attendance money and the A.S.I.A. accordingly saved that amount. It is extraordinary how the two amounts balance out in favour of the authority. </para>
                    <para>Therefore, one cannot blame men, who started off with the suspicion that these penalties were designed to raise the money to pay for their long service leave benefits without any increase in the stevedoring industry charge made on the stevedoring companies, for feeling that their fears are confirmed when they look at the figures. In order to bring the position up to date and to clear up some doubts, I make this statement on the authority of the federal president of the Waterside Workers Federation: Since 30th June this year the penalties inflicted and to be inflicted1 on the waterside workers amount to almost another £400,000. That information has been taken from the monthly reports of the A.S.I.A. which give the number of suspensions. So, in addition to the £381,000 taken from the waterside workers in the forfeiture of attendance money since the inception of the scheme, another £400,000 became liable to bc forfeited in the period from 1st July to 31st October this year. That makes a total loss to waterside workers under that penalty of about £780,000. </para>

                            <para>- That is right. Not all of that has yet been inflicted. It will be spread as the men earn attendance money. It will be forfeited in the future. So the penalties imposed under the 1961 legislation up to 31st October amount to £780,000. I repeat what I said at the outset in answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> The Opposition is completely opposed to the suspension of entitlement to attendance money. </para>

                    <para>The amount of attendance money was 24s. a day up to 31st October, 1961. It was increased to £1 8s. 3d. a day from 1st November, 1961. What is attendance money? It is paid when work is slack, when the earnings of waterside workers are light. The present rate represents £7 ls. 3d. for a five-day week. That is less than the dole. It is less than the unemployment benefit for a man with a family. Perhaps it is enough to provide food for a man and his family; but as for giving him anything with which to meet his normal commitments, it is just useless. It is a pittance; it is a dole; it is not a great benefit. It is paid at the rate of £7 ls. 3d. for a five-day week. So one sees it for what it is - a bare pittance; certainly not a living; not even half a living. When work is scarce and the men's earnings are below normal, that is the time that this Government selects to strike a blow at that paltry benefit. </para>

                    <para>We will be seeking to amend the offences clause in section 36 in committee, and I shall reserve what further comments I have on that matter until then. But I do want to say something about new section 52a which was introduced by the Government in 1961. It provides penalties, first of all, of four days' suspension of attendance money in respect of any day of unauthorized port stoppage, and also authorizes the deduction from qualifying service for long service leave of a period not exceeding 30 days for each port stoppage. Now the Government has recognized the . injustice of the provision penalizing qualifying service for long service leave and has abolished it; but how does it go about abolishing it? It does not repeal the section imposing the penalty. It puts in another section which states that the authority is not to exercise it after this date. What conclusions are the waterside workers to draw from that? They will say that it is a mere subterfuge. They will say: " This is a threat over our heads. If we are not good boys according to the Government's order, it will repeal the new sub-section which tells the authority not to exercise it, and immediately the section comes into force." I think the Government is buying trouble. I think it is seeking trouble. I cannot imagine anything more provocative to the men than to have the Minister admitting the injustice of that provision and then letting it remain in the act. lt is most extraordinary that that provision is there and it calls for a great deal of explanation. </para>

They do not know the provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act. When the Government presents a document like this, the waterside workers look at it and try to understand it. 1 am sorry for them when they try to understand this legislation. 1 am reminded of one further thought, that if the Government wanted understanding and peace on the waterfront, it would produce a docun -nt written in simple and non-technical terms to explain this benefit and take away many of the arguments that are used by some of the people who mislead the waterside workers from time to time. The Government should supply an explanatory memorandum. As a lawyer, I find the greatest difficulty in either following or understanding the provisions of this legislation. If ever a situation called for a brief, easy, simple explanation in non-technical terms, this is it. </para>

                    <para>The Minister has called for peace on the waterfront, but what contribution does he make to it? There are insults, penalties, complicated legislation and no help in the Parliament towards an understanding or a consideration of the measure. The Minister has simply never given the situation a chance by the way he is behaving. Let me return to the Tait committee's report of 1957. I do not want to develop this theme but I ask the Government to look back at the recommendations put before it by that committee. Many of them it has never implemented, lt might find benefit in going back to the recommendation which drew attention to the delay and frustration and the annoyance that arise from having two authorities - the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority and the Commonwealth Arbitration Commission. They could be blended. There are recommendations in that report that I invite the Government to examine further. </para>
                    <para>I wish to refer only to one more mattei before I conclude. I refer to the financing of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority. As honorable senators know, the authority is financed by a stevedoring industry charge that is varied from time to time according to circumstances. The authority recounts that in August last year, after the introduction of long service leave benefits, it made an application to the Government for an increase in the charge. The authority did not get the increase until 1st April. This is a significant fact. For eight months there was delay in granting an increase in the stevedoring industry charge, and at the end of the period, the board's funds went down by £1,056,394 over the year. Its expenditure was £1,000,000 more than its income up to 30th June, 1962. Over the same period, the deficit on capital account rose to £444,000. So, to speak in the vernacular, the authority went down the drain to the extent of nearly £1,500,000. (low did that come about? It was solely and simply because of the delay and dithering in this important matter on the part of the Minister and the Government. If the lOd. increase from 2s. 6d. to 3s. 4d. granted on 1st April had been, as it should have been, granted in August when the request was made, the authority would have collected another £1,500,000 and there would have been no deficit on either income account or capital account. The figures are simply worked out by any one who cares for the exercise. The man-hours worked in the whole period were 26,500,000. The eight months' delay in imposing the charge brought the man-hours to be calculated to 17.600,000. Multiplying that by 10d., we get £1,500,500. </para>
                    <para>Is there any wonder that the waterside workers were suspicious, seeing the mounting involvement of the authority in expenditure on long service leave and seeing no change whatsoever in the charge? Of course, they find at the end of the period that in effect, either immediately or prospectively, they have themselves found all money required to pay long service leave. I indicate these things to show, on behalf of the Opposition, that this dithering, this incompetence, this desire for penalty, this pinpointing of port stoppages to the neglect of every other factor in the waterfront industry, is itself creating the turbulence and turmoil. When I spoke on this subject in 1961, I said that unless the Government changed its attitude in this matter it never would get peace on the waterfront. I repeat that now. I agree with the statement of the Minister for Labour and National Service and of his representative in this chamber that there can be peace on the waterfront. Of course, there can. But we will not get it through penalties. It will not be got by delaying such benefits as the bill provides. </para>
                    <para>In reply to an interjection by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lillico,</inline> who is not here at the moment, I undertook to say something about incentives, as against penalties. I concede that we cannot have unauthorized port stoppages. I concede that something must be done about them. But I venture to say that we will never get peace on the waterfront while we impose penalties upon a niggardly benefit like attendance money, by taking a dole from people. There is a way of achieving peace on the waterfront which 1, speaking for myself - not necesarily for the party - and subject to the approval of the trade union movement, would commend to the Government. I suggest that no industry in Australia was more turbulent than the coal industry. To-day it is a quiescent industry. In a report as thick as the one I hold in my hand, running into many pages of typescript, the Joint Coal Board devoted exactly five lines to this subject, referring to the pleasing state of affairs which reflected credit on management and on union leadership. How did that come about? We had the momentous coal strike of 1949. Thereafter the men were granted long service leave without strings, without penalties. In December, 1950, they were granted an incentive by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gallagher,</inline> later <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Gallagher. </para>

                            <para>- They have record production, but one must be fair and say that vastly more capital and vastly more mechanization are involved and that this is a factor. Looking at the table appended by the Joint Coal Board under the headnig " Industrial Disputes ", one finds that the percentage of man-shifts lost to man-shifts possible has fallen year after year, from 14.28 in 1949-50, to 4.29 in 1953-54, to 1.32 last year. That is a vast change. How did it come about? One of the factors, but not the only factor, undoubtedly was that in December, 1950 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Gallagher stated in an award that industrial turmoil had to be halted. I thought that 1 had that report with me; I regret that I cannot quote from it at the moment. He provided that for every ten shifts worked when coal was being produced - unless it were halted by fire, flood, &amp;c. - the men got pay for one extra shift. There was an incentive to the coal-miners, not a penalty on stoppage. If they worked five days in one week and five days in another week they received an extra shift's pay. That benefit runs right through the industry, into the offices. It applies to the clerks who merely wield pens and pencils. There is an extra benefit of 2s. 6d. a ton on' mechanical extraction of pillar coal. </para>

Obviously one of the safeguards in providing such a benefit for waterside workers would be that men were not induced to work in unsafe conditions for the sake of getting additional pay. That would have to be policed and safeguarded. There are other safeguards. I have not discussed this with the Waterside Workers Federation, but I put it up in answer to the Minister for Labour and National Service, who said in another place that there was no alternative to penalties. I say that there is. The Government might see a most dramatic change come over the waterfront if, instead of penalties - particularly the despicable, mean one on attendance money -it provided incentives to the men to keep working. If the Government stopped irritating and condemning them, I believe we could get peace on the waterfront, but the Government continues to irritate and frustrate the men with long-continuing penalties. </para>
                    <para>Let me conclude with one instance. When a man's attendance money is suspended for four days, he does not pay the forfeiture at once. The forfeiture is made when he attends and no work is available for him. There are men in Sydney and Melbourne to-day who will take four years, to pay the penalties they have already incurred under this legislation. They have been ordered to forfeit attendance money for as many as 60 days for fifteen stoppages. Loss of pay for 60 days is ahead, of them. I am informed on very reliable authority that they will be four years working it off. What kind of penalty is that?' It is something that is irritating and annoying throughout those years. </para>

There can be no dispute that the present bill is put before the Senate on the basis that that safeguard was unfair to the waterside workers. Seeing that a query was- raised as to that matter by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna),</inline> let me read what the Minister for Customs and Excise <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Henty)</inline> said in his second-reading speech on the bill.

I regret that there is not a full-blooded opposition to this measure. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna's</inline> speech was spoken from a brief for the Waterside Workers Federation and not for the country. I want the Senate to get that firmly in its mind at the outset. The performance of this industry under the present system, with the legislation as amended last year, is pathetic. Deliberately and continually our export industries have been white-anted. Interstate movement of goods by sea is now insignificant. When you take into account the most thought-arresting and strong comments printed in italics in the very forefront of the report of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority it is amazing to me that people who purport to represent the national interest should neglect the slightest reference to those matters and, indeed, join with the Minister in removing collateral safeguards that have shown the things to which the industry responds. </para>

                        made a comment about the way in which you get industrial peace. It is significant with regard to this industry that we have before us a reprint of the legislation in a bill covering 73 pages. The bill is a long, confused, complex, intricate and unintelligible piece of rubbish that defies understanding with any degree of clarity even after the long and continuous consideration that lawyers are inclined to give to these matters. I cannot see how the ordinary man who has to administer the bill can possibly understand it. The legislature, with little skill applied by each ministerial contribution, has endeavoured feebly year after year to confuse and add to the legislation. Contrast that with the system that has been adopted both federally and in the States for the development of industrial relations whereby special tribunals deal with particular fields of industry. With their accessibility to those particular fields of industry and their expert knowledge of them they give a much better performance than our parliamentary performance, although their productions are extremely difficult to understand.

                    <para class="block">So, on the basis of the Minister's speech, the essence of the stevedoring industry scheme is a whole system of regimentation and regulation. Of whom? Of the workers. Let me direct the attention of those who have some concern for the public interest to the cost of this scheme as it has developed. The report of the Stevedoring Industry Authority for the year ended 30th June last shows that we are now paying a special pay-roll tax on stevedoring labour of 3s. 4d. a man-hour. That is a tax at the rate of about <inline font-style="italic">33i</inline> per cent. - a super payroll tax. T think the award rate of a waterside worker has been advanced in the last twelve months by some 7d. and is now lis. 2d. an hour. The 3s. 4d. tax has been operative only since about 1st April last and the aggregate yield has been £3,432,000. In the previous year the yield was £3,844.000. This current year, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna's</inline> figures are correct, the yield will be about £4,900,000. Ten years ago, in 1952, that tax yielded £550,000. That is not a bad increase. Despite the enormous yield, the deficiency of requirements this year - that is to say, the extent to which the authority exceeded its income, was £1,056,000. I would have thought, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that some acute attention would have been given to this matter, because this is one of the cost integers that affect freights. I have not seen the latest figures from the United Kingdom, but the last figures I saw showed that stevedoring costs in the United Kingdom represented 8 per cent, to 9 per cent, of freight rates. The Australian costs represent about 20 per cent, of freight rate. </para>

                        <para>During 1961-62 waterside workers worked fewer hours and earned less wages. On average, about 12,760 regular waterside workers were employed each day and there was no work for an average of about 4,950. </para>

                    <para class="block">I have not worked out the percentage, but I accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna's</inline> figure. About 39 per cent, of the work capacity was unused. Yet the waterside workers managed to average, throughout the A class ports, £22 for 26 hours worked per week. To my way of thinking, in comparison with other sections of industry, that is pathetic. The people who are responsible for maintaining that system are derelict to their responsibilities. As I have said, a Minister who perpetuates that system, and then goes on to weaken it still further by the essential provisions in this bill, deserves no confidence. Of the work done for 26 hours  a  week by about 60 per cent, of the men who are registered for work, 37.7 per cent, is non-productive. Of the total gross gang- hours worked at the ten major ports in 1961-62, 37.7 per cent, was classified as non-productive. Coupling those factors with the degree of energy in the industry, which is a notorious public fact throughout Australia, the gross inefficiency and failure of production in this system is such as to condemn it. </para>

The Senate will see that the registrations at Burnie and Devonport have been reduced, and that any better performance in tons per man-hour is attributed by the authority mainly to the use of container-type vessels. I am glad to note that the authority puts on record that it has under active consideration the establishment of a true productivity index.

That scheme was brought in by the Holland Government just before <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Sidney</inline> Holland visited us in 1950 or 1951. The New Zealanders went through their travail and came up with decent leadership of the union. They introduced co-operative profit sharing on the waterfront, and that is the result. We have a system that was adopted after advocacy from the waterside workers themselves. As the Minister has told us, it is in essence a system of regimentation and regulation. I have endeavoured to show the poverty-stricken, fruitless results that come from it, what a waste of work capacity it involves and what enormous costs of a wasteful character it entails. </para>

                    <para>I come now to the main purpose of this bill, which is to make a concession to the Waterside Workers Federation and to eliminate the provision of the 1961 legislation whereby it was provided that the accrual of long service leave should be deferred by such part of a period not exceeding 30 days as the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission determined, should the waterside worker concerned participate in a port stoppage involving more than 250 workers. That is called a penalty. The Minister who urged his party to vote for it last year is now urging that the reason for its repeal to-day is that it is unfair. </para>
                    <para>The other provision that was introduced last year as an aid to discipline was that the individual who participated in a port stoppage should become disentitled to the next four days' attendance money that otherwise would accrue. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> has said that that is a severe penalty which takes away from the waterside worker something very valuable. I should have thought that a fair outlook would have been to describe the situation in this way: When attendance money was introduced as a collateral incident to this scheme it was an incentive. I am again relying on my memory when I say that I believe a perusal of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Raymond</inline> Kelly's judgment on attendance money in 1952 will show that he re- commended that a man who participated in a stoppage should lose his attendance money. I believe that all the provision did was to deprive a person who took part in a port stoppage of an incentive, of an advantage that he would otherwise gain by being a registered member of this scheme. We are now told that the waterside workers have fought this provision as an unacceptable condition of their long service leave. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> was forthright enough to say that their attitude is one of stern opposition to it, despite the fact that the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority states, in the very first paragraph of its report, the importance that it attaches to the? particular aid to discipline. The report states - </para>

                        <para>The total loss of man hours during the year because of unauthorized stoppages on the waterfront amounted to 358,124 hours, which is the second lowest annual figure recorded since 1946-47. But the greatest loss was in the final quarter. In the first three quarters of the year, the loss was running at the rate of 50,000 man hours per annum. The loss of 4,709 man hours in the January-March quarter of 1961-62 was the lowest ever recorded. The dramatic improvement in the loss of man hours from stoppages was due to the deterrent effect of the disciplinary provisions of the 1961 legislation. </para>

                    <para class="block">Do honorable senators notice the diplomacy with which the authority, in reporting to the Parliament, has avoided placing specific emphasis on the disqualification for long service leave, or on forfeiture of attendance money? The term it uses is " due to the deterrent effect of the disciplinary provisions of the 1961 legislation". The report proceeds - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The loss in the last quarter of the year  -  315,103 man hours - was more than seven times the total for the preceding nine months. The fundamental cause of this increase in the last quarter was the calling, particularly at Sydney and Melbourne, of stoppages in protest against the 1961 legislation. The effectiveness of the new disciplinary section 52a rests principally in the suspension of attendance money. Each man involved in an illegal stoppage under this section forfeits, for each day of the stoppage, the next four attendance money payments he would otherwise have received. The qualifying service for long service leave for each man involved is also reduced. Prior to the introduction of the suspension of attendance money there was no real deterrent to unauthorized stoppages by a large number of waterside workers at a port. Suspension of their registration merely prolonged the delay to ships involved in the stoppage. Often, too,  the  waterside workers profited by stoppages, which resulted in an increase in work being done outside ordinary hours at penalty rates. </para>

                        reach the stage of thinking, as he said in his second-reading speech in another place, that this was a saddening and revealing experience. I should think it is probably true to say that it was saddening, but the degree of revelation, I regret to say, is all too restricted. After recounting the effectiveness of actions that he described as political, Communist, purposeful stoppages on the wharfs, well might he ask, " Why do I go on with the measure? ".' The first reason that he gives is that he was convinced that the Australian Council of Trade Unions had no sympathy with the behaviour of the Waterside Workers Federation. Is he still so convinced after
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna's</inline>
                        speech to-day? I ask whether he was so convinced when he added these significant words -  although one would have wished that it would have said so publicly in clear terms.

                    <para class="block">Those words indicated that the A.C.T.U. had kept its expressions of divorcement of sympathy to itself and had not published them for the assurance of the public. </para>
                    <para>A second' reason why we are asked to vote for the repeal of those provisions which contributed to the effectiveness of the 1961 legislation is that the Minister thought it' would be wrong not to correct the anomalies, because not to do so would have been unfair to individual waterside workers. What is unfair in allowing the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to determine to what extent, not exceeding 30 days, a man's long service leave shall be deferred because he has participated1 in a port stoppage? If the stoppage is excusable, surely we. can depend upon the commission to Treat the waterside worker justly. In face of the importance that is put upon the effectiveness of the 1961 legislation by the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority itself, and notwith standing that twelve months ago the Minister was urging that this was a just and fair proposition, we are invited to-day to incite stoppages similar to those, that occurred from March to June and to show to the workers that if only they will make the number of stoppages in those months next year seven times what it was in the previous nine months, when the deterrent was effective, the Minister will crayfish again. Why do I say that? I invite honorable senators to read the last paragraph of the Minister's speech, in which he said - </para>

                    <para class="block">Having recounted the sad story of the Communists' effective campaign in the last quarter of last financial year, he says this measure is an instalment! There is reference to the Minister's parleying with the union to reduce the four days' forfeiture of attendance money to three days. And this is put to us as a instalment! For my part, I am going to stand by what I read into the authority's report, which is that the authority believes that the previous nine months was the most effective disciplinary period it has ever had. For us to weaken that disciplinary power, even without a Communist campaign in the last quarter of the last financial year, is to betray the industry and to weaken the authority. </para>
                    <para>I expect that I will be told that the authority is in agreement with the measure. I had the benefit of knowing the value attached to these disciplinary measures by the executive of the authority when I was asked to vote for the 1961 legislation. I voted for that legislation because it accompanied long service leave with what I thought were preliminary, initial measures of disciplinary aid. Little did I believe that they would be reduced. I thought that as productivity in the industry grew we would have better aids to discipline the malcontents, the people who fomented the last quarter's Communist campaign. I believe that nobody can read the paragraph printed at the very forefront of the report without gaining the conviction that, whatever may be said in political circles, it is a mistake, in the opinion of the authority, to weaken the safeguards that were running with such satisfactory effect for the first nine months of last financial year. </para>
                    <para class="block">Because the Government takes the view that that safeguard should go and the Opposition says that not only that safeguard but many more safeguards should go, I am a voice wailing in the wilderness, but if there is any proposition to make this bill as bad as it could possibly be by injecting objectionable amendments into it, so that it will not survive the third reading, I am still open for consideration of such a manoeuvre. </para>

                        <para>. - I rise to speak briefly to this measure because I have a few convictions that I feel should be recorded. The trouble that has occurred since the measure was passed last year has been due to the penalty provisions contained in that legislation. We heard about those from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> this afternoon. We have also heard about the injustice that was inflicted upon the waterside workers because of those provisions. Those provisions would not have been placed in the measure of last year and there would have been no penalties whatsoever but for the fact that the record of the Waterside Workers Federation with regard to industrial turbulence is unequalled by that of any other industrial union in the Commonwealth. I remind the Senate that last year the Minister pointed out that 47 per cent, or almost half of the time lost on the Australian waterfront was lost through the holding of unauthorized stoppages to discuss the Peace Council, the Ban the A-Bomb move, the attitude of the press towards unity tickets, the Crimes Act, the actions taken by some State governments, Cuba and other subjects that are the stock-in-trade of the Communists. I repeat that 47 per cent, of the time lost on the Australian waterfront was lost through discussing matters that had nothing to do with terms and conditions of employment but which, on the contrary, were matters dear to the hearts of the Communists, and all of which were quite outside the scope of ordinary trade union affairs. So it was that, in desperation, the Government included these penalty pro-' visions in the measure. If the waterside workers had had a record for industrial peace anywhere near approaching that of other workers in the community, these penalties certainly would not have been included in the legislation. It was simply a policy of desperation in order to try to bring some peace and some degree of stability to the Australian waterfront. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>This afternoon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> has notified us that, with the passage of this measure, the trade union movement, including the Waterside Workers Federation, still will not be satisfied and still will resent the fact that any penalties at all are imposed. If that is so, surely it is reasonable to assume that the federation believes it still has a grievance. The probability is that, so far from this measure acting as a deterrent to a continuation of the state of affairs that has existed on the Australian waterfront, the waterside workers will still believe that they have a bone of contention, a cause for agitation and a reason for causing as much disruption as possible on the Australian waterfront. </para>
                    <para>Whenever measures conferring benefits such as these are discussed, I always think spontaneously about the thousands of self employed people in the community. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> referred to this aspect. He spoke about waterside workers earning £22 for a 26-hour week and £21 10s 7d. for a 25-hour week. I think of the Tasmanian primary producers. A few years ago it was estimated that 40 per cent, of them were not netting the basic wage. Since then that percentage has increased considerably. This thought must occur to any one who thinks about these matters: Who pays for long service leave for self employed people? Where do they get all these benefits that are conferred on. employees? I know that in this country we have got into this line of thinking. Our legislation has tended in the direction of conferring benefits on employees. But the time is coming, in fact it has arrived, when we must think of the vast army of self employed people. I repeat that thousands of them are not netting the basic wage. They have to paddle their own canoes and provide these benefits for themselves. </para>
                    <para>I have no confidence at all that this measure will bring any greater peace to the Australian waterfront. I do not believe that it is of any use to adopt a policy of appeasement towards Communist-controlled trade unions. The Minister's second-reading speech was criticized very severely by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna.</inline> He objected to the terms in which it was couched. It constitutes a glaring indictment of the Waterside Workers Federation. The Minister referred particularly to the position that existed in the last three months of the last financial year when there were continual stoppages and constant agitation against the 1961 legislation in spite of the fact that the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McMahon)</inline> had promised that that legislation was in the process of being revised and that something would be done about it. Most of the stoppages were on the Melbourne and Sydney waterfronts. The Minister attributed that to the fact that those two waterfronts are more under the control of the Communists than are the other waterfronts in Australia. </para>
                    <para>The Communists are dedicated to the destruction of the Australian economy. In fact, they are dedicated to handing this country over to a foreign power, if that is possible. It is suggested that they can be appeased by making last year's legislation easier for them by reducing the penalties that are imposed under it. I am afraid that the Minister and the Government will be disappointed if they expect this measure to bring more peace to the Australian waterfront. </para>
                    <para>The Minister referred to the position in New Zealand. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> also referred to it. I was in New Zealand when action was taken. I know the facts pretty well. The then Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holland,</inline> commissioned <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Sullivan to clean up the waterfront and he did clean it up. I know Bill Sullivan fairly well. The Waterside Workers Federation in New Zealand was controlled by Communists. The federation was holding the country up to ransom. It was playing ducks and drakes with New Zealand's exports. Bill Sullivan froze its funds and used every power that the law gave him. Finally he broke the federation in New Zealand. That was a ruthless thing to do, but it was no more ruthless than were the actions of the federation in that dominion against the people of that dominion. Finally, a state of peace was achieved on the New Zealand waterfront. Although that happened several years ago, in all probability that is the reason why New Zealand's record is so much better than ours. </para>
                    <para>I support the measure. It is perfectly apparent that it will be agreed to. I regret that the Government has seen fit to reduce the penalties that were contained in last year's measure. I repeat that I believe very little benefit will be derived by the Australian community by the implementation of what seems to me to be a policy of appeasement towards the federation, the leaders of which cannot be appeased. </para>

                        <para>. -  As most honorable senators will agree, the bill before the Senate is primarily a committee bill, being, as it is, one with a large number of clauses amending a parent act. Of course, the introduction in the Senate of a bill to amend a parent act throws open for proper discussion the principles of the parent act. The Stevedoring Industry Bill which was introduced a year or so ago had two objects. One of them was to extend, for the first time, Australia-wide long service leave benefits to regular waterside workers. In doing that, the legislation imposed limitations and penalties on the ability to claim those benefits if the claimant engaged in unauthorized stoppages. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The other object of the legislation was to seek to increase the ability to impose discipline on the waterfront by including provisions under which attendance money was forfeited by waterside workers who engaged in unauthorized stoppages. This was done so that they themselves would feel the effect of engaging in a stoppage rather than not feel it because fines were imposed on the union as a whole and not on them as individuals. That was the second major point of the parent bill. </para>
                    <para>The amending bill which is now before us has been attacked on two grounds. It has been attacked by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> because it does not do anything to remove the ability to impose discipline on the waterfront by causing a waterside worker to lose attendance money if he engages in an unauthorized stoppage. The bill just simply does not deal with that original provision in the parent act, and the Leader of the Opposition thinks that it should. He believes that the ability to impose discipline should be rescinded. The bill has been attacked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lillico</inline> on the ground that it does remove the penalties which were previously imposed on a waterside worker who engaged in an unauthorized stoppage and therefore lost qualifying time to obtain long service leave. On the one hand, we have the Opposition saying the amending bill is no good because it leaves the brutal provisions of the original bill in the act. On the other hand, we have honorable senators who I believe are imbued with a desire to see the waterfront worked properly for the good of Australia, claiming that it is weak because, in effect, it gives untrammelled long service leave entitlements to waterside workers. </para>
                    <para>I noted down the arguments as far as I could and I shall pass over some of the comments of the Leader of the Opposition simply by saying that I have a different opinion. I do not think the credit for extending long service leave to waterside workers throughout Australia should go to the Tasmanian Government; I think it should go to this Government. If the Leader of the Opposition thinks otherwise, that is his point of view. Certainly the enabling legislation emanated from this Government and was passed by this Parliament. The honorable senator said that the opposition to the original bill by the present Opposition was fully justified. The justification for that opposition was claimed to be that large numbers of amendments have since been introduced. But it is interesting to note that at a later stage in the speech of the Leader of the Opposition he adverted to the fact that there had been a great improvement in the work performance on the waterfront since that bill was passed by this Parliament. I would think if that were true - and the report of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority, to which the Leader of the Opposition referred indicated that it was true - that is a justification for the passage of the bill rather than justification for opposition to the bill which was expressed by the Leader of the Opposition in a previous debate. </para>
                    <para>Certainly a number of amendments have been introduced in this amending bill. Certainly some of them were brought in when this amending bill was in the course of passage through the House of Representatives. Most of them were for the sake of meeting some requests either by members of the Opposition, by unions behind the Opposition or by the Australian Council of Trade Unions. But it is a strange state of affairs when it is urged, as a matter of principle, that the acceptance of amendments is necessarily bad or that it neces.sarily indicates improper preparation.  j </para>
                    <para>This is a complicated matter. In the first instance, it needed to be tested to discover where anomalies were - and some 1 anomalies were found although they had not been expected by anybody, and that includes both those opposing and those accepting the bill. Surely, then, it was proper to remove these anomalies by amendment  when they became evident. It is also proper ! - if you agree with the proposition - to [ bring in an amendment extending the limitations on long service leave. On that point, I would merely refute the statement by the Leader of the Opposition that the  Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McMahon),</inline> in his second-reading speech, claimed that the original provisions were unjust. I do not believe for a moment that he made that claim. What he did say was that he was influenced by the continu-: ing claims of the Australian Council of Trade Unions that the provisions were unjust. He went on to say that he himself thought that in certain circumstances they could be unfair. On those two grounds . and because I believe - and I think the Minister believes - that it is doubtful whether that provision was of great disciplinary value, surely it is right to remove the provision by way of amendment. </para>
                    <para>The Minister is supported by the report of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority on the matter of discipline, which was cited by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> in which the ' authority stated clearly that the principal cause of improved activities on the water- 1 front was the forfeiture of attendance money. I was interested in the claim by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> that men on the waterfront were suspicious because of the Government's activities or the wording of the Government's bills. One particular point brought out by the Leader of the Opposition was that some time about last October the authority, having taken over  the obligation to pay certain benefits, suggested an increase in the levy per man- ; hour, but that the increase was not authorized by the Parliament for eight months - until 1st April. The Leader of the Opposition said that this naturally made the waterside workers suspicious. I do not . follow that part of the argument but I accept that there was something that made them suspicious. </para>

                        spent a long time, it seemed to me, endeavouring to show what a barbaric thing it was to impose loss of attendance money on waterside workers who engaged in unauthorized stoppages. I think the honorable senator stretched credence to its limits when he drew a picture of a waterside worker out of work for a week or more, drawing a pittance of £7 a week, insufficient to live on as I agree, and presumably having to spend a week in a condition of starvation. This was an endeavour to show how cruel it was to impose this loss of attendance money, but the case broke down on
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna's</inline>
                        own words a little later, when he pointed out that a waterside worker who had been ordered to forfeit 60 days' attendance money would have to wait for four years before he paid it off. In other words, he could not lose more than fifteen days a year. There is no case of somebody spending a week at a time or, as the implication was, a great amount of his working life, without attendance money, which had been taken from him, leaving him in destitution.
                    </para>
                    <para>I think I am right in saying that the burden of the attack on the bill by Senators Wright and Lillico is that it will increase in discipline on the waterfront if people do not lose qualifying time for long service leave when they engage in unauthorized stoppages. I do not suppose the truth or otherwise of that suggestion can be proved until time has given us the answer. But it may be that the knowledge that long service leave is now not subject to limitations of this kind, coupled .with the knowledge that engaging in unauthorized stoppages does bring a personal and personally felt fine could on the one hand remove  a  sense of injustice as regards long service leave and on the other hand keep the wherewithal to impose some discipline on the waterfront. </para>
                    <para>If by these two measures we get back to the position in which, after the parent bill had been passed by the Parliament, the loss per man per year was lower than it had been for sixteen years, bar one year, the Government will have been justified in bringing in the bill, the country will have benefited from the savings in freight, and the Opposition will have been justified, this time at least, in not opposing the bill  at  the second-reading stage. The answers lie in the future. All I can say is that it is the belief of the Minister and of the Government, after conferring with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Waterside Workers Federation and after considering how far it could go to meet the requests of those organizations and to what extent it could not meet them, that these amendments can and will contribute to the state of stability which, except for the last two months, was evident in the industry. </para>

                    <para class="block">The committee may remember that we debated this position at length in May last. We considered the position of transfers between ports and claimed that any power | to transfer men from one port to another i should not be utilized for the purpose of strike-breaking at the port to which it was proposed to transfer them. We come along on this occasion and find that the Government is seeking to tighten up the law. The present act requires waterside workers to offer for employment at another port. We oppose that provision. We want to get back to the voluntary basis and to facilitate such transfers. The bill as introduced last year made lt obligatory on waterside workers to transfer from ports where they are registered to some other ports. We wish to alter that provision to provide that transfers be voluntary. </para>
                    <para>Additional justification for what I said last year appears from a glance at page 32 of the authority's report. There was some complaint last year about difficulties that occurred through people refusing to transfer, but this year there has been no complaint about the willingness of people to transfer. The authority does not report one difficulty in the matter and we regret that last year the Government saw fit to make mandatory what had hitherto been voluntary. That is just one more instance of pin-pricking the people who work on  the waterfront and it is with the purpose of avoiding it that the amendment is moved. </para>

I think it is necessary and always has been necessary for a waterside worker registered, say, at Melbourne to be required to work at Geelong should there be work available at Geelong and not at Melbourne, or for a waterside worker registered at Launceston to be required to work at Burnie should there be work available at Burnie and not at Launceston. I am told that it has always been the practice for that to be so and that the authority has always demanded that that should happen. The act has stipulated that the authority shall be able to require a man to work at, say, Geelong and that he shall not be able to claim that because he is registered at Melbourne he need not work at Geelong except under certain conditions. I gather from the authority's report that there has been no trouble about this provision. The Minister for Labour and National Service has indicated that the provision is not intended as a strike-breaking measure. It seems to me reasonable to give the authority power to require a waterside worker to move to a port where there is work available. </para>

There are two matters only of substance in these amendments and I suggest that rather than have a division on each amendment we have one division on the three amendments, if a division is necessary. The Minister may obviate the necessity for having a division by saying that he accepts all of the amendments. </para>

                            <para>-  I deal first with proposed paragraph (aa) covered by my first amendment. Paragraph  (0  of subsection (1.) of section 36 of the act provides that where a waterside worker has been convicted of an offence against this act or of an offence against any law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory of the Commonwealth, being an offence that, having regard to the circumstances in which it was committed, shows him to be unfit to be a registered waterside worker, certain penalties of suspension or cancellation of registration or suspension of attendance money may supervene. The Opposition submits that sub-paragraph (ii) of paragraph (f) is far too wide.It arises from the narrow terms of sub-section (I.), paragraph(a), which provides that if the authority is satisfied that a registered waterside worker is unfit to be registered by reason of misconduct in particular places, namely, in or about an employment bureau, wharf or a ship, certain penalties may be imposed. Sub-paragraph (ii) of paragraph (f) provides that if a man commits any offence against any law about anything he is liable to the penalties of deregistration and suspension. Paragraph (f) is drawn altogether too wide. The Minister for Labour and National Service has argued that it is essential to have a provision to deal with a man who, not on the job but in some way in relation to the job, is convicted of an offence. The Minister instanced the example of a waterside worker having a difference with a foreman stevedore, waylaying him away altogether from the job and perpetrating a brutal assault on him. For example, also, a waterside worker may receive goods away from the waterfront knowing them to have been stolen from the waterfront. Those would be two very proper cases where those circumstances should be taken into account in determining whether his conviction rendered him unfit to continue as a waterside worker. I do not deny that and the Opposition would concede that some provision is necessary to meet those cases. The Minister's reason for refusing this preferred amendment was that nobody had been able to draw him a clause that would cover the position otherwise than by the interpolation of that very wide paragraph (f) introduced into the act by the Government last year. I do not think anybody can deny that paragraph (f) is altogether too wide for its purpose, because it goes beyond tying the offence down to circumstances somehow connected with the man's employment. Under that paragraph, any conviction under any law, Federal or State, for an offence not necessarily connected with his employment may render him liable to the penalties provided under section 36. I submit that the matter could be easily resolved by an amendment of paragraph (a). That paragraph provides that if a man misconducts himself in or about his place of employment, he may be de-registered. The paragraph could be amended to read - </para>

The Opposition would have no objection to that. I certainly reject, and so does the whole of the Opposition, the Minister's excuse that nobody is able to draft an appropriate provision, and that in any case he is concerned only with offences off the job that have a relation to the job. I hope the Minister appreciates that point. The Government says it is concerned only to bring within the scope of section 36 misconduct that, while not occurring on the job, is nevertheless connected with the job. I suggest that that objective could be achieved by the amendment I have just suggested. </para>

                            <para>-  Undoubtedly. I think the honorable senator will see from the tables at the end of the report that it has been exercised, apart from in cases of concerted port stoppages. This is the point at which the propriety of the suspension of attendance money for any reason arises. </para>

                    <para class="block">One of the main purposes of the amendment the Opposition proposes is to assert that it is not proper that a meagre benefit of the type provided by attendance money should be the subject of a penalty. </para>
                    <para>I am not going to repeat at this stage all that I said on the subject during the second-reading stage. The Minister, in what he said quite recently, indicated that he did not think that a penalty in respect of attendance money was a great hardship. He quoted figures to show that the suspension of attendance money did not happen very often. He referred to the fact that I had quoted cases of certain individuals having had 60 days' forfeiture already, and said that those days probably would be spread over four years. He drew from that the conclusion that there would be only fifteen suspensions in a year. I invite the Minister to remember that condtions vary considerably from port to port, and what might be an Australian average cannot be taken to apply in individual cases. It is quite unfair to take the case of fifteen suspensions under section 52a and 60 losses of attendance money for a day spread over four years as being typical. There would be a number  of  cases when the 60 days would be concentrated in a much shorter period. I invite the Minister to remember that each day 4,950 men are not working. If he does that, he will realize what the loss of attendance money means. There are 4,950 men at continuous ports not working each day, and normally they would be entitled to attendance' money. So the question  of  attendance money affects 39 per cent, of the watersiders at continuous ports every day. </para>

                    <para>I leave that point now, because I dealt with it at considerable length during the second-reading debate. I move to amendment (2) (ac), which is consequential. It alters proposed sub-section (3d.) to (3a.) and eliminates any reference to attendance money. I have no argument to address on that. Sub-section (3c.) provides that the number of days for which a waterside worker is to be suspended shall not exceed four times the number of working days for which the authority would have suspended the registration. For my purpose, that really is incidental to the repeal of the words, " or, where not inappropriate, suspend his entitlement to attendance money ". So, I can bracket sub-sections (3a.), (3b.) and (3c.) together as being incidental. Amendment No. 3 is in exactly the same position in that it refers to suspension of attendance money. </para>
                    <para>Proposed amendment No.  4  is as follows: - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Paragraph (b), proposed sub-section (6.), leave out all words after " Authority ", second occurring, insert "shall pay to the waterside worker by way of compensation such amount as the Authority determines as being equal to the whole of the loss of wages, of attendance money and of payments in respect of public holidays, suffered by the waterside worker ". </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The amendment refers to a sub-section proposed to be inserted by the bill, to deal with the situation in which the delegate of the authority imposes a suspension of attendance money, and an appeal is given to the authority where no appeal existed previously. In the event of the authority determining that the penalty imposed by the delegate was wrong, the authority is given discretion to pay such amount of compensation as it determines to be proper. The view of the Opposition is that where the authority is invited to step in and it sets aside suspension of the benefit by its delegate, full compensation ought to be paid. It is no answer to say that that would force the authority into declining to grant suspension, because the very clause that the Minister is proposing to insert in the bill leaves another way open. The authority may not merely lift the delegate's suspension. It may vary it or reduce it. It may reduce the penalty imposed by the delegate. </para>

When all is said and done, the authority does not have to lift the suspension entirely. It may lift it for a limited period, or for a shorter period than that imposed by the delegate. If the authority is of the opinion that, although the delegate's penalty was wrong, there should be some degree of punishment, we think that that should be variation of the suspension instead of cancellation of it. The Opposition considers that a man who has been wrongly suspended by a delegate of the authority should be compensated for the period in respect of which he was wrongly suspended. Surely that proposition does not require much argument. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Temporary Chairman,</inline> with your indulgence I have now covered, in very brief form, relying rather heavily upon my second-reading speech in connexion with one proposal, the grounds for proposed amendments Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4. </para>

                        <para>. - I should like to comment on the various amendments proposed by the Leader of the Opposition. I shall base my comments on the consolidated bill which was distributed recently. 1 take first the proposed amendment relating to section 36(l.)(f). As I understand it, the Leader of the Opposition suggests that paragraph (f) be omitted in full. Subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (f) provides that any waterside worker who is convicted of an offence against any law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory of the Commonwealth, being an offence that, having regard to the circumstances in which it was committed, shows him to be unfit to be a registered waterside worker, may incur certain penalties. The Leader of the Opposition suggests that this is too wide a power and that it could be improperly applied. If I remember correctly, the same suggestion was made when the original legislation was passed through this chamber. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I have made inquiries of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority, not with relation to the future, but in connexion with the period that has passed since the original legislation was introduced. The authority assures me that it knows of no case in which this power has been improperly applied or in which it has been claimed that it was improperly applied. As the Leader of the Opposition himself pointed out, it is necessary to have power to impose a penalty on a man who commits an offence away from the waterfront. That is agreed on all sides. If, for instance,  a waterside worker follows his foreman home, as happened in Western Australia, and bashes him up in the street, there must be some provision to take action against him, even though the crime is not committed on the waterfront. </para>
                    <para>The Leader of the Opposition did make the suggestion that the provision should be amended to provide that before a waterside worker may be dealt with there must be misconduct in his job, or in relation to or in connexion with his employment. He suggested that that limitation should be placed upon this power. There could be circumstances in which it might be a matter of opinion whether an offence committed by a waterside worker was in relation to his employment or not, but the offence could be one which, not in my opinion or the opinion of the authority, but in the opinion of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, to which he has a right of appeal, would make him an unfit person to be registered as a waterside worker. I think that was probably what the Minister had in mind when he said he wished this provision to stand as it was. </para>
                    <para>The concluding words of sub-section (1.) of section 36 read -  the Authority may cancel or suspend the registration of the waterside worker or, where not inappropriate, suspend his entitlement to attendance money. </para>

                            <para>- To accept the proposed amendment would be to remove from the authority discretion to impose a lower penalty than cancelling or suspending his registration. A man whose registration is cancelled or suspended loses his wages for the period during which the registration is so cancelled or suspended. With each day's wages that he loses, he loses the equivalent of about four days' attendance money. If we accepted the proposal, it would mean that the authority would have taken away from it discretion to impose a lesser penalty than cancellation or suspension of registration. As the third amendment proposed is consequential to the first two, I do not think we need spend any time on it. </para>

                    <para>The fourth proposed amendment relates to sub-section (6.) of section 36, which appears on page 34 of the consolidated bill. This relates to the question whether the authority should be required to pay to a waterside worker all that he has lost by way of wages, attendance money, and payment for public holidays as a result of some agency of the authority having suspended him, when he is re-instated after appealing against that suspension. The Leader of the Opposition argues that if a man is reinstated after having been suspended and after having lost payments of various kinds, the payment in full of the money so lost should be made mandatory, that it should not be left to the authority to decide whether he should receive all or only part of that money. </para>
                    <para>I think a number of difficulties would arise if that discretion were taken from the authority. I can visualize instances in which, in the opinion of the authority, the case before it was a borderline case - that is, a case in which it was doubtful whether the man should be reinstated. In such instances, the authority could well say, " We will remit part of the penalty by reinstating you in this industry ". But if the board knew that the payment of the whole of the moneys lost during periods of suspension or cancellation of registration was mandatory and, on the evidence, a case could quite easily be decided either way, the worker concerned could be very much disadvantaged. I suppose the question whether the amendment proposed would be of benefit to the waterside worker or not is a matter of opinion. </para>

                        <para>.- I rise only because I do not think everything should be considered solely from the point of view of whether it would be better for the waterside worker. I quite agree that in cases of suspension you must be just. I think the reason why the authority should retain this discretionary power is that there is sometimes a long delay in the determination of a case of suspension. Merely on the ground of delay, a court or the authority might refrain from imposing a suspension, or might vary or cancel a suspension. Where such was the cause of variation or cancella tion, it would be quite wrong, in my opinion, that the variation or cancellation should carry with it payment of compensation. </para>

                            <para>- It has not been. On experience to date and in the light of what the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McMahon)</inline> said in another place, this power is required to cover only matters affecting a man's employment. Clearly, the terms are too wide. I simply have a difference of opinion with the Minister on that point. There is a fundamental difference between the Government and the Opposition on the amendment of the words at the end of sub-section (1.) of section 36 of the principal act. It goes to the roots of the imposition of penalties by the suspension of a man's entitlement to attendance money. </para>

                    <para>In respect of amendment No. 4, I think the attention of the Minister was distracted when I was putting my argument. I said that if the authority revokes a suspension imposed by one of its delegates, it is a matter in the authority's own hands. If it feels that he should bear some penalty, it does not have to lift the whole suspension imposed by the delegate. The authority is given power to vary or to reduce the suspension. If a man were given three days' suspension of registration, the authority could decide to reduce it to two days' suspension. If a man were given one day's suspension, the authority could reduce it to half a day's suspension. If the authority has power to take the circumstances into account and is not compelled to lift the whole suspension, once the authority reaches the conclusion that the suspension was wrongly imposed in respect of a specified period of time, that is the authority's decision. So why should not the man receive payment in respect of that specified period of time? That is the question that I pose very firmly to the Minister. Why should not the man be paid in respect of the time which the authority says should not have been included in the suspension? </para>

                        <para>.- The point that I put forward in reply to the direct question that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> has asked is that there could well be a case in which the authority, reviewing an occurrence, decided that the man, by his own error or by a degree of misconduct, had contributed to his suspension for one, two or three days; but in view of all the circumstances the authority would be prepared to clear his record sheet and lift the suspension so that he would not lose that amount of entitlement to long service leave. </para>

                <para class="block">The commission, having upheld the appeal, is required to authorize the authority to pay compensation, and it is proposed by that provision to have regard to certain circumstances set out in sub-paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e). The Opposition has no objection to three of the factors being taken into consideration by the commission in determining the compensation to be paid to the successful appellant, but it considers that (a) and (b) should be disregarded. In other words, we think that the commission, having reached a decision that the appellant is to succeed, should not, in determining the amount of compensation to be paid, take into account again the circumstances out of which the cancellation of the waterside worker's registration arose. If the com mission has lifted the suspension entirely, it has already taken the circumstances into consideration. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. Let us assume that a man was deregistered for five days and the commission finds that he succeeds as to the lifting of the suspension for two days. Why should not the man be paid the full wages for the two days in respect of which he had been wrongly suspended? Why have the circumstances connected with the suspension to be taken into account again? If the commission states that the registration had been wrongly cancelled, without any further question the man should be paid by the authority the amount that he would have earned had he not been wrongly suspended and had his registration wrongly cancelled. The second circumstance which the commission is asked to take into account is -  any failure by the waterside worker to furnish to the Authority at the inquiry held under section thirty-six of this Act in relation to the cancellation information furnished by him to the Commission on the hearing of the appeal to the Commission against the cancellation, being information that, in the opinion of the Commission, he might reasonably have been expected to furnish at the inquiry; </para>

                <para class="block">The commission, in determining whether and to what extent the man should be compensated, is asked to take into account information put to the commission on appeal that was not brought out at the original hearing. Any understanding of this industry will show that at the lower level, either the waterside worker appears for himself or he is represented by laymen, and certainly not by lawyers, in 99 per cent of cases. Quite frequently, the adjudication or hearing takes place very quickly  and  at very short notice. Certainly the waterside worker and his lay supporters from time to time would not be able to appreciate legal niceties. I think it is unfair to hold against a worker his failure to do something he could not reasonably be expected to do, namely, to present a perfect case at the first hearing by the lower tribunal. So the view-point of the Opposition is that the factors set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) of proposed subsection (1b) should not be taken into account by the commission. </para>

                    <para>. - I have a very brief comment. This deals with a case wherein a waterside worker's registration is cancelled, which means that he has been severed from the industry, and he is appealing against it to the commission, in effect on two grounds. First, he says, " I wish to have the cancellation of my registration set aside and to be re-admitted to the industry ". Secondly, he asks for something for which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> thinks he should ask, and by right get if his cancellation is set aside, namely, his wages for the time he was out of the industry, that is, his loss of earnings. But it could well be that, on appeal, the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission could, having  regard  to all the circumstances, say: " We shall set aside the cancellation of this man's registration but, because of all the circumstances, we shall not go so far as to say that he should be paid for the time during which he has been out. We shall restore to him the right to work in the industry, but having regard to all the circumstances of the cancellation of his registration, we are not prepared to restore to him the money that he might have lost." </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>This will be done on the judgment of the Conciliation Commission. I think that we should well be able to leave to such a commission the right and duty of regarding all the circumstances of the case. Actually, proposed sub-section (1b.) of section 37a states that the commission, in determining whether it is reasonable that a waterside v/orker should be paid compensation for the reduction of his earnings, shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case. So really the elimination of paragraphs (a) and (b) would still leave the commission able to have regard to all the circumstances, but would remove from it some guidance on the sort of circumstances to which it might wish to look, such as failure to produce information which the commission thinks should reasonably have been expected to be produced. A discretion is left in the hands of the Conciliation Commission, as we think it ought to be. </para>

                <para class="block">I spent most of the dinner recess trying to create some order out of the confusion that flows first from the receipt of a vastly, different bill from the one upon which I did my preliminary work; secondly, from the very belated delivery of the consolidation of the existing law on this matter, and, thirdly, from the well-intentioned but devastating effect of the alteration in the numbers of the Opposition amendments. However, I think I can inform the committee now that subject to proposals I shall make as I proceed with my remarks, we will be able to seek a decision on a number of amendments taken together. In that way, if the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gorton)</inline> does not accept our amendments, we may be able to reduce the number of divisions required on the amendments from twelve to four. </para>
                <para>The amendment that I have moved is similar to amendment No. 4 that has already been discussed and dealt with. The clause that we are now considering introduces an entirely new section. In cases relating to the question of the physical fitness or otherwise of a waterside worker to continue as a waterside worker or to be transferred out of Part A of the register to Part B of the register, the waterside worker is, by the proposed new section, granted a right of appeal or objection to a medical board, as opposed to the. commission formerly,against his proposed suspension of registration or the proposal to transfer him from Part A to Part B of the register. Sub-section (7.) of proposed new section 37b provides, in effect, that where a board upholds the objection or appeal of the waterside worker, if the objection was made to a suspension of registration or to the transfer of a name to Part B of the register, the authority may pay to the waterside worker such amount by way of compensation for any loss of wages, any loss of attendance money and any loss of payments for public holidays that such authority thinks proper. The difficulty is that here is a situation in which the waterside worker is not involved in any breach or any offence. There is no question of any misconduct. It is simply a matter that originates from the authority thinking that the man is unfit for full service as a waterside worker or perhaps unfit for that type of work altogether. It is a mere fact that arises without any default on the part of the waterside worker. He may appeal against the proposal of the authority in relation to him and the medical board may decide that the authority was wrong to suspend him on account of physical unfitness or to remove him from Part A of the register. In that situation we say it is wrong that this sub-section should enable the authority, as a matter of discretion, to pay compensation to the waterside worker during the period in which he was wrongly suspended or wrongfully transferred from Part A of the register. Here is a case even stronger than the case I put before. Here is a case where it should be compulsory in those circumstances for the man to be compensated for the period during which he was suspended or transferred to Part B of the register. </para>

                <para>Not may -  pay to the waterside worker, by way of compensation, an amount equal-  to various sums. I point out to the Minister that where the payment of attendance money is suspended and an appeal is made, it is mandatory on the authority to make a payment of specified compensation to the individual. What is the difference in principle between a successful appeal on the : question of attendance money and a successful appeal on a question that the man is unfit for work? If it is proper to make the payment mandatory in the case of the lifting, of a suspension of attendance money, surely there is a stronger case for the compulsory payment of compensation in a matter where physical fitness alone is involved and no allegation of misconduct or anything of that nature is made against the waterside worker. I press that argument with the Minister. If he rejects it, the committee will not divide. We have contended for the principle in amendment No. 4 dealing with the question of appeals from the decision of a delegate of the authority to the authority itself. But here is a case where the waterside worker is without default or defect from any moral viewpoint and where, if he has been wrongfully treated and the medical board upholds his contention, compensation should be payable as a matter of right and not as a matter of discretion on the part of the authority. </para>

                    <para>. -  The clause proposed by the Government is an endeavour to ameliorate the conditions which previously existed under the act. Previously a man who was thought to be so unwell that he could not carry on his work, or might be a danger to others, was examined by a doctor of the authority. If that doctor certified that he was in fact ill and unable to carry on, the man had an appeal only to the Conciliation Commission. This is an endeavour to give him an appeal to a medical board, one member of which will be appointed after consultation with the Waterside Workers Federation, one after consultation with the employer and one after consultation with the authority. </para>

                <para>I believe that this provision was asked for by the people in the industry and that they thought it would provide a better opportunity i of appeal for a man than an appeal to the ! Conciliation Commission. When a man appealed to the Conciliation Commission, he did not automatically get compensation. It : is not mandatory on the commission to authorize compensation. This clause does not alter that provision. I believe that in almost all cases where a mistake was made by the doctors, who suspended a man or ordered him to be transferred to Part B of the register- </para>

                        <para>- He cannot be arbitrarily suspended. He is given a chance of examination by the authority's doctor. After that he has an appeal to the commission. If the doctor's report on which a man was suspended turned out to be wrong in the judgment of a medical board, I have no doubt that he would be reimbursed any money he had lost, unless he had given a wrong answer to a question asked him by the doctor as to his past health or things of that kind. That may be the explanation of why the provision was framed as it was in the act. </para>

                <para>My officers tell me that the reply to the second part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna's</inline> question is that the distinction existed in the act. I should like to have more time to examine why that should be. This is just a repetition of what was in the last act. Let me try to give an off-the-cuff answer to the question that was asked so rapidly. A man is suspended and loses his entitlement to attendance money only after it has been decided that he has been guilty of some specific act. If he is found not guilty on appeal, then automatically the penalty which was applied when he was found guilty - it is a penalty in that case - is remitted. However, in the case of a medical examination, matters of opinion and the man's answers to questions are involved. It is not a question of a penalty being imposed for a specific breach of provisions of the act. </para>

                        <para>-  It was. There is no question about that. The Opposition is merely opposing what it thinks is a clear failure to do the right thing in relation to making compensation payable when there is no suggestion of default on the part of the man. The Minister cannot say why the payment of compensation should be mandatory when a penalty is lifted from a man who has been charged with an offence and a similar provision is refused in this case. I can well understand his difficulty in trying to justify the two positions that have been mentioned. I content myself with making a suggestion to him. I know that he is not the Minister responsible for the bill and, quite frankly, I am glad that he is not, because then he would not be having as peaceful a time in these proceedings as he is having now: I suggest to him that he directs the attention of the Minister - who has promised to look into anomalies - to this particular anomaly. I can see no justice in making a payment in these circumstances discretionary, whilst it is mandatory under section 33a, sub-section (2.). </para>

                    <para>.- I should like to correct a misapprehension in the mind of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna).</inline> I was endeavouring to give an explanation, and the more I think of the explanation I gave, the more I think it is probably a reasonable one. I shall re-state why <inline font-style="italic">I think there</inline> should be a difference. In the one instance, a charge is brought against a man and a monetary penalty is imposed upon him on the ground that he has committed the offence. The reason for imposing the monetary penalty is that he has committed certain acts which constitute an offence. When, on appeal, it is held that he has not done these things, and therefore has not committed an offence, then automatically the monetary penalty is remitted. The other case deals with a man's medical condition. It might well be that information he had given had contributed to a wrong diagnosis. This is not a question of a monetary penalty for an offence. It is a question whether there should be a discretion to pay all the money he has lost, or less than the full amount if in some way he has contributed himself to the mistake. </para>

We go to the next provision which takes off a period of sickness, and to the final one which limits the time of the deduction from the deduction of fifteen days. I thought the matter might be expressed for my simple purpose by saying that qualifying days for long service leave shall not include absence on account of illness or injury in excess of fifteen days in any one year. That seemed to be the net result I got from my journey through the section. </para>
                <para>Of course, we object to this proposal. We say that any period of genuine illness, particularly when leave is granted for it, should be disregarded and should not be a deduction from qualifying service. Let me put an extreme case. Imagine a man who suffered an injury arising out of and in the course of his employment, and who was entitled to worker's compensation. He could be on worker's compensation for six months. Yet, he would be entitled to qualifying service in respect of only fifteen days of that period. </para>

                        <para>- What distresses me is that the Government keeps turning its mind backwards to follow precedents instead of starting off with a new benefit and being prepared to break new ground and to look at situations. I think it is inexcusable to adhere to a limit of fifteen days just because the State governments have done so. Surely ordinary justice would have dictated the making of an exemption in favour of a man on worker's compensation. </para>

                        <para>- I thank the honorable senator for his interjection. I was about to come to that matter. Under the waterside workers award No. 392 of 1954, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Ashburner, when considering qualifying service for annual leave purposes - not long service leave purposes - imposed a limit of 42 days a year. If the Government only proceeds according to something that has beer, done in the past, why does not the Minister look to that award as a criterion? The only conclusion I can reach is that he looked for the lowest possible element that he could find. I have before me an extract from that judgment. In the case of workers' compensation, the benefit was extended to 42 days. If the Minister is going to go on precedent, here is one established by an arbitral tribunal in relation to annual leave in the very industry that we are considering, but it is not accepted by the Government as a precedent for qualifying days in relation to long service leave. This is a matter upon which, quite frankly, the Opposition feels very strongly. The purpose of proposed amendments Nos. 7, 10 and 11, taken together, is to ensure that the waterside worker on sick leave loses no qualifying service. </para>

We shall take that division as having relation to these three matters in particular. </para>

                    <para>. -  The starting point which I shall take in relation to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> has said is that it is laid down in sub-section (2.) of section 45c that a person shall be deemed to be continuously registered in spite of a break in the continuity of his registration due to illness or injury that rendered him incapable of carrying out the duties of a waterside worker, and in spite of a break in the continuity of his registration not exceeding a continuous period of two months, irrespective of the cause of that break.  His  registration would continue in those circumstances. The conditions upon which he is to be regarded as being continuously registered are laid down. It is stated that the time during which he is continuously registered will be counted as qualifying service except in certain cases. One of those cases, and the one to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> objects, is the case of illness that renders him incapable of carrying out the duties of a waterside worker. The bill lays it down that if, as a result of injury or illness, he is incapacitated for more than fifteen days, the time during which he may still continue to be registered is not counted as qualifying service for long service leave. As I said in reply to an interjection by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> that is based on State acts. The effect of the amendment which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> would have us adopt would be that a man could be away from the industry for years as a result of illness - he could be away for up to fifteen years - and yet, provided he could show that he was ill during that time, the whole of that period would be counted as qualifying service for long service leave. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I want to emphasize again that the effect of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna's</inline> proposed amendment No. 10 would be that a man could be ill, without limit, and away from the industry, and yet have all that time counted as qualifying service for long service leave. That just is not the purpose of long service leave. The purpose of long service leave is to repay people for the time they have actually spent in service in the industry. </para>

Quite apart from any other cases, what is the need for any limitation of time in that man's case? The man is injured on his job. He is suffering from an injury and he is unable to work because of the injury. Why should there be a limit of fifteen days on a man who is injured during his work and who is being compensated for it?

                        <para>-  I do not think it is. I think there is an obligation to pay the equivalent of wages when a man is injured. I will correct my term for the honorable senator. The man is being paid by the employer. Whether an insurance company makes the payment or not, he is being paid; he is on the pay-roll in a non-technical sense. He cannot take other work. He is injured in the course of doing his job and he is out of action for many, many months. I should think that would be sufficient disability and distress for a man, without feeling that simultaneously, and without fault on his own part, he is deprived of qualifying service for long service leave for perhaps a very lengthy period. What does the Minister say about that? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Ashburner made a particular exception in favour of such people. He adverted to them particularly in his award and gave them  42  days' qualifying service for annual leave. He called that generous. I certainly regard it as not generous in relation to qualifying service for long service leave. </para>

                    <para>. -  This is the answer to the specific question that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> asked me: When a man is away from tie industry he is not serving in the industry, whatever the cause of his absence from the industry may be. I have no doubt that that is the reason why <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Ashburner gave the judgment that he gave, which I have just read and which dealt specifically with people who were away from an industry on workers' compensation. A member of the Waterside Workers Federation is allowed to count  42  days for annual leave purposes. Under the metal trades award a man who is away on workers' compensation is allowed to count foul teen days for annual leave purposes. The principle running right through that is that a man is not serving in the industry and is not fulfilling the conditions that attract long service leave if he is on workers' compensation. If the accident or illness was due to the negligence of his employer, he has recourse to other ways of claiming damages. </para>

                    <para>.- At the risk of being accused of making an intrusion into this duet, I should like to be heard in support of the Minister. It would be a pity to let <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna's</inline> facile equation of two dissimilars pass unnoticed. He is taking advantage of the fact that previous remedial workers' compensation legislation has already provided that if a waterside worker is injured in the course of his employment he receives either weekly compensation or, at his election under most legislation, a lump sum after the injury has continued for some time. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. If he elects to draw weekly compensation for six months, usually he will receive compensation at the rate of about  70  per cent, orhis ordinary wages. There is a real distinction between that man's contribution to the industry and the contribution that an active worker is making during that period of six months. He having been compensated by way of workers' compensation during the period of his injury, there is no substance whatever in the argument that is being put forward, namely, that he should be able to count the period he is on compensation as service. We need to get back to the idea that in some instances work is the criterion that earns a man his entitlement to long service leave. </para>

                    <para>. -  I should like to offer the comment that we are dealing with a most unusual industry. This is not a. case of an employee faithfully serving an employer. It is a case of an employee serving a great multiplicity of employers. So his service is not so much to an employer as to the industry. If, in the course of his service to the industry, the industry injures him, why should it not bear the burden of this relatively small particular of qualifying service for long service leave? It is the industry that has disabled him and has prevented him from continuing his active service to the industry. </para>

                <para>I do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright's</inline> version of this matter at all. I believe that we have to look at it apart from all the ordinary concepts of service to an individual employer. The position in this industry is quite different. It is a case of a man serving a conglomeration of employers who are utterly impersonal. If the industry injures him while he is serving it, why should he suffer a disability in the matter of qualifying for long service leave? It is not his fault that the industry has disabled him and prevented him from continuing his physical service. </para>

Amendment No. 9 is purely consequential upon amendment No. 8, so I need not address myself to it. The purpose of amendment No. 8 is to invite consideration by the Government of the position of waterside workers in the B class ports. They are ports that are neither continuous nor seasonal in the terms of the definitions in the act. The port of Mackay is in that category. Formerly it was a very active port, but because of the use of mechanical aids in loading the need for waterside workers has diminished until the port now is classed as neither continuous nor seasonal. Yet men continue to be registered there and are required from time to time. </para><para>The important point to remember in this context is that the men have to be available 365 days of the year. If they are called on any one of those days and they do not attend, they are liable to a penalty. If they are called and fail to attend very often they are liable to de-registration. They might get two days' work a week; they might get three days' work; or they might get none. </para><para>Looking at the nature of this industry which is in a very special plight, one must see the difficulty of a man placed in that position. He can take no other regular work because he has to be on call any day and every day. Yet, this legislation, as it is drafted, says to him, in effect: " Despite the fact that you have to be ready to be! called every day and that makes for all the difficulty in the world in your getting any other regular employment and despite the fact that you are subject to penalties if you do not attend, you do not get any qualifying service at all, except for the days on which you actually work or the days on which you are called up and no work is available and you are paid attendance money ". </para><para>I concede that in a B class port where only fifteen days' work may be scattered over the whole year a man cannot be1 credited with the whole of the rest of the year as qualifying service. I do not push the position that far at all, but surely it is not beyond the ingenuity of those who have considered this matter to say, " We will meet you in some way; we will evolve a formula for men registered at B class ports  - a  formula which would provide that for every day a man works and is entitled to attendance money, he will get one or two days" qualifying service ". Surely there is something in the old saying that they also serve who only stand and wait. If a man has to wait a whole week and work only on the day he is called, surely he is entitled to some consideration for the time he was standing by. </para><para>I am not suggesting that he should be entitled to get all the days credited to him for long service leave, but he is entitled to some quantum in respect of the whole of the balance of that year when he is standing by and is liable to be called. Is it not competent for a Minister and his advisors to see some justice in that argument, and if they do to indicate that they will address their minds to it and will in fact try to evolve some compensation by way of qualifying service in respect of the period of the year when the men are not employed and are not paid attendance money? It seems to me to be a reasonable proposition. </para><para>The mcn in those ports are in a difficult position under the original 1961 act. Even if they turn up and get their attendance money, nothing is credited to them by way of qualifying service in respect of those days unless they already have eight years' service as a regular registered waterside worker. This bill corrects that injustice and one can feel grateful for getting that anomaly out of the way, but it is obvious in my view that the Government has not gone far enough. So I put it to the Minister that there is no obligation to the irregulars in this matter. Section 31a (4.) states very plainly that they are not required to attend or to make themselves available for employment. My amendment would have no application to them. I invite the Minister to consider the case I have put on amendments Nos. 8 and 9  -  No. 9 being purely consequential on amendment No. 8. </para></speech>

                        <para>- I think that is incorrect. The sub-section with which we are1 dealing relates to irregulars employed at B class ports. It is said that these irregular workers employed at B class ports are to receive the benefit of qualifying service towards long service leave for each day upon which they are employed or for each day upon which they receive attendance money. In other words, on each occasion on which they are called to the wharfs to work, whether they work or not, they will receive a qualifying day's service towards long service leave. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                </continue>
                <para>It seems to me that the amendment suggested by the Leader of the Opposition would not confine the granting to them of qualifying service for long service leave to the days on which they worked or received attendance money, but would make it possible for them to get qualifying service for long service leave on any day on which they said they wore available, whether they worked or got attendance money or were called upon to work. They would say that they were available to work. That would be the result of this amendment. </para>
                <para>The workers who are registered as irregular workers at B class ports do not rely upon work on the waterfront as their full or main means of making a living. It is generally agreed and known that people so registered at ports where work is sporadic and where long periods of time pass before ships come in, engage in other work around the town or in the adjacent countryside. Some of them may have small farms. They are available to be called to the wharfs when ships come in. Others have part-time jobs or businesses in the town and they combine them with irregular waterside work. It seems to me that when these people are called down to work a ship, whether they work it or whether they are put to the inconvenience of going to the wharfs and not getting work, they should receive the benefit of qualifying service for long service leave. When there is no ship to be worked or when they are not asked to work when a ship is in port, it does not seem to me that they fulfil the qualification one would expect them to fulfil before they get the benefit of being given qualifying service towards long service leave. </para>

                <para class="block">The effect of the amendment is to alter the time of occurrence of entitlement to long service leave for twenty years of qualifying service to ten years of qualifying service. The committee is invited to consider that this is an industry that is one apart and quite special. I think the Minister himself admitted that in some respects there is no other industrial activity like it in Australia. It has to be conceded that it is an arduous industry and also that the great majority of the men are required to stand by for 365 days in a year. 1 know of no other industrial worker in Australia who is required to do that. When we come to look at the question of entitlement to long service leave, we must remember that the men are liable to be called on any of the 365 days in a year, on Saturdays and Sundays, and that very factor alone sets the industry quite apart from other industries. </para>
                <para>Whilst the Government has been good enough to set out, in the course of this provision, the set of circumstances in which, after ten years, pro rata long service leave will be granted, we say that it should have gone further with this industry and made the dividing line at ten years, giving sixandahalf weeks - half the present entitlement at twenty years - and pro rata for any period in excess of ten years. It is a simple, clearcut proposition that one has no difficulty in making completely clear. I put it to the Minister that this is a complete recasting of the present base. Whilst the waterside worker appreciates the fact that a number of persons hitherto barred from pro rata payments are now to be entitled to them after less than twenty years' service, we think the the Government may as well face up to having the entitlement occur at ten years. </para>

The amendment would, in fact, cut in half the length of time that it is necessary for any one to serve before getting long service leave. The Government has already made some alterations in the requirement of twenty years' service to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> referred. Some people are eligible under certain conditions to long service leave after ten years' service. But to make this a universal right would be, in effect, to reduce by half the period of time originally laid down as necessary to be worked before long service leave was granted. </para>

                <para class="block">The Opposition thinks that provision is completely wrong. In determining the average earnings of waterside workers during the preceding twelve months you surely look at what they have received by way of attendance money. Attendance money is part of their earnings. Surely you include in the total figure money paid for sick leave. Surely you include payments for holidays. The purpose of our amendment is to delete the prohibition and in its place insert a clause requiring the authority to have regard not only to those three factors I have mentioned but also to wages. The clause as amended would read the very reverse of the one that we are proposing to repeal. It would read - </para>

                    <para>.- The effect of the proposed amendment would be to increase the rate at which waterside workers on long service leave are paid. I do not think this is a matter that can be resolved by logic. It is a matter of judgment as to what is right, fair and generous. If there are differences of opinion, that is what they must remain. At the moment earnings are averaged to determine the rate of pay that will be given to people on long service leave. Included in those earnings are all earnings in respect of overtime and penalty rates. Not included is holiday pay unless, of course, the waterside worker worked on the holiday, in which case the pay he received on that day - pay at penalty rates - would be included in the total earnings averaged to see what rate should be given to people on long service leave. It could be said that other things should be taken into consideration and that a man should be paid more. That is a matter of opinion. I do not think one can apply any reasoned argument to this matter. </para>

The great bulk of them were members of what was known as the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union of Australia. Paragraph (a) of sub-section (9.) provides that where a person has been employed as a nonregistered waterside worker before this provision came into operation, and who within two months seeks registration, as long as he was a member of the union on the waterfront before, he shall be deemed to have been registered.

                    <para>. -  The purpose of subsections (9.) and (10.), as proposed by the Government in this consolidated bill, is to extend to members of the Waterside Workers Federation benefits which they are not at present receiving. The provisions will allow members of the federation to count as qualifying service periods which, before this new clause was inserted, they would not have been able to count. As I understand the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna),</inline> if it were carried it would be possible for members of other unions employed on the waterfront, excluding the union referred to in sub-section (10.) which, in the past, has been included in the Waterside Workers Federation, to claim the benefit. The union referred to in the sub-section has been disregarded. The provision gives legal agreement to the fact that it is an old union which has since become incorporated in the Waterside Workers Federation. Therefore, even if a man belonged to it in the past, his service must be counted towards qualifying service for long service leave. So, the benefits are confined to members of the Waterside Workers Federation. </para>

                <para>I think that the result of the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition would be, amongst other things, to make it possible for people who had been employed in other unions in the past, such as the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association of Australasia and the Storemen and Packers Union, to count their service with those unions for long service leave from the Waterside Workers Federation. Once that process began, it would be very difficult to know where to place the limit. It is better to do it as this bill is designed to do it. and to confine the benefit to people in the Waterside Workers Federation who have been working in the federation for a given number of years. </para>

                    <para>. - I thank the Minister for the explanation, but T point out that it is a matter for the Waterside Workers Federation to decide who shall be admitted to the federation. It is not a matter of opening wide the flood gates. If. for instance, a section of men who belonged to the Storemen and Packers Union and had given permanent service on the waterfront were in fact to be accepted by the Waterside Workers Federation as members, why should not the period of service rendered in the industry before that time not be treated as qualifying service in the industry? It must be borne in mind that they do not receive entitlement under any scheme that was applicable to them in their earlier capacity, and they cannot double up on the Commonwealth scheme. There is a section in the act to prevent that from happening. So we are not faced with any real difficulties. The Waterside Workers Federation, for which I am glad to see the Minister being concerned at last, will not let in members of whom it does not approve. It has that matter under control. Therefore, there is no question of opening the flood gates. There is no reason why, once people are in the industry, they should not carry with them the benefit of qualifying service gained in many years on the waterfront. </para>

                    <para>. - If the position is as stated by the Leader of the Opposition, it seems to me that the federation has the right to admit to its rolls individuals whom it cares to allow to become members. I believe that Lis amendment would give to the federation the right to admit to membership people who had worked in other unions before, and also the right to exclude people who had worked in those unions at precisely the same time. That is another reason why the provision should be confined to people who have, for a given period of time, worked in the one union. </para>

                <para>Amendment No. 16 proposes to repeal section 52a which was inserted by the Parliament in the 1961 act. If that amendment were carried there would be no need for amendment No. 17. I therefore propose that we discuss amendments Nos. 16 and 17 together. They are bracketed together. In due course, if amendment No. 16, which seeks the repeal of the whole section, is not agreed to, we shall divide on that. I should like the division to be taken, in the event of our being defeated on the conditional amendment, to apply to that one as well. I can only secure that result by astatement of intention at this stage. With the concurrence of the committee I shall discuss the two amendments at once and have them put separately. </para>

                        <para>- Section 52a is the section upon which I had a lot to say earlier in the day. I beg leave to incorporate in the proceedings in committee all the arguments that I then addressed to the Senate. I do not withdraw any of them. I confirm them, but I do not repeat them. The effect of amendment No. 16 is to strike out the word " amended " and all the words that follow, and to make the clause read, "Section 52a of the Principal Act is repealed ". We argued this matter fully at the second-reading stage. I do not propose to open it up again, beyond saying that it is fundamental to the Waterside Workers Federation and to the Opposition. </para>

                <para>This is an extraordinary situation that we are now considering. Last year, when section 52a was introduced, it contained sub-section (4.). That sub-section remains quite unaltered. It provided that once a declaration had been made by the authority regarding a concerted port stoppage, two consequences flowed. There was an automatic suspension of four days' attendance money against all those who participated in the port stoppage and, secondly, the qualifying service for long service leave was to be reduced to the extent of 30 days or such lesser period as the commission, not the authority, determined. It was that second provision imposing a penalty not only of the loss of four days' attendance money for one day of stoppage, but also the cancellation of qualifying service for long service leave to the tune of 30 days for one day's stoppage which caused all the trouble. The Government has acknowledged the justice and fairness of taking out that objectionable penalty relating to qualification for long service leave, but it has done it in an extraordinary way, a way that I commented upon earlier and that I do not understand. It has sought to achieve its purpose first by allowing the penalty imposing disqualification of qualifying service for long service leave to remain in the bill and then seeks to counteract it by including sub-section  (4a.),  which provides - </para>

                <para class="block">It seems to me to be a most illogical approach to repealing a penalty provision out to leave it in the act and merely say that it is not to be utilized. That, quite frankly, raises in the mind of the Waterside Workers Federation the fear that the operation of the provision is only suspended, if I might use a word that is familiar to the federation, and that the penalty is to be allowed to stand and remain as a threat hanging over the heads of its members. It is quite understandable that that would be the view of the federation, but if that is not the case, I ask the Minister to tell me why paragraph (b) of sub-clause  (4.)  was not deleted. That really ought to have been done. I suggest very strongly to the Minister at this stage that it is infinitely better with relation to the whole situation to adjust past unfairness. Here is the Government, in this extraordinary way, preventing that penalty from operating in the future. The purpose of our proposed amendment No. 17 is to go back and cure the injustice that has been perpetrated down the past eighteen months. If the Minister says, " I cancel it for the future; it is not fair to apply it as a double penally ", why, in justice, will he not go back and cancel its harmful effect over <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> past eighteen months? It seems that the requirements of fair dealing would demand that course, and our suggested amendment No. 17 proposes to achieve it. </para>

                    <para>. - The first question asked by the Leader of the Opposition was why paragraph (b) was left in sub-section  (4.)  and was then followed by a provision that it shall not be operative. He asked why this provision, under which prior to the passing of this bill a man who engaged in an authorized stoppage could lose qualifying service for long service leave, is not excised from the bill instead of being made inoperative. I am told that this is purely a technical drafting request from the Parliamentary Draftsman, who, I think, had it in mind that section 52a will remain in the bill and that in future people might find it difficult to understand why or how action was taken for a year or so to deprive people of long service leave when there is no reference to that power anywhere in the bill, as would be the case if the provision were excised. I am not sufficient of a lawyer to know whether or not the Parliamentary Draftsman's views would accord with the view of all other lawyers, but that is the source from which this provision comes and those, as I understand them, are the reasons which motivated him. But I think I am enough of a bush lawyer, at any rate, to be able to say that while the bill remains as it is this provision which enables penalties to be imposed upon a waterside worker cannot be implemented, and there is therefore no more threat in leaving the bill as it is than there would be if we acceded to the request of the Leader of the Opposition and excised the provision. If we leave it as it is, legislation will have to be introduced to amend it before any action can be taken to impose on a waterside worker any penalty with regard to his qualifying service for long service leave. If we took it out, legislative action would have to be taken to put it in again for the same purpose. I do not believe that any threat exists since the legislation can be amended to put the penalty back; but it would have to be amended in either case. </para>

                <para>The second suggestion made by the Leader of the Opposition was that, instead of saying that, as from the time this bill passes, waterside workers engaged in illegal stoppages will not lose their qualifying service for long service leave, we should make that provision retrospective. He buttresses his argument in that respect by suggesting that we are saying that it is unjust to impose this penalty and, that being so, the correction of the injustice should be made retrospective. I have already challenged that argument. I have endeavoured to point out that what we are saying is that the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Waterside Workers Federation have represented to us that they feel it is unjust and, if they feel that as strongly as they say they do, we are prepared to meet their wishes in this respect. That is quite different from saying that we ourselves feel it is unjust. </para>

                <para class="block">That, in effect, is making sure that all penalties imposed up to date, which have not yet been collected as it were, remain extant. Earlier to-day I mentioned that if the penalty of loss of 60 days' attendance money were imposed, the waterside worker concerned would be suffering for four years in that it would take him that time to pay the penalty. Might I put  a  case to the Minister? If, to-day, and before this bill becomes operative - perhaps to-morrow  - a  waterside worker incurred a penalty under paragraph (b) of sub-clause (4.) for a port stoppage and the penalty is imposed upon him to-day, that penalty will continue to be enforced, and a few months might pass before it is enforced. He might collect only one day's attendance money in each of four months in the future. When this bill is passed in this form, there will be many waterside workers who have been subjected to cancellation of attendance money- </para>

                        <para>- That is true. The Minister is quite right. I thank him. This provision concerns only the second aspect. The purpose of the amendment is merely to ensure that all disqualifications imposed on qualifying service in the past will be lifted. That task does not involve any great difficulty, or any disruption or disturbance of the position. It is merely a matter of bookkeeping records. Why the Government is unwilling to go back on this matter, I find very difficult to understand. </para>

                    <para class="block">This bill seeks minor amendments to two sections of the Audit Act relating to refunds of money from the Consolidated Revenue Fund and the Trust Fund. Honorable senators may recall that in the Budget session last year, section 37a was inserted in the Audit Act, with the support of the  Joint  Committee of Public Accounts, to provide a special appropriation of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for refunds of revenue not covered by other acts, provision for which had previously been made  in  the annual Appropriation Act. Similarly, section 62a was amended to provide authority for refunds from the Trust Fund. </para>
                    <para>Most refunds of revenue are made in consequence of a clear' liability on the part of the Commonwealth - for example, excess taxation payments - but some also arise from the exercise of discretionary authority vested in Ministers under legislation, such as section 164b of the Customs Act and Telegraph Regulation 69. </para>
                    <para>The Attorney-General's Department has expressed the opinion that the appropriation made by section 37a of the Audit Act does not authorize the charging of this class of refund to the special appropriation made by the section. The authority in subsection (7.) of section 62a for refunds from the Trust Fund is similarly deficient. </para>
                    <para>Clauses 3 and 4 of the bill before honorable senators therefore propose to amend section 37a and 62a to correct limitations which were not intended and which were not apparent when the provisions were drafted. Clause 2 makes the proposed amendment retrospective to 1st July, 1962, to sanction the charging of refunds of revenue under discretionary authority to the special appropriation under section 37a and to the Trust Fund, from the beginning of the current financial year. I commend the bill to honorable senators. </para>

                    <para class="block">This bill proposes amendments to the Repatriation Act which will give a desirable uniformity to the operative date of a decision of a determining authority allowing a claim for war pension, irrespective of whether the claim is allowed in the first instance by a repatriation board or subsequently on appeal by either the Repatriation Commission or a war pensions entitlement appeal tribunal. </para>
                    <para>It might be well to remind honorable senators of the system which operates for the determination of claims for war pension. A claim may be made in the case of disability at any time after the termination of the period of qualifying service, and in the case of death, at any time after the death of the ex-serviceman. There is no time limit for acceptance of claims. When a claim is made, it is submitted after appropriate investigation to a repatriation board, in the State where the claimant resides, for determination. Under the act, the Repatriation Commission may exercise the powers of a board, and sometimes it does, but normally the board is the initial determining authority. In the event of a claim not being allowed by a board, the claimant may appeal to the Repatriation Commission, and if his appeal is unsuccessful, he may appeal further to a war pension entitlement appeal tribunal. </para>
                    <para>As there are no time limits with which these appeals may be lodged, the Repatriation Act imposes some limits on the liability of the Commonwealth to pay pension, where the claimant has delayed his claim or the lodgment of an appeal. The limitations which the act imposes are these: A board may not grant a pension from a date earlier than three months prior to the claim; the commission may not grant a pension from a date earlier than six months prior to the lodgment of the appeal to it, and an entitlement appeal tribunal may no't grant a pension from a date earlier than six months prior to the date of the appeal to it. In principal these limitations do seem reasonable. In practice they are, however, resulting in some hardship to claimants and the Government has decided to remove what it regards as an anomaly. </para>
                    <para>It is necessary both for the determination of the claim and in the interest of the ex-servicemen's future treatment that claims be fully investigated. This necessarily takes some time, and varies according to the circumstances of the case. Consideration by a repatriation board also takes some time. At this point no hardship is suffered, as it is the date of lodgment of the claim which, as I have pointed out, is the determining factor in fixing the date of operation of a board's decision. However, when this time is added to the time reasonably taken by an appellant to lodge an appeal either to the commission or an entitlement appeal tribunal the commission, if it allows an appeal, can rarely fix as the operative date of its decision a date as early as the board could have fixed had it allowed the claim in the first instance. In practically no case is it possible for an entitlement tribunal to do so. </para>
                    <para>The effect of the amendments proposed in this bill is that where an appellant does not unduly delay in lodging his appeals, he will not be at a disadvantage because of the factors I have mentioned. Every effort has been and is being made to reduce the time taken to process claims and appeals to a minimum, but the stage cannot be reached where the disadvantage can be entirely avoided. The bill, therefore, provides that where a claimant succeeds on appeal to either the commission or an entitlement appeal tribunal the appellate body will be able to grant him benefits from the same date as a repatriation board could have done, provided he has not delayed longer than three months in lodging his appeal to the commission, and where a further appeal to the tribunal has been necessary for longer than a further three months from the date of the commission's decision. </para>
                    <para>The bill will be of substantial benefit to ex-servicemen and dependants. Not only is the amount of their pension affected but the Repatriation Department also accepts responsibility for medical benefits for which they are eligible from the date from which the war pension is payable. I commend the bill to the Senate. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to take up the time of the Senate for but one minute. I rise to place on record that I note with great satisfaction the fact that the Minister for Trade <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> and his representative in the Senate have to-day tabled the letters between the Minister and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Leslie</inline> Melville for which I asked in a question on the 7th of this month. This revives and acknowledges an inalienable right of this House. It represents to me the culmination of an endeavour of some few years now. It is fitting that I acknowledge this procedure as emanating from the long and distinguished parliamentary experience of the Minister for Trade. </para>
