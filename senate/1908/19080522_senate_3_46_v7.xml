                        <para>- In addition to the opportunity which will be given on the motion for the first reading of the Appropriation (Additional Estimates) Bill - which we hope to have before us by Wednesday next - it is the intention of the Government to introduce one or two other formal Appropriation Bills. I am speaking from recollection, but I think that, for instance, we shall have to introduce a Bill to validate the Treasurer&#39;s advances for 1905-6 and, 1906-7, both as regards ordinary expenditure and public works. On either of these Bills the same privilege will be open to honorable senators in regard to speaking on subjects not necessarily relevant to the contents of the measures. So that it appears to me - although I do not like at this juncture to give a formal promise - that I need have little hesitation in saying that, in my judgment, those opportunities will be given in addition to the one to which my honorable friend has referred. </para>

                        <para>- The matter to. which the honorable senator has referred,. Was mentioned by me some time last year. I then found that I was not able to give effect to .my own desires in the matter - desires which I believe are shared by members of Parliament generally - as I had not the authority nor the funds at my disposal. What I propose to do, as I have indicated to the press quite recently, is this : I intend to place a sum of money on the Estimates which are now in draft, for. the purpose of - asking Parliament! &#39;by &#39; voting the amount, to authorize  the principle of conserving on some of our own properties properly felled timbers . from the various States, in order that they may be seasoned, and hereafter used on Commonwealth works. I cannot exactly indicate at present the sum that I propose to ask for; but I intend to test. the feeling of Parliament by putting the amount on the Estimates, indicating at the same time details of- a scheme for carrying out the tests proposed. I have every hope that Parliament will confirm what I do. I shall &#39; also indicate that the sum granted this year will be for expenditure during the year,  and that Parliament hereafter, for a number of years, will be asked to give a similar or larger sum for- the same purpose, so that we may always have on hand a - sufficient &#39; quantity of suitable timbers for our use. When the Estimates come before the Senate, honorable senators will be able to discuss the subject. I shall then be glad to have, not only their sympathy and support, but also the advantage of any hints which they may offer. </para>
