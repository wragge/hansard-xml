                        <para>. - The very nature of the matter covered by the Bill makes it one which,  in  ordinary circumstances, would create a considerable amount of interest, as I have no doubt it now does, and also induce any honorable senator inclined to discuss it, to speak at some length. But I recognise, first of all, that  it  has been before the Parliament, in one branch or other, for a very long time. Further, I recognise a very natural desire in, indeed, an obligation on, all honorable senators to be as brief as possible with their speeches, in order to close the session in time to enable those living in different parts of the Commonwealth to reach their homes before Christmas. I shall endeavour to assist the Government to close the session at an. early date. For that reason I shall make my remarks on this very important measure as brief as I possibly can. I do not propose to make more than a very short reference to the position of the iron industry in Australia.' I think it will be recognised that it has undoubtedly all the raw natural wealth for carrying on a big iron industry. It may also be taken for granted that there is a very considerable market for the products of such an industry, and it will be admitted that there is an understandable desire to see it developed and established on a good sound basis. If those three things are admitted, the only point which arises is one to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> referred, and that is, which of three methods that have been suggested ought to be adopted. Those three methods are, first, a protective duty ; secondly, a bounty ; and thirdly, a State or Commonwealth enterprise. </para>

                            <para>- I know that there are some honorable senators who still prefer a Customs duty; but I think it is generally conceded that, to impose a duty on iron imports at the present time, would very largely affect a number of industries, and a still greater number of those who are dependent upon the industries to which I refer for the things they require to carry on their ordinary occupations. It is not desirable, nor would it conform to the expressed policy of the Commonwealth, to seek to handicap, or seriously strain, a large number of industries merely to establish one. For that reason, quite apart from any fiscal views I hold, I discard the idea of a duty at this juncture, believing that' its imposition would be highly detrimental to Australia as a whole. Coming to the second method, it seems to me that there can be only one objection urged against the grant of a bounty, and that is that the Commonwealth is asked to pay a certain sum. If the effect should be to establish an industry, every one would be pleased. On the other hand, if the attempt failed, the worst result which could follow from the Bill would be that the Commonwealth; would have spent  £150,000.The  payment of a bounty cannot hurt a single industry called upon to use iron. No engineer, no manufacturer of machinery, none engaged in subsidiary trades, can be in any way injured by the payment of a bounty by the Commonwealth to those who make iron. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. I am trying to state as clearly as I can, and, I hope, fairly, that the effect of a protective duty in the early stages of this industry would be to increase prices to those called upon to use the products of iron. A bounty is free from that objection. If it does not cheapen, it certainly cannot increase, prices, and the worst thing that would happen would be that the Commonwealth would be called upon to pay the amount of the. bounty. </para>

What is my honorable friend's alternative? It is to take the bounty, not from the pockets of all the citizens of Australia, which is going to reap benefits, but from the pockets of a few persons who have to use the commodities which are being made under the bounty system. </para>

I assume that my honorable friend seeks a nationalization of the iron industry bv the Commonwealth. I do not propose at this period of the session - and I sincerely hope that no- one else will do so - to enter into a&lt; discussion as to the advantages or disadvantages of Socialism. If we were to do so, we might as well say it once that we have no desire to close the session, but are prepared to enter into an interminable discussion as to the merits and demerits of Socialism. </para>

                            <para>- I think that the less the honorable senator says to me about a principle the better. I want to set the Minister in charge of this Bill right in a matter of history. Yesterday he inferred that a Bill for the payment of an iron bounty had been before the Senate on a previous occasion. That is not correct. So far as I know, no Bill for the payment of a bounty has ever been introduced here previously. A Bill bearing a similar title was certainly introduced, and with the Minister I helped to defeat it, but it was a mere pious declaration that at some future date Parliament might, if it liked, impose Customs duties. It had nothing in common with this Bill. </para>

                    <para class="block">That will show at once the wide difference between that Bill and this. This is a Bonus Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> said that it was useless to attempt to pass a Bonus Bill, and the Government therefore brought in a measure, the effect of which was to proclaim to the world that at a future date Parliament was prepared to impose protective duties for the benefit of those who had established the industry. Now I want to come down to what is likely to be the ground of contention in reference to this Bill; that is, the question as to whether or not it is desirable to nationalize the iron industry. As I said just now, I desire to avoid opening up such a wide ground of debate, as one is almost attempted to do, by the mention of this question;' but I wish to advance what appear to me to be solid reasons against the policy of nationalization at the present juncture. In the first place, not even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> would dream for a moment that it is practicable to do anything in that way immediately. If the Senate were to-morrow to affirm the desirableness of nationalizing the iron industry no one would say that it could be nationalized within the next few years, probably not even within the lifetime of any mon here. Consequently, the only effect of a resolution of that kind would be to postpone indefinitely the establishment of the iron industry in Australia. If the Government were to come down "with a definite proposal to nationalize the industry - I speak quite apart from the desirableness or otherwise of such a proposal - -and were to show the Senate that they had the ways and means for doing it, I might be inclined to discuss that mode of procedure as against the one proposed by this Bill. But no one can honestly get up in this Chamber and affirm that if this Bill be defeated we shall have the iron industry established bv means of nationalization for many years to come. The alternatives are this Bill or nothing. The alternatives are not iron industry by means of bonus, or iron industry under nationalization ; they are iron industry by means of bonus, or no iron industry at all. Between those alternatives I have no hesitation in making my choice. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend's practical Scotch mind comes in there. Where are we to get the money from if we are to nationalize the industry? Let me now deal with a matter that is brought to mind by the aspect of the case which I have recently discussed. I should like to point out why, apart from the general objection to nationalization, one of the proposals of this Bill as it now stands is, to my mind, most iniquitous. There is a proposal here to compel any one who takes or applies for the bounty to give an undertaking to transfer his property to the State Government, or to the Commonwealth Government, when called upon to do so. What would be the effect of that ? No Government, I take it, would take over a bankrupt concern. Any concern taken over would be one that had already become highly successful. </para>

For every shilling which will be paid by the Commonwealth for the purpose of building up this industry, and making it a success, those directly interested in it will pay pounds. Yet this Bill says : " Because we are placing one shilling beside your pound, we claim the right, after you have made a success of the industry, and have built it up by your own energy and sacrifice, to compel you to transfer the business to us ; whilst if it happens to be a failure, you can carry the loss yourselves." </para>

                            <para>- The proposal of this Bill would be a very fair one to make if the Commonwealth found half the money, and did not contribute merely a fraction) towards the capital cost. If the Commonwealth is prepared to find half the cost, and to put up with any loss which may accrue, there may be some justification for this proposal. But to place a Government, merely by the arbitrary power which all Governments possess, in the position to say : " If you venture your money, and give the best years of your life to the development of the industry, and make a success of it, we shall have the right to take it over; whereas, if it results in failure, you can bear the loss yourselves," is a monstrous proposal. </para>

                            <para>- People do not want assistance if they build up a business without Government aid. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford!</inline> went to the Government of New South Wales with an offer to them that they should take over his business, they said : " It is not good enough." But if he had been making handsome profits there would? have been no hesitation on the part of the Government to accept his offer. If there is to be a transfer of the property to the Government, it should be on terms absolutely just and fair. But it is a monstrous thing to tell me that if I or anyone else build up a business, put money into it, and) make a success of it, the State may come in and take it from me. It may be a crime, in the opinion of some honorable senators opposite, to possess money ; but it is not yet a legal crime under the laws of this country, and I repeat that it is monstrous to propose that, after people have built up a business, and made a success of it, bearing the stress and toil of the day, they should be liable to have it taken from them at the will of a Government. </para>

What I put forward as a fair proposal, which has always ruled hitherto in all relations between a State and its citizens, is that when a property is sought to be transferred to the Government it shall be transferred upon a valuation which is declared to be fair and honest. But here is a proposal to give the Government arbitrary power to take over a property not at anything like Its market value, but merely at the value of the land and the plant and buildings erected thereon. Do honorable senators think that the ,£150,000 proposed to be spent here is anything like a fair contribution as against the very much larger sum which the proprietors are putting into this venture ? </para>

                            <para>- My logic may be at fault, but it appears to me to be absolutely so. Whether a Government assist an industry by means of a bounty or of a duty amounts to the same thing, and, according to the contention of the supporters of the principle to which I am referring, the Government, having given that assistance, has a right to take over the business at its bare value. I pass from that commercial - and in some sense moral - aspect of the question, to consider the right which we have to enter upon industries of this kind. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> I am sure, was not very happy when he was trying to argue that the Commonwealth had the constitutional right to enter upon a commercial undertaking of this sort. He must have had a very strong doubt in his mind, and that I think was manifest from the hesitancy with which he advanced that portion of his argument. I can find no authority to justify <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> statement that the Commonwealth is constitutionally entitled to carry on commercial undertakings. It is a curious thing that he ventured to quote <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> who was Attorney-General of the Commonwealth at the time when the opinion quoted was given. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend evidently has in mind the need of a small arms factory. I think I am correct in saying that the total consumption of iron for guns and small arms would not keep the Lithgow works going for one week. To enable them to be carried on profitably they must be kept going from year to year. My honorable friend therefore wants to establish an industry to do work for the Commonwealth for one week, and work for the public for fifty-one weeks of the year; and he wishes to call the fifty-one weeks' work incidental to the one week's work. Surely that is stretching matters altogether too far. I have given the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin's</inline> opinion. </para>

                            <para>- No, as interpreted by itself. I say that only one interpretation can be put upon the opinion, and it is not that which the present Minister of Defence seeks to place upon it. The true interpretation of the opinion is that the Commonwealth has full right to manufacture iron for its own purposes, and not only to give effect to the powers contained in what we know as the thirty-nine articles of the Constitution, but to carry out such other functions as may be incidental thereto. But it has not the power to take a part in the ordinary commercial life of Australia and manufacture iron for supply in the ordinary way to the public. Though I am not prepared to do so, I might go so far to meet my honorable friends opposite as to admit that, if the Commonwealth were carrying on an industry, the major portion of the output of which was required for Commonwealth purposes, while incidentally the balance was allowed to go outside, that might by a stretch of Constitution be construed as coming within its four corners. </para>

                    <para class="block">But it is an entirely different proposition to propose to start an industry working fifty-one weeks in the year to supply the general public and one week to meet Commonwealth requirements. That would be stretching the Constitution to a point at which it would be practically torn up. </para>

I have endeavoured to put before honorable senators what I regard as the arguments against the proposed method of procedure. On several occasions we have had before us Bills that have been very dear to the hearts of honorable senators opposite. The gravest doubts have been thrown upon their constitutionality, but they have ignored the doubts, and have insisted upon going ahead with the measures, because the goal at which they aimed appeared to them to be in sight. We know that what has happened has been that Bill after Bill of that kind has been declared to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires,</inline> and I ask honorable senators opposite to say whether the pushing on of those measures has helped their cause one bit ? </para>

                            <para>- That makes the suggestion so bad that I refrain from pursuing the matter any further. It is a distinct affirmation of political influence in the nomination of Justices of the High Court, and that it continues to operate after their appointment. I will let the honorable senator's interjection answer itself. I appeal to the good sense of my honorable friends opposite in this matter. Most of them I believe desire the establishment of the iron industry in Australia on a sound basis. I think they should leave their proposal for some future time in view, to put it  moderately,  of the constitutional point involved. Ironworks are not likely to be taken over by the Commonwealth at present, and if at any time it is thought desirable for the Commonwealth to acquire such works, Parliament can be approached with a definite purpose, and we shall then know what we are doing. I suppose that tha  second reading will be agreed to, and I can only express a hope that if it is honorable senators will not allow the Bill to fail because of any difference as to the details to which I have referred- </para>

                            with the majority of whose remarks I cordially agree. There are two reasons for which I can give this Bill my support. One is that the Senate has already assisted in putting on the statute-book provision for the payment of bounties for all sorts of things. A number of honorable senators have been prepared to vote for bounties on goats, peanuts, and Heaven knows what besides. We have voted for bounties totalling ,£329,000, as shown in the schedule to the Bounties Act. Whilst it may be a most desirable thing to provide for bounties in respect of fish, dried fruits, rice, rubber, sisal hemp, linseed, and even New Zealand flax, I think there are reasons why a bounty in respect of the iron industry may be considered of more vital consequence to Australia. I refer particularly" to the question of defence. In time of war the importation of steel would be just as much a matter of contraband of war as would the importation of arms. We could not defend Australia without steel in some form or other, whether in the rough or as a manufactured article, and as a Commonwealth we shall be scandalously wasting money in the establishment of an arsenal at Lithgow for the manufacture of arms unless we have a reliable supply of steel, the raw material necessary to make such works of any value whatever. On these two grounds, that a bounty on the production of iron is as legitimate or more legitimate than a bounty in respect of many of the productions which have already been considered fit subjects for bounties, and that a reliable supply of the raw material necessary for the manufacture of weapons of defence must always be 'at hand in Australia. I feel perfectly justified in voting for the second reading of the measure now under discussion.

But between this measure and the Bounties Act there is no analogy. Any holder of land in any part of the Commonwealth might take advantage of the Bounties Act to obtain the bounties provided for in that measure. But this Bill merely proposes to bring into existence a monopolistic industry, and if there is one thing which the Labour Party's hands are against. it is the establishment of monopolies and the continued' existence of monopolies in any part of the Commonwealth. </para>

It is a? clear and unmistakable declaration that" monopolies privately owned are of no advantage to the community as a community, and that private monopolistic institutions enrich themselves at the expense of the community. With the experience of years before us, it does seem a strange thing that" as soon as a Labour Government secures possession of the Treasury bench they should introduce a measure having for its object the furtherance of a system which we are here, <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> members of the Labour Party, to minimize as far as possible. </para>

The Dominion began by granting bounties for the establishment of the iron industry, and according to the <inline font-style="italic">Canadian Year-Book,</inline> foal most every year, since the bounties were first granted, the industry in Canada has been making Oliver Twist demands for more and more assistance. There is but one- course open to me as a labour man, and that is to continue to advocate and to endeavour to realize the planks of the platform of the party to which I belong, and to see that this industry shall be either State-owned or Commonwealth-owned. It should belong absolutely to the people. </para>

Not long ago, a sad picture was drawn by certain newspapers of a visit which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hoskins</inline> paid to Melbourne. Upon that occasion, notwithstanding that he was in very delicate health, he undertook a long railway journey with a view to inducing this Parliament to grant him such assistance as would enable him to tide over his financial difficulties. That <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hoskins</inline> does not possess the sympathy of many who favour this proposal is clear from the reception which was accorded to a proposal to grant assistance to the iron industry at a meeting of the Sydney Trades and Labour Council. The matter had been considered by that body, and had been referred to the executive, which, after giving it full and earnest consideration, recommended the adoption of the following motion :  - </para>

                            <para>- We know how vigorously members of the Opposition denounced the granting of bounties to industries which it was proposed to establish outside of New South Wales. It would seem, therefore, that they are interested in this Bill only from a geographical standpoint. To me it is a matter of indifference whether an industry is to be established in New South Wales or in any other State. </para>

                            <para>- There is no analogy between the payment of bounties in respect of other products and the proposed bounty upon iron. Any man or woman, any youth or girl, is at liberty under the Bounties Act, to make experiments in the production of certain commodities, and if those experiments prove successful, is entitled to claim the bounty payable in respect to them. But the bounty which this Bill seeks to authorize has not  the same general application. It is intended to assist in the establishment of a monopoly, for there is room in Australia for only one industry of the kind it is proposed to subsidize. When I was drawn off the track bv interjection, I was outlining the recommendation submitted by the executive of the Sydney Trade and Labour Council to the general body. Upon that recommendation the following amendment was moved - </para>

                    <para class="block">Both the amendment and the motion were discussed at great length, and after every phase of the question had been considered the amendment was defeated by 66 votes to 26, and the recommendation of the executive was agreed to. I am informed, too, that prior to that discussion, a letter was received from the secretary of the  Eskbank  Ironworkers' Association calling attention to the fact that in their opinion the iron industry needed some encouragement, that a claim for wages was before the Wages Board, and that the award would largely depend upon the assistance which the industry received' from the Government. But that letter had no influence whatever with the Sydney Trades and Labour Council. We know also that this very question has been discussed at various times by the Trades and Labour Council, Melbourne, and that, although strong efforts have been made by a section to induce the Council to agree to the subsidizing of the iron industry, the proposal has been ignominiously defeated, for the reason that experience has conclusively proved that wherever the industry has been established, it has created millionaires upon the one hand, and mendicants upon the other. In America the influence of the iron kings has been  exercised  in every conceivable direction - over newspapers, over parliamentary institutions, and over men occupying public and semi-public positions. </para>

                            <para>- Nothing at all.. What I wish to show is that, as the States Governments are the largest consumers of iron in Australia, it would be much more advantageous to their interests, and those of the Commonwealth, if the industry were nationalized. It would be much better, too, from the stand-point of the workmen employed. Of course, we have 'been told' that after a certain period has elapsed the Government can take over this industry if it feels disposed to do so. But similar promises have been forthcoming in regard to all private concessions which have been made in Australia from time to time. For instance) we received the same assurance-  in connexion with the Melbourne tramway service. We were told that if we handed over the highways of this city to a private company it would lay down tramways, and the public would be convenienced in a way that they had never been convenienced before. We were also informed that after a certain number of years the people, through the municipalities, would become the possessors of the company's property. But what are the facts ? We handed over the public highways to a private company, and immediately the tramways came into competition with the State-owned railways. Immediately the company started operations trouble occurred with its workmen. </para>

                            <para>- A strike occurred almost immediately the first line of tramway was opened, and since then not half-a-mile of line has been added to the routes specified in the Act under which the company carries on its operations. Why? Because the tramways are privately owned. Speaking generally, it may also be said that there has been no cheapening of the fares that were originally charged. </para>

But these tramways, because they are privately owned,' increase the fares on certain days in the year. On Cup Day and New Year's Day a person is not permitted by the Melbourne Tramway Company to utilize the citv tickets. If one wants to take a ride from Parliament House to Spencer-street he has to pay threepence cash, or tender a twopenny ticket. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that it is serious to throw men out of employment ; but if it meant that in the course of twelve or eighteen months this industry would be established by the State or the Commonwealth, that a considerably larger number of men would be employed on a better wage standard, and with more reasonable conditions of toil, that users would get the material at a cheaper price, and that the profits, if any, would belong to the whole of the people, the little suffering which the men might be called upon to endure by their temporary displacement would be to the advantage of the whole of the Commonwealth. We are asked to grant a subsidy or a bounty of  £150,000  to a company; but after we have done that, is there any guarantee that it will npt come along later and ask for a duty? Those free-traders, who have ever been against the imposition of any kind of duty, urging as a reason why import duties should not be enforced, that they increase the prices of commodities, naturally will be anxious to continue the subsidy, so that it will mean either more subsidy or more duty. Whichever way these folks look at it, it will mean additional taxation of the citizens of the Commonwealth ; because we know that the people interested in these industries abroad have at their command such an immense amount of capital, and such influences at work in almost every part of the world, that they would be prepared to sell their commodities in different parts of Australia at below cost price, with a view to wiping out any competitor here. This firm in New South Wales have no possible chance of competing with the iron kings of America and Germany if the latter declare war against them. But if the industry were nationally-owned, the chief consideration would be to turn out the materials requisite for certain industries as cheaply as possible, and of such quality that they would compare favorably with any materials turned out by private enterprise in any part of the world, and the State Governments would feel that they were in duty bound to give first consideration to the enterprise that was owned by the people. We know that nowadays some States have Governments which extend little or no consideration to any local product if the imported article can be obtained more cheaply. We know that, although resolutions have been carried in the Victorian Parliament recommending that preference should be given to locally-manufactured articles, there has been a departure from that recommendation, and goods have been obtained abroad on the ground that they cost much less than the locally-made articles. </para>

                            <para>- That is altogether beside this question. To me it would seem that neither a duty nor a bounty would successfully establish the iron industry in New South Wales or any other State, for the reason which I have given, namely, that there are such powerful influences at work in different parts of the world that it would be very seriously handicapped from the very day of its commencement. </para>

                            <para>- Those who are conversant with the doings of the huge trusts and syndicates of America and Germany know that there is truth in the statement which I have made. We know what influence the Standard Oil Trust exercises, and that is only an offshoot of the trusts incidental to the iron and steel industries of America. When I come to consider the history of this movement to get a bounty for the iron industry in New South Wales, my recollection takes me back four or five years when a Royal Commission was appointed to investigate the matter. It was presided over by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> C. Kingston, and included <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> C. Watson, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> W. Fuller, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. D.</inline> Watkins, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> B. Edwards, and others whose names I cannot recall at the moment. I remember reading much of the evidence it took, and its report. It was equally divided in its opinions. One section favoured the bounty system, another section was strong in its condemnation of any bounty, and that section, including <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fuller</inline> and two or three other representatives from New South Wales - free-traders fiscally - signed a report in favour of the nationalization of the industry. It does seem strange to me that instead of that principle having gained adherents there has been a disposition on the part of certain members to water down the policy which they advocated but three or four years ago. What has brought about this change? Surely if there is anything which one can admire in a public man it is consistency. Some of those honorable gentlemen would seem to be consistent in one thing only, and that is in their inconsistency. Canada provides a lesson which we ought to take to heart, the people's money being expended year after year to advance the interests of private citizens. Let us view Japan. I do not suppose that there is any country in the world that has during the last thirty years made such material progress as has Japan. That progress has 'to a very large extent been due to the fact that the Japanese Government, intelligent as it is, notes the manifold advantages of publicly-owned enterprises, as compared with privately-owned enterprises. Every writer who has written on Japan has pointed out the business-like way 111 which public industries are controlled and managed. The success which the Japanese have made of the tobacco industry has been observed. Although a few years ago Japan, as a nation, owned but a portion of the railway lines of the country, to-day the State owns and controls every mile of railway in Japan. It owns and controls sugar plantations and refineries ; it owns and controls paper mills; it owns and controls one of the largest iron and steel works in the world. I have here a short summary dealing with the Japanese Imperial Government's steel works. This booklet shows the importance of conducting an iron industry on modern principles both in regard to military and industrial requirements, and how that lesson was early perceived by the Japanese Government. What a difference between the Government of the Commonwealth and the Government of Japan ; and what a difference between some of those honorable senators who support this proposal and those who advocate nationalization ! We know that within a few years it will be urgently necessary to expend greater sums of money for the defence of Australia. For that purpose large iron and steel works will be needed. Surely it would be well for the Government to own and control the industry which supplies materials required for defence. This booklet states that the attempt to nationalize the iron and steel industry in Japan at first ended in failure, as did also the attempt to induce private enterprise to take up the matter. In Japan, and elsewhere, there are certain people who believe that private enterprise can much more successfully conduct businesses than can a Government. No doubt that section induced the Japanese Government to grant big subsidies as an incentive to persons to embark upon tha industry. The attempt was unsuccessful. Then the project was allowed to remain in abeyance for some time. At length the Government made a second attempt,. In 1890 and 1891 estimates for the necessary expenditure were submitted to Parliament. They were rejected on the ground' that the information furnished by the Government regarding works was not sufficient in respect to the amount of raw material available in Japan. How much more business-like were the people responsible for the government of that country than are those responsible in the Commonwealth. We do not know what raw material is available in Australia. We are told that sufficient raw material exists in New South Wales for a huge industry to supply the needs of the whole Commonwealth. But we have no information as to iron deposits in the Commonwealth generally. When the Royal Commission se.t, I am unaware that it took evidence on the subject outside Melbourne and Sydney. The iron and steel industry is well established in Japan to-day. The reason why it has been successful is that the Japanese Government proceeded in a business-like manner. The booklet before me shows that the members of the House of Peers insisted on a full investigation regarding the possibility of the establishment of the industry. A Committee was appointed. The question whether the amount of iron ore available was sufficient was carefully considered. Skilled engineers were sent to almost every country in the world who collected information, and furnished estimates and recommendations. As a result the industry is to-day successfully established. To show the magnitude of the Japanese works, I may mention that the length of railway lines within the works themselves was, in 1901, 10 miles, and it was then estimated that the length would be 17 miles hereafter. They have a quay wall 630 metres long, with a water depth of 30 feet at ebb tide. They have a fleet of three or four steamers of from 2,000 to 3,000 tons displacement, which are able to load and unload simultaneously alongside the wharf. They have hospital buildings, workmen's dwellings for 3,000 persons, and many other conveniences such as are needful in connexion with such a huge undertaking. Surely the object lesson which Japan provides is one well worthy of emulation by the Commonwealth. I do not know that any words of mine are likely to convince or convert those senators who have made up their minds to vote for the second reading of the Bill. But I am convinced that the amount of the bounty will not stop at £150,000. Once we start assisting this industry, we shall not be able to turn back. It seems to me to be a cruel thing that the whole of the citizens of Australia should be penalized in order that a private citizen in New South Wales may be enabled to establish an industry to enrich himself. If the view of the people of Australia were taken to-morrow, I venture to assert that an overwhelming majority would be opposed to this project. </para>

                            <para>- I -believe there would be eight to one against it if the subject were clearly put before the electors. If it were put as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has put it to us, that it means passing this Bill or having no industry established, the probabilities are that a majority of the electors would favour the proposal. But if the question were put whether the industry should be nationally owned and run in the interests of the citizens of Australia, or whether £150,000 should be granted to a. private citizen, I have not the slightest doubt as to what the verdict of the people would be. The number of those who believe, in the policy of nationalizing monopolies is increasing. Here we have an opportunity of giving effect in a practical way to the principles we have times out of number advocated. But there is a disposition to back down because we are told that there is a likelihood of the industry not being established, and of a number of men being thrown out of employment if we do not consent. I earnestly hope that the amendment I have moved will be carried, and that some measure of support, at any rate, will be given by those who have on previous occasions affirmed the principle of the nationalization of monopolies. Whether I _ meet with support or not. I have at least given evidence of my consistency on this question. I have opposed the granting of a bounty to this industry inside and outside of this Chamber and I shall continue to oppose it. If approved of by a majority of the Senate, the Bill, even though it should be amended in the way proposed, will probably meet with a similar1 measure of support 'in another place. Should it become an Act, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hoskins</inline> will receive the bounty, and we shall be given an opportunity in the course of a few years, if we feel so disposed, to take over the industry' and carry it on as a. national enterprise. But let me say that in five or ten years' time we shall have no better opportunity than we have to-day to take over the industry and to make it a national enterprise. As a matter of fact, when we have by the payment of the bounty successfully established the industry as a private enterprise, we shall have greater difficulty in taking it over. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so; but I am endeavouring to point out that the same opposition will be shown by certain honorable senators to the taking over of the industry by the Commonwealth, even if it is a non-paying concern, that is shown at the present time. It is a nonpaying concern to-day, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hoskins.</inline> It is because he cannot make it a success that he asks the people of the Commonwealth to make it a success for him. That is a peculiar position for any citizen of the Commonwealth to place himself in. In effect, he says. " I have been a failure at it. I cannot make a success of it. I have not sufficient money, and I cannot get a sufficient number of people in New South Wales who have the same faith in the enterprise that I have myself to come forward and take a hand in it ; so I am going to make a begging appeal to the Commonwealth Parliament and to the representatives of my own State therein for the assistance that I cannot secure in my own State." </para>

                            <para>- No. There is a very great difference between a bounty and a duty. Some honorable senators argue that duties increase the price of commodities. I do not admit that. I say that, temporarily, by the imposition of duties prices may be increased, but any one is at liberty to embark in a line of industry advantaged' by the imposition of Customs duties. That naturally produces internal competition and cheapens the price of the dutiable commodities. But, in the case <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> this industry, neither a bounty nor a duty can be of advantage to the Commonwealth, because there is room in Australia only for one industry of the kind. Imposing a duty for the benefit of this industry would be imposing a duty for the benefit of a monopoly, and granting a bounty to it would be merely doing the same thing. I do not wish to delay the Senate further. I have made my protest against the principle embodied in the Bill, a protest consistent with my platform utterances, and consistent also with the planks of the party to which I belong. We are against existing monopolies, and that being so, I cannot for the life of me understand why  we should spend public money in an endeavour to create additional monopolies, and say in the next breath that although we propose to assist the creation of a monopolistic institution, we make provision in the Bill to enable the citizens later on, if they feel so disposed, to take over the monopoly at the valuation which the people whom we shall have assisted bv this subsidy like to place upon it. </para>

So that they will turn out this material, not with their own money, but with Commonwealth money, and .when they have done so, they will approach the States Governments and ask them to take the material which they have turned out at the people's expense, at the price which they will place upon it themselves.

I believe that, no matter what Government is in power in the Commonwealth, whether it be a Labour Government or one opposed to the policy of the Labour Party, we must, within the next four or five years, if we are to be worthy of the name of citizens of a nation, adopt a forward policy. That may mean the construction of a railway between South Australia and Western Australia, and if I can help it it certainly will mean the taking over and the development of the Northern Territory. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know that I shall. That depends on certain contingencies; but that these lines of railways will be built in the course of years goes without saying. That a railway will be built in the Northern Territory is. I feel sure, as certain as that I am standing here this morning. The construction of these lines of railway will mean the payment of thousands of pounds for steel rails. The Commonwealth could make these rails more cheaply than private enterprise will be willing to make them for. If they are made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hoskins</inline> he will look for profits on the material he turns out, and if the industry were in the hands of the Commonwealth, those profits might be saved for the people, and the industry would be on a much more satisfactory basis. I am satisfied that it would be a step in the wrong direction to subsidize any private citizen to the extent provided for in this Bill. I am satisfied also that if this Bill is carried and the proposed subsidy is granted to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hoskins,</inline> there will, in the course of a few years, be another appeal to Parliament for additional assistance for this industry. </para>

                        <para>. - I should like to say a few words on the second reading of this Bill. The argument urged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> appeals in many respects to me. I feel that this is pre-eminently an industry that could be successfully nationalized. I feel, further, that it is an industry, the opponents of which are so strong that it would be of great advantage to it to have the strength of the nation behind it. But I recognise that it is an industry we are so urgently in. need of that nothing should be permitted to prevent its earliest possible establishment. There is not, in my judgment, a sufficiently strong feeling in favour of the nationalization of this, or of any other industry, to warrant the assumption that that end could be achieved in the near future. This Bill furnishes an opportunity of establishing; the industry, and if, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> believes, there is a large majority in favour of its nationalization, the provisions of the measure will enable that majority to achieve its will when it is made manifest at a general election by the return of a sufficient number of persons pledged to give effect to that proposal. But, in the meantime, we shall have an industry, the importance of which transcends all others established in our midst. We are continually expressing our sense of the importance of a complete and effective defence system. It seems to me that the question of defence is inseparably bound up with the production of iron. It is impossible to create munitions of war without an adequate supply of iron and steel. </para>

                            <para>- No, I do not think it would. This is one of those cases in which I think that we require a bounty before the imposition of a duty. As I have said, iron and steel enter into almost every detail of our lives. We cannot have our dinner prepared, or eat it, we cannot be carried about the city or on the railways, we cannot build our houses, or do anything of a material character without the products of iron and steel, and at present we are dependent for our supplies entirely upon foreign sources. I do not use the term "foreign " as applied to Great Britain, in any offensive way. We may rest assured that Great Britain will always be glad to give us the supplies of iron that we require, so long as she is able to do so. But her ability to do so depends upon her maintenance of the command of the seas, and we must remember that at any moment we may be absolutely cut off from our source of supply in the matter of this absolute essential. We cannot, therefore, over-estimate the importance of having within our own borders an abundant supply of this important commo'dity. For that reason I am in favour of establishing the iron industry at the earliest possible moment, and with the means which are available. Some honorable senators have .suggested the imposition of a duty upon iron as an alternative to the bounty system proposed under this Bill. But whatever plan we may adopt, some years must necessarily elapse before we can develop our iron resources sufficiently to supply our own requirements. I believe that we have practically unlimited deposits of iron ore, but before they can be made serviceable some years of developmental work must be undertaken. If we were to impose upon iron a duty sufficiently heavy to be protective in its incidence, it would not have the immediate effect of making available the quantity of iron that we require, and consequently its cost to the users of this commodity throughout Australia would be increased. Of course, some persons will say that T have always contended that the imposition of a protective duty has the effect of decreasing the price of any commodity. That is so, and I maintain that a protective duty upon iron would eventually cheapen the cost of that article. But we cannot ignore the fact " that the iron industry is one which it would take many months, and probably years, to develop. Consequently no analogy can be instituted between iron and other manufactured articles. It is of more importance than any other commodity of which I have any knowledge. Gold dwindles into insignificance when compared with it. For that reason I intend to vote for this Bill, which, I believe, will have the effect of at once establishing the iron industry. I shall look forward longingly to the time when circumstances will enable us to nationalize it. But even if we do not nationalize it, it is better to have. the industry conducted by private enterprise in our own midst than to have it conducted bv private enterprise abroad, seeing that the foreigner has power to tax us at his will, and that we are in imminent danger of having our supplies entirely cut off, in which case we should be utterly helpless. These, briefly, are the reasons which induce me to vote for this Bill. I support it, not because I am opposed to nationalization - because I ardently hope that that step will yet be taken - but because I desire to see the iron industry established at an early date, and because I think that this Bill provides the means of establishing it. </para>

                        <para>. - 1 take a very great interest in the iron industry, and have done so for the past few years. The State which I represent possesses some of the purest iron deposits to be found in any part of the world. It is interesting to know that those deposits have been reported upon by one of the best experts in the world. Some time ago the owners of the Blythe Iron Mine engaged an expert from Great Britain to report upon them - a gentleman who was held  in  such high repute that his fee for a few months' work was £3,500. The Bill under consideration does not specifically propose to assist the iron industry of Tasmania or of any other State, although we know perfectly well, as a matter of fact, that it will have the effect of substantially encouraging the industry in New South Wales. But in matters of this kind our convictions ought not to be swayed by geographical considerations. Although Tasmania possesses magnificent iron deposits, I recognise that large deposits also exist at Lithgow, and that men have- been found with the courage and capital necessary to give those deposits a fair  trial. It seems to me that in dealing with measures of this kind we are apt to regard prospective industries through quite different spectacles from those through which we view industries which have already been developed. Only this morning <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> argued that because an attempt has been made in New South Wales to establish the iron industry, we ought not to assist it. To me that fact is a very solid reason why we should assist it. We all recognise that the industry is struggling with very great difficulties indeed. Personally,, I should not have referred to the local aspect of this question, had it not been for the fact that reference has already been made to it. I think that we should discuss the matter from the broad stand-point of whether it is desirable by any artificial means to encourage the development of the iron industry in Australia. Undoubtedly it is. In a huge continent such as we inhabit, we must recognise that our railway system, as it expands, will afford a fair measure of employment to those engaged in this industry, and the fact that we occupy a country which is likely to be isolated from the rest of the world should also weigh with us in considering this question. </para>

But instead of doing that, they propose to introduce into it an important controversial element, which is likely to jeopardize its passing. I hope that they will not risk such an important measure by insisting upon the insertion of that provision. </para>

He declared, in effect, that it had a right, in running the Post Office, to manufacture the hessian which is used in the making of mail bags, or to establish a sealing-wax factory. That is the interpretation which I put upon his utterance. He said, virtually that it is not constitutional for the Commonwealth to attempt to establish an industry of this kind, but that there is a wav by which we can get round the Constitution. </para>

                            <para>- If we want to establish any industry, there is one way in which to acquire the necessary power, and we have no right to anticipate the verdict of the people. Unfortunately, the weakness  of our legislation has been that we have tried to exceed the terms of the deed of partnership which contains express limitations, and whose great central feature is that we are to deal with only those matters which have been handed over to us. It has been shown by the decisions of the High Court that in several instances we have tried by indirect means to accomplish that which we have no power to accomplish directly. I do not want to enter into further argument about the desirability of nationalizing the industry. Briefly stated, my opinion is that every one of these projects should be dealt with purely on its merits. If it is a desirable industry to nationalize, then let us take the power to nationalize it. But with the question of nationalization generally, and the socialistic aspect of the matter I am not dealing. I am really anxious to see this Bill passed. I do not want to see difficulty raised which cannot effect any useful purpose. In this matter, one has lo take a certain degree of personal responsibility. In common with a great many members of this Parliament, I have been watching for some time the trend of financial affairs in the Commonwealth, and I am sorry to say that I have a very grave doubt as to whether we are not going to have a financial crisis. That is a thing which we need not have. But our present policy seems to be bringing a crisis upon us. We are now asked to give a bounty, and I desire to say, in justice to my constituents and myself that I know what  .1  am about to give. We are asked to confer a bounty not on a prospective industry, but on an existing industry, and it will cost us straight away £30,000 a year. That, in itself is not a very large sum. It is worth quite that sum to establish the iron industry, and I intend to vote for the Bill on that account. But this, with other commitments into which we have allowed ourselves to be drawn recently in various ways, will, in my opinion, make the financial position of the Commonwealth in the near future a very difficult one. Notwithstanding that possibility, I am here to take my share of the responsibility, and to give a very hearty support to this Bill without any amendment </para>

                        <para>. - It is generally known that I have taken a considerable interest in the iron industry since I became a member of the Senate. On several occasions, the Question of establishing ironworks in the Commonwealth has been discussed here from various stand-points. I am pleased to say that no matter what another place mav think of the principle of nationalization v th.; Senate has placed its hall-mark of approval on it. I feel as certain as I stand here to-day that before very long the time will come when that principle will be applied to the iron industry. There are so many reasons in favour of its nationalization that I am surprised indeed that gentlemen who take a lively interest in the welfare of the country, and pose from time to time as State-righters, can take up any. other, attitude for a moment. Honorable senators can talk as they like about the iron industry being in existence-, but it is so little in existence that it will practically lapse unless the Government come forward with the money of the taxpayers to rescue it. In the proper sense of the word, it is not an established industry. Of necessity, it must be a monopoly practically situated in one State, for the simple reason that in Australia there is not a sufficient market,, either now or, so far as I can- see in the future, for more than one reasonably up-to-date ironworks. If it is to be- worthy of the name of an ironworks, it must be able to supply the requirements of Australia, and the one article which above all' others it must produce must be steel' rails, and, of course, the State Governments will, be the principal customers for those products. </para>

We are now asked to establish the iron industry by means of a bounty which is only another form of protection, and so soon as -it is properly on its feet, we shall have forced upon us the necessity of imposing a protective duty, or the works must be molly-coddled with an <inline font-style="italic">enormous amount</inline> of public money - more than I think we shall be able to afford. There is no escape from this inevitable position.

                            <para>- I hope that my honorable friend is not attempting to pull my leg. If the industry were nationalized by the Commonwealth, 'there would be no necessity for any bounty to be paid. But if it were nationalized by the New South Wales Government - the most likely Government to embark in the enterprise - I take it that the amount of assistance which we are now asked to give to a private company would be just as necessary then. The cost of carrying on the concern would be just the same then as it is now, and it would be unfair to ask that State at its sole expense to establish what I believe ought to be a national industry. We must make up our minds that there will be an enormous outlay on the ironworks, and for that reason, I contend that it ought to be in the hands of the central Government, and not in the hands of even a State Government. I should object to a State Government taking over the industry, because I am satisfied that it would provoke very much discontent amongst the various States if they had to subscribe in order to keep alive an industry within the borders of one State. I am quite sure that those who are constantly crying out about State rights would be the first to raise their voices when they realized that New South Wales owned an ironworks which' the other States had to help to keep going. I cannot understand those who in one breath talk about State rights, and in the next breath are prepared to create a monopoly which, in my' opinion, must be confined to one State. T hope that those honorable senators who are endeavouring to put this monopoly in the hands of one company in one State will bear that in mind, and that when next they explain to the public the process of parliamentary business, they will be kind, enough to point out that they have assisted in creating a monopoly in one State only for the benefit of one company only, in opposition to the proposal of the Labour Party that should create a truly national industry. When what is desired has been done,  I  have no doubt that those people who are at the present time in such a hurry to create a monopoly in New South Wales will be loudest in crying out against it. I see no urgent necessity for rushing into this enterprise. The only argument that I can see in favour of it is that in Lithgow there are a large number of men with families who are dependent upon the ironworks. That is an unfortunate position, which I forecasted some years ago, when I outlined my proposal to establish ironworks under the control of the Government. I pointed out that, sooner or later, vested interests would be created, and that the central Government would be compelled to grant its help. It would be urged, I said, " How can we allow men and women to starve when there is an industry that requires our assistance?" That is the position that faces us now. The industry has to some extent  been established at Lithgow, and the workmen are in need of employment. We have been told that the predecessors of the present company, who started the industry, had some promise made to them. ' I deny that any promise was made to any company. If they had regard to the attitude of the Federal Parliament, it must have been obvious that the intention was that the industry, if established at all, should be a national concern. Yet it has been said that the investors were encouraged to go into the industry, and that we cannot now refuse to help them. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford</inline> may have gone into it with the hope of securing assistance, but the present company have no such excuse. They bought the concern with their eyes open. They entered upon the trade knowing its drawbacks. Therefore, I am satisfied that this Parliament is, in no shape or form, under any obligation to do the slightest thing to help the company. But, as I have admitted, there are other considerations which we cannot ignore. There are a number of people who must seek employment elsewhere unless we extend assistance. I know, personally, what it is for a workman to have to seek employment. An appeal on that ground must reach the heart of every one who has any feeling in his breast. But the national aspect of the question cannot be ignored. As politicians, when we cannot secure all that we want, we are often obliged to make the best of a position. I am sorry that there is not a sufficient number of members in the Federal Parliament who believe in doing the right thing ; though in saying that I do not attribute to any honorable senator a desire to do the wrong thing. I am sorry that there is not a majority who recognise the necessity of placing the industry on the only true and sound basis. We have been told that we have not the constitutional power to establish an industry of the kind. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin's</inline> opinion has been hawked about to a considerable extent. But I point out that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> propounded, as Attorney-General in the Barton Administration, a very elaborate view. I grant that he did not say straight out that we had power te nationalize the industry. But he said that there were powers under the Constitution which would enable us to conduct an industry of this kind. For instance, if we need iron for defence purposes, there can be no two opinions as to our having the constitutional power to establish ironworks to supply our own requirements. To show that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin's</inline> opinion was not circumscribed, as represented, I will read what he said.   His  opinion was - </para>

                                could not be expected to give an opinion on such a silly, hypothetical case. The ironworks had not been established when he gave his opinion, and the question of taking over works that did not exist could not enter into consideration. I am satisfied that we have under the Constitution the implied power to go into this concern without fear of interference with State rights.

                            <para>- -I was pointing out the advantages which would accrue if this industry were carried on by the Federal Government, and the dangers likely to arise to the States Governments, and also to the Federal Government, if it is permitted to remain in the hands of private persons. The danger to the interests of the various States is not very obvious at the present moment, otherwise honorable senators opposite would not be found so ready to support the establishment of this industry as a private monopoly, as according to their public protestations they are great States rights men. Under existing circumstances we must view this matter on the assumption that the industry is to be established at Lithgow, since there is no immediate prospect of its establishment anywhere else in the Commonwealth. And we should ask ourselves whether wc are justified in doing anything which would further the establishment of iron works at a place which is not at all favorable for the development of the industry. I know sufficient of the geography and the commercial conditions of New South Wales to say that Lithgow is not the best place in that State for the establishment of iron works. I lived in the State for a considerable number of years, and while there took a lively interest in the development of the iron industry. Many years ago <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Mitchell, who was at one time a colleague of the  President  in the representation of the Illawarra district in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, but who has since gone, let us hope, to a better place, took a very prominent part in the establishment of iron works, and he expressed the opinion that Lithgow was not a favorable place for their establishment. He was a strong freetrader, and he held that there were grave difficulties in the way of the establishment of such works in any part of Australia, because the labour conditions here are so different from those which obtain in most of the countries where the great competitors in such an industry are established. Lithgow, according ro <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. '</inline> Mitchell's opinion, in which I concur, is one of the most unfavorable places for the establishment of iron works from a Commonwealth stand-point. It is situated at a considerable distance from the seaboard. The cost of the transport of coal, ore, limestone, and the finished products of iron works must always be a most important element in the success of the industry. Without cheap transport such an industry is very heavily handicapped. In every other country in the world a first consideration in the establishment of the iron industry has been the necessity of cheap and easy means of transport, and wherever possible land transport has been avoided. We are not at present in a position to say where such works might most advantageously be established in the Commonwealth. New South Wales certainly possesses a more abundant coal supply than any of the other States; but that is perhaps the only advantage which in this matter is possessed by New South Wales. Iron ore is to be found in every State in the Commonwealth, and there are several places in other States in which there is much richer ore than that of New South Wales. The presence or absence of certain chemical ingredients in the ore used might make or mar the industry. If possible, the ore must be free from phosphorus, sulphur, and other ingredients difficult of extraction. Unless ore of a high quality is available the industry must be heavily handicapped. I do not say that there is not good iron ore in New South Wales, because there is very much of fair quality; but the reports of experts go to show that perhaps the purest and best ore so far discovered in Australia is that found on the Blythe River in Tasmania. </para>

I consider it the height of impertinence for the honorable senator to suggest that I should ask his permission to explain the matter in my own way. I am justified in saying that so far as the quality of the ore is concerned that at Lithgow possesses no special advantages, and there are some serious disadvantages to the establishment of the industry there.

                    <para class="block">Blythe River, from the Iron Knob, and from any other part of Australia. This would be the cheapest means of transport, and without the cheap transport of its raw materials the industry cannot be made a commercial success. Lithgow is a town away in the Blue Mountains about 100 miles from the coast, and that is too great a distance to transport raw material for the manufacture of iron. Iron works established in the United Kingdom are placed as near to deep water as possible, in order that the cost of transport may be reduced to the smallest possible amount. The works are so situated that the materials can be transported by water. Iron stone is to be found in most parts of the United Kingdom, and I have seen coal and iron brought out of trie same mine, whilst the furnaces were not more than a mile away from the mine. That is how the iron industry was built up in the United Kingdom, and it had commercial advantages not to be obtained in . any other part of the world. We have no such advantages at Lithgow, and I cannot see how we can hope that the industry will be carried on successfully there. I wish to direct the attention of honorable senators to what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Attard</inline> has to say in this connexion as to the approximate cost of the production of pig iron there. </para>

                            <para>- Avery fair average is about 30 cwt. Of course, the quality of the coal varies considerably, and so does the ore, only more so. In the biggest manufacturing part of the United Kingdom - I refer to Cleveland - 3 tons of ore are required to produce 1 ton of iron; but in most other parts 2 tons of ore are sufficient to secure the same result. With regard to the Lithgow iron works I find that during a period of six months they produced 13,856 tons of pig iron. That is equivalent to nn average of only 495 tons per week. Yet we have been told that these works have a great capacity. We have been led to believe that they were producing about 700 tons weekly, and that their output was to be increased to 1,000 tons weekly. But even if that expectation be realized those works will be a very twopenny-halfpenny affair compared with the up-to-date furnaces which are to be found in other parts of the world. I find also that at Lithgow the cost of the labour and material necessary for the production of one ton of iron is £3 12s. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that the difference is absorbed in labour. If it were, the condition would not be so unsatisfactory as it is. In reply to specific questions put to him, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allard</inline> stated that during a period of twelve months the average cost of iron ore to the company was 8s. per ton. That is an enormously high price to pay for iron ore compared with the price paid for it in other parts of the world. I find, too, that at Lithgow coke costs 19s. 5d. per ton, which is an abnormally high rate. I cannot understand why such a price should be charged at Lithgow, where coal, which is the raw material of coke, can be obtained so cheaply. The works there also pay 6s. 100. per ton for limestone, which is not at all a low price. </para>

To me these high prices constitute the most depressing feature connected with this proposal, viewing it from a commercial standpoint. Then we have been told that the iron produced at Lithgow is superior to the imported article. Of course, I can understand that we are naturally proud of our own production, but at the same time we should not permit our judgment to be warped merely by sentimental considerations. But what are the real facts of the case? I find that the iron produced at Lithgow has not even been sold at the ordinary market rates ruling in Australia. According to the Customs returns the selling price of the Lithgow iron, both last year and this year, was a few shillings per" ton lower than the selling price of the imported article to which it is alleged to be superior. In 1906 the selling price of the Lithgow article was £3 12s. per ton, and in 1907 it was £3 13s. 3d. per ton. </para>

                            <para>- From the Customs Department. The prices which I have quoted do not by any means indicate that the iron produced at Lithgow is superior to the imported article. I have already pointed out that the prices which the New South Wales Government have been charged by this company are very unfair. The Government of that State has paid £4 9s. per ton for its iron, whereas, according to the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allard,</inline> the average price paid by other customers has been only £3 4s. 8d. per ton. That gentleman quotes other cases in which outside customers have been charged £3 5s. 6d. per ton by G. C. Hoskins and Co., as against £3 10s. per ton charged to the Government. This is the way the private enterpriser works the Government milch cow. From the New South Wales Government, they get their iron carried from Lithgow to Sydney at half the usual rates. When the iron is bought by the Government, £1 more is charged than to other customers, and this is the industry that anti-Socialists of the Senate, those advocates of private enterprise and self-reliance, are now demanding more public money for in the form of bounties. So surely as we establish this industry so surely will these prices be increased, and the States Governments will be called upon to pay, perhaps,  £4  9s. per ton for their iron, whilst other customers are paying only £3 10s. per ton. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I have not analyzed the prices from the standpoint of the production of steel rails. Before concluding I should like to point out that the bounty system, wherever it has been tried, has proved the reverse of satisfactory. We all recollect the experience of Victoria in connexion with the butter bonus, and we know that the local consumer was called upon to pay for that article a higher price than ' was the customer abroad. The history of the bounty system in Canada is far from encouraging. When it was initiated the promise was made that it should continue only for two or three years, and that the industry would then be sufficiently established to be able to compete with other countries without any artificial stimulus. But notwithstanding that the iron bounty has continued for thirteen years in that country, only last year the Parliament of the Dominion had to agree to its renewal. Seeing that the people of Canada have already expended $6,000,000 in the form of iron bounties, we must be prepared - if we pass this Bill - to submit to a very costly experiment. Of course, I recognise that the industry cannot be established without some assistance being granted to it. If we were to nationalize it I think that the taxpayers might possibly receive some return for the money which would be invested in it. The time will undoubtedly come when the iron industry in Australia will be a very big one. But under the scheme which is embodied in this Bill it will be controlled by a few capitalists who will exploit the masses for their own purposes. We shall then have Australian Carnegies growing rich at the expense of the taxpayer. </para>

                            <para>- I merely pointed out that if the industry is to be made a commercial success it should not be established at Lithgow, nor put into the hands of private enterprise. One thing is certain, namely, that when once the bounty system has been initiated in respect of the iron industry it will have to be continued. Personally, I would like to see the industry controlled by the Commonwealth. Whatever profits were derived from it would then find they way into the national exchequer. But under this Bill we are asked to assist a private capitalist to make profits. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly that is the <inline font-style="italic">eni de sac</inline> into which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> argument drives him. The iron industry has been a source of great prosperity to every country in which it has been made a success. All countries which are well advanced in the iron industry are also well advanced in civilization and progress. The United States, I suppose, owes its enormous wealth more to the iron industry than to any other. Scotland, my native land, was one of the poorest countries in Europe until she established her iron industry ; and then, owing to her enormous mineral wealth, she became, and still is, one of the richest countries in the world. I dare say that in the future we shall be able to look upon our iron industry in a somewhat similar light, and see it yield an enormous profit, but at the present time we must recognise that very little profit is likely to accrue to the general public from it. We are taking a step in the wrong, direction when we propose to use public money to keep going a ' private concern. There is another aspect of the question which I cannot overlook, and that is the position of the workmen. Perhaps as poorly a paid class of workmen is to be found in the iron industry all over the world as in any other industry. I can remember having to work, when a boy, for the handsome wage of 6d. .a day in an industry which was yielding enormous fortunes to those who were fortunate enough to call themselves " ironmasters " which, in Scotland, is synonymous with millionaires. These men became enormously rich at the expense of poor working men, many of whom were toiling for 16s. a week. I foresee these difficulties arising in Australia just as they have arisen elsewhere. We all remember reading of the poorly-paid workmen in Carnegie's ironworks, and the riots which occurred there years ago, when the negro was brought there to blackleg on the white man. We know the poor wages that obtain in many countries where the iron industry is established. We should take the only step possible to avoid those evils in Australia, and that is by placing the iron industry in the hands of the central Government, who will see that the men who bear the heat and burden of the day are well treated. Iron work in Australia must, of necessity, be very laborious, and the men deserve to be well paid. There is no better employer or paymaster than the Government, and for these reasons we ought to establish the industry on the broad basis of control by the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>.- I confess that I listened with a good deal of surprise to the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, who is practically a member of the Government. He threw a wet blanket over the Bill, and apparently he does not desire it to pass. He dwelt a good deal upon the danger to the Commonwealth and the States if we decide to give a bounty. But he forgot to say that the Commonwealth and the States will have the matter entirely in their own control. If an attempt should be made to exact undue prices for the products of the ironworks, it will be entirely in the hands of the Commonwealth and the States to bring them down. The fear that they will be compelled to pay undue prices, and that therefore the people will be unduly taxed, is utterly unfounded, because we should have simply to open the ports to bring the prices down to what was reasonable. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie made an attack, not only upon the Bill, but also upon the place where the iron industry is being carried on. This Bill is not brought forward entirely in the interests of Lithgow, although possibly it will derive the first benefit from its enactment, because the industry has been advanced more there than in any other part of Australia. The benefits which it offers can be enjoyed in any part where there are iron deposits and persons enterprising enough to engage .in the industry. I agree with all that has been said regarding its importance. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> and others have shown what an enormous advantage the establishment of the industry will be. It is really the foundation of all industries, and we ought to go a good deal out of our way to try to get it established here. I regret that the Bill has been so framed as to make it absolutely impossible for many honorable senators to vote for it exactly as it is. I do not see that there was any necessity to frame it in that manner, nor why it could not have been framed in the same way as the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston's</inline> Bill of 1902. He did not include any clauses regarding wages which are now being settled by a Wages Board - or any clause regarding the nationalization of the industry. We find the same body of men blocking the establishment of the industry now as on that occasion. </para>

                            <para>- The Labour Party. It was owing to their action that the proposals of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston</inline> were shelved, and to them is due the non-establishment of the industry. If the Government were honest, and desired to help the industry, why did they insert in the Bill objectionable clauses which it is impossible for many honorable senators to vote for, although we are all agreed as to the necessity of establishing the industry and giving assistance to it? Why should those clauses have been inserted to divide us? Was it done in order that the Bill might be lost? Honorable senators on the other side claim to be consistent. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> for instance, claimed that he gave certain pledges regarding this industry to his constituents. But he must recognise that other honorable senators have given pledges "to their constituents, and that, naturally, they want to keep them. It is a very great pity that this bone of contention was put in the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- Wages Boards have not yet been established in other places, but they will come in good time. It seems that our honorable friends on the other side are more concerned about the conditions of labour than in getting work for men. If you get work for men, you can settle the other matter by-and-by. My honorable friends want to do too much at once, and thus it is that they get nothing done. I " shall support the Bill as far as I can. I support its second reading, because I think that the iron industry needs developing. For many years private enterprise has been tackling this problem.. The Sandfords manfully tackled it for years, spending an enormous sum. They battled against misfortune, against drawbacks, against disappointment from this Parliament when, owing to the action of the Labour Party, they did not get a bounty which they were led to expect. Finally, they had to succumb, but they found that another firm was enterprising enough to put £250,000 into the concern, and endeavour to make a success of it. </para>

                            <para>- That is the case. We are told that unless this Bill is passed, 600 men will be thrown out of work. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie says that if it is passed it will simply be the means of putting money into the pockets of capitalists. Does he know that 1,000 men are dependent upon the industry, and that probably three or four persons are dependent upon the earnings of each of these thousand employed? In their circular, Hoskins and Company say that it is impossible to carryon the industry as it is, working up the raw ore as they do, unless assistance in the form of a bounty is given. They state that unless it is given the number of their hands will fall to 300, who will be simply used in working up scrap iron. Are we prepared by our action to bring about the destruction of the industry? A large responsibility is placed upon each of us. It should also be remembered that it is not proposed to put this money into the pockets of Hoskins and Company. It is to be paid on approved material being placed on the market. The firm will have to incur great expense in getting the ore and putting approved material on the market before a single penny can be put in their pockets. We all know the difficulties the firm have had to encounter. There have been difficulties in regard to wages. Some time ago the men were asked to accept a reduction. This they declined to do, and the matter was referred to a Wages Board. At the re quest of the Wages Board, an independent accountant was asked to go into the business, and he reported in these terms - </para>

                        <para>The Board sat for a few days and then adjourned pending the investigation of the financial position of the concern by an independent accountant. This report has now been presented, and, although we think it open to criticism in some respects, the general conclusion that wages must be considerably reduced if the industry is to be continued on its present basis, is very difficult to answer. With our full knowledge of the industry of the concern we think that the present wages will be maintained by the Wages Board, and the industry will expand considerably, and employ a much larger number of men, if the proposed bonus on pig-iron, steel ingots, and puddled bars, is granted. </para>

                    <para class="block">If the output increases, the cost of working the business will decrease with every additional ton which is put out. The men say that they have secured a minimum wage of 7s. per day, and are prepared to leave the determination of the wages Ito the Wages Board, and to abide by whatever decision may be come to. It has been stated that only ninety or ninety-five men are employed in the industry. But it must be remembered that, apart from the families of those men, there are other persons whose prosperity depends upon the continuation ot the iron works. It is stated here - </para>

                    <para class="block">They also say that they are turning out about 700 tons per week, and that the output could be increased to 1,000 tons without an increase of plant, which would lead to a reduction in the cost of. the iron produced. They refer to the subject of nationalization, of which they approve. They say, "We admit the wisdom of nationalization of monopolies but they do not think that that policy will be carried out at present, whereas the firm establishment of the iron industry in private hands, and under fair conditions, will not hinder the future nationalization of the works. They consider that the industry has passed the experimental stage, and that, with the assistance to be given, it will become permanent. They point out that the cessation of operations now would be disastrous, and that the men would lose their employment. There are over 600 men directly or indirectly engaged in the works who would be discharged. We ought to put aside any small differences we may nave as to this measure, and if we can,  conformably with our platform pledges, support the Bill, we should do so. The amount involved is not very large, but the expenditure will probably encourage others to establish iron industries in other parts of Australia. We can afford to put aside non-essentials, and the forces of those who are in favour of the principle should not be divided, because the loss of this measure would undoubtedly be the means of throwing a large number of men out of work. </para>

                        <para>. - The last  speaker  is responsible tor my rising to say a few words with regard to this Bill. It is customary for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> in nearly all his speeches to cry " Down with the Labour Party." I am getting sick of it. It is disgusting to hear the same tale from the honorable senator so frequently. I am in rather an awkward position. I have been studying this matter very carefully in the light of my hustings pledges, and also in the light of our financial position, having regard to the other obligations which have to be met. 1 am concerned with the question how we are to find the money for the proposed bounty.  I have received no reply to that question. I believe that even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> is not prepared with a reply. No party in this Parliament has a policy in that respect. But the moment a policy that would meet the situation is introduced, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> and others cry, " Down with the Labour Party." . I should regret it very  much indeed if a number of men were thrown out of employment. But at the same time, we must be careful of the finances of the Commonwealth. If we are to pay £30,000 a year for the benefit of the Lithgow works - where will it end? At the expiration of the five years influences will still be exerted, and we cannot realize the total that will have to be paid before we have done with the business. I am not afraid of a monopoly, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> is. But I consider that if the company in question requires £30,000 a year for five years, they are just  as likely to require a similar amount at the end of that period. If I were to receive an advance from a Bank, the institution would want a mortgage to the amount of twice the value received. If the Commonwealth Parliament is to advance £150,000, what is it to get by way of security? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> has referred to the Labour Party as blocking progress. I have turned up the report of the Royal Commission which inquired into this subject in 1904. I intend to quote from it. I have an object in view. One-half ' the members of the Commission were opposed to a bounty, and the other half were in favour of it. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> McColl  would study the report of one-half the members of the Commission, he would find that not only the Labour Party, but also some of those who once were Labour men, but who now lead the Tory Party" in another place, were opposed to a bounty for the production of iron. The report says - </para>

                    <quote>
                        <para>We recognise that the Commonwealth possess vast deposits of iron-ore of high grade, coal, Sc., for iron works. Ample evidence has beer* given to satisfy us on that point. Furthermore, we believe it would be a considerable advantage to have the industry in operation in a flourishing condition, and on a proper basis. In our opinion, however, such a desirable result would not be best promoted by the Bill we have been asked to consider. </para>
                        <para>The Bill provides for the payment of ^324,000 of the people's money to private individuals engaged in an enterprise for their private gain. There can be no guarantee that the bonuses proposed would permanently establish the industry, though it is probable the inducements offered might be instrumental in forming speculative companies. </para>
                        <para>One of the witnesses, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford,</inline> managing director of the Eskbank Iron Works, New South Wales, stated that he had made an agreement with an English syndicate to spend ^'250,000 in extending the Lithgow works if the Bill passed. In answer to another question, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford</inline> said that to make pig-iron he wanted a plant involving an expenditure of from ^100,000 to £125,000.  This estimate is less than half the sum proposed to be paid <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> bonuses. </para>
                        <para>The Canadian experience is not encouraging. The bonus system for iron production was first instituted there in 1S83. Subsequently a Bill was passed in 1897 further continuing the system. Another Bill was carried in 1899, providing for the diminution of the bounties by a sliding scale expiring in 1907. In July of this year the Dominion Government decided to postpone the operation of this sliding scale for one year, which practically means a further increase in the bounties paid. Nearly all the witnesses examined before the Commission agreed that the payment of bonuses would he useless unless followed by a duty. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Are the representatives of New South Wales prepared to grant the necessary protection? The bounties must be continued unless there is a protective duty. As a protectionist, I -see quite  clearly  that the way out of the difficulty is the imposition of a duty. If we merely give a bounty! what is to prevent the Americans from sending in ship-loads of iron and steel and* selling it at a loss, perhaps for a year or two, in order to crush the Lithgow industry? Hence, if this Bill be passed, and £30,000  paid, we may be no nearer to the establishment of a permanent industry than we are at present. It is to be observed, by the way, that the representative in another place of the district which includes Lithgow is an out-and out free-trader - or, rather, he is, like the Western Australians, a " geographical protectionist " occasionally. The report of this one-half of the Royal Commission states, further - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Experience shows that if the payment of bonuses be commenced the liability of the Commonwealth will not be limited to the sum proposed under the Bill, but that further Government aid will be sought. </para>
                        <para>The evidence failed to show that there was any commercial necessity for the bonuses proposed. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford</inline> said he could produce pig-iron at Lithgow under 35s. a ton. Allowing for freight to Sydney, Melbourne, and other parts of the Commonwealth, he could, on this showing, compete favorably with any imported pig-iron. Other witnesses, who, however, had ess experience than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford,</inline> doubted the correctness of his estimate of cost. But, on the supposition of his having made an underestimate, he would still, even without a bonus, be in an excellent position as compared with the, imported commodity. </para>
                        <para>No effort was made to bring forward witnesses against the Bill. Notwithstanding that fact, the evidence given failed to establish a case in its favour. Several witnesses thought the establishment of iron works in the Commonwealth premature, and much of the evidence was strongly against any attempt by the Government to establish the iron industry by the payment of bonuses. </para>

                    <para class="block">I am making these quotations largely for the benefit of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline> who never loses an opportunity of throwing stones at the Labour Party. But he should be careful that in his stone-throwing he does not injure some of his own leaders. The names appended are " W. M.

Our principles in this matter are well known. We believe in the nationalization of monopolies. Some go a little further and say that we de'sire to nationalize all industries. Nothing of the kind. We believe in the nationalization of monopolies, and though there is perhaps one way in which it can be explained ; I am astonished to find a Labour Government introducing a Bill of "this kind. </para>

                            <para>- I am a Scotchman, and I always like, to know where the money is to come from. As representatives of the various States - I shall not mention New South Wales, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> did, I keep that in the background - we are here to conserve the interests of the Commonwealth, and to see that a fair deal is made. Those who are prepared to give away money in this and in similar directions should be prepared, when the time comes, to provide the funds necessary for other purposes. The  President  will not call me to order if incidentally I say that money will be required for the payment of old-age pensions, for defence, and many other purposes. </para>

I have no doubt that the second reading of this Bill will be carried. The Government intend to submit amendments which will overcome some of the difficulties in the' way. I shall support those amendments, but if we should fail to secure an alteration of the measure my conscience will prevent me from supporting it. </para>

I was born with one, and I am cultivating it, and even if differing with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> I should fall under his denunciations that will have no effect whatever upon me. We have to consider a very serious question, and the electors will want to know more about it. I think they will be a little surprised when they read the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> the Minister of Defence, in introducing this Bill. I felt great sympathy for the honorable senator because of the expressions he had to use. But with the honorable senator the task was a duty, and not a pleasure. </para>

In fathering the Bill of another Government, and submitting it for the consideration of the Senate, they have succeeded in cementing almost all the discordant elements, of the Opposition, and bringing them over to their side. </para>

                            <para>- Like other Governments, they have in their weakness accepted a position which seemed to be forced upon them, with a desire to placate the anti-Socialists, and, for once, to accomplish something which, in ordinary circumstances they could never be expected to accomplish, and that is to bring the Millens, the Pulsfords, and the Grays side by side with the Pearces and McGregors to do something in the interests of what? Labour ? Yes. They have endeavoured, in their speeches, to use the argument most recently put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> that if this industry is not given something out of the pockets of the people  600  men will be thrown put of work. I have known industries in this country in which as many thousands of men have been engaged as there are hundreds in this industry, and yet those men have been deliberately thrown out of. work in order that, from a given date, the people employing them might increase the amount of the profits they were receiving. I do not, for a moment, infer that this is the case at Lithgow. But I say, unhesitatingly, that, although we have discussed this question from time to time, we have never yet had any evidence submitted to show that this Parliament would have one iota of justification in passing this Bill. I have heard honorable senators opposite argue that when a question arises affecting a particular State, it is the duty of the representatives of that State especially, to look after the interests of the people of the State. For a considerable time I have been pledged to a platform which has been circulated throughout Australia, and which emphatically declares my opposition to the creation and building up of private monopolies. Upon the present occasion, however, we find a section of the Labour Party, and the whole of the anti-Socialists, banded together for the purpose of assisting an existing monopoly to grow wealthy at the expense of the public. During the whole of the discussion upon this Bill not a tittle of evidence has been adduced to show that if we approve the measure, a monopoly in the iron industry will not exist for the next half century. I question very much whether even at the end of that time there will be the remotest chance of the industry being other than a monopoly. One ironworks in Australia will be sufficient to supply our requirements for the next half century. Consequently, if this Bill came before us in an honest' form it would be entitled "A Bill for an Act to present the sum of ,£30,000 per annum to the proprietors of the Lithgow Ironworks." We are asked to make this annual contribution to a private firm in which we have no proprietary rights whatever. I know that my honorable friends opposite will say that I am an advocate of the rights of the working man. Most decidedly I am, and if I thought for a moment that the employe's in this industry would get anything other than a bare subsistence out of it- </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. In common with other honorable senators, I recognise the grave position which will be created if the 600 employes at Lithgow are thrown out of employment and supplies to their wives and families are thus unceremoniously cut off. But whilst my humanitarian instincts are sufficiently strong to prevent me overlooking that consideration, I cannot forget that I owe a duty to the people of Australia and to my constituents, Having pledged myself time and again not to countenance the establishment of monopolies unless they are nationalized, I feel - that if I voted for this Bill I should be under an obligation to resign my position and to make way for some representative who had a greater regard for his pledges. I frankly admit that there is one column in the papers which have been circulated for the information of honorable senators which I do not understand. It is either incomplete or its arrangement is very complex. From the documents which are before us I gather that in 1908, from January to May inclusive, the firm of G. C. Hoskins and Company supplied the Government of New South Wales with iron at £4 10s. per ton, and that during the whole of these months the prices charged to other consumers that is to good old private- enterprise ranged from £3 4s. 3d. to <inline font-style="italic">£3</inline> 5s. 1 id. per ton. In other words, a difference of 25s. per ton was made in favour of private enterprise. There is no evidence - even in the testimony of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hoskins</inline> himself - to show that the works at Lithgow are other than a one-horse show, and that they will continue to remain so. All that the' Bill asks us to do is to sanction the Commonwealth handing over £30,000 per annum to a private firm in return for the mere knowledge that a certain quantity of iron has been produced. The bounty will amount, approximately, lo £1 per ton. At the end of the period covered by the Bill the iron industry will occupy exactly the same position that it occupies to-day Then those who are interested in it will again be heard clamouring for Parliament to grant another £30,000 per annum to them in order to avert the summary dismissal of their employes and the closing down of their works. </para>

                        <para>- - I admit that this Bill is an attractive one. From one stand-point it is dangerously attractive. If it be represented to us that by the payment of a certain sum by way of bounty we can provide employment under good conditions to a fairly large number of men, we are bound to consider the matter. To that extent the measure attracts me. But, on the other hand, I can see more points against it than I can see in its favour. I recognize that by passing it we are likely to create- a monopoly. </para>

                            <para>- If we authorize the payment of the proposed bounty we shall incur a very great risk of creating a monopoly, which will be of no value whatever to the Commonwealth. It will not be a monopoly which will accomplish anything apart from providing employment for a number of men at a decent rate of wages. Nothing else can be urged in its favour. From another point of view - and one in respect of which I do not expect to get any sympathy from a. good many senators on the other side - this Bill will represent an economic waste. In the first instance it will represent the deliberate expenditure of so much money, and we have not too much of it to spend at the present time. When the bonus system ends it is to be followed by the imposition of a duty, which from my point of view will represent an increased cost to the users of iron.- Feeling as I do that we are going first to waste money by giving a bonus, and, secondly, when the bonus system is ended, if it ever should end, to penalize the users of iron in the Commonwealth, I cannot bring myself to vote for the second reading of the Bill, in spite of the fact that it has, as I have mentioned, one redeeming feature, and that is that it may give employment to a number of men for a. certain time at a good rate of wages. I have said more than once, here and elsewhere, that I prefer the bonus- system to the imposition of duties; for this reason, that the community pays the money and a certain industrial result is secured. But I have always said, and I shall continue to believe, that, on the balance we shall not do much good to the Commonwealth by the artificial creation of industries which in the result will penalize all. users of the articles with which they are dealing. I cannot believe that in this case any result will arise from the operation,, first of the bounty, and next, of the duty, except that it will represent economic waste. For that reason I shall vote against the second reading of the Bill, and oppose its passage in every way I can. I am not going to vote against the second reading for the reason which may induce many honorable senators to do so, and that is in order to nationalize the industry. I am as much against nationalizing the industry as against wasting public money in this way. For the reasons I have given I find myself compelled to vote against every part of the Bill - against nationalization and against the preliminary waste. </para>
