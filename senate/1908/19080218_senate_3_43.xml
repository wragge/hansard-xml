              <para>- There is nothing ambiguous about it at all. The position is this : That all these men, save and except learners, get a higher wage than that stated in the honorable senators question. As regards learners, the position is that they do not usually join at the age of 14, but later - it may be when 19 or 20 years of age, and when they have had a little experience. I am informed that - </para>

            <para>They have but small prospect of advancement, unless they can obtain appointment to positions of greater skill, for which, of course, higher wages are paid. For any vacancies occurring in the latter, they eagerly compete, and the most suitable and meritorious are selected. Now, the Board&#39;s rates provide for lads commencing at 14 years of age, and receiving annual increments until they attain the age of 21 years, when they are paid the minimum wage. The Board&#39;s rates evidently regard it as necessary, although not specifically stating so in every instance, that such classes of employes should have seven years of experience before being paid the minimum wage. But the youths receiving such appointments here are always over 14 years of age, being sometimes 19 and 20. They are usually then transferred to the more technical position at their current wage and receive increments annually. If they are industrious, they sometimes learn their business in less than the seven years, and receive the minimum wage as soon as they are qualified. It is in consequence of this practice, which was adopted at the request of the employes, and has given great satisfaction to them, that there are at the present time a number of cases where employes are receiving less wages than the Board&#39;s determination,when their ages are taken into consideration, but which are, in most cases, higher than the Board&#39;s rates when their years of experience are considered. </para>

              <para>- The Government Printing Office, is becoming a notorious sweating shop. Arising out of the last answer, I desire to ask whether the Government will see that the Factories Acts conditions are observed, or whether they will permit the State Government Printer to ignore those conditions? Are we to understand that men are to be paid according to their experience, irrespective of whether the Factories Acts apply, and that the State Government Printer is to be the sole judge of the wages to which the men are entitled ? </para>

          <para>.- When progress was reported on Friday afternoon, I was pointing out that, in my opinion, the retention of the duty of1d. per lb. on packet tea would not increase the price of tea to the consumer. I shall be asked, &#34; Who will receive the advantage?&#34; The advantage, in my opinion, will go into the pockets of the importer, but even if it did mean some slight increase in price to have the tea packed in Australia, no consistent protectionist can vote for the abolition of the extra1d. per lb. on tea that is brought into Australia packed. </para>

            <para>- This is not a revenue duty at all. I look upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson&#39;s</inline> proposal as one of very great importance, and, coming from a professed protectionist, I am somewhat amazed at it. It is not a matter affecting consumers only. Some interesting evidence on the subject was given before the Tariff Commission. A witness from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson&#39;s</inline> own. State, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKenzie</inline> Murray, representing the firm of W. D. Moore and Company, was examined by the  Chairman.  He desired that the duty on packettea should be 2d. per lb., and gave some of the strongest reasons possible in favour of his suggestion.

        <para class="block">It was shown in evidence that even the labour of one boy who might be employed in the tea packing industry in any part of Australia would cost as much as the wages of ten coolies doing similar work in Ceylon., where coolie labour can be obtained for 2d. and 3d. per day. A boy doing such work in Australia would receive at least 15s. per week. It was also shown in evidence that the wages paid for packing tea in Australia amount to&#163;8,000 or &#163;10,000 a year. The witness to whom I have referred, said that unless the duty which he suggested were agreed to, the probabilities were that Lipton and Company, who carry on business in London, and have estates in Ceylon, would have their teas packed there, dump them into Australia, and sell them in competition with those who have established packing houses in the various States, and who employ white Australian labour. </para>

Lipton and Company, who had commenced business in Australia, and were advertising with a view of obtaining control ofthe Australian market, would offer a competition so dangerous as to be likely to close up the packing houses that had already been established.

            <para>- Even if it be true, as the honorable senator contends, that the retention of the duty of1d. per lb. on packet tea means a slight impost on consumers of tea in Australia, I would remind him that the people are prepared to bear that impost rather than have imported into Australia tea packed in Ceylon by coloured people receiving 3d. per day of ten hours to compete with tea packed in Australia by white labour, working forty-eight hours per week, and receiving reasonable remuneration. The position is very serious, so far as many workers in Australia are concerned. There are at present a number&#39; engaged in making the packets or cartons for the packing trade, while others are employed in making strawboard and timber boxes for it. Then, again, a very large number are employed in printing labels and wrappers, whilst, in addition, there is a large army of men. women, and girls employed in various other ways in the industry. </para>

          <para>In 1904, 2,149,041 lbs. of tea were imported to this State. Of that, at least half is put up in packet form. A large proportion of it, imported from Victoria and South Australia, originally came from Ceylon, but all the Robur tea is packed in Melbourne, and the Amgoorie and  Terai  teas are packed in South Australia. Still, all those teas are packed by our own labour, and the cost of packing represents a good sum paid in wages. That would be about 1,000,000 lbs. in packed teas alone. </para>

            <para>- Yes. He said that the imposition of this duty would mean, in wages. and material, ^8,000 or .&#163;10,000 per annum. The minimum wage in the printing trade here is <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> 16s. per week of forty-eight hours, whereas in Ceylon the rate of pay is about 14s. a week of I do not know how many hours. The coolies who are supposed to do all the hard work  receive  from 2d. to 3d. per day. Those who believe in a white Australia, and in the policy of protection, surely cannot favour the free importation of packet tea put up under the sweated conditions to which I have referred. </para>

A witness residing in Melbourne stated that a duty of Jd. per lb. would cover all the printing and incidental charges of packing. That being so, we are asked to vote this duty, not because of any actual injury to the trade, or because any one can show that injury will be done to the trade if packet tea be allowed to come in free, but because of a fear that at some future time something may happen. </para>

            <para>- Upon that occasion the honorable senator&#39;s White Australia policy was slightly tainted with yellow. In his very heated discourse upon packet teas, he overlooked the fact that all the evidence which he quoted was tendered prior to any duty being levied upon tea. He spoke as&#39; if the witnesses whose testimony he quoted were contending for the retention of something that had previously existed. But he is well aware that all his arguments applied only to a period prior to the imposition of any duty upon tea.Senator Findley stated that Terai and Amgoorie teas are packed in South Australia, and that Robur tea is packed in Melbourne. He thus practically closed his own mouth by producing evidence that all the popular brands of tea used in Australia are packed within the Commonwealth. Surely nobody can urge that he has made out a strong case for the position which he has taken up. Of course I recognise that he is an ardent protectionist, who would go to the extent of protecting black beetles if necessary. But I merely wish to extend protection to industries in a reasonable way, which can be justified. I do not want to blindly protect industries. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has shown conclusively that all the most popular brands of tea are being packed in Australia, and that they were packed here prior to any duty beingoperative </para>

          <para>. - I wish to cool the ardour of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> by assuring him that the great danger which he apprehends is merely a visionary one. The fact of the matter is that packet teas have been made up in Australia for the past twenty years. They have been put up into &#34;blends &#34; by merchants or large wholesale grocers who are desirous of catering to the taste of their particular customers. This has been going on during the past twenty years, and before any duty upon tea was operative. If the present duty upon packet tea is retained, tea will still be made up into packets in Australia, but if packet tea is admitted free, the result will not be anything like so disastrous as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> imagines, and the consumers will obtain their tea at from1/2d. to3/4 d. per lb. cheaper than they can do now. That is why I shall vote for the free admission of packet tea. I shall therefore support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson&#39;s</inline> proposal. </para>

          <para>. - I trust that the Committee will not agree to the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson.</inline> Honorable senators will recollect that the protectionist section of the Tariff Commissionrecommended the imposition of a duty of1d. per lb. upon tea in packets not exceeding 10 lbs. in weight, whilst in respect of other tea they recommended its admission free. Now it has been found from experience that teas for the retail trade are made up in packets of 20 lbs. and under, and accordingly the proposal of the Government is that tea made up in packets not exceeding 20 lbs. in weight, shall be dutiable at1d. per lb. I think it is advisable that we should discriminate between tea imported in bulk and tea imported in packets. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> seemed to assume that the great bulk of packet tea sold in Australia is packed here. I am not speaking of packets made up to the order of the individual customer at grocers&#39; counters, but of the tea that is packed, and passed from one trader to another before it reaches the consumer. No separate record is kept of the importations of tea in bulk and in packets, but about one-tenth of the total quantity imported is believed to come in in packets. The importation of tea last year amounted to 29,478,614 lbs. It has been a steadily increasing quantity since 1903, when it was over 24,000,000 lbs. In 1904 and 1905.it was 28,000,000 odd lbs. Roughly speaking, we import about 30,000,000 lbs. of tea per annum, of which the Customs authorities estimate that 3,000,000 lbs. comes in in packets of less than 20 lbs. weight. Some advantage&#39; will be gained if we can cause tea to be imported in bulk, and induce our own people to pack it for distribution. There are various industries associated with the packing, such as the box, packet, and tin caddy making, and the printing. Surely it is not asking too much that id. a lb. should be levied on tea imported in packets - a rate that would return a revenue of about &#163;12,000 or &#163;13,000 a year. I hope that honorable senators will support the item as it stands, I trust, also, that they will not yield to the demand of a strong supporter of the duty that it should be increased to 2d. </para>

          <para>. - I well remember when this matter was under discussion before the Tariff Commission. After the evidence had been taken, the. members of the protectionist section were unanimous that there was a great deal of truth in the allegations that in &#39; the near future tea packing would be done much more extensively abroad than in Australia, unless action were taken by Parliament. Not only did we have the evidence to guide us in that connexion, but at that time caravans were travelling about the streets of Melbourne advertising Lipton&#39;s Tea, with blackfellows upon them, and showing the work being done in Ceylon. With indications of that description before us, we certainly had reason for concluding that something must be done in the near future to prevent the tea-packing industry growing in another country and diminishing in our own. It is very unfair of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson,</inline> in dealing with a question of this kind, to be influenced by votes given upon another question. </para>

            <para>- I am willing to do the same. We allow them to grow the tea and send it to us. If honorable senators had any knowledge of the customs and methods of coloured people in other countries in packing tea, and in many other industries, they would not be so anxious to encourage that kind of thing. Tea in bulk can be  more closely examined at the Customs than can tea in packets. In that way we can protect ourselves from adulteration&#39; and other evils much more easily than in the case of tea imported in small packets. The protectionist section of the Commission, in deciding to recommend the promotion of the tea-packing industry here, had in mind everything that has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> and the Minister of Home Affairs. It means, not only the putting of the tea into the packets, but also the making of those packets, whether they are of paper, wood, or tin, the printing of the labels, and all the other work incidental to the industry. Taking into consideration what the Minister has said on the authority of the Customs officers, we must recognise that the tea-packing industry means something substantial to the Australian workers, of whom we should think. </para>

            <para>- If the honorable senator would listen, he would know my views. I am speaking of the attitude of the <inline font-style="italic">Register,</inline> and the &#34;class which the honorable senator so ably represents. I am not in favour of an increase of the duty, and will give my reasons. In South Australia there is a ring controlling the tea business, formed by a number of importers,  who, I suppose, are the friends of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and his party. The storekeepers can get tea for 8d. or9d. per lb., which they must sell to the customer at a price, not under1s. 3d., or otherwise they need not appeal to the same importer for supplies in the future. In order to prevent any roguery - because there is a lot of cheating in connexion with this trade, I shall vote for the duty as it stands.I am not sure that the tea imported would not be just as pure if it were fixed up in packets elsewhere; but, as a protectionist, I shall, as I say, support the duty. I should like, however, if it were possible to vote straight out , for free tea. There is an impression abroad that tea does pay duty ; and, in this connexion, a number of storekeepers take advantage of the. ignorance of the people. I should be glad if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> or any other honorable senator, would suggest how we could get over the difficulty I have indicated. I do not see why importers should stipulate that the storekeepers shall charge the consumer a definite price. I regret exceedingly that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> should take the stand he does, because it appears to me to represent protection run mad. The honorable senator seems to be suspicious that those who will not go the same length to which he himself goes are not true to the cause. The honorable senator lives in Melbourne, and, no doubt, is to some extent, as we all axe, including <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> in regard to his State influenced by that fact. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> lived in Victoria or South Australia he would take a somewhat different view. It seems wonderful how inconsistent honorable senators can be when the interests of their States are affected. Even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> rather than vote with his free-trade friends, went beyond the bar when a question affecting South Australian interests - the duty on salt - was before the Committee; I shall vote for the duty as it stands, and, rather than support an increase, I would desire to see tea entirely free. </para>

          <para>. - I cannot say that; I support this proposal with as much enthusiasm as I have done other items. But we are face to face with the alternative of giving employment to our own people in the printing of labels and the packing of tea, or employing Cingalese and Chinamen. At present we cannot grow tea in Australia; but we can, at least, provide that tea for transport throughout the Commonwealth shall be prepared and packed by Australians. There is one point about the present proposal that I do not like; and I shall endeavour by amendment to remove the objection. The proposal, as it stands, exempts people who are wealthy enough to purchasea 20-lb. packet from the incidence of the duty ; and I do not regard that as just, seeing that these 20- lb. packets are prepared in Ceylon by the cheapest labour obtainable. </para>

            <para>- It is <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> tax on tea - and we are not disguising the fact - for the purpose of providing employment for our own people. I think it is worth while taxing tea, when there is a prospect of providing the labour in Australia, and I make my . proposal on no other grounds. As the proposal stands at present, an unnecessary distinction is drawn between the man who can order 20 lbs. of tea at a time, and the man who requires only 1 lb. </para>

          <para>. - Whether we impose a tax on packet tea or not, bulk tea will come in free as hitherto, and, therefore, I cannot see how this proposal can be described as a tax on tea. It is rather a tax on the packing or making up of tea after it is brought here. As it is designed for the benefit of white labour, I, as a protectionist, intend to support the duty as it stands. At the same time, if it partook of the character of a revenue duty or a tax on an article which could not be produced in the country, though I have contended that we could produce tea quite as successfully as coffee- </para>

            <para>- Yes; and there is equally little hope for the tea industry. I would not support this item, if it were in the nature of a revenue duty, because the Senate has already dealt with the question of taxing tea for a much more laudable purpose, and that was to establish a system of old-age pensions. I cannot understand the attitude of some honorable senators on the other side, who intend to support this item, because tea is packed in India by coloured or cheap labour, when I recollect they have already levied a tax on a very necessary article of food. The consumers of bananas, who are principally white people, are taxed for the upkeep of Chinamen, and I am sorry to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> was one of those who imposed that tax. </para>

In my opinion, a duty of1d. per lb. is ample protection to give for the packing of tea. I agree with the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> to increase the size of the package. It would be a mistake to tax the smaller packages, and to allow the larger packages to come in free. I believe that a better quality of tea will be secured if we increase the size of the packet. </para>

            <para>- I know that we have been importing tea in small packages. We ought to do what work is necessary for the distribution of the raw material, and that is all which this proposal is designed to achieve. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> is wrong in describing it as a tea tax. Itis a tax on packed tea, and, therefore, I differ from him in the proposal to increase the size of the package. We must allow a certain amount of convenience to the persons who are sending the. product backwards and forwards, and I think it will be found that a 20-lb. package is more than is usually purchased by persons who live in the centres of population. </para>

            <para>- I think that -the honorable, senator will scarcely find a house in Toorak which buys more than  5  or10 lbs. at a time. A sensible housewife does not like a large package, because when itis opened the tea loses its aroma. I think it may safely be said that the limitation of the package to  20  lbs. will accomplish what we desire, and will not hamper or oppress our own people. To make the size of the packet larger would prevent the exchange of this product by sea. I urge upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> that this is a protectionist and not a revenue duty. It is designed to achieve the local performance of a large amount of work which in some instances is now performed abroad, and which in many more instances in the future will be performed abroad if the duty be not imposed. I firmly urge that particular aspect of the case upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> in order that we may carry this proposal, and have a very interesting and profitable work done in the country. We are looking out for work forour young people. </para>

          <para>. - My principal objection to this duty is that it will have to be paid chiefly by people who live in the bush, and who buy their tea, not in&#189;-lb. or1-lb. packets, but in packages of from  5  to  50  lbs. in weight. I do not believe that the industry of packing tea, if it can&#39; be called an industry, is worth establishing. If we cannot do better for our young people than to make them packers of tea the sooner we abandon our policy of protection the better. I could find a dozen more profitable ways of employing our people. </para>

But the burden of its establishment would have to be borne by one section of the community, the people who live out in the bush, and who cannot, rush to an adjacent store, and buy the tea they require in&#189;-lb. or  1  -lb. packages. To speak of the packing of  100,000  lbs. or  1,000,000  lbs. of tea per annum as an industry, is ridiculous ; but even if it were worthy of the name it would, under the present proposal, have to be maintained at the cost of people who live in the bush, and I should like to know why we should add to their present burdens. </para>

No doubt it could, but at a cost so great that, it would not be worth our while to tryto cultivate it here. We import our tea, and it is grown by coloured labour. When we have no objection to drinking tea grown by coloured labour, how can it be such a deadly sin to consent to its being packed by coloured labour? </para>

          <para>.-I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has placed himself in a very paradoxical position. If there was one member of the Senate who, in my opinion, was, year in and year out, consistent in his advocacy of the principle of protection, it was the honorable senator. Now, apparently, when he finds that the adoption of that principle may result in a slightly increased cost to the consumer in any part of Australia, he must re-consider his position, and become a free-trader in regard to the tea-packing industry. Does the honorable senator really suppose that the people in the bush would get their tea any cheaper if this duty were not imposed? They do not at the present time obtain their tea direct from Ceylon, but from the nearest storekeeper, warehouseman, or agent, and they will have to pay the same price for the tea they consume whether it is packed in Australia or abroad. I do not suppose that the planters of Ceylon would deal with individual consumers of tea in Australia. Their business is carried on in a large way with merchants. I read some evidence to show that the packing of tea in Australia involves the payment of from &#163;8,000 to&#163;10,000 a year in wages to tea blenders, packers, tinsmiths, and printers. </para>

            <para>- It would. These men complain that if the duty were not imposed the probabilities are that Lipton, who is one of the biggest dealers in tea in the world, would do all his business from Ceylon, and, being able to undersell the established firms in Australia, would become a monopolist in this line, and have command of the market. Honorable senators smile at that statement, because they will probably say, &#34; Many people, many palates.&#34; In connexion with tobacco, we know that although in that case also tastes differ, the industry has become a monopoly, and, according to sworn evidence, the major portion of the business is in the hands of the monopolists. We have been told that there are well-known brands of tea which are packed in Australia. These become popular as a result of extensive advertising, and, to some extent, because of their quality. But a brand of tea that is popular to-day may be driven practically out of the market tomorrow. A brand of tea which is being extensively sold to-day may within a short time be superseded by another brand put on the market by Lipton. </para>

          <para>. - I have always been opposed to a tax on tea, for reasons which I have already stated in this Chamber; but I regard the proposed duty as a tax on packets, not on the tea contained in them, and am of opinion that it will not increase the price which will have to be paid for tea by those in the back-blocks, about whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is so anxious. In Western Australia, tea is largely used by the workers in the bush, but I do not think that they would oppose the proposal to put a duty on packet tea, the effect of which would be to give employment to men in Australia in the packing of tea, and to others engaged in paper-making, printing, labelling, and other industries. The Customs returns do not furnish us with information as to the quantity of tea imported in packets, and, therefore, we are not in a position to say whatrevenue the proposed duty would return. </para>

          <para>. - We have had some very entertaining speeches on this question, and, according to the arguments of some honorable senators, if the conundrum, were put to the Committee - &#34; When is a tax not a tax?&#34; - the reply given would be, &#34; When it. is on tea.&#34; I am not convinced, however, that the proposed duty will not be a tax on tea, and, in my opinion, tea should be admitted duty free. Australians consume moretea per head of population than any other people in the world, it being regarded here as both a necessary and a luxury. Probably the tea-drinking habit has much to do with the temperance of our people, tea taking the place of other stimulants. The Government do not need extra revenue, and therefore the duty is not justifiable as a revenue duty, while it is altogether objectionable to tax such an article of drink. </para>

            <para>- The contractor generally buys from the homestead store. The proprietors of the big stations will not be taxed, because they buy tea by the halfchest or the chest; but the small farmer who grows, perhaps, 200 acres of wheat, buys only a 10-lb. caddie. If the Committee desires to deal fairly with those in the country, it will agree tomy request. Further, if there is a desire to give a preference to anybody, it should be given to the small man as against the larger one. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch&#39;s</inline> argument was to the effect that we should impose a tax on all tea, because the great bulk of it is imported in large packages. </para>

            <para>- It is imported in smaller quantities. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> wants tea to be taxable when it is imported in quantities of less than 100 lbs., which means a tax on all tea. As the Committee has already decided that there should be a duty of some kind on packet tea, I am not arguing against that. All that I argue is that we should levy the duty in such a way that we shall not unfairly place a tax on the greater portion of the country residents who are the very class that all of us, by our voices at any rate, appear to desire to encourage. </para>

            <para>- I think that the largest portion is put up in1-Ib. and&#189;-lb. packages. I cannot see, from a protectionist stand-point, what is to be gained by increasing the weight of packages, unless it is desired to derive revenue from tea. Of course, if we want to impose a tax upon tea I am quite ready to do so. I think it was a mistake ever to remove the tea duty. But let us impose the tax openly. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> called attention to the fact that this duty of1d. per lb. is really upon the package. I have tried to ascertain what weight of paper is contained in a1-lb. packet of tea, because that would really be the amount of protection extended to the packing industry. I do not know what the weight is exactly, but at all events the duty on the packing paper would amount to a very substantial protection indeed. Therefore I cannot see that there is any necessity for a large limit. </para>

          <para>. - The proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> simply means that the provision in the Tariff regarding taxing packet tea would be used as an engine to make the poorer classes of the community bear the burden of the packing industry. Reducing the weight of packages to 10 lbs. means, if it means anything at all, that all the consumers in the community who cannot afford to pay for an ounce of tea more than 10 lbs. at a time, will have to sustain the packing industry. Our, poorer citizens are unfortunately in a great majority, and they usually buy a pound or half a pound of tea at a time. I hope the Committee will not be led away by the fallacy that has been put forward, because it simply means making a most mischievous difference between purchasers. </para>

          <para>. -I have tried to follow the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> but can make nothing of it. He voted to impose a duty on tea, and now, because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> proposes to reduce the size of the packets which will be taxable, from 20 to 10 lbs., he objects. Of course, people in towns usually buy their tea weighed on the scale by the storekeeper, and done up in packets by him. They will escape duty altogether. But there are hundreds of settlers who only come into a town once a month or once in two months, and buy enough tea to keep them going until they come to town again. The tea which they buy is usually done up in 10 or 5-lb. boxes. It is imported like that. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> contends, and I agree with him, that we should give such a purchaser the same advantages as we give to the men in towns, who buy their tea in small quantities direct from the grocer. I do not think that that is an unreasonable thing to ask. </para>

            <para>- What occurs to me is that the original purpose in making tea duty free was to give the poorer classes a chance of getting their tea cheaply. But why should not the poor man in the bush be able to get his 5 or  10-lb.  package as cheaply as the poor man in the town, who buys his tea in a1-lb. or&#189;-lb. package? A  10-lb.  tin is a package in the ordinary sense of the word. It cannot be said that any great industry is affected by dividing a  40-lb.  chest of tea into four  10-lb.  chests or packages. I therefore move - </para>

            <para>- I thought that the attitude assumed by the honorable senator was that I should not address myself to the question of postponement; that the items I have mentioned should be at once postponed, and that I should proceed immediately to discuss item 123. That would prevent my making the observations I wish to offer regarding the intervening items, which are closely related. I desire, first of all, to deal with the division as a business man, and may say at once that it is somewhat difficult to discuss it from the various stand-points from which we ought to consider it. I am a moderate protectionist. Whilst I do not believe in extravagant protection, I certainly favour such protection as is calculated to give fair play to Australian workers, and to take into account Australian conditions. </para>

            <para>- So far as the principle of protection is concerned, I am not in opposition to them. I have already explained that point to my new colleagues. I have come over here, just as other protectionists associated with the Opposition have done, with an absolutely free hand in regard to fiscal matters. As a protectionist I am desirous of securing consistent protection. I do not wish to see some petty industry granted extreme protection, whilst other industries which, according to figures that I can produce, are highly important receive only a small modicum of assistance. Then, as a business man, I desire to remove anomalies with a view to simplifying the Tariff in the interests alike of the mercantile community and of the Customs Department. I cannot forget that I represent a, State which, is not blessed with a very large surplus revenue, and which is called upon to bear a larger amount of direct taxation than is any other State. </para>

            <para>- I would point out how extremely inconvenient it would be, if. under a motion for the postponement of an item or a number of items, an honorable senator were allowed to wander all over the Tariff. Such a course would have the effect of entirely defeating my ruling. It will be . recollected &#39; that at the outset I stated that, with the assistance of the Committee, I would endeavour to confine the discussion to the particular item before the Chair. I must therefore ask the honorable senator to discuss item 106. </para>

I think that such a proposal is a reasonable one, because, after the duty has been fixed upon item 123, which constitutes the raw material of the other items, we shall be in a better position to deal with the taxation that should be levied upon apparel made up from that raw material.

          <para>. - May I explain to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> that, as originally introduced, the schedule contained a proposal for a rebate of duty upon certain raw materials. The proposal was that duty should be rebated to the extent of three-fourths where the raw material was used for the purpose of making waterproof clothing. But the House of Representatives saw fit to strike out that proposal. Many weeks elapsed between the date of the proposals and the consideration of this item in that Chamber, and, in the meantime, the rebate was made in terms&#39; of the original proposal. When ultimately the proposal was struck out by the other Chamber, the position was that certain persons had been allowed rebate, whilst others had not. It will thus be necessary to re-insert the schedule for the purpose of enabling payment to be made to those persons who did not receive the rebate between the date upon which the Tariff was introduced and that upon which the proviso was eliminated by the House of Representatives. To do justice to all, it will be necessary to preserve the schedule. </para>

Here we have a distinct reference to a schedule which does not exist, but which has to be manufactured hereafter. I ask your ruling, sir, as to whether we can pass an item subject to a schedule of which we know nothing, and of whose terms we have not the faintest idea. I have no desire to createdifficulties, but merely wish to put things in order. I suggest that the Vice-President of the Executive Council should move to omit the reference to a schedule which does not exist, and re-introduce it at a later stage.&#34; Certainly he should not ask us to do something which we are clearly incapable of doing. At least, the course which he proposes is more than inconvenient, and is most unusual. I do not think that such a proposition was ever heard of before. We might just as reasonably be asked to agree to clauses in a Bill which is not before us. This schedule is practically a clause of a Bill, and it is not before us. </para>

Another place struck this schedule out, and therefore it does not appear in the Bill now before the Committee, butI explained that I propose to ask for its reinsertion in order to permit of the rebate of duty being paid to a few persons on the same lines as it was paid to others during the period intervening between the introduction of the schedule in another place and the date on which it was struck out. I shall circulate the amendment before the consideration of this schedule is completed. </para>

The proposed duty is an enormous advance on a large item, and will strike very heavily at the consumer.

        <para class="block">It is true that the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended 30 per cent., but the free-trade section, as it is called, recommended 10 per cent. The mean between theto would be 20 per cent. I am proposing 5 per cent. above the mean, so thatI cannot be accusedof advocating an unduly low rate. I hope my motion will receive the very careful consideration and afterwards the support of the Committee. </para>

The duties on rubbered cloth used to make the same kind of rug in Australia are 30 per cent. (General Tariff) and 25 per cent. (United Kingdom), so thatthere is a higher duty upon the raw material than upon the manufactured article. </para>

Here is another model of a buggy rug,  which in its finished state is admitted at duties of  25  per cent (General Tariff) and  20  per cent. (United Kingdom). On the piece goods of the same material for making up here the duties are  30  per cent. (General Tariff) and  25  per cent. (United Kingdom).

(United Kingdom). The duties on apparel are  40  per cent. (General Tariff) and  35  per cent. (United Kingdom). The duties on cotton rubbered waterproof apparel are  35  percent. (General Tariff) and  30  per cent. (United Kingdom), while under this item the duties on cotton rubbered waterproof cloth are  30  per cent. (General Tariff) and  25  per cent. (United Kingdom). I could go on enumerating anomalies in the duties  on  the manufactured article and on what is considered by the people interested in this industry to be their raw material. </para>

            <para>- By the new paragraph  g  which I shall propose the duties on rubbered waterproof cloth, woollen or containing wool, will be made  35  per cent, under the General&#39; Tariff and  30  per cent, against the United Kingdom. That will mean - an additional protection so far as the industry of waterproofing woollens is concerned. On rubbered waterproof cloth, silk or containing silk, but not containing wool, I propose to leave the duties at the same rate as under paragraph  a  of this item, while on waterproof cloth n.e.i., I desire, the duties to be reduced to  20  per cent. (General Tariff) and  15  per cent. (United Kingdom). As paragraph  a  now stands, it subjects all kinds of rubbered waterproof cloth to duties of  30  per cent. (General Tariff) and  25  per cent. (United Kingdom). Only in the case of rubbered cloth, woollen or containing wool, do I propose to increase the duties. The manufacturers of rubbered cloth desire a certain amount of protection. Some of them are engaged very extensively in the industry. I believe the Dunlop people employ a considerable number of hands, and have spent large sums on machinery. They and others rightly claim the same measure of protection as has been extended to other industries. </para>

            <para>- Will the honorable senator content himself with minding his own business, and not mine? The Government originally proposed to allow a rebate of three-quarters of the duty charged on piece goods to be manufactured into rubbered material. Under paragraph  a  of this item, piece goods, woollen or containing wool, n.e.i., and rubbered waterproof cloth of any material, are dutiable at  30  per cent, and  25  per cent. Consequently, the maker of rubbered waterproof cloth of woollen material gets, no protection, practically. Under item  106,  apparel and attire - woollen or silk, or containing wool or silk - is dutiable at  40  per cent. (General Tariff) and  35  per cent. (United Kingdom), while under item  107  apparel and attire n.e.i. for the human body, made of any material not containing wool or silk, is dutiable at  35  per cent. (General Tariff) and  30  per cent. (United Kingdom). It is sought to have a reduction of the duty, so far as waterproofed cotton goods are concerned, because, according to item  107,  under which the apparel made from these is included, they are dutiable at  35  and  30  per cent. The proposal now in regard to goods of silk, or containing silk, but not containing wool, is that the duties shall be  30  and  25  per cent., and that waterproofed cloth, n.e.i. shall bear duties of  20  and  15  per cent. That was &#34;the point on which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> was pilloried, and which he &#34;had overlooked for a moment. Let me explain that the original intention of the Government was to protect this particular industry, but, by reason of the alteration made elsewhere, no protection was given, because, as I have explained, rubbered waterproof cloth of any material, which is the raw material of the apparel industry, bears a duty of  30  and  25  per cent. When we turn to item  107  we see. that apparel and attire as against the United Kingdom bear a duty of only  30  per cent., with the result that there is no protection whatever afforded to the industry. </para>

            <para>- I hope my friend will follow me. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> proposes to strike out the words &#34; and rubbered waterproof cloth of any material,&#34; he does so with the object of giving protection to this industry. The honorable senator&#39;s proposal isto increase the duty to  35  and  30  per cent. on rubbered waterproof cloth of wool or containing wool , it being borne in mind that this will give a protection of only  5  per cent. In regard to waterproofed piece goods of silk, or containing silk, the idea is to have a duty of  30  and  25  per cent., which is the same as the old proposal, but, at the same time, gives a proper protection. Then, thirdly, on waterproofed piece goods n.e.i. - principally cottons - the proposed duty is  20  and  15  per cent. Honorable senators will bear in mind that there are practically three persons to be considered. There is first the manufacturer of the piece goods, who, according to item  123,  is given a. protection of  30  and  25  per cent., and, when the raw material is made up into waterproof fabric, there is a protection of only  5  per cent. as regards the woollens. The next person to be considered is the manufacturerwho makes this waterproof from wool and cotton, and the third is the manufacturer of the apparel from the waterproof material. As i have already pointed out, in the case of the first mentioned there is a duty of only  25  per cent. </para>

            <para>- Without this amendment the position is that waterproofed woollens come under  123  a at the same rate as the raw material therefor, namely, woollen piece goods. There is conse quently no protection to the proofing industry. The amendment provides a  5  per cent. protective margin. It also increases the protective margin on apparel made from waterproof cottons by reducing the rate on the piece goods. </para>

If we are entitled to call a buggy rug an article of human attire, we are equally entitled as suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> to so describe an ordinary door mat. If the Minister has not made a mistake then I say that the method of the Customs officials in keeping from Parliament information we ought to have does not commend itself to me, nor, I think, to the Committee. Whatever the -rate of duty may be, we ought to know exactly the articles on which the duty is imposed. </para>

        <para class="block">Tariff gives to rugs, and now the Minister refers me to item 114, where I find that the protection is 10 per cent. It was not right, if the Minister will allow me to say so, for him to point out that only 5 per cent, protection was given when on an enormous proportion of the articles to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> referred the lowest margin is 10 per cent. The present proposal is to give a protection of 100 per cent, more than that of the Tariff before us. The duty n.e.i. is 20 per cent, and 15 per cent., and I take it that this means cotton goods, seeing that woollen and silk goods are specially provided for. Seeing that the duty on these rugs, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> is to remain at 35 and 30 per cent., and that he proposes to let the raw material, when not containing wool or silk, in at 20 and 15 per cent., he is giving the difference between those two duties. lt is idle for the Minister to talk of 5 per cent., when, in some instances,&#39; the duty amounts to 10 per cent., and in others to 15 per cent. Whatever the measure of protection, it should be clearly understood that 5 per cent, does not represent the solid facts of the case. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley&#39;s</inline> amendment be carried, there will be, in some cases, 10 per cent., and in others 15 per cent, margin; in other words, he proposes to double the measure of protection. </para>

If, for the reason alleged, the manufacturer of waterproof goods has not a sufficient measure of protection, then we ought to take the step I have suggested. Hitherto protectionists have tumbled over themselves in order to assure us that the imposition of a duty cheapens the cost of the article, and, if the manufacturers are getting the benefit of cheapness thus induced, what injustice do they suffer as compared with the importer of the manufactured article? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> when this question was put to him, saw the advisability of smiling it off. </para>

            <para>- No doubt a manufacturer desires as much as he can get. But we must distribute these duties with some regard to fixed principles. If it be claimed that duties have a tendency to lessen cost, then the manufacturer has no grievance, because he is getting his raw material more cheaply by reason of the duties which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> and his friends have succeeded in imposing. I know that protectionists believe that the imposition of a duty on an article has the effect of reducing its price. </para>

The point on which I desire to lay stress is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> is seeking to raise duties. I notice that he shakes his head. I think it is necessary that we should know what&#39; he does propose. It is quite obvious that, with the object of removing an anomaly, he is seeking to enlist the sympathies of those who, like myself, might be with him on that point. But at the same time he is trying to secure votes to get higher protection than the Tariff already conveys. </para>

          <para>.- It is true that my request at first sight suggested an increase in the duty on perhaps two items, but that is. not so. Let.me take the position as it stands now. On rubbered waterproof cloth made pf any marterial the duty is 30 per cent, in the general Tariff and 25 per cent, in the preferential Tariff. My request, if adopted, will make the duty on waterproof cloth 5 per cent, higher. On silk goods the duty will be exactly the same; but on cotton goods it will be very much lower, because if honorable senators will refer to item 123 they will find that cotton is free when imported from the United Kingdom and liable to a duty of 5 per cent, when imported from other countries. My request involves an increase of the duty on woollen goods because we produce wool, but it means a very considerable decrease in the duty on cotton goods. If my request be adopted the duty on woollens before proofing will be 30 and 25 per cent. ; and when proofed 35 and 30 per cent. The duty on silks before proofing will be 20 and 15 per cent., and when proofed 30 and 25 per cent. The duty on cottons before proofing will be 5 per cent, and free, and when proofed 20 and 15 per cent. I feel that the claims of those on whose behalf this request - is submitted are so reasonable that it will receive the support of the majority of honorable senators. </para>

Throughout Australia, a waterproof coat is. an article of necessity, in many cases it is a very great necessity. There is already a very high duty on this material, and there&#39; is a much higher duty on. the manufactured article. I do not see why we should attempt to make any alteration. </para>

          <para>.- There still seems to be some confusion as to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley&#39;s</inline> request. I want to point out two features. In one case, it provides for a protection of 5 per cent, to the manufacture of waterproofs, and in the case of cottons it proposes a very substantial reduction, that is from 30 and 25 per cent, to 20 and 15 per cent. I wish &#39;honorable senators to distinguish between waterproof clothing and rugs, -as they come in under different headings. On waterproof cloth made up from piece goods the duty, according to the schedule, is 35 and 30 per cent. </para>

            <para>- That is so.; but I am dealing with a particular proposal. The difficulty is that the importer of waterproof cloth from the United Kingdom, has, under paragraph a, to pay 25 per cent. duty, and if he proposes to rubberize woollen materials, he must pay the same rate of duty on the raw material he imports for the purpose. </para>

            <para>- No ; the whole object of the proposal is to protect the man who rubberizes woollen material, and a protection of only 5 per cent. is proposed. That would take this material out of the class of goods to which it properly belongs. All materials made waterproof here should be treated on the same basis. I can understand the local manufacturer who rubberizes cotton cloth being given an ample protection of 25 per cent. against the importer of waterproof cotton material, because he is enabled to get his raw material in free. This is only one of the anomalies with which this portion of the Tariff bristles. </para>

          <para>. - If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> desires merely to remove an anomaly, he can attain his object by striking out the words &#34; and rubbered waterproof cloth of any material,&#34; without proposing any subsequent additions to the item. I can see that&#39; there is an. anomaly in the fact that all rubbered waterproof cloth, irrespective of the  material for which it is manufactured, is grouped under one heading, whilst in the case of all other manufactures of cloth a division is made under the headings of different piece goods, that is, woollen, silk, and cotton. I think that a similar division might reasonably be followed in dealing with waterproof cloth. The Vice-President of the Executive Council was able to show that there was no difference between the duty on piece goods and the duty under item 107 by adopting the extraordinary course of taking the general Tariff of 30 per cent. in one case and comparing it with the preferential Tariff in the other. </para>

            <para>- Does the honorable senator mean to say that the piece goods come from the United Kingdom, and the manufactured goods from some other country ? We know that in both cases the imports come from the United Kingdom, and it is therefore misleading to compare the general Tariff in one case with the preferential Tariff in the other. If my suggestion, that rubbered waterproof cloth should be divided, and included under the separate headings ofwoollen, silk, and cotton goods, as are all other manufactures of cloth, were adopted, it would follow that, instead of there being a difference of 5 per cent, in some cases there would be the same measure of difference between piece goods employed for this purpose, and the manufactured article, as there is in the case of every other article of apparel and attire. I see no reason why we should depart from that principle in the case of these goods, unless, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> has suggested, we desire to give some special protection to the man engaged in rubberising imported material. </para>

I have not, however, proposed a reduction to 20 per cent., because, in view of the constitution of the Committee, I do not think that I could carry such a proposal ; I, therefore, ask for a reduction of only 5 per cent. Fifteen or twenty years ago there was in Victoria a great struggle between the makers and the users of woollens, between the tweed-spinning trades and the clothing trade. Deputation after deputation waited on the Minister, those on one side pointing out that the spinning industry could not continue to carry on unless the duty on piece goods was raised, and those on the other declaring that the manufacture of clothing would be impossible if there were, an increase of duty, because importers would be able to compete successfully against the local clothing firms. I forget exactly how the difficulty was settled, but the facts afforded an objectlesson which I shall not readily forget. </para>

          <para>- I was not aware that that firm manufactured clothing; the firms which I have in my mind were firms whose whole business was the making up of clothing. The clearest evidence was given that an undue increase in the duty on piece goods would seriously interfere with the local manufacture of clothing, and throw out of employment the troops of seamstresses and others engaged in it. The Ministry now in power is at the head of the political party which introduced the Tariff of 1902. That Tariff provided that liquor of proof strength should be dutiable at the same rate if imported in bulk as liquor imported in bottles broken down by the admixture of one-sixth of water, the object being to give work to the Australian bottling trade. That provision remains in the present Tariff. Now, if it be desirable to encourage the local bottling trade, it is undesirable to crush the local clothing trade, which employs an immense number of hands, not only in Melbourne, but also in Sydney and in the other capitals. I ask, then, for a reduction of 5 . per cent, on the duty on piece goods ; an exceedingly moderate proposal, which I hope will commend itself to the Committee.  </para>

          <para>. - The item is one of the most important in the Tarill It is true that under the Tariff of 1902 piece goods were dutiable at 15 per cent., but the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 30 percent. The rates now provided for are a considerable reduction upon the original proposals of the Government, while the&#39; duty on imports from the United Kingdom is -5 per cent, less than was recommended by the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission. The object of the duty is to thoroughly establish the woollen industries of the- Commonwealth. Although&#39; they nave, assumed substantial proportions, they are not yet so large- as we hope they will become. In New South Wales there are five woollen and tweed mills, employing&#39; 338 hands; in Victoria nine, employing 1,434&#39; hands; in Queensland one, employing 117 hands; in South Australia two, employing 155 hands; and in Tasmania four, employing 274 hands. I have no information about Western Australia. These establishments are capable of enormous development. We hope that ultimately none of the wool produced in Australia will leave the Commonwealth as raw material, but that the whole of our exportation will be of textiles and fabrics. In 1906 Australia produced 552,156,737 lbs. of wool, of which 7,249,151 lbs. were used locally, and about 545,000,000 lbs. exported, much of the wool so exported coming back to us as textiles or fabrics ; surely an anomalous state of affairs. We hope, by substantial encouragement to the woollen industry, to increase the local production of textiles and fabrics, so that ultimately we shall have none but the manufactured article to export. </para>

            <para>- My honorable, friend must not do himself an injustice. If it is a fact that the manufacturers say so, when they get an assurance of substantial protection, not only will they immediately increase their plant, but they will at once found additional industries. The present manufacturers will at once establish additional woollen machinery, in order to supply the increased demand. It is to facilitate that process that the increased duty is proposed. I take this opportunity of making a few preliminary remarks with regard to woollen goods, trusting that honorable senators will see their way, not under any circumstances, to request any reduction so far as item 123 is concerned. </para>

          <para>. - I shall support the proposed reduction, but not on the grounds that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has advanced in proposing it. I shall do so in the interests of what I consider to be consistent protection. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has reminded the Committee of the great importance of the woollen industry, and rightly so in my opinion. The woollen industry is already a large one, and I quite agree with my honorable friend that it is capable of exceedingly great expansion. We can make a great deal more woollen fabrics than we now make, and in greater variety. But I do not think that we shall, in our generation, or within the next 100 years, be able to make all the woollen goods we require. I mean that we shall not be able to make them economically.; physically, we can make anything whatever. I absolutely deny that we shall be able to meet all our requirements in this direction. Therefore, we have to consider an item of this kind from two or three stand-points. Those who desire to see protection maintained - and most of us in the Senate, and in the other Chamber, do so desire - but who do not want to see it exaggerated, wish to afford opportunities for the encouragement of local manufactures. But we have also to bear in mind that even ifwe raise the duty to 100 per cent., the local manufacturers will not be able now, or in the immediate future, to provide us with what we want, because our own tastes would not accept what they would make. Just as in regard to women&#39;s fabrics, we go to. all the markets of Europe to supply us with the varieties of dress stuffs that we require, so it is in regard to woollen piece goods. No matter what duty we impose, there will be certain materials and patterns which are not locally manufactured. </para>

            <para>- I quite agree with giving our own people fair play. I agree that we should take Australian conditions into account. But what are Australian conditions? We like to see our people living decently and earning good wages. That is why we offer the manufacturers of these commodities fair protection. But we must bear in mind, in dealing with this or any other industry, that the manufacturers of woollen goods are in exceedingly advantageous circumstances. They have not to pay heavy freight on their raw material, and freight to English and foreign manufacturers amounts to a very expensive item in the course of a year. Further, our manufacturers have a fair amount of labour at their disposal, and are able to obtain machinery as good as is used anywhere in the world. But, nevertheless, there are only certain kinds of woollen material that for many years to come Australia will be capable of manufacturing. </para>

            <para>- Because we have not got a sufficiently large market. Our market is limited to supplying the wants of 4,000,000 people residing on this Continent, in which there is every variety of climate, from the tropical of the north down to the very cool temperate climate of the south. We cannot possibly for centuries to come hope to be in a position to supply the people of this continent with every variety of woollen goods that they may require. In the United States there are 88,000,000 people. The United States has adopted the policy of encouraging, and  protecting local industries. But, notwithstanding her protective policy, America imports very largely, and will continue to import, no matter what duties are imposed. While we give our manufacturers fair play, and should give them reasonably high duties, we must consider the people who consume the goods as well. If honorable senators go to any clothing factory in Victoria - and I quote Victoria as affording the best illustration of my argument, because the largest manufactories of clothing are to be found here- they will find many protectionists among them who are actuated by the desire to make up Australian woollen goods to the greatest possible extent. But, nevertheless, honorable senators will find that nine-tenths of the material that passes through their hands is imported. </para>

            <para>- It was started about 1873 or 1874 by the Government of Tasmania offering a bounty of&#163;1,000 for the first , &#163;1,000 worth of woollens produced and sold. That prize was won by a certain firm. Another firm competed, but did not secure the bounty. What happened? The second firm &#34;went broke &#34; ; its industry failed. For a long while the woollen industry languished. The mills were able to make flannels of excellent quality, but they carried on in a very small way indeed. The duty at that time was 10 per cent. <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem.</inline> When it was raised to 12&#189; per cent., what followed? The woollen mills were able to develop to a small degree. We got the duty up to 15 per cent., and the industry still further developed. When the duty was raised to 20 per cent. , it made a bigger advance, and has been growing ever since. Though it had attained to a degree of perfection before the Federal Tariff was Introduced, it was the duty of 15 per cent. which enabled the manufacturers to stand. </para>

            <para>- That is rather misleading in some respects. The Tasmanian manufacturers of woollens are concerned almost entirely with flannels and blankets, and some of them have assured honorable senators that a duty of 15 per cent. is enough for them. I am not arguing that because 15 per cent. is enough for the Tasmanian manufacturers it is enough for Victoria, or that they could turn out woollen piece goods under that duty. But when you raise the duty from5 per cent. to 20 per cent. you make a very substantial increase indeed. </para>

            <para>- I would give 20 per cent. against the United Kingdom and 25 per cent. against foreign manufacturers upon tweeds and woollen piece goods&#39;. I wish to refer to a point that the VicePresident of the Executive Council made as to the importance of the woollen industry. He mentioned the number of people employed in it. I have here an account of the number of people employed in factories in which woollen goods are manufactured compared with the number in connexion with the manufactures of apparel, hosiery, &#38;c. I, preface my remarks on this subject by pointing out that the woollens that we can produce here are limited in range of quality and design. We give a margin ot 25 per cent., and our raw material is close at hand. But in the case of the makers of ready-made clothing, manufacturers of mantles, and other articles of attire, we give a margin of only 10 per cent. That difference is very largely ray reason for supporting a reduction in this instance. I know that there is no chance of the Committee accepting higher rates of duty on apparel than 35 per cent, and 40 per cent. Those duties ought to be ample to protect the manufacturers. But if they do not get a reasonable margin between the raw material and the manufactured article, their efforts are discounted. Now, in the metropolitan district of New South Wales there are three woollen mills, employing 103 males and 160 females - a total of 263 persons. The figures are for 1906. In Victoria there are 1,434 persons employed in the woollen mills. That is to say, the number of employes in Victoria and the chief manufacturing district of New South Wales is 1,697. I am giving the figures for the two States, where the woollen, clothing, and apparel factories are flourishing, under conditions which allow of a comparison being made on exactly equal lines. The number employed in the making of apparel, &#38;c, in the metropolitan district of New South Wales was 11,231, whilst 19,317 were so employed in Victoria. On the other hand, 263 were engaged in the woollen mills of the metropolitan district of New South Wales, and 1,434 in those of Victoria, or a total of 1, &#39;69 7. </para>

            <para>- I am willing to vote for an increased duty for the industry, but a point that we have to consider is whether or not a duty is likely not merely to have a protective incidence, but to be a very heavy burden upon the people. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has quoted figures regarding the revenue received &#34; from imports coming under this division, which in themselves show that we must have consideration for its revenue aspect. I propose now to put before the Committee the average rates of wages paid in the clothing factories. The average of all is, males 37s. 9d., and females 16s. 9d., per week. The average for males receiving the minimum rate of wage or over is 54s. id., and for females 22s. 4d. Then, again, the average pay of all males employed in the woollen mills is 23s. 9d. per week, whilst the average of all females is 16s. .7d. The average rate of pay of males receiving the minimum wage or over is 39s. 8d. a week, and of females 20s. nd. per week. In both States the wages paid are governed by law. In Victoria, at all events, there are certainly Wages Boards&#39; determinations in .operation. </para>

            <para>- A manufacturer could not do so when he was buying wool on a rising market, and had to deliver at fixed prices. That is one reason why the woollen industry here has not been, during the last few years, a profitable and growing one. Latterly the woollen market has been either stationary or, at all events, not rising, and, as the manufacturers will have, under this proposal, an additional protection of 5 per cent, on imports from the United Kingdom, and of 10 per cent. in the case of foreign goods, I do not see why they should not do well. </para>

But probably some of us from a State like New South Wales may be pardoned if we really have some ideas of our own concerning what is best for the welfare of the commercial community. I venture to say that by means of a protective policy the Victorian woollen industry has been bolstered up to an extent that no other industry on the face of the earth has been bolstered up. Yet the Vice-President of the Executive Council and his supporters have the effrontery to point to Victoria as an example of the blessings of protection- </para>

            <para>- New South Wales has manufactured better woollens than Victoria has ever done. Further, the New South Wales mills have kept upon their legs without any Tariff assistance, whereas most of the &#39;Victorian mills have gone &#34; bung &#34; at one time or another and have been reconstructed. Why, from the stand-point of quality the Tasmanian mills are turning out a far better article than are the Victorian mills. </para>

            <para>- I pass by the results of the analyses of samples submitted to the Tariff Commission which demonstrated the large quantity of &#34; shoddy &#34; that is being palmed off on the public of Victoria as the result of a protective policy. In 1878 I find that in Victoria there was a duty of 11 per cent. imposed upon woollens, and the number of hands employed in the industry was 730. In 1881 the duty levied was16&#189; per cent, and the number of hands engaged was 776; in 1886 the duty was 22 per cent. and the number of hands employed 780. In 1887, under a duty of 22 per cent., there were 704 hands engaged in the industry, in 1889 under a duty of 33 per cent. there were 841 hands employed, but in 1890, with a similar duty operative, this number declined to 810. In 1891, with a 33 per cent. duty still in operation, the number of hands further diminished to 791. I wish to draw special attention to the fact that in 1892, when a 44 per cent. duty upon woollens was operative, there were only 552 hands employed in the industry. The following year, under a 44 per cent, duty, . the number of operatives increased to 639, and in 1895, under the same duty, there was a further increase to 690. But in 1899, when a duty ranging from 16&#189; per cent. to 27&#189; per cent. was in force, the number of hands increased to 917. It will thus be seen that the number of hands engaged in the industry increased from 690 in 1895, when a duty of 44 per cent, was in operation, to 917 in 1899, when the duty ranged from16&#189; to 27&#189; per cent. </para>

            <para>- These are official figures which have been supplied to me. In 1903, under a duty of 16&#189; per cent., the number of hands engaged in the industry was1,013. I seems extraordinary that between 1878 and 1903 - a period of twenty-five years - the total number engaged increased by only 230, notwithstand-  ing that the industry had been bolstered up by means of a 44 per cent. duty. Simultaneously, under a duty of 15 per cent., the Tasmanian mills wereable not only to do a good trade, but to pay good dividends, and with a duty of 20 per cent., according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy,</inline> they did still better. </para>

            <para>- That is not my opinion. I know that six or seven mills were started in Geelong under a certain rate of duty, but the mill-owners were dissatisfied and clamoured for a higher rate. As soon as they had obtained an increased protection, half of them closed down, and the remainder did practically nothing. At the same time the littlemills of Tasmania were paying dividends. If ever there was an illustration of the absolute fallacy of the protectionist doctrine, it is afforded by the State of Victoria. Personally, I like Victoria. I do not altogether like its climate, but I likeits people, and I wish them well in every way. Their political education, however, has beensadly neglected. They have become so inoculated with the protectionist doctrine that they have absolutely gone mad on the fiscal question. Practically the whole of the witnesses who appeared before the Tariff Commission were Victorians, who were shrieking for a higher duty, and complaining, of the deplorably bad times that they were experiencing as the result of the operation of the Commonwealth Tariff. Yet the manager of one Victorian woollen mill not only confessed that his firm were doing better than they did under the higher duty which obtained prior to Federation, but actually declared that on a capital of &#163;60,000 they had paid a dividend of 7&#189; per cent, for five or six years, and that on the real capital invested, viz., &#163;30,000, they were paying 15 per cent. </para>

            <para>- I have not had the pleasure of interviewing the gentlemen who own the New South Wales woollen mills. But I have no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vicars</inline> would say that under the present Tariff his mill is doing very well, and that he cannot execute all the orders that he has already received. Nor can the mills in Victoria or anywhere else in Australia. In Victoria the hands employed in the woollen mills number 720 males and 710 females, or a total of 1,430. They earned last year &#163;76,901. In the clothing and tailoring establishments - the places where the raw materials are made up - 1,487 males and 5,513 females are employed, or a total of 7,000 hands, who earned last year &#163;360,789. I quote these figures to show the difference between the employment given by the woollen mills, which are to get the advantage of these increased duties, and that given by the establishments which use this material, for which they have now to pay higher prices. There are employed in the making of clothes nearly five times the number of hands engaged in the producing of the raw material. </para>

            <para>- In dress-making and millinery, in Victoria, 114 men and 7,789 females are employed, while in the underclothing trade the hands consist of 154 males and 3,229 females. These earned last year &#163;129,313. We are practically asked to tax the whole community for the sake of a few woollen mills. I know that I shall meet with a certain amount of coolness when I refer to the Old &#34;Country, but I must point out that our imports of woollen piece goods come almost entirely from the United Kingdom. This duty is therefore levied only againstthe Old Land. Apart from the kindly feeling which we should have towards the Old Country, is it not to the advantage of Australia to give her a real, and not a sham, preference? To put up the duty from 15 to 30 per cent., and then say that we are giving a preference of 5 per cent., is simply insulting the commercial community of the Old Country. What is really being done is to attempt to prohibit the importation into Australia of English woollen goods. Honorable senators opposite will not succeed in doing that, because neither America nor Canada has been able to do it. If we in Australia had any of the pride, or doggedness and perseverance, of the English people we should not, with our natural advantages, need any Tariff protection to enable us to manufacture woollen goods. We are the largest sheep growers in the world; we grow varieties of wool that are exported all over the world. When it goes to England it has to bear railway freight charges, intermediary commission charges, sea freight charges, and more intermediary charges before it reaches the manufacturers. After the goods have been manufactured they have to be returned to us with all the intermediary charges duplicated. I calculate that &#163;100 worth of wool, to go to the Old Country and come back in a manufactured condition to be retailed, costs about &#163;213. </para>

            <para>- I am pointing out the great advantages that Australia has over every other country for manufacturing wool. Yet it is said, &#34; We cannot do it unless, in addition to all those extraordinary charges, we impose almost a prohibitive duty of 30 per cent.&#34; . I do not say that Australia cannot manufacture woollen piece goods. She can do it, and I believe will do it within a few years, because our manufacturers have risen to the knowledge that they have the means and ability and, I hope, the machinery, which is a great factor., to enable them to produce woollen goods equal to what is imported, without needing these extraordinary, crutches, which will only retard our progress. But. as our manufacturers say that they cannot do it at present, we ought to have regard to the great advantages given by the interchange of commerce. We depend greatly upon freight conditions for the value of our exports. If we prohibit importations it will mean increased freights from Australia to Europe, as ships will not come here empty. If we shut ourselves up we shall have to pay for it in other directions. </para>

            <para>- If I can read between the lines it refers also to the fiscal question which we are now discussing. Nearly the whole value of our exports depends upon the Old Country. What should we do in Australia with our butter, tallow, sheep skins, and wool if it were not for the Old Country? Before we commit ourselves to these prohibitive duties on woollen goods, we should recognise all that we owe to the Old Country. That may be called sentiment. Honorable senators opposite may say that England would not take our goods if she did not want them. But the fact  remains that we depend almost entirely upon her for our prosperity. </para>

        <para class="block">No good purpose would be served by repeating the arguments I have already advanced in favour of making the general Tariff 25 per cent., with, of course, the subsequent intention of moving a reduction of 5 per cent, in favour of the United Kingdom. However, I hope I shall not be deemed tiresome if I suggest that there is a great deal in what was urged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> as to presenting practically a closed door to the country which is the chief customer for our wool export. In pursuance of some remarks made, before dinner, I beg to be allowed to refer to a difficulty of the Australian manufacturer of woollen goods in supplying the local market with all that is required. This is a limited market under any circumstances, and there are required at least five different kinds of machinery to turn out the blankets, woollens, tweeds, worsteds, and broad cloths we are all anxious to see manufactured here. Even if I do not like high duties, there &#34;is no honorable senator, not even the most pronounced protectionist, who wishes more sincerely than I to see the growth of the local industry. The only difference between us is that I desire to see the industry grow healthily, and not at the expense of the whole community. </para>

          <para>- The honorable senator talks about improvements since the inauguration of the Commonwealth ; but what about the enormous improvement in the honorable senator himself. Is that due to Customs duties ? However, I hope that the request for the reduction of the duty by 5 per cent, on the general Tariff will meet with the approbation of the majority. </para>

          <para>. - Earlier in the evening, the VicePresident of the Executive Council remarked that this is one of the most important items in the Tariff. With that remark I can cordially agree; and for that reason, although the honorable gentleman seems impatient for a division, I venture to add a few words to the discussion. The enormous jump from the old Tariff of 1902 strikes me with some amazement. The duty in another place was reduced from 30 to 25 per cent., and escaped a, further reduction by only one vote. </para>

            <para>- If that is the explanation, of course I accept it. When so large an increase in the  duty  is proposed, not on a small, but on an important item, surely we are entitled to some .substantial reason. The only reason that could justify such a proposal  must  be found in the nature of the industry itself. I have lived in the hope that some one would tell us that the increased duty is necessary for the preservation or the growth and expansion of the industry. </para>

            <para>- We are now told that if a little more protection be given this bantling will grow. What more protection is wanted than that which the industry enjoyed in Victoria? How long have we- to spoon feed this precious bantling, which was apparently starved on duties of 40 and 50 per cent, in Victoria? It would be better to pension every manufacturer and employe than to impose duties which, as I shall show from the evidence of the manufacturers themselves, represent a. burden on the consumer, lt is curious to observe, in looking through the evidence, that those who put forward the most strenuous demands for higher duties are those who&#39;&#93; all through their manufacturing lives, have lived under the highest protection. The men who started under free-trade and have been going along under the comparatively low duty of ibc Commonwealth were apparently satisfied. They made no complaints. The loud objections, the demands for more protection, came always from the Victorian manufacturers, who had an opportunity of building up their industries under the very high duties which prevailed in the preFederation days. </para>

            <para>- Twenty-five years ago, the Victorian manufacturers assured the people of Victoria that, if they were only given a reasonable measure of protection for a limited period, they would be able to establish their industries, and then stand alone without the aid of Tariff support. But every time there has been any public tendency to look into the Tariff we have always had from that source the one cry, &#34; We cannot live without high duties.&#34; That was the burden of their prayer to the Tariff Commission. </para>

            <para>- It proves their greed, and that is the same thing in a Victorian mind. It proves that if we give them the 25 per cent, which they are asking for to-day, they will ask to-morrow for 30 per cent. ; that if we give them the 30 per cent., they will ask for 40 per cent; ; and that when they get the 40 per cent.&#34;, they will ask for 50 per cent. It is about the safest thing I know to predict that an industry which has been built up under a system of protection will ask incessantly for more help. There has never been a case where any manufacturers, no matter how liberally they have been subsidized by a State Tariff, have come forward and said to the Legislature, &#34; We are grateful to you for the support you gave us in our early days. That struggle is over, and we can dispense with the duty.&#34; At one period in its history, Victoria had duties ranging up to 44 per cent. That was the time when the woollen industry was in the least flourishing position. </para>

            <para>- I can now understand the framing of this Tariff. It must have been framed by men who know very little about the facts connected with industries when it is said that in New South Wales they had nothing to diminish. I find that in the industry kindred to this industry 5,676 hands were employed in New South Wales as against 6,291 hands in Victoria. </para>

            <para>- These interjections explain to me to a very great extent how this Tariff came to be framed and the measure of support which it is receiving, because it is quite clear to me that when honorable senators make such statements they have not looked closely into the conditions of the industry as it existed in New South Wales. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has said that in New South Wales they had nothing to diminish.

            <para>- Vicars&#39; mill compared with similar mills in Victoria has been a fairly successful one. It has never been closed or reconstructed. It has never had to go on year after year unable to pay dividends. What does <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vicars</inline> say about his mill? He says that in the early days his firm did a profitable business in colonial tweeds without any protective duty at all. There is not a Victorian manufacturer who, having had for twenty-five years the benefit of duties ranging up to 44 per cent., can come forward and make a statement as satisfactory as that one. What <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vicars</inline> could say was that in the early days under free-trade his firm did a profitable business. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vicars</inline> said that his firm had also been supplying part of the requirements of the State for upwards of twenty years, that lately they had been given a, slight consideration, but that during the earlier and greater portion of that period they had competed openly against the importing firms. Is there any Melbourne manufacturer who can make a statement like that? Further, the witness went on to say that they were able to send goods into Victoria, where the duty was 25 per cent. So that we have a manufacturer in New South Wales, under freetrade conditions, exploiting the market of the most protectionist State in the Commonwealth, and that was Victoria. </para>

            <para>- No. I had not time to say anything before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> interjected. For his special benefit, let me point out that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hogarth,</inline> of Tasmania, affirmed that he managed to send goods into Victoria, paying a 25 per cent. duty. It does not appear to me to matter whether he sent much or little. He did not send them in at a loss. He must have sent them in at a profit. It shows that if he had had a surplus stock to dispose of he could have sent in more if he had so desired. The fact is that neither in Tasmania nor in New South Wales were they making enough to supply the local market, and, therefore, they were under no necessity to look abroad for the sale of surplus stock. </para>

I have nothing to say as to whether the quantity he sent was large or &#39;small. I am pleased to think that under Federation the quantity sent from New South Wales and Tasmania is steadily increasing, and to be brought face to face with a little healthy competition is likely to be the best, tonic that the Victorian manufacturers have ever had. </para>

            <para>- Exactly, and the factory inspector was called upon to administer the Factories Act. There is a law which says that a child shall not work below a certain age. It is a fact that children below the age were discovered working. Whether there was a law or not, what have honorable senators to say on behalf of an industry which is forced to employ children of twelve years of age to turn out the goods in respect of which they propose to give the manufacturers ah additional duty of 10 and 15 per cent.? I have tried to ascertain whether there was any just cause for increasing the duty. I have endeavoured to find, out if there was any evidence of retrogression on the part of the mill-owners. I find that the Tariff Commission made an effort to learn what profits were being made at the factories. Here is an extraordinary statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Grainger</inline> -  &#34;The witness, when asked what dividends his company paid, attempted to mislead the Commission by stating that it worked out at 7&#189; per cent, on the total subscribed capital of &#163;60,000. The balance-sheets of the company, with which the witness was confronted by  a  Commissioner, showed that the capital of the company was &#163;30,000, upon which 15 per cent, dividends had been paid for several years.&#34; </para>

            <para>- What has that to do with it? At the present moment we are being asked practically to double the protection given to the manufacturers of woollens. Had they been in a struggling position, or had the industry been on the verge of shipwreck, there might have&#39; been some justification for doing so, but when the woollen manufacturers are increasing the number of their hands and their output, and have for years paid dividends of 15 per cent., what justification can there be for imposing a tax on every working man and woman in the community in order to enable them to swell their 15 per cent, dividends into dividends of 20 per cent, and 25 per cent. ? I always understood that those who advocated protection at least pretended that they did so in the interests of the masses of the people, but when manufacturers are making 15 per cent, profit they have no justification for approaching Parliament for licence to dip their hands still further into the pockets of the people who are forced to buy their goods. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator is quite right, and he will take all he can get or all that honorable senators are willing to give him. It is because I see  no indication that those engaged in this industry are not well able to carry on or are not doing handsomely, and because I believe that any additional impost would merely have the effect of enabling ^ the manufacturers to increase the prices of their goods to the consumer, that I decline to vole for the Tariff as it stands, and intend to vote for the lowest duty to which the Committee will agree. I have said that this additional impost will increase prices to the consumer, and the evidence given by the woollen manufacturers themselves is an admission of the truth of that statement. They practically &#39;, admitted that the in-, creased duty would increase the prices of their goods, because they told the Tariff Commission that as they were asking for an additional duty upon woollens, to equalize things that should be accompanied by an increased duty upon imported madeup apparel. The meaning of this was that as they would, in view of the increased duty, charge more for their goods to the manufacturers of apparel, it was only fair to balance that by giving the latter a higher duty also. The protectionist contention that the .effect of duties is to lower prices, though I do not believe that any protectionist honestly believes in it, is found useful on the platform and useful to manufacturers who come here and ask us to give an increased duty on the understanding that they will guarantee that there will be no rise in the price of the article they manufacture, although they do not afterwards adhere to their promise. </para>

            <para>- I have arrived at my conclusion in this matter through paying for and wearing boots made in both States. &#39; I wish to emphasize the fact that however much honorable senators opposite may deny that the effect of a duty is to increase the price of the article on which it is imposed, the manufacturers of woollens have shown that it is not so by admitting that if the duty were increased in their favour, in order to be fair we should increase the duty in favour of the men who make up apparel. If an increased duty on woollens were to have the effect of making woollens&#39; cheaper, why should the manufacturers be concerned to ask for a higher duty for the benefit of the makers of apparel from woollens? They knew that the imposition of an increased duty on woollens would increase the price of the raw material to the makers of apparel, and on that account recognised that it was only fair that the latter in their turn should be given an additional measure of protection. There is no doubt that they were quite right, and their action absolutely destroys the protectionist contention that the imposition of a duty does not increase the price of the article. I do not suppose that there is an item in the Tariff which concerns the masses of the people more intimately than does that which we are now considering, in conjunction with the associated item of apparel. The number of people engaged in this industry is, comparatively speaking, a handful. </para>

            <para>- Perhaps the honorable senator will wait until I have finished my argument, and he will then be welcome to all the support for a policy of high protection that he can obtain for it. Only a small number of people are engaged in this, industry, and they are doing well, whilst, scattered throughout Australia, on its plains and its mountain sides, there are many thousands of people who are taxed in order to keep the handful of people who are benefited by this taxation. Speaking on behalf of the hundreds of thousands of people scattered throughout Australia who have to buy these &#39;goods, I say there is no just cause and no warrant for placing an additional impost upon them. </para>

          <para>.- Even the most ardent and bigoted freetrader will admit that if there is any industry in Australia which can be called a natural industry, it is the growth of wool and manufacture of woollen piece goods. It is admitted that we produce as fine wool as is produced in any part of the world. Those who take up the attitude that Australia should not give protection to the woollen-manufacturing industry, desire that Australians should be merely wood and water joeys for the rest of the world, producing raw materials for other countries that they might be returned in a manufactured state. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> the leader of the Opposition, and other honorable senators who have addressed themselves to this subject, have said that we cannot hope to succeed to any great extent in the manufacture of woollengoods because our market for such goods is so limited. They seem to think that it is confined to Australia. I join issue with them on that point. I say that our market for such goods is not limited to the Commonwealth. Our market for woollen goods should be as world-wide as our market for wool. We produce the finest wool, and have an opportunity to produce the finest manufactures from wool. If we can do so, the world will as readily compete for our manufactured woollen goods as it now does for our raw wool. No weight therefore can be attached to the argument that our market for woollen goods is limited : but even if it were confined to the demand for such goods in the Commonwealth, it should certainly be our object to supply that demand. What are the facts? Under our Commonwealth Tariff the quantity of woollen piece goods imported into Australia has been increasing very largely. The figures are available to every honorable member, and they show that our importations of woollen goods in 3899 amounted in value to &#163;1,348,952, and that in 1905 these importations had increased in value to &#163;1,809,784. According to the information placed before us in dealing with the schedule, I find that in 1906 we imported into the Commonwealth woollen piece goods to the value of &#163;1,993,312. </para>

They often talk of free-trade Great Britain, the only country in which that policy is logically pursued, and they talk also of New South Wales having pursued a free-trade policy.

I wish to remind honorable senators that Great Britain never adopted free-trade until her manufacturing industries had reached such a stage of development that they were able to defy competition in any portion of the world ; and in regard to the woollen industry, the principle of protection was so rigidly applied that woollen goods manufactured in Ireland were forbidden to be imported into England. Honorable senators opposite cannot refer me to any country in the world that has ever built up a great manufacturing industry without protection. </para>

            <para>- How long is it since England adopted free-trade? It is only a little over half a century, yet the honorable senator speaks of a period so  near to our own time as that as the dark ages. The woollen industry, in which, perhaps, Great Britain stands supreme today, was built up under a system of protection so rigid that the importation of woollen goods from Ireland was absolutely prohibited. Ireland was at the time producing very superior woollen manufactures, and the English people were so much afraid that their woollen industry would be destroyed by this beautiful free competition of which honorable senators opposite are so fond of prating, that they forbade the importation. No country in the world has built up her manufacturing industries without protection- Indeed, no country of importance, with the exception of Great Britain, has ever adopted freetrade, and we know that as a matter of history Great Britain built up her manufacturing industry under&#39; the most rigidsystem of protection. As to the position of the woollen industry in New. South Wales, about which we have heard so much, the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission reports - </para>

          <para>The woollen industry was established in New South Wales upwards of fifty years ago. In 1884-5, <inline font-style="italic">had</inline> seven mills, employing 312 people, with an output of 305,000 yards per annum. In 1904, there were three mills, employing 245 hands, with an output of 481,000 yards of tweed, 1,700 yards of flannel, 16,580 blankets and rugs, or a gross output of approximately 520,000 yards. In the earlier times the mills depended entirely on what was known as &#34; Colonial tweeds,&#34; a good honest cloth, which made a name and a trade for itself. This industry was smothered about fifteen years ago by the wholesale importation of a shoddy imitation. </para>

          <para>At the lowest computation the Australian rate of wages for woollen workers was 50 per cent, higher than that prevailing in England, and 70 per cent, above continental rates. In Japan, which was already exporting its woollen manufactures to Australia, the wages averaged about os. per week. In Japan, girls receive 3d. to 5d., women 5d. to  10d.  per day of sixteen hours, and special workers <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> per week, compared with &#163;3 per week here. Without any reference&#39; to hours, Australian wages compare with those of England as twelve to seven. The hours worked in England and Scotland were li fly-six per week, on the Continent they vary from sixty to sixty-four: In Australia, fortyeight hours was a general acceptation of a week&#39;s work. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That shows that the Australian manufacturer is very heavily handicapped &#39;in competition with the English and Continental manufacturer, and he is still more handicapped in comparison with the Japanese manufacturer. Honorable senators opposite  are prepared at all times to insist that Australian employes working in factories or elsewhere shall be given fair conditions - that is, that they shall be treated properly with respect to hours of labour, rates of wages, and terms of employment generally. But upon what conditions do they insist in regard to the foreign manufacturer? They say to him, &#34;You can  employ  \-our hands under any conditions you please - the most degrading and sweating imaginable - and yet we will allow you to  supply  Australia with all the shoddy goods you can produce.&#34; That is the attitude which those who believe in free-trade assume.  For my own part, I am not in favour of low duties at all. I would join with my honorable friends opposite in voting for no duties rather than for low duties. Low duties will simply place burdens on the taxpayers whilst accomplishing nothing. If you provide a duty so low that it does not effectually prevent importation, the goods will come in as heretofore, and people will buy them and pay cost price plus the duty. The consequence is that the general taxpayer will contribute  very  largely through Customs duties to the revenue. I should prefer free.-trade to that condition of things. But directly you provide duties such as are sufficient to secure effective protection to the local manufacturer, you impose no burden on the taxpayer, except for a little while; because, if the duty is effective in giving protection to the local manufacturer, you enable him to supply the market, and importation ceases. The taxpayer ceases to pay the tax on imported goods, because he uses local goods, which pay no tax. Of course, honorable senators opposite will say, as they have said scores of times, that the local manufacturer charges the full price plus the duty. But that does not follow, because directly you have established manufactories by effective protection- </para>

            <para>- Absolutely true. Honorable senators opposite have been arguing that, by imposing duties under this Tariff, we are simply laying a burden on the taxpayers of Australia. I hold that, instead of doing anything of the kind, the Tariff will, if the duties are adequate, encourage the establishment of sufficient manufactures in Australia to supply the demands of Australia, and, possibly, to give a surplus for export. Let me give an instance. I do not think there is a country in the world in which working men can get their boots cheaper than in Australia. Yet our boot-manufacturing industry has been built up almost entirely under protection. </para>

            <para>- I am only using that as an illustration. The same thing will apply to woollen goods. As a matter of fact, honorable senators opposite have used it as an argument why we should not have high protection in the case of woollen piece goods. They say that Australia does not want high protection for some of her manufactures, such -as rugs, blankets, and flannels. But if we had not established those industries&#39; under a system of  protec-tion  Australia to-day would not be able to compete with importers in those classes of goods. The fact that Australia can compete against the world both in respect of quality and cheapness with her flannels, blankets, and rugs establishes the fact that high protection can build up air industry without in any way increasing prices to the consumer. It is also a fact, notwithstanding the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> that the woollen industry in Australia has been languishing. The figures, which I have quoted abundantly prove my statement. There is one factory in Queensland which, although we had a system of protection before Federation, and although the State Government gave encouragement to it in every possible way - such as by giving it Government contracts - has been languishing for a long time. It has been languishing worse than ever since the establishment of Federation. </para>

            <para>- I should be very pleased if the honorable senator would  allow me to enunciate my own policy. I feel quite capable of doing so without troubling him very much. My policy certainly is not to centralize everything, but to build up in Australia a manufacturing industry in respect of the particular classes of goods we are discussing, because I think that Australia is particularly well suited to their manufacture. We produce the finest wool in the world. There is no gainsaying that fact. The whole world competes eagerly for our wool. For what purpose ? To. manufacture it so as to meet the requirements of the world, ourselves included, and afterwards to send back to us in a manufactured state that very highclass raw material which has been previously exported from Australia. Establish manufacturing industries here which will convert our raw material into the finest manufactured articles and we shall find the whole world competing for them, just as they now compete for &#39;the wool which we produce. Honorable senators opposite think that we should be merely hewers of wood and drawers of water tor the rest of the world - that our raw materials should be carted away from Australia to be manufactured and then carted back to us. That is their idea of prosperity. It is not mine. I do not want to see Australia become a wood and water joey for the rest of the world. But if we are to have protection at all it should be effective. If we have low duties, all that we shall accomplish is to place burdens on the backs of the taxpayers without producing any advantageous result. &#39; If we adopt high protection we shall accomplish something worth having, and under it no such burdens as I have indicated will be placed on the backs of the taxpayers.. I desire a scientific protection sufficiently high to be effective, whilst at the same time not giving the local manufacturer a monopoly. </para>

I should like to know how it is possible to secure effective protection without giving rise to a monopoly. The honorable senator went on to say that his desire was that Australia should manufacture the goods which she requires, in order that consumers might secure articles of superior quality. He added that importations from Japan were coming in, but according to the official return the value of our imports of these goods from Japan, in 1906, was only &#163;25. </para>

            <para>- In Tasmania in 1888 there were three woollen mills giving employment to seventy-two persons, and treating during the year 157,400 lbs. of wool. At that time, to the best of my recollection, there was in operation a duty of either 10 per cent, or 12 per cent.; it was certainly not more than 12 per cent; Between 1888 and 1896 the duty was increased to 15 per cent., and in the lastnamed year the number of hands engaged in the industry had increased to 109, whilst the consumption of wool had gone up from 157,400 lbs. in 1888 to 253,000 lbs. In 1896 the duty was raised from 15 to 20 per cent. I well remember the imposition of the increased duty, for I was one of those who fought for it. The consequence was that in 1897 the number of hands engaged in the industry had further increased, whilst the quantity of wool treated rose from 253,000 lbs. to 269,000 lbs. In 1898, when the duty of 20 per cent, had become effective, the output of the mills required the treatment of 634,000 lbs. of wool, or three times as much wool as was used by the Tasmanian woollen mills in 1896. </para>

            <para>- It is chiefly due to the advantages which Tasmania possesses in the shape of a dry atmosphere and a particularly soft quality of water. I have quoted these figures with a view to showing that so far as her production was concerned, Tasmania did very well under the operation of a 20 per cent, duty. The Victorian mill-owners who are engaged in the manufacture of flannels and blankets have also done fairly well under a 15 per cent. duty. But the manufacturers of tweeds are not in such a fortunate position, and they do require an increased duty. An increase from 15 per cent, to 20 per cent., it seems to me, would be ample to meet their case, and consequently we ought not to impose a higher duty under the general Tariff than 25 per cent. </para>

He appeared to approach that subject in, a. very nervous mood. I wish to say that I will not yield anything to Great Britain if the concession involves the undermining of the woollen industry in Australia. We know that in the past the bulk of our woollen piece goods have been imported from Great Britain. To my mind if we extend a preference to Great Britain our woollen industry will be compelled to drift along in the haphazard fashion which has hitherto characterized it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> took the trouble to tell us that the &#39; industry has done remarkably well under the operation of a 15 per cent. duty.

            <para>- They showed that the industry has been upon the decline ever since Federation was inaugurated. During the past year we imported &#163;2,200,000 worth of woollen piece goods. Surely that is not a happy position for a wool-growing country to occupy. We export annually about &#163;20,000,000 worth of wool and retain for manufacturing purposes only about one per cent, of the gross product. So far as New South Wales is concerned, the&#34; in dustry has been languishing under what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> calls free-trade conditions. It has not prospered notwithstanding the progress made by that State in other directions. </para>

            <para>- I am very glad that it was a representative of New South W&#39;ales who called attention to the state ot the Committee, in order that a larger number of honorable senators might hear the facts as to the crayfish progress of the woollen industry in that State during the free-trade <inline font-style="italic">regime.</inline> In 1880 the number of employes in the woollen industry in New South Wales was 214. By 1900 it had increased to 221 - an addition of seven bands in twenty years. In Victoria, under a protective policy, the number of factories in 1880 was ten, while in 1900 it was nine, but the number of hands increased from 814 to 1,013 i&#34; the same period. Therefore, the representatives of New South Wales have nothing to be proud of in the progress of the industry in their own State.

            <para>- Iwill withdraw the word &#34;gallant&#34; if the honorable senator objects to it. It shows what fearful straits the New South Wales representatives are in when they ask the Committee to believe that under their beneficent policy of freetrade they were able to send manufactured woollen goods into Victoria. According to the New South Wales <inline font-style="italic">Statistical Register,</inline> from  1896  to  1900,  when the duty was  25  per cent, in Victoria, the total amount of New South Wales woollen manufactures sent to Victoria was  &#163;74  worth of rugs, including furs, and  &#163;28  worth of other woollen manufactures, spread over five years. I had to refer to these matters to set right those honorable senators who have wasted most of the afternoon in placing such fallacies before the Committee. What a slender case they must have when they tell honorable senators, in face of those figures, that New South Wales exported woollen goods to Victoria ! The leader of the Opposition expended some time to-day in pointing out the inconsistency of protectionists in not agreeing to reduce this duty, but he might well devote some time to studying his own inconsistency, and striving if possible to remedy it. When he was outlining his attitude towards the Tariff earlier in the session, the honorable senator said that when he was before the electors of New South Wales he announced that his policy would be not to lay hostile hands upon the Tariff, but rather to level up than down. I have waited in vain to see him apply the lever for the levelling up. When will he begin? So far from doing that, he has rather gone back to some extent on his professions by voting for the levelling down of duties. </para>

          <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> when he began, said that he rose to put the last  speaker  right. That is exactly the reason which has called me to my feet. I wish to bring <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> who seems to be so very far from the correct path, back to it. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> was quoting the evidence of the witness, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hogarth,</inline> from Tasmania, I asked whether he would read the answers to questions  33,413 - 33,416,  in the reported evidence given before the Tariff Commission, and the honorable senator wasdiscreet enough not to do so. Let me remind honorable senators that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> was then taking <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> to task, and asking the Committee to believe that this manufacturer, who was asking for higher duties, knew more about the matter than did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy.</inline> However, the answers of this witness will explain the apparent discrepancy between the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> as to the increased imports and my contention that the industry has been making steady progress. The mere fact that the imports have grown does not prove that the local industry has retrogressed ; on the contrary, it proves that the general prosperity of the country has caused an increased demand, which the local mills have not been able to supply. The following is the extract from the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hogarth</inline> -  33,413. Has your trade been increasing or stationary since the Federal Tariff has been in operation? - It has been stationary this last two years. There had been a gradual increase after the 20 per cent. State duty had been put on. We doubled ourselves in seven or eight years. 33,414. Do I understand you to say that you are not progressing because the duty is not sufficiently high? - I won&#39;t say that. 33,415. How are you stationary ? - We cannot go on increasing for ever. 33,416. Is your output up to the full capacity of your mills? - Yes; we cannot do another bit. </para>

I find from the reports of the Tariff Commission that in 1878 the Victorian Industry, with a duty, of 11 per cent., employed 736 hands, whereas in 1892, when there was a 44 per cent, duty, the number had decreased to 552. </para>

            <para>- In 1893, with a 44 per cent, duty, the number of hands was 639, or close on 100 less than under the duty of 11 per cent. In 1899, under a duty of 27&#189; per cent., the number rose to 917 ; but in 1903, under the Commonwealth with a duty of 16&#189; per cent., the employes numbered 1,013. The argument that , a higher duty will provide more employment is not borne out by the figures I have quoted. Honorable senators seem to forget that if, by an increase in the duty more employment is provided for a few, it must be at the expense of thousands. We are told by protectionists that increased duties do not mean increased prices, but my. opinion is that under the duty of 44 per cent, prices in Victoria increased to such a degree that the goods could not be sold. </para>

            <para>- lt does not suit the honorable senator&#39;s book, but I  housekeeper  that later on he also will believe what I have just said. If for a moment I thought that a duty of 25 per cent, on .woollen piece goods, when imported from countries outside the United Kingdom, was not suk ficient protection to the Australian manufacturers, I should vote for the imposition of- a higher duty. I assured my constituents. that I should not attempt to reduce the duties in the old Tariff, and I do not think that by any vote I have given I have tried to reduce a duty. I am quite willing, however, to increase a duty if I think it necessary, but we have had no evidence to show that the Australian manufacturer will not be on as good a footing as the foreign manufacturer if he is given a protection of 25 per cent. He buys his raw material on the spot, and therefore has a natural protection of at &#39; least 10 per cent, against his foreign competitor.  Victoria imposed a duty of 44 per cent, on woollen piece goods, but it was found that the ultraprotectionists were defeating their own ends, and therefore the duty had to be reduced. If figures will prove anything they prove that in 1902, when the duty on this line was reduced to 16J per cent., the Victorian manufacturers were in a more flourishing position than was the case when the duty was 44 per cent. It all goes to prove that people can go mad on&#39; protection. There is no doubt that at one time the people of Victoria were mad on protection. The manufacturers of this State are not satisfied with a fair and reasonable protection. My desire is to give them what I consider to be a fair and reasonable protection, but not to give them a protection which would be too high and react against the consumers in the Commonwealth. For these reasons I intend to support a reduction of the duty to 25 per cent. </para>

          <para>. - Honorable senators will probably recollect that when the Tariff was first introduced in another place it was intended that the duties on paragraph  b  of this item should be 35 per cent, in the general Tariff and 30 per cent, on imports from the United Kingdom. But yielding to the representations made the Government agreed that dress materials weighing 5 ozs. per square yard should be admitted at 15 and 10 per cent, respectively. It was pointed out by the mover of the reduced duties in another place that the proposal he made would enable women of the industrial classes to obtain their dress goods at a more reasonable rate than if the weight of the goods was not stated. I am reliably informed that since the imposition of the new duties it has been found that the effect has been to benefit a class of citizens in better circumstances than those to whom it was intended to give relief. The advantage is found to be on the wrong side. Unless the weight of the goods be specified anomalies creep in. No one. desires to give encouragement to any industry abroad that would come into serious competition with industries established in the Commonwealth, but it has been pointed out that these dress materials have not and are not now being made in any part of Australia. </para>

            <para>- I hope that honorable senators opposite will stick to it, because their contention is that the higher the duties the higher the taxation upon the community. When it is shown that protection will not be advanced by the request I intend to make, I should be able to claim the support of honorable senators opposite who have been arguing in a certain direction since the Tariff came before the Committee. I understand that Bradford and Company, of England, are in a position to manufacture dress materials weighing 6&#189; ozs. to the square yard. Woollen materials of a greater weight would come into competition with woollen goods manufactured in the Commonwealth and might be made into men&#39;s clothing. </para>

There is no good reason for placing a high rate of duty on silks. Silks imported to be worn as dress material are very costly, and tinder an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty pay accordingly. But silk fabrics are worn by the poorest girl as well as by the richest woman in the land, and there is no good reason for discriminating between them and other dress fabrics. The Customs Department would be saved a great deal of trouble, and no revenue would be lost, if the goods coming under paragraphs  b  and c were all made dutiable at  15  and  10  per cent., while such an arrangement would make the proposed amendment unnecessary. </para>

            <para>- There can&#39; be any amount of complexity. Business people have a right to ask that the Tariff shall be simplified if that can be done without a sacrifice of its principle. But unless a suggestion comes from a particular quarter the Vice-President of the Executive Council refuses to listen to it. If it comes from a favoured quarter, however, he says that it i? quite in conformity with his own policy, although he is afraid to propose anything somewhat similar himself. I speak as one who has had a great deal to do with passing Customs entries, and know what the difficulties are. In this case the revenue lost would be the difference between  10  and  15  per cent, on  &#163;100,000;  that is to say, it would be  5  per cent, on that amount. The revenue would, therefore, be reduced by  &#163;5,000.  That calculation assumes that there are no larger im- portations. It may be assumed that we shall receive a larger revenue from the duty. But I honestly believe that such will not be the case. The Tariff will simply make ladies take more wear out of their silk gowns or buy a commoner class of material. I hope that my honorable friend will adopt a reasonable  attitude when it is simply desired to simplify the passing of Customs entries and to remove anomalies. </para>

          <para>. - The Vice-President of the Executive Council made a statement which was obviously in error, although I have no doubt he fell into his mistake inadvertently when he stated that the  15  per cent, had been recommended by both sections of the Tariff Commission. If he looks a little more closely into the reports he will find that what the free-trade section recommended was a duty of  10  per cent, wherethese goods were imported in lengths of  12  yards or over, and further, they made that recommendation as part of a general scheme. They recommended that the  10  per cent, should apply not merely to the silk goods now under review, but to the woollen goods which the Minister proposed to tax a.t  25  per cent. Therefore, it is not correct to say that they recommended  15  per cent, in this case. What appears to me to be more pertinent is that the protectionist section recommended  15  per cent. The Minister, however, proposes to make the duty  20  per cent. If there is any virtue in the reports of the Commission at all, the Minister ought to see special virtue from his point of view in the recommendations of the protectionist section. But the matter with which we are dealing is not one of protection at all. There is no fiscal question involved unless it be that of raising revenue. The Minister admits that this is a revenue item. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> has only approached it from that point of view. The point at issue is this - is it advisable to get a little more revenue by having an additional item in the Tariff? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> asks why not throw this item into the previous one and make the goods taxable at the same rate of duty. They are the same class of goods except for a little silk being used in them. We do not need to be in the business . to know that the fewer the items in the Tariff the less possibility of confusion and conflict as between the importers and the Customs officers. The revenue is not worth speaking about. The Customs officers would be able to say definitely whether throwing these items into one would simplify the working, of the Tariff. I feel confident that it would. If there were only one item in the whole Tariff there could be no complication. All goods would pay the&#39; same rate of duty. There would, be no room for conflict. Evidently the more items are subdivided the more room for conflict there is. In this case the total amount at stake, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy&#39;s</inline> figures, is  &#163;5,000,&#39;  which is not worth considering. Honorable senators opposite are constantly saying that they are opposed to mere revenue items. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy&#39;s</inline> suggestion were made as a hostile attack upon the  1902  Tariff I should not support it, but it does seem to me to be a case where simplification can take place without- touching the principle of the Tariff. Although there may be a slight loss of revenue, on the other hand there will be a- great gain in simplifying the work both in regard to the Customs officers and the trading community. I should like to know whether the Minister has finally made up his mind not to accept the suggestion with regard to the second paragraph. If he can accept it it will not be necessary to put in these words. </para>

            <para>- If the proposal I make be agreed to, that is exactly what, will happen. Goods containing any silk would- come in under paragraph c. We cannot define the percentage of silk, but if we say that the goods coining under paragraph b shall not contain any silk, no confusion will arise. It is possible that this may ultimately have a protective incidence, although I do not at this stage arge its acceptance upon that ground. There has been some production of silk in Canada, but there is no evidence of such an industry here. </para>

          <para>. - The Minister has frankly . admitted that this is a revenue item. I would impress that fact upon honorable senators opposite for the reason that they have shown a tendency to deal with purely revenue items upon their merits. This being only a revenue item, I desire them to consider what it is the Minister asks us to retain. He has admitted that as the item stands in the Tariff there is a possibility  of  confusion. To avoid that confusion, he is proposing the addition of words which will cause to be classed as silk goods, woollen piece-goods containing even the finest thread of silk. That is to say, woollen piece-goods worth  &#163;1,000,  and containing silk of the value of the onehundredth part of a penny would be classed as silk goods. The absurdity of such a proposal should be sufficient to condemn it, but if it does not, surely I may ask honorable senators to consider the annoyance and inconvenience to which it will subject importers. </para>

            <para>- Then what the Minister has in view &#39; is not the  &#163;105,000  per annum which we have previously collected under this heading, 5 but the additional revenue which he hopes to secure from a purely revenue duty. That forces me to ask honorable senators to consider whether we want the extra revenue. Does the Federation or any State require it ? The Commonwealth has a larger revenue under this Tariff than it has ever had, and its revenue hitherto has been ample. Every State is obtaining from the Federation more than it has ever had, and it will get still more from this Tariff. Four out of the six States, according to their last financial statement, had a surplus. Is there any justification for keeping this item as it stands for- merely revenue purposes? I do not think that the Committee will entertain it for one moment as a revenue line. . What is the alternative ? 1 do not think that the Customs Department is troubling about the question of revenue. For some reason or other it desires  that the two paragraphs shall be kept separate. The alternative is too absurd, and although the Minister does not appear to be prepared to accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy&#39;s</inline> proposal, I hope that the Committee will do so. </para>

          <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> has stated that silk is worn universally. I wish to contradict that assertion. In my opinion silk as a dress material partakes very much of the nature of a luxury, and to that extent it is a proper subject for taxation. I am in favour of raising revenue by the taxation of all articles of luxury or of ornamentation. If we admit silk piece goods at the same rate of duty as woollen piece goods, shall we not encroach upon the manufacture of dress materials which can be made in Australia? There are many kinds of dress materials manufactured in Australia, and if silk be placed upon the same level - as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> wishes to place it- </para>

            <para>- If the honorable senator&#39;s contention be correct, we shall admit silk piece goods at the same rate as woollen piece goods, and to that extent shall undermine our woollen industry, which, in the future, we hope will produce a very suitable- article of dress material for ladies. I shall oppose the proposal. </para>

          <para>. - The statement which I made in regard to the general use of silk is one which any honorable senator can verify for - himself. Silk is, proportionately speaking, very little used  in dress, materials. Within &#39; the past few months it has come into vogue to a considerable extent, but as a general rule silk dresses have gone out .of fashion. One sees a black silk dress very rarely now, although at one time it was regarded as the costliest form of dress. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> seems to think that in itself silk is a very costly material. I wish to tell him that it is possible to purchase a light flimsy Japanese silk, which is used for trimming hats, from about 10 1/4d. per yard. That class of silk is required by the poorest woman in the land just as much as it is by the richest. Virtually it occupies the same plane as other dress fabrics which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> erroneously thinks we can produce here. I- wish to assure him that only an exceedingly limited range of-&#39;dress fabrics can be made in the Commonwealth. Already the -revenue derived from this Tariff has greatly exceeded the Treasurer&#39;s anticipations. If we desire to increase that revenue, are we taking it from those persons who can best afford to pay it? &#39; I would remind the Committee that the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> system possesses one advantage in that it adjusts itself. Under that system the expensive article is called upon to contribute to the revenue very much more than the inexpensive article. The lady of fashion who purchases a  &#163;25  silk dress has to pay by way of duty considerably more than the poor woman who purchases a Japanese silk for her children, costing from is. to is. 3d. per yard. I ask the&#39; Vice-President of the Executive Council to report progress. </para>
