                            <para>- Order ! I point out to the honorable senator that clearly that question is a departure altogether from the principle on which a question should be framed. It appears to me to be one by which it 'is sought to bring about a feeling of ridicule and contempt with regard to the administration of a Department. This I do not think should be attempted in the form of a question. </para>

                            <para>- I need hardly say that I am sorry to interpose, even for a few minutes, before the resumption of the consideration of the Tariff: But I -think that honorable senators will feel with me that the matter  to which I propose Vo call attention is of very grave and serious importance, and that constitutes the best apology I can offer for even briefly occupying their attention. ' I believe that they will agree with me that the public mind has become possessed, or is certainly becoming possessed, of what we all feel is .a highly important national need - the taking over of the Northern Territory and its control by the Commonwealth. I think that1 there is a settled feeling on that subject now, and that it will not be satisfied unless at as early a date as possible Parliament has the opportunity of considering and deciding the terms on which that transfer, whose accomplishment is inevitable, shall take place. In view of that, I recently asked a question of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, which I repeated at his courteous invitation at a later date. I must say that the answers which he then gave me, courteous as they were, advanced the matter very little farther, and, indeed, were calculated to fill with considerable concern those who are deeply interested in this question.. My honorable friend's first answer was that the matter would be introduced as soon as the  stale of business on the notice-paper would permit, That is a stereotyped formula to which we are not unaccustomed - it is not meant to tell us anything, and of course it does not. I quite agree that whilst there is a pressure of other business, some matters of more or less public importance must remain in abeyance. But it gives us no indication of when this very vital question - vital in the national interests of Australia - is likely to be brought under the consideration of Parliament. The second answer which my honorable friend gave, in response to an interjection of mine, was that the matter was not likely to be introduced, in fact, that it would not be introduced to this Parliament until the South Australian Bill had received the Royal assent. We all admit that business must' be arranged by the Executive Council according to its importance, , but it is the second answer of the Minister which is of great importance in relation to the consideration and decision of this question. I have adopted this method of moving the adjournment in order that the Minister may have an opportunity of giving a fuller answer, with some explanation in it, and, if I may say so without implying any reflection upon him, a more definite answer. There have been promises for a long time back that this matter would be dealt with at an early date and expeditiously. Those promises have not been fulfilled. I do not make any complaint, nor do I move this motion for the purpose of offering any censure, but it is a fact that promises of the clearest character have been made extending over a considerable time, and' in the most formal and solemn manner. Let me recall to the Minister's recollection the real position of this great national question. The terms were arranged between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> the Prime Minister, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Price,</inline> the Premier of South Australia, about Christmas time in  1906,  and embodied in writing in the form of an agreement between the Commonwealth and the State of South Australia. They contain a stipulation, to which I invite the attention of the Minister and of the Government. </para>

That is essential, because there may be the greatest and widest differences of opinion as to the terms embodied in the agreement. In fact, when it was originally notified to Parliament, and the agreement became a parliamentary paper, indications were given that there was not absolute unanimity in regard to its terms. The Vice-President of the Executive Council will therefore see the urgent necessity of ascertaining whether or not the agreement in its present or any other form is to be adopted by this Parliament. The agreement further stipulated that its terms were not in any way binding - </para>

The next thing 'that happened was that Parliament met in February of last year. On that occasion, owing to the, intended departure of the Prime Minister for London to attend the Imperial Conference, no real business was brought before Parliament, but the arrangement for the control of the Northern Territory was considered of such surpassing importance that in the short speech then made by the Governor-General, it was one of the few subjects, if not the only subject, of . first-class importance mentioned. It was referred to in these terms: - </para>

"Then" meant upon the  return  of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister returned, and Parliament  re-assembled  at the end of June or the beginning of July of last year, but nothing has been done since. I am not putting it,, nor do I ask the Senate to say, that there may not have been difficulties, because on the reassembling of Parliament the other Ch'amber had, after a little while, to undertake the consideration of the Tariff. But I do think - as a senator of South Australia, and having regard also to the national interests of the Commonwealth that in a question of this magnitude an opportunity should have been made for the consideration of the terms of the agreement. South Australia performed her part. She kept her word,' but the Ministry, for reasons that I dare say they felt were sufficient, d\d not keep theirs. South Australia adopted the agreement. </para>

The Ministry in South Australia, carrying out the obligation which rested upon them, introduced the agreement attached to a resolution, in order that Parliament might express its approval of the terms and conditions upon which the transfer was sought to be made to, and accepted by, 'the 'Commonwealth. They desired to secure the approval of their Parliament to those terms before they introduced the Bill. That is what ought to have been done here. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that any question of temper will 'be introduced into the consideration', of a subject of this kind. It is too big a subject. Every man who, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell, is not indisposed to take a large view of these great questions, feels that the Northern Territory must inevitably be taken over by the Commonwealth Parliament. We ought to have an opportunity of dealing with the terms of the agreement. We have had them before us for eighteen months, and if we had that opportunity we should be able to say whether or not we assent to them, or whether we desire to modify them. The course adopted by the South Australian Parliament is an excellent one for us to follow, and I. can see no difficulty in the way of the Government affording the Senate, if not the House of Representatives, an opportunity of dealing with the matter at an early date. If we wait for the Royal Assent to be given to the South Australian Bill, as the Minister's second answer indicated, and this Parliament disapproves of the terms of the agreement, that Bill will simply become waste paper, and all that has been done in South Australia will be as if it had never been done at all . In the meantime, difficulties have arisen in South Australia in connexion with Northern Territory lands, and I saw by the newspapers only the other day that actually litigation is about to begin in connexion with some question of the leasing of lands in the Territory. If we are going to take over the Northern Territory, let us say so at once, and if it is desired that there should be some modification of the terms so far agreed to, let that be said at once. It is only fair that the people of South Australia should be relieved from any uncertainty or suspense, and that this national question, as I call it, should be solved at the earliest possible opportunity. It is for these reasons that I invite the Vice-President of the Executive Council . to give the Senate some definite information on the subject. I ask the honorable senator, to begin with, whether, when the Tariff is disposed of in this Chamber, an opportunity will be afforded of considering the agreement. And, above all, if there is a prospect, as I am sure we all hope there may be, of our having a little relief from our legislative duties. I hope we shall be told that an opportunity will be given, before even that happy event takes place, of dealing with the' agreement. I point out to the Vice-President of the Executive Council the serious importance of the question, not merely as a matter of business, but in view of the desirability of having it settled, not only in the interests of what is best for the Commonwealth, but of giving the Commonwealth that which is urged in many quarters, an opportunity of having control of lands and territory of its own; wherein it can make an effort to develop at least one portion of Australia according to whatever the enlightened policy of the Commonwealth itself may be, irrespective of any State interference. </para>

                        (New South Wales) [11.34]. - The matter which has been sprung on the Senate this morning is undoubtedly one of great consequence, but I venture to say that it does not possess anything like so strong a claim to the consideration of this Chamber or of another place as another question which I shall only name and not argue, and that is the question of the establishment of the Federal Capital.

                        is one of quite recent origin ; and while I admit its importance, I must say that I have never heard any very urgent reason why at a stage of the session when matters are very confused, and a gigantic question like that of the Tariff is still far from settled, we should set aside every other question to consider a matter which, although it may have been deeply studied by

                        and his colleagues in the representation of South Australia, has occupied far less of the attention of honorable senators from the other States than perhaps South Australian senators imagine. I know perfectly well that at the last State election in Queensland the honorable senators who were returned were pledged at almost every meeting to oppose the proposal which has been made.

                            <para>- That is all I propose to do. I repeat that I should oppose the Commonwealth entering into a wild and great proposition, while a constitutional obligation, which is to be found set out. in the Statute creating the Commonwealth, remains undischarged and undecided. The question introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> involves, if it involves anything at all, not only the taking over of the Northern Territory, but heavy financial obligations, including a couple of millions sterling of debts, and also the building of railways which will cost several millions. The building of these railways is a part of the proposition which has been submitted. There is a Northern Territory railway, which some honorable senators desire should be given an easterly curve, that it may be linked up with the railway systems of Queensland and New South Wales - a proposal, in which, by the way, I entirely concur. It will be of no use for the Commonwealth to take over the Northern Territory without some reasonable means of communication with it. We can never secure a reasonable connexion with 'the Territory by water ; whilst a connexion of the railways in the Territory with those of Queensland and New South Wales would be to the advantage of the Commonwealth as a whole. Still, the project is a gigantic one, and the financial obligations it would involve are tremendous, and can only be faced if the Ministry and those who keep them in power are willing to adopt a very different policy of Commonwealth finance than that which has hitherto been followed. We cannot entertain these huge projects until we are prepared to face the inevitable policy of public borrowing. Certainly the cost of the works involved in the proposal which is being discussed, could never be defrayed out of the public revenue. The proposal involves new and great complications and difficulties, and that being so, to argue that there should be immediate action in this matter is unreasonable. The action taken in bringing it forward this morning, as a matter of urgency, is one which I venture respectfully to protest against. It may possess some element of urgency from the South Australian standpoint, but from the Commonwealth standpoint it cannot be said to be urgent as compared with other matters which have been clamouring for settlement, and which if the proper order of precedence be observed should be settled before it. The one which above all these matters I name as demanding the earliest settlement is the question of the Federal Capital. </para>

                            <para>- My surprise was great when I heard from the honorable senator that, in his opinion, this was a matter of urgency, and much greater when I heard him state there had been delay on the part of the Government. I cannot admit that the matter has been hung up by the Government, or that there has been any unreasonable or undue delay in its consideration. I agree that it is a matter of very great importance. I regard it as a gigantic project which is certainly entitled to the deliberate and calm attention of the Senate, certainly not at the closing hours of an extraordinary session, but at a time when we should be in a position to deal with it quietly and deliberately. What has actually taken place so far is this : A provisional agreement was entered into, and months after that, it was taken up by the South Australian Government, and then only at the close of a session of the State Parliament, that is to say, in December last. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so, but the point I was making was that the provisional agreement Had been entered into some eleven or twelve months prior to that, and the South Australian Parliament did not deem it a matter of urgency, or that it  was necessary to deal with it at all until December. If it was considered a matter of urgency there, we might have expected that when the South Australian Parliament met, I think in June, 1907, it would have been one of the first matters dealt with. As I have said, the South Australian Parliament did not attempt to deal with it until December last. </para>

                            <para>- The South Australian Parliament having dealt with the Bill in December last, the Bill was sent on to us and we found that it contained something which we did not altogether approve of, and which we regarded as to some extent a departure from the provisional agreement. Following that, in February last - and we are now only in March - there was a Conference of representatives of the South Australian and Commonwealth Governments, and as a result, it was determined that a Bill should be drafted by the Commonwealth Government, and when drafted should be submitted for the consideration of the Government of South Australia. That Bill is now being drafted, and it is proposed to submit it in the ordinary way to the Government of South Australia for their consideration. As a matter of fact, were not this an extraordinary session, . as. has been hinted by my honorable friend, this Parliament would, at the present moment, be in recess, and the matter could not possibly be dealt with until late in the year. That, of course, was recognised at once by the South Australian Parliament itself. They could not definitely know our arrangements, and could not possibly be aware when we could get the Tariff through. They were fully aware that in the ordinary course of affairs, the Commonwealth Parliament would not deal with it until August or September, or perhaps December next. </para>

                            <para>- At the very earliest, in June. I think that it is obvious, from the action of the South Australian Parliament itself, that there has been no room for reproach on the ground of delay, so far as the Federal Government is concerned. My honorable friend was, I think, hardly fair to the Government in that respect. He must recognise that since we met on the 22nd of January last, we have been absolutely absorbed in the Customs Tariff Bill. This Chamber, at the present moment, is devoting itself incessantly and assiduously to its duties in relation to that measure. The other Chamber was equally absorbed in the Tariff last year. It is true that they saw fit to indulge in a short recess, to which they were reasonably entitled after their arduous labours. </para>

I think it would not. I think, moreover, that it is a matter of such importance that fuller time and consideration will be necessary in order to do justice to the Commonwealth, and, indeed, to South.

                            <para>- We have to do justice to the Northern Territory also- justice to all parties concerned. Under all these circumstances, it would, I think, be misleading the Senate for me to suggest that there is any reasonable prospect of the matter being dealt with this session. I view the prospect hopefully from the way in which honorable senators are concentrating their energies upon finishing the Tariff, and getting rid of what I submit is a subject of infinitely more urgency, although not of greater importance. There are also other important matters with which we  have to deal, one of which has been mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild.</inline> We are keeping faith, to the very letter, with the South Australian Government. We have never suffered the remotest reproach from them. There is nothing which could be suggested by way of urgency which would call upon this Parliament to deal with the subject during the closing hours of this session. While I admit, therefore, that it must take an early place in our business during the next session, I also say that, in the ordinary course, that is the place that it should take, and it is one which, I think, will be satisfactory to all concerned. As far as relates to the assent of the Imperial Government to the Bill passed by the South Australian Parliament, to which my honorable friend has referred, the Government would prefer that assent to be received. But I mentioned to my honorable friend a little while ago. that if he would repeat the question which he asked I should be very glad indeed to give him a definite statement as to whether we would permit the lack of that assent to stand in the way. I have considered that point, and discussed it with the Prime Minister. If other public business did not impose an obstacle, we should have no difficulty in going on with the matter, notwithstanding that the assent has not been obtained. </para>

                            <para>- The Federal Bill, as well as the South Australian measure, will require the Royal assent. Therefore, it is necessary that both Bills should be passed. It would be useless if the Royal assent were given to the one and not to the other. The South Australian Parliament have fulfilled their part of the contract so far as the agreement is concerned. They may have made some alterations which, perhaps, will not be acceptable to the Commonwealth Parliament. But for that reason it is the more necessary that the agreement should be taken up and its conditions considered. This is not a matter of importance simply to South Australia. It is also important to Western Australia, because the matter of the railway to the western border of South Australia is involved in. this same agreement. From my point of view, therefore, the matter is urgent. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has quoted the last paragraph of the agreement, which shows that it was promised that, without delay, the subject would be introduced to Parliament in order that an agreement might be arrived at by the State and the Federal Parliaments. There is a good deal of force in the argument used by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, that there have been very important matters with which this Parliament has had- to concern itself. I think that my colleague will be satisfied with the answer that has been given. We now know definitely that there will be no undue delay, but that as soon as possible this matter will be taken up and dealt with. I am very glad to learn that there is no intention of shelving it, but that it will be handled in a practical way. </para>

But I would add that, so far as the Commonwealth Parliament is concerned, the Tariff is at present the most important piece of legislation that can be dealt with. It was because it was felt that no time ought to be wasted that no member of the party with  which  I am associated has  attempted to urge the Government to do. anything hastily. I, for one, am thoroughly satisfied with the explanation that has been given by the Vice-President of the Executive. Council-, and with the promise that early next session the matter will be dealt with. Every one must admit that this Parliament, in the ordinary course of events, would have prorogued last December, if not at the latter end of November. Neither the Parliament nor the people of South Australia could have expected the. Government to deal with it before June or July next. Consequently, I am thoroughly satisfied with the assurance of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, that the interests of South Australia will be conserved by the consideration of the subject early next session. </para>

                        SYMON (South Australia) [11.56].  - I merely wish to  say,  in withdrawing the motion, that I trust that the Vice-President of the Executive Council will acquit me of any discourtesy in not giving him notice of my intention to bring this subject forward. There were circumstances which made me overlook what otherwise I certainly should have done, in intimating to him before the" Senate met today that I intended to ask the indulgence of' honorable "senators in order to call attention to the subject.

                            <para>- Yes. I do not for one moment suspect my honorable friend and his colleagues of failing to appreciate the great importance of this question. I think that the people of South Australia, as well as the people of the. Commonwealth, will be satisfied with the declaration that my honorable friend has made in respect of his appreciation of the magnitude and national importance of the subject. I am satisfied to have received the intimation that there is no reasonable probability of the agreement being brought under the consideration of Parliament until early next session. My desire was, as I said before, that there' might be a clear and definite intimation that operations in reference to the taking over of the Northern Territory, with which South Australia is so seriously concerned, would not be suspended. I am also satisfied on a point, which gave me a little uneasiness, as to its being considered an essential condition of the consideration of the agreement by this Parliament that the Royal assent should be given to the South Australian Act. I am glad that my honorable friend has informed us that, after consultation with the Prime Minister, nothing of the sort is anticipated, and that, if it were convenient to do so, the matter would be dealt with irrespective of that Royal assent. I am sure that my honorable friend will accept1 my assurance that, the matter being cleared up in that way, satisfaction will be given to those who are interested in the question. and the people of Australia will be enabled to feel that, at the earliest possible moment next session, the whole subject will be brought under consideration. I ask leave to withdraw my motion. </para>

                    <para>.- When the Tariff was introduced in another place the articles mentioned in this paragraph were dutiable at 6d. per lb. in each column of the schedule. Those rates were considered satisfactory by those who are interested in the business, but for some reason or other the House of Representatives reduced the duty against the United Kingdom to 4d. The United Kingdom is the only competitor in this kind of work, and. T do not know why any preference should <inline font-style="italic">b?.</inline> given to it. I am not particular as to whether a request for a higher duty in the first column is carried, or whether the duty in the preferential column is increased ' to 6d.  I hold in my hand a copy of Wise's <inline font-style="italic">Post Office Directory.</inline> Those* who are running this work employ a very small number of men. What their employes do is to take from the municipal, State, and Federal rolls the names and addresses of the residents in the various towns of the different States, and to get other information that is compiled by municipal and Government officials, and also Australian advertisements. The information and the matter is printed in1 England, because it can be printed more cheaply there than in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. These people have the work printed in England, because I understand that in Australia there is no firm which is prepared to undertake the publication of this directory at the price which Wise's people are prepared to pay. As it is intended to be a purely Australian publication, as its income is derived in Australia, and as the Government assist indirectly in procuring much of the information embodied in the work, there is no reason why, if Wise's people will not have it printed in Australia, they should not be made to pay for having it printed abroad. No doubt honorable senators are aware that there is published in Victoria a directory known as Sands and McDougall's Directory. In connexion with that work a large army of men is employed year in and year out who, unlike Wise's men, do not go to the municipal, State, and Federal rolls for information, but from house to house. A special duty intrusted to the men is to ascertain who lives at a certain house, and what their occupation is, and I warrant that all the information contained in Sands -and McDougall's Directory can be taken as absolutely reliable. The firm, therefore, are handicapped in that respect because they have to pay for the information which they obtain by these methods, whereas Wise's people obtain the information indirectly through the expenditure of effort and energy by the various authorities. </para>

                    <para>. - Originally the Government proposed a duty of 6d. per lb. on Australian directories, guides, and time-tables, that is, directories, guides and time-tables the contents of which related particularly and practically solely to residents in. Australia and other matters of Australian concern. It has been recognised by the Government for a long time that the very undesirable practice has been followed of getting much of this material printed abroad, and, as the honorable senator said, the printing has so far been confined to the United Kingdom. When the Tariff was submitted elsewhere a proposition was made by the Government to impose a duty of 6d. per lb. on all such printed matter. Some very strong representations were made to the Minister of Trade and Customs by deputations which waited upon him before the proposal was considered in the other House. But he announced emphatically that the Government desired to discourage as far as they possibly could the printing of such matter abroad because it peculiarly relates to Australia and therefore should be printed in our midst. If there is any printing that local printers who have erected buildings and established plants might justly expect to be called upon to do it is the printing of directories, guides, and books for Australian purposes. Under the circumstances we should like to see the duty of 6d. per lb. as originally introduced by the Government adhered to, and will support a request to make the duty6d. all round without any preference to the United Kingdom. </para>

                <para class="block">As the item now stands, newspapers are not exempt under it. While the item bore a duty, " newspapers registered for transmission through the post " were excepted from it by its wording, but when it was made free, "newspapers registered for transmission through the post " became excepted from the "free" provision, also by the very wording of the paragraph. The amendment which I propose will make the paragraph operative only up to the 9th December, 1907, and so newspapers registered for transmission through the post will fall, as they ought to, under item 371, and be free. The wording which I have proposed will still validate the collection of the duty up to and including the 9th December. </para>

All modern educationists regard drawing as an essential, on the same level as reading, writing, and arithmetic.

                    (Tasmania- Minister of Home Affairs [12.27]. - I am not aware whether cartridge paper is used to any great extent in children's exercise books, but the better classes of cartridge paper are used for drawing. Cartridge paper is being, and can be very easily, manufactured in the Commonwealth. There is, therefore, no reason to omit it from this item and exclude it from the policy of protection.

                        Ledger has probably moved this request with the idea of conveying the impression that Australian school children are to be handicapped by a duty upon cartridge paper. Probably he believes that Australia is not capable of turning out paper suitable for drawing at a price acceptable to those who require it. But the mills in Australia are turning, out an article equal in quality and as reasonable in price as that imported.

If I were to refuse protection to an industry because it is alleged to have become, or to be becoming, a trust, I should be untrue to the principles upon which I was re-' turned. I ask that this industry should be given protection, and if the free-traders opposite are anxious to put down trusts let them help the Labour Party in their efforts to nationalize industries in order that they may be controlled and managed by the people. For the edification of these anti-Australians who are always declaring that we cannot in Australia turn out certain articles and commodities. I wish to exhibit samples of paper turned out by the paper mills in Australia which will be found equal in quality to and as reasonable in price as the paper manufactured by any firms abroad. </para>

                    <para>. - I think the point is being missed. The question is not whether this paper can be manufactured in Australia ; and I take this opportunity of saying that I have never used that argument in dealing with any duty. It is not denied that this cartridge paper is very largely used in all schools as drawing paper, and that being so,I am entitled to ask the Committee to permit as much freedom as possible in the use of it. If honorable senators are not willing to make it absolutely free of duty, on the ground that some cartridge paper is being made in Australia - and I do not know that that can be proved - I am entitled, at any rate, to ask that we should not impose a duty of½d. per lb. on it. If it will satisfy the Government or my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> who is now looking after the interests of the Paper Trust, I am willing as a compromise to agree to a percentage duty in this case, but I think it should represent very much less than½d. per lb. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator must know that the duty on strawboard is one of the highest duties in the Tariff, as on the lower qualities it runs up to 60 or 70 per cent. What is more, whether the duty is imposed for that purpose or not its effect is certainly to fatten one wealthy man at the expense of every box manufacturer in Australia. </para>

I say that there is in Australia to-day in connexion with this industry no stronger or more perfect combine or trust than that which exists in connexion with the manufacture of paper. Not only do the proprietors come together, but when a mill was recently started in Sydney an arrangement was made under which Australia was divided into the particular spheres of operation to be worked by the Melbourne and Sydney concerns respectively. </para>

                        <para>- What honorable senators are doing now is to put the manufacturers in a position to levy toll upon the people .who require to use their products as the raw materials of the industry in which they are engaged.. The manufacturers of paper have not the decency to rest content with a duty of 25 or . 30 per cent, on the article, but do not hesitate to ask for 50 per cent. .' Why, the daughters of the horse leech were never in it with the people who run these particular concerns. I do hot wish to mention the name of any firm, but they are known, and their - representatives have been seen around the lobbies of this building within recent hours. The first objection  1  take to the duty proposed is that being a fixed duty upon an article the value of which varies very much it is comparatively low, I should say as low as or 15 per cent., on some qualities of the article produced, whilst on other qualities it is a .tremendously heavy duty. </para>

I wish, the Committee, .seeing that ' the industry .is fairly established, to assent to a proposition that a duty of .25 or 30 per pent, would afford sufficient protection. </para>

                        <para>- That is not the point. We have here to deal with a trust that is doing remarkably well, and there  is only one power at present by which we can do so, until our anti-trust law is put on a better footing, and that is, whilst giving them a reasonable measure of protection to make it impossible for them to unduly fleece the consumer. That they will fleece the consumer to some extent I have not the slightest doubt. </para>

I have to submit a practical proposal. Under a duty of 25 per cent, the industry ought to be able to develop. One of the representatives of the manufacturers, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDougall,</inline> declared that a duty of is. was equal to only 12½ per cent. Of course that is not the truth. It was true so far as regarded one quality, but it did not apply to the whole range of qualities. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable senator who has just resumed his seat has referred to this duty as penalizing a number of persons who are using strawboard. Perhaps it would be as well to traverse briefly the history of this industry in Victoria. Before any strawboard was made here the cheapest that could be obtained cost £17 per ton. The Victorian Parliament imposed a duty of £4 per ton. That, according to the reasoning of honorable senators opposite, should have made the price£21 per ton. But what it really did was to reduce the price to £12. It established the manufacture in this country of an article which was sold for less than the price of the imported material. The effect upon the consumer was therefore to put £5 per ton into his pocket, and also to put £4 into the revenue. I have a perfect recollection of these facts and they cannot be disproved. </para>

                        <para>- I shall not deal with that point, because it has been sufficiently discussed. The allegation has been made that the finer qualities of strawboard suitable for the manufacture of the smaller, kinds- of boxes cannot be made in this country - that, in fact, the card made "is not good enough. It has been said, for instance, that jewellery boxes cannot be made of it. I hold in my hand a jewellery box made from Broadford card. As far as I am able to judge it is as good as could be obtained anywhere, and as small as could be desired. I wish, to intimate that when the present request is disposed of, I intend to submit one in favour of an increase., of duty in the general Tariff column. I do not propose to affect the duty against the United Kingdom. </para>

                        <para>- In this country it is made from ordinary wheaten  and oaten  straw. I intend to propose that .the dub be 2s. per cwt. under the 'general Tariff. I should move that it be 2s. 6d.,  but as an- .  other' place reduced the duty from 2s. 6d. to 1s. 6d., I think there is  a  better prospect of a duty of 2s. being agreed to. No duty could be too high upon this product, be'-, cause it is made from  a  raw material which is frequently permitted to rot because there is no use for it in Australia. </para>

So that we have these facts combined - that strawboard is now immensely cheaper because of the- local manufacture; that a considerable number of persons are provided with employment in its manufacture; and that at least one capitalist is making immense profits out of the industry. Surely these are effects which  we should like to see increased. </para>

He said that the existing duty was in the interest of a paper combine or trust, and that since it had been formed the price of strawboards had been increased. So far as my information goes, there is no . combine, or trust. It is true that in  1895  there were in Victoria three mills known as the Barwon Paper Mills, the Broadford. Paper Mills, and the Melbourne Paper Mills. They have been formed into one company, and duly registered under the Companies Act, and the statement that has been made frequently here and elsewhere that it is an industry run . entirely by Sands and McDougall is absolutely incorrect. It is true that about twenty years ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDougall,</inline> of that firm, looking into the future, and anticipating it too rapidly, embarked in the strawboard mill industry located at Broadford. I am informed that he invested no less than£50,000, and. like many men who do the pioneering work in particular lines of commercial enterprise, he, so to speak, blazed the track, but he suffered a considerable loss. However, during that period the industry has had a somewhat varied career. With the small measure of protection which it has had, it has succeeded, but not succeeded to that extent which every well-wisher of Australian industry would desire. It has had to contend against manifestly unfair competition. Those who advocate free- trade principles trot out, not infrequently, the argument that many industries have a very great natural protection in the charges that are made for the carrying of particular commodities. In one of the circulars which have been sent to honorable senators by a Sydney firm, the statement is made that the freight on strawboard equals  £2  a ton. </para>

                        <para>- This is an industry which deserves every . encouragement. It is a natural and a primary industry. The farmers have received a very great advantage by its establishment at Broadford. Those engaged in the wood industry are materially concerned in its progress. As much as  £4,000  a year is paid to the woodmen in and around the district. And, apart from what is paid to the lime-burners, as much as  £5,000  a year is paid to the farmers for the straw. In fact, over <inline font-style="italic">£6,000</inline> a year is paid in wages to those engaged in the industry. </para>

                        <para>- I got the information from those who are directly concerned in the mill which I, in conjunction with others senators, visited last Saturday. I did not count the hands, but I do not doubt for a moment that there are  82  engaged in the factory. It is worked on the three-shifts system. There is no doubt that, with the additional protection for which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> asks, the strawboard from Holland and Japan will not have such a big market, and the local industry will be in a far better position than hitherto it has teen in. I am informed, that recently the New South Wales Government called for tenders for the supply of a certain quantity of strawboard. Three tenders were received, namely, one from Victoria, one from japan, and one from Holland. The price of the Victorian tenderer was  £8 10s.  a ton ; the Japan tenderer asked  £7 2s.  6d. a ton, while the price of the Holland tenderer was  £7  a ton. Although there is a duty of  30s.  a ton on strawboard, still the representative of the Holland mill was able to put in a tender at  £1 10s.  less than the Victorian price, and the Holland tenderer quoted  2s.  6d. a ton less than the Japanese tenderer. Last night, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> pointed out how acute the competition is becoming in respect of the Japanese, who are engaged in certain lines of industry; he exhibited calendars that were printed at Yokohama; and no doubt what is taking place in regard to the printing trade there is occurring in almost every line of industry in Japan. Japanese, it is said, are now extensively engaged in the making of strawboard. There is no reason why the Committee, having declared in favour of a protectionist policy, should not give to this industry that protection to which it is entitled. Last year we imported about  £24,000  worth of strawboard from Holland and Japan. </para>

                        <para>- There is no bogy about Japan. The very fact that a Japanese mill tendered to the New South Wales Government for the quantity which it required recently shows conclusively that. Japan as a competitor is not a bogy, but an actuality. The wages in Holland are in some cases about a quarter of those paid in Australia, while the hours run' from twelve or fourteen per day. In Japan they are from twelve to sixteen, and we know that the wages there are only from 6d. to is. per day. </para>

                        <para>- To show, from an industrial point of view, what increased protection given to the manufacturer means, since the imposition of this higher duty by another place the hours of the employes at Broadford have been reduced from twelve to eight per day, which means to those who have embarked their capital in the industry a further expenditure ' in wages of considerably over £1,000 per year. Therefore with the eight hours system and better wages, and the fact that the industry has never been on what might be called a substantial basis, the measure of protection which it asks for ought to be readily given. They are making at Broadford a board equal in quality to any imported either from Holland or Japan. The users of the boards have no fault to find with their quality, but some folks in Sydney are complaining about being handicapped owing to the suggested increase. It is remarkable that we have heard .few, if any, complaints from any "Victorian boxmakers about it. The. wail comes from New South Wales, the State which has for a considerable period been wedded to the free-trade fallacy. </para>

This is an industry, anyhow, that deserves encouragement. It has had to struggle for existence, .and has demonstrated that an article equal, and in some cases superior, to the imported, can be turned out, while since its establishment wages have been increased, hours have been reduced, and the users of the commodity have been in no way disadvantaged. </para>

                    <para>. -  1 do not intend to give a silent vote on this item. I intend strenuously to oppose <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> request, and to support the one which will be moved to increase the duty. I am not afraid to say that in company with other honorable senators I visited the strawboard mill at Broadford last Saturday. I  was pleasantly surprised to see the conditions obtaining there. My visit removed from my mind the idea that I had regarding the insanitary and offensive conditions that sometimes obtain in -similar manufactures. The occupation is very clean and healthy as conducted in the Broadford mill. If there is a natural industry in Australia, the manufacture of strawboards .is essentially one. I see no reason why we should have only one mill throughout this great Commonwealth. I believe that if the protection is increased it will lead to the establishment of similar mills in the agricultural portions of Australia. I have here a copy of the circular from F uerth and Nail Limited, from which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has endeavoured to make great capital, regarding the statement made to the Tariff Commission by the manufac- 'turers of strawboard that if the protection was increased, they would not increase the price of their product. I admit that they have since increased the price, but that was due, not in any way to the increased protection, but to conditions over which neither they nor any one else in Australia had control. </para>

                            never asked me to make this statement. I am speaking from what I saw. I went to the mill last Saturday in order that I might be able to deal with the subject the more intelligently when it came before the Committee. Every member has not a technical knowledge of all the industries which the schedule touches, and it is our duty, if we have the time, to make investigations 011 the spot in order to satisfy ourselves as to the conditions obtaining, and the probable results of any duties that we may impose. Reference has often been made in the discussion on this schedule to the new protection. It has been stated that it will never be put into effect by the Government, or by the manufacturers who are receiving increased protection. But in .this case the manufacturers, immediately the. duty was increased gave the benefit of it to their employes.

For those reasons I shall vote against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> request, and support the highest possible duty that can be imposed, not only in order to protect the manufacturers in the Broadford mill, but in the hope that the industry will be established in every agricultural centre in Australia. The principal components of strawboard are straw, lime, and alkali, and its manufacture gives work, not only to the men engaged in the mill, but to those who cut and ca.rt the timber, and burn the lime. </para>

                        <para>- I was coming to that. It was stated positively that the manufacture of strawboard is largely an automatic affair, and does not require the employment of many hands. On the other hand, the box industry in Australia employs at least 6,000 hands. To set up a demand for high rates of duty on behalf - to put the figure as high as we can - of somewhere between fifty and sixty adults and lads, who, according to the protectionist theory, are to be benefited while 6,000 other persons are to be injured, is a proposition that does not appeal to me. ' On me principle of the greatest good to the greatest number, I shall certainly' vote against a high rate of duty, and in favour of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> rather extravagant proposal. I wanted him to move something lower. I think his proposal is extravagant, but I must vote for it, as the best filing that offers. This tax is not opposed merely by a few honorable senators from New South Wales and other States. It was opposed before - the Tariff Commission by the South Australian boxmakers, in. whose interest <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Silver</inline> gave evidence; the Victorian Master Printers' Association, represented bv <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pratt;</inline> by Alexander Auslebrook. of Brisbane: by the New South Wales Printers and Boxmakers' Association : and by a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Firth,</inline> who is in business in a very large way as a box manufacturer. </para>

                    They do not want anything. of the kind, and the honorable senator's statement is not only extravagant, but inaccurate. On the item which we are now discussing, they have made a simple request, that the duty should be 15 per cent,
                    <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem.</inline>
                    I believe that that would be a fair thing in the interests of. all concerned, but as
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline>
                    has moved a request for a duty of 25 per cent., it should certainly receive the support of honorable senators who do not desire to crush a widely-spread industry for the salce of one Victorian combine. . In addressing the Committee,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline>
                    denied that there was a trust in the paper manufacturing business, but by way of interjection, when
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline>
                    was speaking, he said that the effect of the proposed duties would be to bring other competitors into the field who would destroy or crush the trust. The honorable senator gave away his own panorama by absolutely contradicting himself. One minute there was no trust, and five minutes afterwards there was a trust to be crushed. That is typical of the brilliant but very unconvincing oratory to which we have been treated on this item. However, we can quite understand the enthusiasm displayed by a few gentlemen who were the happy guests of this combine last week. We all know the influence of environment, and recognise the unconscious bias which may be created by hospitalities courteously extended. It should not be forgotten that the boxmaking trade is one winch affects almost every retail industry throughout the Commonwealth, since these paper boxes are very largely displacing the everlasting brown paper and string to which, some time ago, we were accustomed. When the Tariff was first introduced in August last, and the duty was fixed at as.

I do not know what the Victorian boxmakers Bid then, but let us hope that they were fair, and did likewise. There has been so much said, and very well said, by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> on this subject that I shall not repeat any of his statements, or attempt to enlarge upon any of his arguments. I have, however, felt it to be my duty, before his request is put to a vote, to bring under the notice of the Committee the matters to which I have so briefly referred. </para>

                    <para>. - Before we go to a division, 1 should like to give the Committee the benefit of some information I have received on this important question. Honorable senators opposite have several times called for the authority upon which statements have been made from this side, and my authority for the information which T propose to give the Committee is a circular issued by the Queensland Master Printers and Allied Trades Association. I do not suppose that the conclusions at which they have arrived after careful consideration, or any speech I may make on the subject, will influence a vote, but I still think it is right that information supplied by so responsible a body, comprised of men who may be supposed to know all about this business, should be placed before the Committee. I take the opportunity of saying that the circular seems to me to fully confirm the judicious, and, indeed, the moderate, proposal submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> I quote the following from the circular :  - </para>

                            however, is of opinion that a duty of is. 6d. is not sufficient. These conflicting views seem to show that it would be well to adhere to what was agreed upon in another place. When the Tariff Commission were investigating matters in relation to this industry, they received evidence to show "that a duty of is. per cwt. was not sufficient. They recommended a duty of 2s., and the Government proposed a duty of 2s. against the United Kingdom, and 2s. 6d. against imports from foreign countries. Representations were made to the effect that cardboard box manufacturers, portmanteaux makers, and bookbinders depended very largely on strawboard as a raw material. These people said that if strawboard were made dearer, they would hardly be enabled to compete against outside manufacturers. Accordingly, the House of Representatives made the duty is. . 6d. all round. I trust that that decision will be maintained, notwithstanding the 'divergent views expressed as to the inadequacy or supersufficiency of the duty.

                    <para>. - It has to be remembered that the strawboard with which we are dealing is the completed article. But bookbinders and boxmakers use strawboard simply as a raw material. They have shown a desire to meet the strawboard manufacturers in a fair and reasonable manner. Ever since 1902, the duty on strawboard has been is. per cwt. I believe that that was a very fair compromise between the manufacturers of this article and those who use it. 1 am prepared to stand by the Tariff of 1902. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> win withdraw his present proposal, and move one to the effect that the House of Representatives be requested to make the duty is., I shall support him. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not agree with the proposal of the Minister to 'delete these articles from this item with a view to admitting them under paragraph  n  free from the "United Kingdom and at 5 per cent, from other countries. If we can make strawboard here for every kind of purpose, why cannot we make cardboard and pasteboard which at present are dutiable at 20 and 15 per cent. ? Where does the consistency come in in transferring these articles from one paragraph to the other? I am not looking at this proposal from the stand-point of a mill-owner or- a printer, but from a national aspect. It is just as easy to make cardboard and pasteboard here as it is to make strawboard, But they are not likely to be made locally unless a protective duty is imposed. It seems that there is an eleventh hour kind of unanimity in respect of this request. Strong representations were made to the Tariff Commission in favour of the imposition of a protectionist duty in the interests of those who make 'straw and other boards, and now, when we are nearing the end of our labours on the Tariff, Ave are confronted with a request desiring the articles to be made dutiable at 5 per cent, in the general Tariff and admitted free from the United Kingdom. I have no objection to them being admitted free under departmental by-law, but if we are going to start admitting them free in that way, on the representation of certain interested printers, then every printer from A to Z will be entitled to make a similar representation, because he requires certain kinds of board. I am rather surprised at the attitude of the Government, because ' if we yield to every representation that is made in respect of reduced duties, we shall get ourselves into a very funny position indeed. From a protectionist point of view, it would be much more advisable for the Government to allow these articles to come in under departmental by law than to admit . them free from the United Kingdom, and at 5 per cent, from other countries. </para>

                        <para>- I think that we ought to take the testimony of those who are interested in the trade. If the mill-owners had felt that it would do' them any injury, they would not have consented to this proposal. The fact is that cardboard and pasteboard are not made here, and, therefore, there is no reason why duties of 20 and 15 per cent, should be imposed. I am very glad indeed that the Minister has seen fit to move the request, because otherwise I should have done so. This is not a question of giving protection because an industry does not exist. </para>

                    <para>. - If that is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley's</inline> object, then the course he now proposes is not the right one to take. Where departmental by-laws are mentioned, certain items are subjected to duty or made free as prescribed for certain purposes set out. The Department thereupon proceeds to frame its by-laws to give effect to that provision: If we inserted here a request for the free admission of cardboard and pasteboard for boxmaking, printing, and kindred trades, as prescribed by departmental by-law, the question of their production within the Commonwealth would never arise, and no by-law could be framed under that provision to say that the duty should cease, or that the articles should be dutiable under another heading, when their production had been sufficiently established in the Commonwealth. It would be necessary for the honorable senator, in order to achieve his object, to move that the articles should be dutiable at the lower rate, until a proclamation was issued stating that the local manufacture was sufficiently established to supply the needs of the Commonwealth. </para>

I wish now to find out whether the Minister is going to support this absurd request. If he is we might just as well attach this pious declaration to every article in the Tariff. I hope that the Minister will not permit the Tariff to be disfigured by attaching such an absurd declaration to the duties on this article when it really amounts to nothing. I should like to hear whether the honorable senator proposes to carry out the original idea of the Government in this matter. </para>

The honorable senator has suggested that I require a compass to find my way about, and- that is about the most ungentlemanly observation that I have listened to since I have been a member of the Senate. In view of what has taken place in the last few minutes, it is extraordinary that an honorable senator who has occupied so much of the time to-day should talk of the necessity of compasses for any other member of the Committee. <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator Findley</inline> has himself  made use of three or four different compasses and has called, amongst others, on the members of the Government to help him to explain a matter he did not understand. I think that when an honorable senator has nothing to say on a' subject he should leave the debate to those who know something about it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> is influenced by too great self-esteem and has a habit of looking down upon other honorable senators. I hope that in future he will treat other honorable senators differently. When other honorable senators desired to speak he called for a division, although he had previously wasted half an hour himself, and then he got up to speak again when he did not know for the life of him what he was talking about. </para>

The Minister came forward with an intelligible proposition in asking the Committee to take certain articles out of one item that they might  fall into a subsequent item. Honorable senators were with him in the proposal he made, but before it is carried into effect, because of a frown or a threat from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> he immediately withdraws and tries to compromise in some way by attaching this particular useless and solemn provision with respect to a proclamation which involves practically the passing of an Act of Parliament. </para>

Everything was going on satisfactorily until Ministers inspired by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> took up a new position. I have personally done all I could to assist Ministers in passing the Tariff, but when they go out of their way to accept a proposal, to which they were previously opposed, involving the imposition of duties on articles which cannot be manufactured here, honorable senators on this side have a perfect right to enter a protest. We agreed with the proposal at first submitted by the Government. </para>

Certainly if a duty of  5  per cent, is imposed on those imported from foreign countries, it must necessarily have the effect of diverting trade to Great Britain. I therefore hope that the Committee will see the wisdom of adhering to the duty. </para>
