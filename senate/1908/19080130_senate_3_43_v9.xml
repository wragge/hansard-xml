                        <para>- Referring to a statement appearing in this morning's news-  papers to the effect that the Government have practically terminated negotiations with the London County Council for the acquisition of a site in the Strand for Commonwealth Offices in London, and are now directing Captain Collins to open negotiations with a view to acquiring a site elsewhere, I should like to ask whether the information supplied by the press is correct, and, if so, whether the Vice-President of the Executive Council will give honorable senators his assurance that before any negotiations on the subject have been completed the Senate will be consulted? </para>

                        <para>- The position of the matter is that no further developments have really taken place. The London County Council have not accepted our offer for the site originally suggested. The Council's plan which has been referred to was forwarded to Captain Collins for our information. It is scarcely likely that any additional offer will be <inline font-style="italic">made to the</inline> London County Council. I have no doubt whatever that if any negotiations take place for another site the Senate will be consulted before they are completed. </para>

                        <para>- The question concerns the - Department of the Minister of , Trade and Customs,, and if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> will give notice of it I have no doubt that he will be furnished bv my honorable colleague with an answer. However, I should like to say in regard to the first statement that I noticed another state7 ment in the Hobart <inline font-style="italic">Mercury,</inline> of Monday or Tuesday last, to the effect that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, as. Minister of Trade and Customs, had hurried over to Tasmania at the time of the Federal elections and informed the fruit-growers that the Commerce Act regulations would not be carried out, and further that I had made a promise, which the newspaper described as a " tacit" promise, that the Act would not be enforced, and that in consequence of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne's promise and my tacit promise I was permitted to go back to the Senate. I wish to describe these statements of the <inline font-style="italic">Mercury</inline> as unmitigated untruths. I made no such promise as that which has been attributed to me. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne did not visit Tasmania until a month or five weeks after the elections, and he then reiterated what I had previously said, that in the early days of the administration of the Commerce Act it would not be administered harshly, and that its provisions would be brought into force gradually until the people should become accustomed to them. But as for saying that the provisions of the Commerce Act would not be carried out, or the regulations under -it enforced, that is a misstatement, though whether made designedly or not I am unable to say. Perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> will give notice of the question he has asked. </para>

I am under the impression that in such cases it is necessary that the papers should be laid on the table of the Senate. Papers were laid on the table yesterday relating to the classification of some position in the Public Service, and that, I know, was done pursuant to statute. If that be so, the provision, if applicable, will no doubt be followed in the case referred to by the honorable senator, but whether it is the law or not I shall have the matter brought under the notice of the Public Service Commissioner in order that, as far as possible, what the ' honorable senator desires may be done. </para>

            <para>Wales) [2.45]. - I desire to call attention to an unfortunate misprint which appears in the last proof number of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I have never had occasion to take exception to the accuracy of our <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports, but unfortunately a misprint has crept into the last issue, and as it affects other honorable senators besides myself, perhaps I may be permitted to mention it with a view to rectifying the error by substituting the proper word for the one which is employed. I am represented as having said on 23rd January, page 7581. </para>
            <para>Before this Chamber has done with the Tariff, if I understand the feelings of honorable senators on this side at all, we will give the Government another drag along, and put a few more protectionist spokes into the Ministerial wheel. </para>
            <para>The word which I did use - and the context clearly shows it - was not " protectionist " but" preference. " A slip has evidently been made by the linotype operator. As the use of the word "protectionist" to a certain extent reflects upon other honorable senators sitting upon this side of the Chamber as well as upon myself, I think it best to mention the matter thus publicly lest I may be challenged hereafter with having made the statement. </para>

                        <para>- Without replying to the interjection I may say that I had no opportunity of revising the proof of my speech upon the occasion in question, because I was not in Melbourne when it was issued. I look upon the error purely as a misprint, and not as a mistake on the part of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reporters, who certainly do their work in the most admirable fashion. I am sure it would not be proper for me to say one word about the manner in which they discharge their duties, because it has never been questioned and never will be. But the word in the extract which I have quoted should certainly be "preference" and not " protectionist." </para>

            <para class="block">I shall not occupy a long time in arguing this or any other motion that I may deem it proper to submit in relation to the Tariff ; but the proposal is a large increase upon the previous duty, and candles must be regarded as necessary appliances in connexion with one of our most important primary industries - mining. The proposed duty will not only affect the households of the people, but most seriously affect the mining industry of Australia; and as it is quite clear from the figures placed before the Senate that the Tariff is yielding a very much larger revenue than it was expected to yield, notwithstanding reductions made in another place,, it seems to me that I am submitting a very mild proposal when ' I seek to reduce the duty by £d. per lb., and to such an extent give some relief to the mining industry, which employs an infinitely larger number of workers than the candle industry of the Commonwealth is ever likely to do. For every man employed in making candles, ' there are a hundred employed in using them. Such a form of protection as is here proposed may be all very well for -a few people living about a city, but it is painfully antagonistic to the development of the great mineral resources of the Commonwealth, which, while very profitable occasionally,, are nevertheless extremely uncertain, and more often leave a loss than a profit on the outlay. The mining industry ought not to be singled out specially to tear a heavy burden, seeing that the results of that industry are so uncertain. </para>

I do so because I know that the principal import of candles comes from foreign countries, particularly Germany. Therefore any preference that we may offer to England is reasonable, as encouraging trade with Australia's chief customer and only banker. </para>

                    <para>- I quite understand that, they come from Belgium and the Netherlands as well as from Germany. Although it is some years since I was in active commerce, I am an old importer. I handled candles as well as other merchandise years ago. Although I have not the remotest interest in the matter now, and have not been asked by anybody to bring this proposal forward, I may say that twenty years and more ago I fought in the Parliament of my own State for the reduction of a proposed duty on candles for exactly the same reason as I am put- ' ting forward now - the interests of the great mining industry of Australia. </para>

                    <para>- I know that electricity is creeping into a few of the mines. Some of the great mines in Western Australia are no doubt lit with electricity, as are some of the coal mines of New South Wales. It is possible that in some of the other large mines of Australia electricity is being used. But the great bulk of mining exploration is done with the help of candles, and the great majority of the hardy, hard-working prospecting miners who sink shafts on chance, in the hope of good results, are . large consumers of candles. The candle stuck in a bit of clay and clamped against the side of the shaft or drive is what we have all recognised many and many a time when we have been looking around those interesting efforts of human industry. It is ' exceedingly undesirable to burden a primary industry, such as mining is, with so heavy- an increase as 100 per cent, upon the duty hitherto paid. I am asking for a reduction of the. proposed increase by a Half. I shall not elaborate the matter. If the case is not a good one, it will not be supported, but I am inclined to think that there are enough senators present to carry the motion. </para>

                    <para>. - A good case can certainly be made out for the candle industry. Prior to the imposition of the original Commonwealth Tariff there obtained in four of the States a duty of 2d. per lb., in another of the States a duty of, I think, 25 per cent., and in New Zealand a duty of 2d. ; 2d. per lb. was the recognised  duty.  In the Commonwealth Tariff the duty was reduced to id, Largely as the result of that reduction the candle industry has been struggling, and indeed was one of the strangled industries in connexion with which a revision of the Tariff was asked for. </para>

                <para class="block">That is the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kitchen</inline> ; and it is for honorable senators to accept it for what it is worth. I can only testify that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kitchen</inline> is a gentleman of repute, whose word may be relied on in this connexion. I do not think that he would jeopardize his position, or his indus try, by any misrepresentations. This industry was the subject of investigation by the Tariff Commission, and the protectionist section, recognising it to be a struggling industry in regard to which a duty of i.d. was riot sufficient to enable it to be carried on at a profit, recommended a duty of ad. The free-trade section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 20 per cent., which I think, though I cannot say definitely, is equal to a duty of about id. I may point out that the imports in 1903 were 3,352,000 lbs. ; in 1904 they were 3,444,700 lbs. ; in 1905 they were 3,211,600 lbs.; and in 1906 they were </para>

                    lbs. Honorable senators may suggest that the cause of the reduction in the imports was the progress of the industry and its rehabilitation; but such is not the case. I have made inquiries at the Customs Department, and I am assured that the reduction is not a Tariff effect. Honorable senators will observe the consistency of the importations from 1903 to 1905.

                        <para>- The three years I have cited conclusively show the hold that the importers have obtained on the market ; and it is not from' the United Kingdom that the fiercest competition comes. As a matter of fact, the United Kingdom supplied only 130,000 lbs. in 1906 as compared with 1,720,000 lbs. imported from Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands, which practically command .the import trade. Bearing in mind the fact that stearine is a large basis for the production of candles, and that stearine is a product of tallow, 878,699 cwt. of which was exported from Australia in 1906. I invite honorable senators to say that this is essentially a native industry which should supply every candle we burn. </para>

I can, of course, make further inquiry, and so ascertain the cause. However, it is clear that this industry is not effectively protected as it should be; and, under the circumstances, I trust honorable senators will retain the duty as now proposed. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia) [3.7] - I do not like to allow this item to go to a vote without briefly stating my view. Whatever our fiscal opinions may be, we are all animated, I think by a desire to redress anomalies, and remedy any mischief or injury that may have been created by any peculiarity in the duties. At any rate, that is my view, except in regard to duties on foods and other items of that kind. Candles are a purely manufactured article, ana were said to be one of the causes of the outcry in relation to strangled industries. This is a pure matter of business, and not one of feeling ; and we are entitled to know before we vote, where is the evidence that the candle industry was strangled under the duty of1d. It is quite clear that there is no evidence of it in that authoritative compendium known as the Tariff Commission's Reports; otherwise the Vice-President of the. Executive Council would have quoted it for our information. In lieu of any evidence of the kind, the Minister produces a letter from the monopolistic candle maker of Australia,

                        <para>- We  ought to object to this lobbying. This is not the way in which information should be given to the Committee. The statement is entirely one-sided, coming from an interested source, and very vague. The writer says that a majority of the candlemakers were not able to make ends meet. We have no evidence of that. Any person may make a statement of that kind. But are we to vote for huge duties to put additional profits into the pockets of those who make statements which we have no means of checking? </para>

                        <para>- The cry was that industries were being strangled and ruined ; that the pattering of bare feet was heard. But when we ask for evidence that an industry will be ruined without further protection, we are met by the exclamation- " Are we to wait until industries are ruined?" Statistics show that the candle-making industry has thriven under a duty of1d. per lb. In 1902 the importation of candles was about 2,000,000 lbs., and in 1903 increased to over 3,000,000 lbs., but in 1906 it decreased by one-half. In the interval a uniform duty of1d. per lb. had been imposed, and, presumably, up-to-date machinery installed, and therefore local manufacturers were in 1906 able to prevent importations to the extent of  50  per cent. I hope that the duty will not be increased on the faith of a statement such as that contained in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kitchen's</inline> letter. We wish to do what is fair and just in these matters, and therefore I am willing to listen to any evidence that may be given in regard to the state of any industry. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kitchen,</inline> who seems to have almost a monopoly of candle-making in the Commonwealth, appears to be also a manufacturer of stearine, and the candle manufacturers of Tasmania, instead of asking that the duty on imported candles may be doubled, ask for protection against him. He is filling his purse, so to speak, from two sources, and desires, not only the doubling of the duty on imported candles, but also the doubling of the duty on imported stearine. The Tasmanian manufacfacturers protest against the increasing of taxation on their raw material, and in a circular, a copy of which has, I presume, been sent to other honorable senators, say - </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator asserted yesterday that twenty hands was a large number, and that if only one man was employed in an industry he was entitled to be protected. As my. honorable friend is a gentleman of imagination, he may imagine, if he likes, that in this case  1,000  hands were employed. </para>

                <para>Two of these were in Tasmania, and one  in  New South Wales -  they are ruined industries -  while another small firm in Sydney has informed the writer that their machines' are practically idle, they giving their attention to the manufacture of other goods, as the candle department did not pay. Thus you will see that if the increase from½d. to1d. per lb. is insisted on, then every small candle industry  in  Australia -  that is what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kitchen</inline> wants -  will have to close up, and their business handed over to the three or four large stearine manufacturers -  a big monopoly over again -  who can, owing to the high duty on raw material, combine and prevent any small industries starting, and charge a very high price for their candles. It may be asked  why  we.  in  Tasmania do not start a stearine plant. In the first instance, the capital required is very great, and therefore the output must be great to make the plant pay, and. the population is not large enough to consume the goods. Again, the people of Tasmania, owing to the cool climate, prefer a paraffin wax candle, it being a much clearer, brighter burning article, showing a better light in a cool climate, than a stearine candle. Paraffin wax is not, and cannot be, manufactured in the Commonwealth in sufficient quantities to supply the demand. One firm in New South Wales only make a little for their own use, but their output must naturally be limited, as paraffin is a by-product of kerosene oil. They, therefore, cannot get sufficient for their own use, they being also candle makers, and have to import their wax. </para>

We, as candle manufacturers, naturally keeping closely in touch with what goes on in the production of our raw material, believe it will be many years before Australia can supply the demand for this article, and even then the duty might well be. a protective but not a prohibitive one, which is proposed at present. Why, therefore, impose such a duty that will for all time close up all- small candle industries, and give a monopoly to the few large ones, who can then for all time prevent others, starting? </para>

Here we have an instance of factories being closed not because of the insufficiency of the duty but for another reason, and that, reason has been shown. When  we  come to the item of paraffine wax we shall be able to deal with that, but we must deal first of all with this unconscionable request by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kitchen,</inline> the monopolist, to increase the duty on the manufactured article by 100 per cent. We will deal with him in . regard to the duty on stearine - his other manufacture - when it is reached. With regard to the second column to which reference has been made, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> about the preference. Parenthetically I may say that I would rather that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> had moved a request to reduce the duty to  id.  per lb., as it was previously, but he has not done so. </para>

                        <para>- I quite agree with my honorable friend, because undoubtedly what underlies preference is the encouragement of trade with the United Kingdom. If there be already a trade the reason for preference does not apply. But in this case the figures which have been cited show that the trade is in other hands, and therefore if we wish to encourage the candle-making industry in England and the exportation of candles to Australia a preference may be fair. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to propose that the House of Representatives be requested to leave out the preference duty in regard to candles. If I had any lingering doubt in my mind on the question of preference to Great Britain it was cleared up yesterday by the statement of the Vice-President of the Executive Council when he told us that the practical object of this Tariff was to conserve Australian interests. We are endeavouring to establish industries in Australia, and to foster and encourage our own manufactures. We are also as far as we can endeavouring to provide that the employes of the various industries shall receive fair and reasonable remuneration. I am well aware that I am forbidden to enter into a general discussion on the preference question, but it may have been gathered from remarks previously made by me that our preference offer to the United Kingdom has been treated with contempt. These preference duties would encourage the importation of articles from a country where the conditions of labour, and its remuneration, cannot be compared with what obtains in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- It is only a few years since I worked in the United Kingdom, and I know what I am speaking about. I do not intend to vote for preference duties. Whatever articles we import from Great Britain should, I consider, pay the same duties as those imported from other parts of the world. I may be accused of being disloyal in moving to omit preference duties. I will stand that accusation. I think that the whole proposal is a bit of mock sentiment put forward with the object of spreading the spirit of Imperialism throughout Australia. </para>

                    <para>- I think that the better form for putting amendments of this character will be to submit the question- " That the House of Representatives be requested to make the duty in the second column " so much. Honorable senators will notice that certain dates are mentioned in the second column. Obviously we could not remove those dates, because the duties have been operative since those dates were placed there. The question now submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> will be - </para>

                    <para>. - We have to recognise that a certain principle has been laid down in the framing of this Tariff, and unless exceptional reasons are given for ignoring that principle it should be adhered to. Therefore I cannot support such a request as that submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham.</inline> We are aware that very good candles are made in Great Britain. One of the best is the Broxburn candle, which is made principally in the Lothian districts of Scotland, and is one of the finest candles produced. It enters into com- petition in  Our  market with the American candle. It is a good thing to give an industry of that kind an advantage over industries conducted in foreign countries. I assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> that the conditions in the candle-making industry of Scotland are not, by any manner of means, such as have been represented by him. If you were to search the whole of Scotland you would not find a higher or better wage paid for unskilled labour than that paid in the works to which I am referring. I know something about the matter, because I was employed at those works myself. It is many years ago, I admit, but I believe that practically the same conditions obtain to-day as existed at the time to which I allude. In granting a preference to candles coming, at all events, from Scotland, we shall not be encouraging the introduction of goods made by sweated labour to compete with our own products. I hope, therefore, that the Committee will retain the present measure of preference. </para>

                    <para>. - I would ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> to withdraw his request.  As has been very properly pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, the principle of preference in relation to certain items is a distinct feature of the Tariff, and the Government intend from first to last to fight for it. I claim. that the Senate, by agreeing to the second reading of the measure, has accepted the principle, and this is a case' in which it may fairly operate. Under present conditions the importations of candles from the United Kingdom are very small, only 130,000 lbs. having been introduced in 1906, whereas 1,720.000 lbs. were imported during the same period from Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands. That being so, there is some reason for granting a preference to candles made in the United Kingdom, and, in the circumstances, I would urge mv honorable friend, to withdraw his proposition. </para>

                    <para>. - To my mind, the remarks made bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> are very pertinent. If I correctly understand the intention of the Government, the great object they have in view in submitting these preferential proposals is to give manufacturers in the United Kingdom a chance to secure that trade which to some extent is passing into the hands of foreigners. We desire, so far as is consistent with the preservation of our own industries, to" assist those of the United Kingdom, and in . that way to benefit British workers. There is no reason why, in our efforts to Assist the workers and traders of Australia, we should not have a kindly feeling towards our. working kindred in the Old Country. I dissent altogether from the principle of constructing simultaneously a preferential and an ordinary Tariff, designed to serve revenue, manufacturing, and industrial purposes, and the only reason .why I sympathize to some extent with the preferential proposals of the Government, is that I recognise the possibility - which we hope will be realized - that ultimately the conditions of the British worker will be improved. Having done our duty to our own workers, surely we should extend some consideration to those of Great Britain, from which we have sprung. It is for these reasons that, on the question of preference, I am inclined to go to some extent with the Government. </para>

                <para class="block">Honorable senators will notice that item 42 includes other articles which I believe are also used in the manufacture of candles, to which my motion does not apply. In view of the discussion which took place on candles, and, further, because I have reason to think that honorable senators are fairly familiar with the details of the candle-manufacturing industry, I shall say no more in support of my motion than that stearine and paraffine wax enter very largely into the manufacture of candles, and, quite apart from the fiscal question, honorable senators should balance the benefit which might be conferred by cheapening a raw material of the large candle-making industry as against the smaller 'advantage which might be conferred by an increase of the duty upon those whose operations are limited to stearine and paraffine wax. It is well known that the candle manufacturers who are really in trouble are the smaller men, and the imposition of increased duties would, to a still greater extent than is the case at present, place them in the hands of the larger manufacturers of candles, who also manufacture stearine and paraffine wax. If in the imposition of a duty we have any choice, we should exercise it for the benefit of the small struggling man rather than for the benefit of well-established concerns carrying on large operations and with any amount of capital behind them. </para>

When the kerosene industry in New South Wales is sufficiently established to supply  all the paraffine wax required, it will be time enough for the Government to ask Parliament to amend the Tariff to meet the altered conditions. At the present moment, all the paraffine wax made in Australia may  be  regarded as a negligible quantity. An  important factor in this matter is the local manufacture of stearine by the larger candle manufacturers. We know that an enormous capital is required to put up a stearine plant, and the larger manufacturers are thus in a position to control the sources of supply of a commodity required by the </para>

                <para>Smaller  candle manufacturers. With a duty of Jd. per lb. on stearine they have captured the Australian market, and would be able to hold it without any duty,' because the price of stearine is lower in Australia than in Europe. In the circumstances, it may be asked what objection there is to a duty of id. per lb., and the objection is that as these manufacturers of stearine already control the market they might put the price up beyond a certain figure, whereas with a reduction of the duty there would at least bc some opportunity afforded for the importation of a certain  Quantity  of the article, which they need not fear so long as they kept down the price. I have all the time striven for brevity in the discussion of. the Tariff,  and I therefore submit my motion without further comment. </para>

                    <para>--  I have not definitely made up my mind as to the vote I shall give in connexion with this item. Whilst' I have listened attentively to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has said, I am informed that the Commonwealth "Oil Company of New South Wales at the present time employ about  1,000  men; that they have works at Airlie and Woolganand retorts at Capertee and Hartley. I am further informed that at their works they ma.ke fuel oil, lubricating oil, petroleum spirit, benzine, and paraffine wax. </para>

                <para>We know that paraffine wax is a by-product of the industries in which this company is engaged, and they assert that if they are 0 given the measure of protection embodied in the schedule they will be able to make all the paraffine wax required in Australia. They . desire to be relieved in a measure from Eastern competition. </para>

                    <para>. - I should not have spoken on this item had I not desired to inform <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> and others who are anxious to retain the proposed duty of id. per lb. that what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has just said was fully considered by the members of the Tariff Commission, who came to the conclusion that in the interests of the smaller industries connected with the manufacture of candles a duty of Jd. per lb. would be sufficient to enable the manufacture of stearine and paraffine wax to be carried on, if people were prepared to go' into the industry thoroughly, while it would prevent any overcharge being made by local manufacturers of stearine upon competing candle manufacturers. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has pointed out, the local manufacturers of stearine have already captured the market under a duty of ½d. per lb. And I am entirely satisfied that when the manufacture and manipulation of kerosene is carried on in Australia -those engaged in the industry will be able to compete with outsiders under a duty of |d. per lb. on paraffine wax. The difficulty is that paraffine wax is used for many purposes other than the manufacture of candles. It is used, for instance, in the preparation of paper required for the packing of butter and commodities of that description.  In the circumstances, we should not impose a higher duty upon the article than is- absolutely necessary. The Tariff Commission considered that since it is shown that we have the raw material for the purpose here a duty of Jd. per lb. is sufficient to ultimately establish the industry for the manufacture of paraffine wax in Australia. , </para>

I find that in the year in question ,£3,311 worth came from the United Kingdom, whilst the quantities imported from other countries were valued as follows: - Burmah, ,£6,128; India, £14,703 ; New Zealand, £46 ; Straits Settlements, £13,818; Belgium, £^15; Borneo, ,£4; Germany, £10; Java, £985 ; Sumatra, £2,000 ; and the United States of America - no doubt the Standard Oil Company supplied this - £[35,317. </para>

                    <para>I would particularly emphasize the fact that it is just as essential to the candle industry of Australia that the proposed duties on paraffine wax and stearine should be maintained, as the  duty  on candles. Paraffine wax and stearine are both really the finished article, needing merely to be moulded into candles on arrival here. If these items, therefore, are allowed to come into the Commonwealth at a low rate of duty, they compete with the local candle maker in just the same way as if candles are allowed to come in at the same rate. </para>

                        <para>- We know, from our experience during the recent hot spell, what paraffine wax candles are like. Since the introduction of paraffine wax, it has become a favorite ingredient with candle-makers, . being imported to the extent, as quoted by the Minister, of over 6,000,000 lbs. last year. What other interest is suffering by reason of that enormous importation ? " It is driving out of the market the stearine that otherwise would be produced and used here to the same extent. Until it can be shown, that stearine candles are of a worse quality, and are sold at. a higher price, than paraffine wax candles, I see no reason why we should encourage the introduction of this pernicious article, because it is' pernicious in so far as it discourages the use of our own native crude products. As a result of the introduction of this foreign commodity; we are shipping to the other markets .of the world our own native product of tallow. Even during the drought years, when we were supposed not to be able to produce tallow, we were shipping it away at the rate of 300,000 cwt. a year. In order to make good those vast shipments of tallow, we had to purchase paraffine wax from the  Standard Oil Company. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> and others spoke in a very creditable strain against the encouragement of monopolies, but while they inveigh and rail against monopolies in Australia, they seemingly have every sympathy with and the tenderest of feelings for the monopoly that exists in America - the Standard' Oil Company. Paraffine wax, as the Minister has shown, is largely an American product, and the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clarke</inline> before the Tariff Com mission was - " So far as the supply of paraffine wax is concerned, we -are completely in the hands of the Standard Oil Company." The alternative, as is alleged by some honorable senators, is for the Australian manufacturers to put themselves in the hands of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kitchen.</inline></para>

                        <para>- I am sure the honorable senator does not dispute the opinion cf his quondam leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> who described <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kitchen</inline> to-day as - I forget the adjective which he used, but it was certainly not complimentary - a monopolist. The whole trend of the speeches against this duty has been in the direction of- labelling <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kitchen</inline> as the monopolist of the Australian candle  trade. If we reduce the duty to id., it will leave the consumers of paraffine wax at the mercy of the Standard Oil Company. I favour accepting the less of the two evils - the monopolist in our midst. One argument that appeals to me very- strongly is consideration for Tasmanian interests. I regret that any vote of mine should be cast in the direction of destroying any industry or wasting the hard-earned money of any person engaged in it. But when . dealing with questions of this kind affecting the national welfare, we must put out of our minds altogether considerations of a personal or even of a local character, take a wider view, and attempt to ascertain what will be the ultimate effect of our votes upon the general prosperity. By making the duty only Jd. we shall continue to displace tallow and stearine, both essentially Australian products, from use in the manufacture of Australian candles. The Tasmanian manufacturers have my sympathy, but I regret that they cannot have anything more. I might remind those Tasmanian  senators  who wish to reduce this duty that other States in the Commonwealth have their initial difficulties to overcome just as Tasmania has had. We have in Western Australia similar industries established, and up to the present they have not been in need of any cheap paraffine wax in order to achieve prosperity. So far, I have had no application from .'them for any reduction of this duty. But, apart from the peculiar interests of Tasmania or Western Australia, I am not going (o encourage the introduction into Australia of a raw material which, will have the direct effect of 'ousting our own products of- tallow and stearine from use in an Australian industry. </para>

                        is always fair, and I am sure that the reason why he is going to vote on this occasion rather, in a contrary direction is that he does not appreciate the rue position. If he votes for the amendment, he will not injure in any way the manufacture of stearine. It has been proved that a duty of £d. per lb. on wax and stearine has enabled the stearine manufacturers to succeed. I would point out to the Vice-President of the Executive Council that this is . essentially an item with regard to which he ought to exercise his judicial faculty, and refuse to listen fo the representations of interested parties. The first Commonwealth Tariff was built up upon the just aphorism pf "revenue without destruction." In 1902, when we were passing that Tariff, I think every member of Parliament would have said that every industry then existing in the Commonwealth, no matter how humble, must, if possible, be promoted and not extinguished. If there is a way out of the difficulty in this case, the Minister should take that way which protects the small industries, even though they be Tasmanian industries, and at the same time allows the other industries to flourish. I assert most unhesitatingly that, after .taking, I think, ten days in the Senate to argue out the question as to the use of paraffine wax and stearine in the candle factories, the compromise we came to at that time was fair and just, and enabled all parties to carry on their business  successfully.. The proposal .the Government now put before us is neither fair nor just, and will- absolutely shut up the Tasmanian candle factories. The simple facts are that under the old compromise Tariff the duty was id. per. lb., and that both sections of the Tariff Commission have practically recommended that it should so remain. ' The free-trade section df the Commission recommended, not 20 per cent, as stated in the document before us, but only 16 per cent. After listening to the whole of the evidence, including that taken in Tasmania, which the Vice-President of the Executive Council and his Customs officers have not done, the two sections- of the Commission came to the conclusion that they could not justly recommend the increase of this duty to id., and suggested that it should be Jd. or lower. The Government are ignoring the compromise of the old Tariff, and ignoring both sides of the Tariff ' Commission, which was a judicial tribunal. The leader of the Senate asks us now to throw overboard, as the Government have done, the whole of that evidence, and listen to the representations of
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kitchen.</inline>
                        I do not believe that
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kitchen</inline>
                        is any less honorable than I am, but he has virtually the control of the whole candle industry of the Commonwealth. A man of that sort cannot take, as the Minister should take, a judicial view of the matter. The whole of his interests are bound . up in twisting this Tariff, if he can do so, to suit his own pocket, and in doing that he is most cruelly and unjustly trying to crush two or three factory-owners in Tasmania,

It is not fair and right that, by the imposition of the duty of  id.,  the small manufacturers' should be placed at the mercy of those who are in a position to exercise a virtual monopoly. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline>
                    as a true Australian, is desirous of averting ruin from any ,of our industries, and would be the first to assist in preventing further oppression. I should have been glad to hear from the Vice-President of the Executive Council some reply to the quotations which have been read, and which destroy or cripple any claims to an increased duty, but the honorable senator has told us that, while no evidence in favour of an increase could be produced when _ the duty of id. was imposed, he had obtained further light since. That further light", however, has come from the obscuring source represented by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline>
                    Kitchen ; and I should have liked to hear read the second letter from that gentleman when we were dealing with the duty on candles.

                        <para>- But the Vice-President of the Executive Council carefully omitted to read that particular part in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kitchen</inline> so ingenuously admits that, when paraffine wax .is obtained, all that is necessary is to put it into moulds in order to obtain candles. Had we been aware of that fact, I do not think that we should have doubled the duty on candles. The whole labour employed is practically insignificant. However, the duty on candles has been passed. We have the unanimous decision of the Tariff Commission, now supplemented by a statement from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> as to what actuated the. protectionist members in coming to the conclusion that ai duty of £d. was enough. While we do not hold ourselves bound by the recommendations of the Tariff Commission if they appear to us inapplicable, we ought, in the interests of the taxpayer, to give some attention to the very cogent reasons which induced them to come to their decision. The case on behalf of the Tasmanian manufacturers is fortified bv the uncontradicted statement that when the Tariff was introduced <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne promised that the duty should be £d. ; and possibly buttonholing and lobbying is accountable for the doubling of the impost, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kitchen,</inline> I suppose, put himself into communication with the authorities, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, weakly yielding to the influence, went back on his promise. That is not the way in which to assist an industry which claims - and, unlike many other industries, rightly claims - to have been seriously affected by the duty. On these grounds it seems to me that the case for a smaller duty is amply made out, and, in view of the acquiescence accorded to the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> I hope the Government will not press for a duty of 1d. </para>

                <para class="block">I should move a still further reduction if I thought that there was any possibility of carrying it. It may surprise honorable senators to hear that the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission was that the duty on confectionery should be  2d.  per lb. Had the free-trade section recommended that rate, I should regard it as a waste of time to draw attention to the matter, but the recommendation having come from strong protectionists, surely attention will be paid to it by the protectionist members of the Committee. Personally, I think that a duty of  2d.  per lb. far more than covers the difference between the labour cost and price of materials elsewhere and those which our manufacturers have to pay. Of the chief ingredient of confectionery, namely sugar, Australia produces sufficient to meet her own requirements, so that it is not a high-priced commodity, while1d. per lb. more than covers the difference between the cost of labour in the Commonwealth and its cost in any other part of the world from which confectionery is imported to Australia. The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission gave the fullest consideration to all the questions involved, and I am surprised that the Government proposed a rate so much higher than that which they recommended. If the rate of duty is increased beyond what is necessary to establish the industry, the prices of confectionery will go up. It is, or soon will be, the avowed object of the Government and its supporters to increase prices. </para>

                        <para>- I - would sooner vote for direct prohibition. I do not think that any protectionist will deny that rates of duty act as a strong incentive, and afford a good opportunity, to local manufacturers to increase their prices unduly. The Tariff rate gives them an indication as to what prices they may charge. If the importation of any particular article were- absolutely prohibited, this indication as to price would disappear ; but if the Committee allows its protectionist idea to run riot, and increases the rate from 2d., recommended by the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, to 3d. - it might just as well increase it to 4c!.,  sd.,  or 6d. - consumers will have to pay more for their confectionery, whether they buy the imported or the locally-made article. These high rates take out of the pockets of the people more than they should be called upon to pay. A duty of 2d. would amply satisfy the best Victorian manufacturers. Of the witnesses who came before the Tariff Commission, the man most largely interested in the confectionery trade in Australia seemed to me to combine energy with great ability in administration to a greater extent than any other. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Macpherson</inline> Robertson would be abundantly satisfied with a duty of 2d. per lb., which would enable him to continue his industry as satisfactorily as he has conducted it in the past. ' All the facts show, and it is a matter of common repute, that he at any rate is conducting - well, I admit - a very successful business. He is employing labour on good terms and under good conditions. If honorable senators think it necessary for him to have any protection at all - and I believe that he could compete on level terms tomorrow .with the whole world - a duty of 2d. per lb. is, even in his opinion, ample. For these reasons I hope that the Committee will not arbitrarily, and without justification, as the report of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission abundantly proves, raise the duty from 2d. to 3d. </para>

                    <para>. - In 1906, we imported from the United Kingdom 2,776,596 lbs. of confectionery, and from other countries. 407,538 lbs. I hope that honorable senators will see their way to support the item. It. relates to what is essentially a native industry, and one in which we should command the whole of the trade. The basis of the commodity is sugar, and in its local manufacture Australian sugar is used. It is true that the  cocoa beans have to be imported, but the employes in the industry are specially skilled in the manufacture of the beans into confectionery. We have managed, I admit, to establish many of these industries; and to suggest for a moment that with those vast businesses throughout the Commonwealth there is any chance of the consumer suffering is to submit a proposition to which, I think, my honorable friends will not readily agree. </para>

                    Not at all. Throughout the Commonwealth confectionery is very cheap, and necessarily it is so by reason of the large industries which are competing one with the other. Our importations of confectionery are very considerable. In 1906, for . instance, we imported 3,184,134. lbs., on which duty to the amount of ,£27,000 was paid. Why should that be so? Australian confectionery, is equal to the best confectionery that we get from abroad.

Let me now draw the attention of honorable senators to the importations, in order to show how inadequate was the duty in the Tariff of 1902. In 1902 the imports were 2,741,423 lbs. </para>

                        <para>- Surely my honorable friend will see that that is no answer to my contention that, as shown by the increased importations, the old duty was inadequate. The value of the confectionery imported in 1906 was - from France,£1,066; from Germany,£1,213; from the United States, £16,962 ; and from the United Kingdom, £93,674. I ask honorable senators whether it is not a reasonable thing that our own people should be permitted to manufacture  that vast quantity of confectionery, especially when it is recognised that it can be made just as well and as skilfully here as abroad ? </para>

                    on this item is very simple and very easily understood. There is no argument for increasing the duty in order to protect a diminishing industry. It is not put to us that the object of the increase is to rehabilitate a strangled manufacture. It is put on the bare ground that we ought literally to have prohibition, and that the duty is intended and expected to be prohibitive. That is quite a new feature in this Tariff, I take leave to say with great respect.

                        <para>- Yes, but the original proposal was to add1¾d. to the recommendation of the Tariff Commission - practically to double their recommendation - with nothing to justify it except the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy.</inline> It would be much better to have a straightforward prohibition of the importation of any confectionery from England, which is the largest exporter of the article to Australia. Of course, the imported confectionery is mostly of a kind which is not made here. That fact is apt to be forgotten. The palates of the consumers - and some of us who are grown up like a few lollies occasionally - vary. A great deal of this imported confectionery is of a kind not made here. </para>

                        <para>- No ; it must be so; and I will tell my honorable friend why. He has given to us the other side; but I rather fall in with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has said, that although it would be impossible for any Minister to have all the information which each of us might require, it would have been a very important thing on these matters, which are supposed to rest on the plea of assistance to injured industries and so forth, that we should have some information with regard to the admitted increase in factories, the consequent increase in the number of workmen employed, and the developments in the industry under the Tariff as it stood. But in the absence of that information, we have, what has been casually alluded to already, the fact that since the commencement of the Commonwealth, Australia has become an exporter of confectionery, and that the exports have gone on increasing. They have fluctuated in different years, as, of course, all trade does, but in 1906 the exports amounted to 371,116 lbs. So that not only has there been, as the Vice-President of the Executive Council candidly admitted, an increase in the number of factories and workmen employed, but an increase in the output. The local consumption of locally - manufactured stuff has no doubt had the effect of decreasing the consumption of. imported stuff, but the exports of Australian made confectionery have increased ten times over during the last four or five years. In 1902, the exports were 43,245 lbs. In the next  Year  they had increased five times - to 225,006 lbs. In the following year the exports had doubled again, to 478,643 lbs. In the next year they had increased to 556,864 lbs. In 1906 they fell off somewhat - to something under 400,000 lbs. - probably because there was a greater consumption of the locally-manufactured article. </para>

                        <para>- But my honorable friend must see that it is a fair inference that the reason why we consume such a large quantity of imported confectionery is that it is a. different kind of confectionery from that made here._ If the local manufacturers have all the necessary appliances, the experience, and  the skill, with the cheap sugar and other advantages they enjoy, and if, nevertheless, confectionery is imported, it must be a different kind. I dare say that in time the local manufacturers will even be able to overtake that quality of confectionery which is now imported, and which a great many people seem to like. We have just dealt with a very important duty on paraffine wax. We were all impressed by the fact that both- sections of the Tariff Commission recommended a particular duty, to which the Committee assented. We can have no better guide, as a general rule - there may be exceptions, but it is for honorable senators opposite to point them out - than the fact that' the two sections of the Tariff Commission have united in their re-' commendation. They have united in recommending a duty of  2d.  on confectionery. I wish to read a  paragraph from page 8 of the report of the protectionist section of the Commission. They have critically analyzed the evidence on both sides, and they wind up with a paragraph summarizing part of that evidence - ' </para>

                <para class="block"> A manufacturing confectioner in Western Australia, at the close of his examination in relation to a claim for an increased duty on liquorice, was asked - "Do you intend to  give  evidence in connexion with confectionery ?" and replied - " No ; it (the Tariff) does not affect us in regard to confectionery ; it is only the Australian competition that affects us. I do not think the oversea competition is worth considering. The confectionery trade is strong enough to stand on its own ; it is established now. It is not the  Englishman who is cutting us out, it is that we. are cutting out one another; that is where our profits go.". </para>

                    <para>In spite of the statements made that the Commonwealth Tariff has been injurious to this industry, the evidence shows that during the period it has been in operation there has been a large increase in the manufacture of confectionery generally, and in the number of workers employed. Some of the witnesses asking for increased duties had only commenced business since the Tariff was imposed, and were doing fairly well, although their output was neither as large as they desired nor as it would be, if importations were reduced. </para>

                <para class="block">So that, from every point of view, the old duty has been amply sufficient. Under it the industry has developed. Importations have increased by leaps and bounds, and more people have been employed. The protectionist report of the Commission is signed by- <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Quick, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clarke,</inline> ex-Senator Higgs, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline>  and they have recommended the duty now proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> namely, confectionery n.e.i.,  2d.  per lb. Therefore, I venture to say that as we were guided in regard to the duty on candles by the fact that both sections of the Tariff Commission were at one, so we should be guided by their advice in this instance, and should leave the duty at  2d.,  under which the industry has greatly flourished, the consumption considerably increased, more factories have been erected, and more workmen employed, while the exports have risen to ten times what they were before the first Federal Tariff was introduced. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable senator who has just sat down has referred with great satisfaction to the fact that in the confectionery trade we are exporters. I agree with him that it is an extremely desirable thing that we should export. But it is only desirable because it gives added employment to our people, and added profit to our commercial men ana manufacturers'. ' If 'it is such a splendid thing that we should have achieved an outside market of .  400,000  lbs. of confectionery, surely it is a better thing that we should do something to control and capture the market for the 3,000,000 lbs., of imported confectionery ? That is a self-evident proposition. </para>

The sugar of which lollies and confectionery are made we do produce. Is there any reason why Australian skill and  intellect should not produce from our own sugar the confectionery we require, .made to any standard that can be required? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator may be right, but that does not alter the fact. It only shows that the protection so far has not been sufficient to enable us to cover the whole area of manufacture. In other words, whilst the industry has been developed very satisfactorily, our manufacturers are not  yet able with the protection ' they have, to cover the whole area. Imports are increasing, and our consumption is also increasing very materially. I recognise that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. Clemons</inline> is thoroughly consistent. If I held his views I should adopt . the attitude that he is taking up. He feels that every Customs duty, except for purely revenue purposes, is iniquitous. </para>

It is satisfactory to know that we have developed an export trade to the extent of 400,000 lbs. per annum, but the ' position would be still better if we had an export of, say. 5,000,000 lbs. If it would be good to have an export trade of 5,000.000 lbs., and the work involved in producing that quantity of confectionery, it would be equally good to be giving employment to the same amount of labour in supplying our own people. </para>

                        <para>- As to that, I would point out that we have had for a considerable time a duty of  2d.  per lb. on confectionery, while sugar costs at least  2d.  per lb., making a total of4d. If my honorable friend's argument, therefore, were correct, confectionery could not be purchased under  4d.  per lb., since, according to his implied contention, we must at least include in the cost the duty and the price of the material, as well as the cost of the labour, which I have not yet mentioned. But, as a matter of fact, large grocery stores in Melbourne frequently advertise lollies at  3½d.  per lb. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend would, of course, imply that everything made in Australia is impure, and that all that is imported is pure. I venture the opinion that the confectionery advertised, under a duty of  2d.  per lb., at  3½d.  per lb. retail is pure, and the fact that it can be retailed at that price is an evidence that the wholesale price is less. If these lollies can be sold wholesale at less than  3d.  per lb., that clearly answers the argument that the duty is added to the cost, and that the consumer pays it. </para>

If that were the case, how did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> who was once young - and who, I dare say, has forgotten the incidents of his youth - survive it? He has admitted that there still lingers about him a strong desire and a plaintive regard for the sweets of youth ; because he tells of the lollipops that he uses. I congratulate the honorable gentleman on being still so pleasantly juvenile. But how did all the youngsters get on in the days gone by ? However, it is unnecessary to discuss the question at length. I do not think that we need so large an increase of the old duty, and I shall vote for the request. </para>

                    <para>-45J- - Although I do not regard as .absolutely infallible the declarations of either section of the Tariff Commission, very few persons  have a greater respect than I have for the work of that body, and  1  think that a serious responsibility is taken by the Government, or either House, in venturing to go beyond any recommendation unanimously made by it. I feel it to be almost, a matter of duty, in the absence of very strong reasons to the contrary, to accept the unanimous decision of both sections of the Commission but in this case I find myself in a very serious difficulty. I am a believer in preference to Great Britain, and my difficulty- is that if we accepted the request now before us, I could not, as a protectionist, agree to a preference being granted to the United Kingdom in the direction of reducing, as would be necessary if this proposal were agreed to, the general Tariff of 2d. per Ito. It seems to me, however, that by a modification of the request which will be proposed later on, we can strike the happy medium and afford the Australian producer of confectionery as much protection as he ought to have. He has teen enjoying a protection amounting to something over 25 per cent, on the value of the product. That is very satisfactory, seeing that the manufacturer has at hand the major portion of his raw materials, and that they can be obtained here as cheaply as anywhere else. That being so, I think that he has been sufficiently protected, and that we might well impose a duty of 2d. per lb. on imports from the United Kingdom, and possibly place an additional impost on imports from other countries. Of the total imports of confectionery only about 400,000 lbs., of the value of ,£16,000, come from countries other than the United Kingdom, so that we have in this case an opportunity to grant a substantial measure of preference. </para>

                    <para>.- In giving way to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> I pointed out that I preferred my own request to his, and one reason for my preference has just been stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mul</inline> cahy. I am a great believer in the principle of preferential trade, and desire it to be substantially recognised in framing this Tariff, so that we may determine a few years hence its effect on the trade between Australia and the Mother Country. Another reason why I cannot vote for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons'</inline> request is that I, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy,</inline> have some respect for the decisions of the Tariff Commission. If we reduced the general Tariff on confectionery to 2d. per lb., and the duty on imports from Great Britain to 1½d. per lb., we should go below the recommendation of both sections of the Commission. I ask honorable, senators to support me in a request that the general Tariff be 2½d. per lb., and that in respect of the United King: dom 2d. per lb., for that would not mean going below the rates recommended by the Commission. After taking a great deal of evidence, they recommended that the old duty should be increased by 100 per cent. Such an increase should be .sufficient to satisfy even <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne. Should it not be enough to satisfy almost every one else? If it had not been that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne was briefed, I suppose by some of the big manufacturers, the duty recommended by the Tariff Commission would have been adopted. However, nothing seems to satisfy the honorable gentleman, and, not content with a recommendation to raise the duty 100 per cent, higher than that under the old Tariff, he has proposed that it should be raised by 400 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- The output of the Commonwealth factories has increased, and if the imports have also increased, that only shows that there is a certain class of confectionery, and particularly chocolate confectionery, which we cannot or do not make here, and, further, that the people are becoming accustomed to buy enormous quantities of sweets, so that there is room for the imported as well as the locally-manufactured article. I join issue with the Vice-President of the Executive Council, who argues that because over' 3,000,000 lbs. of confectionery, as classified in the old Tariff, is imported annually, the duty we impose should be sufficiently high to transfer- the whole of that trade to Commonwealth manufacturers. I join issue with what I call the ultra protectionists on that point, and I say that no moderate protectionist could possibly subscribe to such a doctrine. The Government desire in connexion with this item, and I suppose in connexion with every other if they could get the Senate to vote sufficiently high duties, to shut out all importation. If we did that, I would say - God help the Commonwealth ! </para>

As the mouthpiece of the Government, the honorable senator has said that he desires to absolutely exclude all imported sweets from the Commonwealth, and this doctrine  of the exclusion of- imports is one to which no man of common sense can subscribe. I find that in this matter the Government are going absolutely against the evidence. I have here a copy of letters from manufacturers and confectioners' associations, showing that all they want is a duty of 2d. per lb., and yet the Government are proposing an increase of nearly 100 per cent, beyond that duty. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that. I regret that I cannot obtain from Senator Best the information for which I asked. Considering the evidence before him, that the manufacturers themselves would be quite content with a' duty of .2d. per lb., and that the statistics show that the imports are increasing, I think the honorable senator, by telling only half the truth, and rot putting the other side, has not dealt fairly with the Committee. Side bv side with the increase of imports there is an increase in the output of the local fac.tories, and it is shown that they are progressing and flourishing. </para>

                    has said that numerous communications have been received from different manufacturers of confectionery in the various States to the effect that the proposed duties are far too high, but il will be found that the bulk of the evidence given before the Tariff Commission by those engaged in the confectionery business in the various States, and in a position to understand exactly what is necessary, is to the effect that the . old duty was insufficient. A Tasmanian manufacturer of confectionery when before the Tariff Commission contended that the duty on gum goods, such as jujubes should be 3d., and not 2d... per lb. He said that if (he duty w.ere fixed at 3d. he would be able to secure the trade, and to employ a 'large number of hands. The same kind of evidence was given bv almost all the witnesses examined in the various States bv the Commission.

In Queensland there was a duty of  4d.,  and in South Australia a duty of  3d.  per lb., whilst in Tasmania - one of whose representatives is now making a strong protest against the duty of  3d.  per lb. - there was prior to Federation a duty of  4d.  per lb. on chocolates. </para>

                <para class="block">There can be no doubt that if sufficient protection were given to the manufacturers of this class of confectionery, many more men, women, and boys would be employed in the local factories. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> desired to know why the importations had increased under the Federal Tariff. In  1903  the importations of general confectionery into the Commonwealth exceeded the importations under the old State Tariffs in  1899  by  1,090  tons, and there was also an increase in the importation of cocoa and chocolate confectionery by  1,020  tons. The value of the former was about  £120,000,  and of the latter  £138,000.  The figures show conclusively that these particular commodities have not been adequately protected. With a sufficient measure of protection they can be manufactured in Australia, and will provide employment for Australian workmen. </para>

When before the Tariff Commission, a witness named Geddes, who has been associated with it for a very long period, instituted a comparison between the wages conditions which obtain in it in Australia and those which prevail in some of the countries from which we import large quantities of confectionery. He said that in  1902  over  £100,000  worth, duty paid, of foreign confectionery was imported into the Commonwealth, excepting Queensland. </para>

If we allow one-half of that amount as being the sum that would have been spent in wages if the goods had been made here, and we calculate the wages at £2 per week, we can see that the manufacture of that quantity of goods here would have provided fifty weeks' work for 500 men. </para>

In New South Wales and Victoria I have seen grocers give away confectionery which was absolutely unfit for human consumption. It is positively absurd to urge that confectionery can be manufactured from pure toiled sugar and sold at 3|d. per lb. Not only has it been sold for 3½d. a lb., but I know that it has been sold for 2 ki. per lb. Under what conditions can it be manufactured? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has stated that until very recently no duty was levied upon confectionery in New South Wales. Will it be believed, then, that one of the largest manufacturers in Australia was able to build up his business there under free-trade conditions? I do not say that he did not desire the aid of protective duties. I believe that he did. But it is upon record that 'his particular firm, which is doing one of the largest businesses in confectionery in Australia, does not desire any increase in the old rate of duty. What evidence has been placed before the Committee regarding the necessity for increasing the impost recommended by the Tariff Commission ? </para>

                        <para>- No. . But the firm to which I have referred is the largest manufacturer of confectionery in New South Wales, if not in Australia. The goods which it produces are a credit to the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has given expression to some "very strong views. He voiced his delight that Australia was now ?.n exporter of confectionery, and he expressed the hope that she will soon supply all the sweetmeats that we require. I echo his wish entirely, if that result can be achieved under equitable conditions. But I ask honorable senators to reflect for a moment upon the advantages which our manufacturers already enjoy. They can obtain their sugar for a little less than 2d. per lb. Then they have a protective duty of 2d. per lb., which is equivalent to <inline font-style="italic">/~i8</inline> per ton. In addition, the foreign manufacturer has to pay freight charges and various commissions. In these circumstances, it seems incredible that our- manufacturers are not able to build up successful businesses. </para>

                        <para>- One of the factors which we have to consider in the development of Australian industries is the competition that we have to face with the United Kingdom and other European countries in regard to the quality of our goods. I venture to say that the manufacturer in Australia who equips himself with the most modern means of production confers an advantage, not only upon other manufacturers, but upon the people as a whole. I have no hesitation in saying that a duty of  2d.  per lb., which is equivalent to  £.18  per ton, should be a prohibitive duty. If it is not so, there must be something radically wrong with the conditions under which our factories, are conducted. </para>

                        <para>- We need healthy competition from wherever we can get it, not only in. confectionery, but in every branch of industry. We have gained much of our knowledge in Australia, from the pioneers of industries- in other lands. In any modern confectionery, manufactory here, it will be found that the machinery in use and the methods employed in treating the raw material have been to some extent copied from other countries. I ask the Committee to consider in all earnestness bow far they propose to eliminate from Australian conditions those educational factors. The people of Australia do not buy imported sweets simply because they are imported sweets. The shopkeepers have to pay more for them, and they are bought bv the public because they are considered healthier for the children and of better quality, or at all events tetter suited to individual tastes than are many of the local products. The large manufacturers at Home, who have built up successful businesses and earned a name throughout the world for their cocoa, chocolate, and sweets, have gained that name- </para>

                    <para>. - No more powerful argument in favour of the duty proposed in the Tariff can be advanced than the figures showing the imports since the establishment of the Commonwealth. A duty of id. per lb. was imposed by the first Commonwealth Tariff, with the result that the imports of confectionery alone have risen from  2,741,000  lbs. in  -1902  to over 3,000,000 lbs. in  1906.  This is now proposed as a protectionist Tariff; to assist Australian industries, and those figures should be ample argument in favour of adopting an effective protective duty. The former duty of id. per lb. has been clearly shown to be insufficient. Are we content to allow those imports to come in in. the future as we have in the past? To those of us who believe in protection it does not appear to be wise to do so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> was in error in stating that the industry flourished in New South Wales under free-trade. Prior to Federation the industry iri that State had the benefit of a duty of id. per lb., which is not free-trade, or anything like it, and had a prosperity of a kind. </para>

                        <para>- Incidentally it had a protective effect. We are now asked to go back to a revenue, or free-trade rate, whichever honorable senators opposite choose to call it. We do not know whether the Tariff Commission, when both sections of it recommended a specific duty of  2d.  per lb., took into consideration " the probability, which has since developed into a certainty, of increased duties being imposed upon the raw materials of this industry. At least three of the raw materials are to be saddled with an increased impost. Gelatine, which was formerly on the free list, is now dutiable at  40  per cent. </para>

                        <para>- I shall certainly not lend a helping hand to reduce the duty on confectionery towards a free-trade level, on the slender probability of the duties on the raw materials being reduced later on. Almonds are now dutiable at  4d.  per lb. instead of 2d., find glucose, which is sometimes referred to as deleterious,' but which is certain to. enter largely in the future into the manufacture of confectionery, is to bear a new duty of 4s. per cwt. If the Tariff Commission did not have in their minds the contingency that those higher rates would be imposed on the raw material, then their recommendation for a' duty of 2d. per lb. on confectionery is absolutely valueless, and we are left free to consider what will be a fair duty in view of the altered circumstances. </para>

                    The issue is a very simple one, namely, whether or not 2d. is an adequate and effective protective duty? The Tariff Commission have reported that it is adequate. The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended that the duty should be 2d. ; and

                    agrees with that view, but does not propose to vote for such a duty, because of a feeling that he would like id. added to the general Tariff in order to give a pretended preference to that amount in favour of Great Britain.

                        <para>- If we are agreed that 2d.' is sufficient, we ought to vote for it; but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> seems to feel a sort of .timidity as to voting for 2d. because he desires an appearance, at least, of preference "to England. In my opinion, we ought to do the right thing in the one column, and take our chance in regard, to the other column, though at the same time I sympathize with the feeling which prompts <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline> I have no business, of course, to say one. word of reproach to the honorable "senator, but I point out to him that, in regard to a suggestion even of real preference on confectionery, there are many considerations which do not apply to other items. Free-trader as I am, I recognise that confectionery is not a food or a necessary of life; it is not even like blue, a necessary of a humble occupation. We must all admit that confectionery is a luxury, perhaps a harmless luxury, the enjoyment of which we are disposed to encourage ; but I appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> whether it is worth while voting against what he believes to be an adequate and effective duty, merely for the purpose of adding another id. in order to take it off again under the colour of preference? It strikes me that we may be apt to lose sight of. the single issue before the Committee, namely, whether 2d. is an adequate and effective duty. </para>

                        <para>- It was rather long, combined with all the other statements made by the honorable senator on the same subject. But the honorable senator is entirely in error. When he tells us that it was the unanimous opinion of the Tariff Commission that 2d. was sufficient, he forgets to say that, in addition to the 2d., it was recommended that 25 per cent, should be charged under certain conditions. </para>

                        <para>- That is all right. But the position I am in is that, as a member of the Commission, I was satisfied that, up to- a certain stage, 2d. was sufficient against Great Britain as well as other countries, but I felt, further, that it was also necessary to have the alternative 25 per cent-. The Government, or another place, however, decided to do away with the impost of 25 per cent., and adopt the higher duty all round. What am I to do in the circumstances? I intend to support the higher duty all round, because the impost of 25 per cent, is out of the question at the present time. </para>

                        <para>- If I desire to give Great Britain a preference, the duty in the general Tariff must be raised. I do not care whether the general Tariff be 2½d. or. 3^-d., I am not prepared to go below 2d. in regard to Great Britain or any other country. I should prefer duties of 3d. and 2Ld., because the 25 per cent, that we thought necessary to protect certain classes of confectionery has been knocked out. I 'hope honorable senators will note that those who are attempting to reduce the duty never indicated to the Committee that an impost of 25 per cent, was in question; and I hope the vote will be against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons'</inline> request. When this industry was under consideration by the Tariff Commission, I agreed with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> in very many instances, and I do so still in regard to other lines that we cannot discuss at present. If the honorable senator is prepared to take action in the direction I have indicated, he will find me supporting him. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to point out one or two reasons which have induced me to arrive at my decision on this item. Originally the duty was 2d. on confectionery, with id. on cocoa and chocolate. One of the pledges given by myself at the election was to remove anomalies ; and, surely, . it was an anomaly that cocoa and chocolate, which are largely confectionery, should be admitted at id., while other forms of confectionery were charged 2d. I feel under, an obligation, therefore,  to remove this anomaly in the only way in which I think it can be honestly removed, and that is bv bringing cocoa and chocolate to the level of other confectionery. That means that [ must give my vote for a duty of 2d. There is now the question raised by the preference policy inaugurated by the Government, and- I unhesitatingly say that I am in favour of preference. In saying that, I do not believe that the Government have given anything like substantial preference; but that, however, does not prevent my taking the small crumbs which they have allowed to fall from their table. I am confronted with the position which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has pointed out, namely, that the only way in which we can have a duty of 2d., and, at the same time. give preference in favour of Great Britain, is by having the preferential duty 2d., and the general Tariff higher. If I understand figures, there is no other way in which it can be done. Great Britain sends to us 80 per cent, of our importations of cocoa, chocolate, and confectionery, so that a. preferential duty of 2d. on British imports would mean a duty of 2d. on <inline font-style="italic">So</inline> per cent, of our importation.'  The general opinion of the Committee seems to be that 2d. would be a fair duty. </para>

In politics one must be practical. There could be nothing more foolish than to imitate the boy who, thrusting his hand into a narrow- necked vessel to grasp a fistful of nuts, found himself unable to get anything. Honorable senators on this side of the chamber, although holding somewhat divergent views, have endeavoured, in order to economize public time, to arrive at some arrangement. </para>

                        <para>- Anything tending to promote the welfare of labour is a concern of the party. I ask those who favour the new protection, which is to bring the workman, as well as the employer, under the shadow of our protectionist policy, how that can be done if the Tariff wall is not built sufficiently high ? The question, did a duty of 2d. per lb. protect, is answered by the figures relating to -the importations of last year, when we imported 7,000,000 lbs. of sweets, or 2 lbs. for every man, woman, and child in the Commonwealth. Some one else ate my share. We spent .£116,000 of good Australian money in giving employment in the making of lollies to people in Great Britain and elsewhere, and we taxed the lolly-eating section of our population to the extent of £40,000. The rates agreed to by the House of Representatives - 3d. and 2½d. per lb. - are too low; but if I cannot get 3½d. and 3d., I shall take <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mil</inline> len 's advice, and accept what I can get. The mandate of the people was to impose duties that would protect, not revenue duties. We were sent here to make the Tariff an instrument for the creation of industries, not for the raising of revenue. </para>

                        <para>- Sydney was never so prosperous as it is under protection. It is growing like Jonah's gourd, though I hope that it may not wither as suddenly. If the rate under the general Tariff is reduced to 2d., and a preference is given to British importations, we shall be in a worse position than we were in under the old Tariff, because 80 per cent, of the imported confectionery comes from Great Britain. Therefore, I shall vote against any preference if the general rate is reduced below 3d. Indeed, I wish to see the importation of lollies stopped altogether. We produce our own sugar, and everything necessary for the manufacture of confectionery. There are thousands of young persons growing up every year who require employment, and we have capital which we have now to send abroad for investment. Let us therefore build up industries in Australia. Great Britain can look after herself, and so can the importer. </para>

If he did not want our goods, he would not buy them, and if we did not want h;s goods we would not- buy them. If Great Britain could produce all her wool she would not buy a single ounce of that article from Australia. If she could produce all her meat she would not buy any of our meat. So why should we trouble about her? If we can make all our own lollies, why should we not do so? Why should we not encourage this industry? Why should we not protect ourselves against the competition of Great Britain, and, for that matter, of every other country. The old duty, as I have pointed out, did not protect. We shall be justified in trying to see whether duties of 3d. and 2jd. will protect. I do not see how it is possible for any one to advocate the passing on of a. share of this protection to the workers unless it is raised very considerably above what it was under the old Tariff. I intend, therefore, to vote in the first place for a' duty of 3d., and it will depend entirely upon developments whether or not I shall vote for any preference to Great Britain in the circumstances. </para>

                        <para>- Coming back to the question of preference, it has been indicated by several honorable senators that in moving my request to reduce the duty in the general Tariff to 2d. per lb. I intended to follow it up with <inline font-style="italic">h</inline> request to fix the duty on British confectionery at 1½d. per lb. I meant nothing of the sort, and I would not vote for such a proposition if it were moved by any one else. I wish to indicate my views in regard to preference to Great Britain. I have already said that, in order to save the Australian taxpayer from suffering what I consider a burdensome load, I should take every opportunity, even the specious pretext of British preference,, to relieve him. But with regard to an item like confectionery, I think that there is not the slightest chance, by any kind of British preference, of reducing the burden on the taxpayer. What, then, is the only other reason why one should consider preferential trade? The only other reason I can find is that we desire to assist Great Britain to compete in our markets. I do not believe that she wants any assistance at all. My opinion is that if our markets are open to the world, Great Britain will be perfectly well able to take care of herself, and any of these illusory preferences which we are offering are almost an insult to her, and certainly have no practical value. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> seems to think - and I admit at once that from my long and friendly association with him I am astonished that he should-- </para>

                        <para>- I would be the last man to blame the honorable senator for adhering to his election pledges, and he knows that well enough. But whether he made pledges to his constituents or not, I am merely referring to his attitude on this question. He seems to think that if we impose a prohibitive duty of, say, 2½d. per lb. against the rest of the world, and an almost equally prohibitive duty of 2d. per lb. against Great Britain, we shall give a preference. </para>

                        <para>- That is not in accordance with the honorable senator's usual fair play. He ought to know that when I moved my request I carefully said that, so far as I was concerned, I would make the duty on confectionery as low as possible, but that I had not the slightest chance of carrying a request for a duty less than 2d. per lb., and a very small chance indeed of carrying that; I would, however, go as far as I could go in the direction of removing this burden of taxation. The honorable senator knows that I moved my request under those circumstances, and with that distinct preamble. I am surprised that he has publicly announced himself in accordance with the Government scheme of preference. </para>

I will not, under any circumstances, indorse such a sham preference as that. Whether this duty is carried or not, I will not be found supporting any preferential policy. </para>

                        <para>- I regard a duty of 2d. per lb. as prohibitive, but I regard the duty of 3d. in the Tariff as worse. If the honorable senator had listened to what I said, he would know that I regard a duty of 2d. per lb. on confectionery as a distinct incentive to every local manufacturer to put up the price of his commodity. And the local manufacturer, working under a duty of 3d. per lb., would be still more likely to charge the consumer a higher price. I may be wrong in that assumption ; but that is the one on which I. have to work ; and because I think so I do my best to reduce the amount which the consumer has to pay for his confectionery. </para>

                        <para>- My answer to that question has been given more than once. It must be obvious to any one that in present circumstances the Australian manufacturers do not supply confectionery in the many varieties that consumers want. The importations are confined largely to the kinds of confectionery which Australian manufacturers do not make. We had very clear evidence on that subject before the Tariff Commission. The local manufacturers said that they did not make all varieties of confectionery that could be purchased anywhere in the world, and that where any varieties were lacking a certain quantity of such confectionery was imported. </para>

                        <para>- In the Commonwealth there were some purchasers who wanted certain brands of confectionery. They were unable to get their requirements from the local manufacturers, and therefore they bought the imported article. After giving careful attention to the matter, I have not the slightest doubt that that is the explanation of the importation. But I  admit that if there are protectionist senators who think that there should be no new varieties of confectionery, that every one in Australia should eat only the sorts made here, they can put on a duty which will be prohibitive. </para>

                        <para>- That is not the question at all. We make the ordinary forms of cocoa, just as those firms do, but there are many varieties of confectionery which we do not make at the present time. I know perfectly well that protectionists may reply, "Put on a heavy duty, and there is no variety that we will not make." If the argument is worth anything, let it be. used. It does not appeal to me, because I do not think that it is soundly based. I do not believe for a moment that Australia will ever make all the varieties which the rest of the world can make. I believe that to-morrow Australia would be unable to put on yesterday's hat if it found itself in that position. </para>

                        <para>- No. I have not time to go into that matter now, but I can assure the honorable senator that, according to the evidence before the Tariff Commission it was extremely hard to separate the items, and that " confectionery " included many articles which properly ought not to come under that term. I will not vote for preference if it simply means an attempt to help on the industries of England, but wherever it gives me an opportunity of reducing the burden of taxation on the Australian consumer it will receive my support, if I cannot get that reduction in any other or better way. </para>

As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> has pointed out, only at one meeting was the question distinctly put to him, and I think that at not more than two or three meetings was it put to us directly. I take this opportunity of saying that my leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> has admirably and, I think, quite accurately, expressed the views of most honorable senators on this side of the chamber; and likewise the views which the people of Queensland hold on this vexed fiscal question. </para>

On the whole, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has admirably presented the position which we take up, and which I think we on this side of the chamber intend to take up, in considering the conflicting issues raised in this Tariff. With respect to confectionery, I cannot forget the startling correspondence which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> in the early part of September last about the combine in the trade. Charges were made by most reputable men under their own signatures. The correspondence was long, clear, and precise, and it went to show that there were some suspicious and dangerous practices growing up to the oppression of the trading community of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- And also to the oppression of the consumer, because ultimately it falls upon him. Therefore I am inclined to think that the duty on confectionery under the old Tariff, which brought about a flourishing state of trade, and under the auspices of which a combine grew up, against which strong evidence was produced, is one that should not reach the limits proposed by the Government. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has pointed out that the importations of confectionery have increased. But the years mentioned, 1903 to 1906, were years of increasing prosperity in this country. . Consequently the purchasing powers of the community were very much greater than they were in former years. That probably accounts for the increased importations. The very years of our prosperity when we were enjoying the blessings of Providence are now dragged in as a reason for increasing duties which were already high. Almost every article imported was consumed in unusually large quantities during those years. But that consumption cannot be justly attributed to a defective Tariff. The question of preference also has to be considered in relation to this item. It is a vexed question, and it is difficult to devise a course which will do justice to all conflicting interests. But here again I think that our leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mil.len,</inline> has indicated the - right position. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> putting; as he usually does, the argument from the Victorian protectionist point of view very strongly, says, "Look at those large imports; let us shut them out ; we want an increased duty for that purpose." But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> is a strong supporter of a Government which has brought down preference proposals. I will not charge Ministers with insincerity in this matter. I dare say that they believe in what they have professed. But we must have a brand, of preferentialists in this country different from that which. exists in Canada. Prior to 1900, when Canada instituted her preference policy, the imports from. Great Britain showed a tendency to decrease. But when in that year <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid</inline> Laurier brought in his preference Tariff, the importations of British goods increased. </para>

I shall vote with him. </para>

                    as to thc item before the Chair. I cannot 'shut mv eyes to the fact that the recommendation of the protectionist members of the Tariff Commission was that' there should be a duty of 2d. per lb. on confectionery. But they added the proviso - confectionery " of which the invoice value, including the inside packages, if any, exceeds1s. per lb.,  25  per cent." A duty of  2d.  per lb. is a fair one. An increase was asked for only by a few members of the trade, who had started in business since the Federal Tariff was first imposed.

                <para>I intend subsequently to propose that the duty on imports from the United Kingdom be.  2d.  per lb. After the long debate which we have had I do not think that there is any occasion to enter into a long argument. A duty of  2½d.  will afford ample protection. We already have a large export trade, and the report of the Tariff Commission goes to show that instead of the imports of confectionery being a danger, the local industry is increasing every day. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that my honorable and esteemed friend is one of the happy recipients of the " give away"; I am not in the habit of giving any one away. If, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> says, the price of sugar is  2d.  per lb., and lollipops consist largely of plaster of Paris, the selling price -  3½d.  per lb. - is abnormally high. A duty of  2½d.  per lb. ought surely to be sufficient-, whilst a duty of  3d. per  lb., which is the primary price of the sugar, increased by  50  per cent., is simply preposterous. Even an impost of  2½d.  per lb. is so exceedingly liberal that it ought to satisfy any one but the most greedy protectionist. It is positively ludicrous to sit here and listen to gentlemen or senators-- </para>

It is extraordinary to sit here and listen to wild harangues in favour of manufacturers by some honorable senators who, a little while ago, declared that the self-same men were a most awful curse to the community, in that they constituted a combine that was doing I cannot tell how much injury to I do not know how many people. These confectionery manufacturers, a few weeks ago, were the most awful collection of creatures in the Commonwealth, in that they had agreed to put up prices. We now find that some of those who were condemning them wish to put up the prices for them ; some honorable senators are constituting themselves a combine, to enable the manufacturers of confectionery to charge higher prices than they were charging before. Regarding a duty of anything above1d. a lb. as an extortion, I shall vote for any reduction that is proposed. The request now before us is absolutely in accord with a. notice that I gave something like a month ago, and I hope very sincerely that a majority of the Committee will carry it, and agree to reduce the extortionate duty of 3d. per lb., if it is by only½d. </para>

                    <para>. - The debate has certainly been a prolonged one, and I feel that there have been adduced facts and evidence which go to show the absolute necessity for increased protection for the confectionery industry. The argument on the other side was that the duty of 2d. per lb. was practically prohibitive, but a statement of the imports has shown most conclusively that that is not the case. The Government, in making their proposals in this connexion, had the fullest recognition of the recommendation of the Tariff Commission. As honorable senators will remember, the Commission recommended that confectionery of the value of1s. per lb. and upwards should be dutiable at 25 per cent., which is 3d. per lb. As a matter of fact, every class of confectionery below a value of1s. per lb. is manufactured here ; consequently the Government adopted an all-round protection of 3d. per lb., with a. preferential duty of 2½. per lb. in favour of Great Britain. I submit that a reduction of the duty below 2½d. per lb. would have a very serious effect on our own manufacturers ; it would make ineffective the protection granted. As I have indicated from the outset, we must have regard first of all to our own manufacturers - a first regard for our own industries. We do not intend to sacrifice this industry, so far as we are in a position to protect it. We felt that in making a concession to Great Britain by reducing the duty to 2½d.per lb. we were cutting down the rate to the lowest limit; but we are now invited to reduce the duty to 2d. per lb. I am going to ask honorable senators, in view of the knowledge they possess that such a duty is insufficient, to say that the duty of 2xd. shall remain. </para>

                        <para>- That, however," is not the point. We have to decide whether we are prepared to grant reasonable and effective protection to one of our own industries. I venture to say that every lolly that is consumed here should be manufactured by our own workmen; yet we find that something like <inline font-style="italic">£i</inline> 16,000 - money belonging to this country - is annually paid abroad, part of which goes to pay the wages of other workmen in the industry. When we know that our workmen are competent to produce these particular classes of manufactures, of a quality equal to what can be made abroad, we have aright to say that they shall have the first choice. </para>

A duty of 2½d. per lb. against imports from Great Britain is regarded by them as necessary if we are to effectively protect this industry, and if honorable senators reduce the duty on imports from abroad by they will be doing a serious injustice to one of our most valued industries. In all the circumstances, I ask the Committee to retain the duty at 2jd. per lb., as proposed bv the Government. </para>

                        <para>- I shall crave leave to say a word or two upon that aspect of the question in a few moments. The Minister made a statement, I believe inadvertently, which was calculated to mislead the Committee. He pointed out that the previously existing duty of 2d. per lb. had not prohibited imports, but surely he could not be ignorant of the fact that 2d. per lb. was not hitherto the prevailing duty, and that a large proportion of the imports came in under a duty of  id.  per Jb. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. I think I am correct in saying that one-half of the imports were introduced,- not under a duty of 2d. per lb., which the Minister has affirmed was an ineffective duty, but under a duty of  id.  per lb., which is half the duty now proposed. It appears to me that even if we accept the contention of the Vice-President of the [Executive Council, that the hitherto prevailing duty is insufficient, we shall be doing quite enough if we increase it by 100 per cent. We shall do so if we fix the duty at 2d. per lb. Does the Vice-President of the Executive Council contend that double the hitherto prevailing duty will be insufficient? </para>

                            is speaking of pounds weight of both, whilst I am speaking of pounds value of confectionery, not including cocoa and chocolate. I have noticed that honorable senators opposite, when dealing with low-priced commodities such as lollies, like to roll out the number of pounds weight of importations. Described in pounds weight, the import appears to be so much more serious,, but I prefer to quote the cash value, to give honorable senators some idea of the real extent of the trade. If the declaration of the Minister that he desires this duty to be prohibitive is correct, then I ask what' becomes of the protestations we have heard in favour of preferential trade? What becomes of the statement of the) Minister, and also of
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline>
                            in defining protection? They have said that they ask for duties sufficiently high to equalize the conditions here and elsewhere. Will they contend that a duty of 2d. per lb. on this item would fail to do. that? Do honorable senators know what percentage that duty represents, and what proportion it bears to- the cost of labour in this industry? I saw, from one of the Tariff Commission's reports, that the cost of making 1 cwt of lollies was said to be 3s. 6d., and a duty of 2d. per lb. on a, hundredweight of lollies would many times exceed the cost of labour in their manufacture.

                        <para>- I cannot say whether it is or not, but I do not suppose that it is. As the previously prevailing duty upon a large proportion of the imports was id., and not 2d. per lb., before we raise the duty to 2½d. we should, as reasonable men, assume that a duty of 2d. per lb. will be sufficient until we see what the effect of that increase will be. I think that such an increase of the duty would be ample, and I shall vote for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson's</inline> motion, because, if we are sincere on the subject of preference, it will afford us an opportunity to benefit British trade without serious detriment to that of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Then I hope the honorable senator will become a smoker, so that he may acquire that fine equanimity which distinguishes smokers as a class. But I would point out that con- 'fectionery is a luxury. Certainly it is not a necessary of life - it is not a food. The figures quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> earlier in the evening conclusively show that under a uniform duty Great Britain, in competition with other countries which produce confections and send them into the Commonwealth, already enjoys 80 per cent, of the trade. From the point of view of a preferentialist - which I am not - it strikes me that it is absurd to say that we are going to encourage British trade by imposing an additional duty oT <inline font-style="italic">\A.</inline> per lb. If I believed - which with great respect to the Vice-President of the Executive Council I do-not - that the proposed duty would prove prohibitive other considerations might weigh with me. </para>

Of' course, it is human to err, and I merely express regret that upon this item the honorable senator cannot take the view that he previously entertained. I utterly fail to understand the logic of. his arguments. Just now he cast a vote in favour of  admitting 100 per cent, of the imports of confectionery into the Commonwealth at a duty of 2d. per lb., but now that a proposal has been made to admit 80 per cent, of them at that rate, he declares that he cannot support it. </para>

                    <para>.- Seldom in my political career have I been more astonished than I was at the speech delivered just now by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon. Senator Millen</inline> has most effectually scattered his confused arguments to the winds. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> voted to make 100 per cent, of the imports of confectionery into the Commonwealth dutiable at 2d. per lb., and he has since attempted to explain why he cannot support a proposal to admit 80 per cent, of them at that rate. I wish him joy of the confusion into which he has got himself. This great free-trade leader now has a chance of reducing the duty upon confectionery, but for some reason or other, best known to himself, he is not going to avail himself , of it. The Vice-President of the Executive Council will find that he has made a mistake in running away from the preferential trade policy of his leader. </para>

I should like to know what the people of Great Britain would think of this debate if they could hear it, and of the sincerity of our Prime Minister. With regard to the item of chocolate, I wish to tell <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> that chocolate is a food product. To a very great extent it is a necessary of life. The honorable senator has attempted to draw a line between food products and luxuries. He has declared that biscuits and confectionery are luxuries. The members of the Government who imagine that they won their seats upon a protective policy, have made protection their trump card, and they now wish to impose inordinately high duties upon the various items enumerated in the Tariff - duties which will  undoubtedly injure the prosperity of the Commonwealth. I hope that the Vice-President of the Executive Council will live to find out the mistake he has made in this and other items. He is not content with raising the duty 1 00 per cent., but tries to secure an increase of 300 per cent, or 400 per cent, if he can get it. What common-sense is there in that ? Is it holding the scales of justice equally between those who do not want a duty and those who want protection? My honorable friend talks about effective protection, but he means prohibition. He has actually departed from the illustration of effective protection which he gave in his second-reading speech. </para>

                <para>I am quite aware that a vote has already been taken which, if agreed to by another place, will reduce the duty on imports under the general Tariff to 2½d. But, while I recognise the right of the Committee to arrive at that decision, I also recognise that our decision is not final, and I want to make sure that in this particular item no preference is given to Great Britain. </para>

                        <para>- That will not happen if what I think will eventuate takes place. The further this discussion goes, the more pronounced is my opinion against preference. The Vice-President of the Executive Council said this afternoon that he was desirous that the Australian manufacturers of confectionery should command the whole of the market. Yet he is prepared, on behalf of the Government, to give a preference to the country that sends here about 85 per cent, of the confectionery imported. That is scarcely compatible with a desire to conserve the Australian market. When we recognise, as the honorable senator has pointed out, that in sugar we produce the foundation of the industry, and that we are quite able and prepared to manufacture any special confectionery which may now be imported, I do not see where his consistency lies. Fearful lest another place may upset the vote which has been taken this afternoon in reducing the duty in the first column to 2½d., I submit my motion, which, if adopted, will insure the carrying out of the desire of the leader of the Senate, as the representative of the Government, to capture the whole of the market. </para>

He admits that he cannot differentiate between the importations of cocoa butter for medicinal purposes and the total importations under the item, and yet he tells us that the medicinal use of cocoa butter is infinitesimal. Defeat will not place me in the wrong ; but I ask those who intend to vote against me to remember the phrase of that great statesman, Lord

                </quote>
                <para class="block">The question of the use of these articles in confectionery, especially the use of glucose, was considered very seriously by the Tariff Commission. My request embodies a recommendation by four members of that body, whose names I will give in order to show that into the consideration of the matter no question of free-trade or protection entered. It is recommended by Messrs. J. S. Clemons, G. W. Fuller, W. G. Higgs, and G. McGregor, and the object is as far as possible to exclude the importation of deleterious confectionery. When we come to deal with the Excise Tariff Bill it is my intention to submit a similar request, so as to make it impossible, so far as it can be done by the imposition of a heavy duty, for any persons to offer to consumers confectionery which is injurious. Of course, it is unnecessary for me to remark that no one desires to eat such confectionery or to know it is sold in the Commonwealth, no matter where it is made. Concerning the use of glucose in confectionery the four members of the Tariff Commission whom I have named made this report - </para>

                    <para>Important and definite evidence was given on this subject by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkinson,</inline> Government Analyst for Victoria.  His  evidence, detailed on pages 527/529,maybe summarized as a clear indication that the use of glucose in confectionery is undesirable and unnecessary ; that it means a commercial advantage to manufacturers and a disadvantage to consumers, and that it is used as a substitute for sugar or fruit juices. This opinion was supported by a manufacturer (Caffrey). It was further confirmed by the cross-examination of a witness in Victoria (Hoadley). An important witness, who to some extent depended on the use of glucose, had no objection to provisions for identifying confectionery in the manufacture of which glucose had been used (MacRobertson) ; as to the amount of glucose in imported confectionery ; in locally-manufactured. Evidence was also given showing that both paraffine wax and plaster of Paris occasionally entered into the composition of confectionery. </para>

                        <para>- When we come to deal with the Excise Tariff Bill propose to move a request for the imposition of an Excise duty upon confectionery containing glucose, paraffine wax or plaster of Paris. The honorable senator will recognise at once that into my proposal no element of the fiscal question enters. It simply represents a desire by four members of the Tariff Commission to prevent the consumption of deleterious confectionery. There can be no question about the impropriety of using paraffine wax and plaster of Paris. As regards the use of glucose I will briefly explain how it is made and how the danger to the consumer of confectionery arises. Glucose is an artificial production, which is used as a substitute for sugar. In its manufacture it is absolutely essential that sulphuric acid should be used, but subsequently, in order that it may be used as an article of food, efforts are made to get rid of that acid. The evidence we had, especially from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkinson,</inline> who assisted us very materially, and holds very strong views on this point, was that it was practically impossible to entirely remove the sulphuric acid. We were told by that gentleman that if in that process sulphuric acid were changed to sulphurous acid the danger to the consumer of the confectionery remained. Some witnesses attempted to show  that when sulphuric acid was replaced with sulphurous acid the injury to the consumer was comparatively slight. I regret that I have not with me a long letter in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkinson</inline> reiterated to me the very strong views which he holds with regard to the danger of using glucose in confectionery. No one could be more determined on that point than he was, and speaking as he did in his capacity of Government Analyst for Victoria his opinion is worthy of our consideration. </para>

                        <para>- Perfectly easily. As to why glucose is used in confectionery instead of sugar the answer is very simple. It is used because it enables the manufacturer to put more water into his confectionery. Of course, the object of every confectioner - and I am not speaking of Australian manufacturers only - is to get as much solidity as possible at the lowest possible expense. By using glucose he is enabled to put more water into his confectionery than he could do if he used sugar or fruit juices. That is the confessed and obvious reason for the use of glucose. But no one has said that it is a desirable substitute for sugar. </para>

                        <para>- There may be men here, just as there are in England and elsewhere, who would not like to be compelled to use sugar instead of glucose. But what is our position? So far as any glucose is used it supplants sugar, and so far as sugar is desirable as an ingredient in confectionery manufacture, we have it in Australia in unlimited quantities, and ought to use it. But that is a consideration which is beside the much more important question that glucose is decidedly not wholesome. I do not think that I need point out the evidence which we received showing how much glucose is used, but I can assure honorable senators that the quantity is considerable. As to any heart-burnings that might be caused by my proposal, obviously there would be none arising on fiscal grounds, because I am just as desirous of excluding the use of glucose where the confectionery is imported as in the case of local manufacturers. As  1  have already said, I shall move when we come to deal with the Excise duties an Excise on confectionery containing these prescribed articles of 2d. per lb. If any honorable senator asks "Why 2d.?" I reply that I have in anticipation respected the decision of the Committee with regard to the import duty. As we have an import duty on confectionery of 2d. ner lb., I quite agree to make the difference between the Excise duty and the import duty on confectionery containing these ingredients 2d. Therefore I am not attempting in that way to injure local manufacturers who use glucose. I again point out that the proposal has the warm support of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> ex-Senator Higgs, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fuller.</inline> We gave the matter very close and careful consideration, and I hope that the request will be carried. </para>

A large number- of experts say that glucose as it is used in confectionery is not injurious. It certainly is a fact that, although we have very severe adulteration laws in operation in the various States, hitherto there has been no prosecution against those who use glucose as an adulterating material. </para>

So far as I am advised at present by the departmental officers the experience is against the proposal. Further, if it were agreed to it would involve a chemical analysis of all the confectionery coming into the country. </para>

                        <para>- I am going to show to whom the benefit of the doubt ought to be given. Should it be extended to the importer, the manufacturer, or the poor unfortunate consumer, who opens his mouth and shuts his eyes, and waits for whatever we send him ? In a case of -this kind, it should be given to the children of the Commonwealth, who are the largest consumers of confectionery. There are on record a great many instances where the use of glucose has proved not only injurious, but fatal. In England, a short time ago, a number of people were poisoned by drinking beer, and it was distinctly shown that the poison found in it was introduced by the use of glucose in its manufacture. There may be a slight measure of doubt in favour of or against the use of glucose, but with these facts before us, surely it is our duty to give the benefit of that doubt to the people of Australia. In the United States of America, there are in operation very' strict laws with respect to the use of glucose. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has said that we have in force in Australia strict laws relating to the purity of foods and drugs. We have in some of the States, but in others we have not. In some States where there are strict laws of the kind in force, they are not properly administered. That is another reason why we should take action. In what way does the danger arise ? It arises from the necessity of using in the manufacture of glucose plaster of Paris, sulphurous acid, arsenic, and other ingredients which are dangerous to health. In America, foods are analyzed, and are not permitted to be used unless they pass a very high standard. Here, as a general rule, we have no such system, and we should therefore do something under the Tariff to protect our own people. The evidence of the manufacturers in Australia is that the use of glucose imparts to confectionery a chewing consistency, and makes it soft. In other words, they say that confectionery in which glucose is, used does not crystallize so readily as does that in which sugar only is employed. Yet it was clearly shown before the Tariff Commission that the same quality can be secured by the use of other ingredients, such as fruit juices, which may be a little more expensive, but are far more wholesome. There was a time when no glucose was used in the manufacture of confectionery in this State, and the people who consumed lollies then fared very well. A few years ago, only a few hundred tons were used in Australia ; but now thousands of tons are consumed. This is an indication of the growth of the use of glucose in the manufacture of confectionery. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>

                <para class="block">Clemons seeks to prevent the introduction of confectionery containing glucose from any other part of the world where there is no guarantee that there is any supervision over its manufacture. I think that we shall be acting wisely by protecting to that extent the people of Australia. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has raised the objection that this would necessitate an analysis being made in respect of every importation of lollies. There would have to be at least a declaration by the importer or the manufacturer abroad that his imports contained no glucose, and if we found that such guarantees were valueless we should prohibit the importation of goods by those who gave them. </para>

It is useless to talk about our diminishing birth-rate when the Minister insists upon poisoning; the children who do come into the world with glucose and plaster of Paris lollipops.
