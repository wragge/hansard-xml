                        <para>- It is not the intention of the Government to appoint a Royal Commission. On Friday last, when the Supply Bill was before the Senate, I undertook to bring the complaints' referred to under the notice of the Cabinet, so that there might be a determination by Ministers as to the course to be followed in regard to them. Unfortunately, we could hold only a somewhat hurried Cabinet meeting this morning, and the matter did not receive full consideration. Ministers determined, however, that there should be no Royal Commission, but that the complaints, particularly as to organization,  should receive the earliest attention and the fullest consideration. </para>

As to the adequate representation of the British Navy in Australian waters during the visit of the American warships, I would remind him that the invitation was conveyed through the Imperial authorities, who will, no doubt, recognise the importance of the occasion and the need for being fittingly represented. </para>

No doubt, in due course, that Bill will be presented to Parliament ; but I see no possibility of its introduction this session. </para>

            <para class="block">I admit that the duty originally proposed by the Government has been greatly reduced by another place, but on the other hand, I would point out that this item was previously free. Now, if there be one article under our Tariff which should be made as cheap as possible to the consumer it is wire netting, which is so requisite for the suppression of the rabbit pest - a pest which has developed such formidable dimensions as to render great areas of the best grazing land of. Australia no better than a howling desert, useless for the support of any of the live stock industries which play so important a part in the production and wealth of this continent. I believe that in one of the Victorian gaols an attempt is being made to manufacture wire netting. The fact that such an occupation has been found for prisoners is no reason why the whole community should be penalized by being required to pay extra for this very necessary article. </para>

                    <para>- The attitude  which the representatives of New South Wales in this -Chamber will assume towards this item will afford the best possible answer to a good deal of unnecessary eloquence which was expended last evening over the fact that we had voted in a certain direction in respect of one of the primary industries. I wish to point out that the factory for the manufacture of wire netting in New South Wales was established long before any duty upon that article was operative. The fact that that industry has grown up, and had the benefit of a protective duty incidentally extended to it at different times has nothing whatever to do with the position which we now have to face. It cannot be denied that the industry in New South Wales was established without the expectation that it would be assisted by a protective duty. It has -grown and carried on a successful business without any fiscal aid. and there is no reason whatever why the whole of the agricultural and pastoral pursuits of the Commonwealth should be penalized in respect of this article, even to the extent of <inline font-style="italic">£,x</inline> per mile, let alone or <inline font-style="italic">£6</inline> per mile. </para>

                    <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> will look at the paper which he holds in his hands, he will see that in accusing me of being unfair, he is scarcely acting in a manner that is consonant with  his own reputation for fairness and high intelligence. If wire-netting were excluded from Australia, the whole country, from one end to the other, would speedily become a huge rabbit- warren, and the growing of crops, and the feeding of cattle would become impossible. That extreme illustration merely evidences the positive need which exists for allowing the occupants of our soil to obtain the cheapest wire-netting possible. I hope that the Committee will be willing to request the abolition of the residue of the duty originally levied upon this article under the present Tariff. The item cannot be  a  revenue-producing one of any consequence to the Government, and to insist upon the duty proposed would penalize every occupant of the soil from one end of the continent to the other. </para>

                    <para>. - Honorable senators will observe that the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended the imposition of a duty of 25 per cent, upon this item. The Government originally proposed that a duty of 30 per cent, should be levied upon it under the general Tariff, and of 25 per cent, under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. The House of Representatives, however, reduced the Government proposal under the general Tariff to ic» per cent., and that under the Tariff for the United Kingdom to 5 per cent. The Government regard this industry as one of the most important in the Commonwealth, and feel that there is no reason why Australia should not make every mile of wire netting that is required by our people. Let us look at the matter from a practical stand-point. We know that wire netting of the value of £521,000 is annually imported into the Commonwealth. We also know that we have in our midst an industry in which a capital of something like £100,000 has been embarked. </para>

The local product is acknowledged to be equal, and, indeed, superior in many respects, to the imported article. If we realize the facility with which this wire netting can be made here - if we realize that we have all the plant, and can command all the skilled labour necessary without any difficulty - why should we deliberately encourage importation with a view to crushing out the local industry ? </para>

                        <para>- There can be only one construction placed on the action that the honorable senator is taking. He knows as well as I do that there is an European, also, I believe, a British combine in connexion with this industry. Ever since the introduction of the Tariff, the importers have deliberately made Australia a dumping ground, and reduced their price from £40 to£30 per mile, with the sole object of crushing out the local industry. As a matter of fact, locally-produced wire of A quality,1¼-inch mesh,  17-inch  gauge, and  42  inches wide - which I understand to be the rabbit netting most in demand - was from the  7th  March,  1907,  to  7th  September of the same year, quoted at£43  10s. ;  but, according to the list issued on the  6th  February,  1908,  the price had been reduced to£3610s. </para>

                        <para>- No, it is because of the dumping operations of the importers; and I could quote, if necessary, the prices of other qualities. For the B quality, 1¼-inch mesh,  17-inch  gauge, and  42  inches wide, the price has come down from  , £40 10s.  to  £3310s.,  and in similar proportions for other qualities. </para>

                        <para>- We are prepared to deal with monopolies, and we can much more easily deal with monopolies at home than with monopolies abroad. The moment the foreign combine succeeds in crushing the industry, the whole of the supply of wire netting will be in its hands. The combine, as has been the case in the past, certainly in regard to other industries, will be able to dictate its own terms ; and it is a  most short-sighted policy, in view of our past experience, to enable such a power to be exercised. At the present time there is competition between the local industry and the foreign industry, but our own manufacturers are struggling. </para>

                        <para>- I intend, if I can, to have the duties increased to 15 and 10 per cent. We have, first of all, the recommendation of the, protectionist section of the Tariff Commission ; and it must appeal to our common sense that this industry ought to command the local market. We may safely rely on the competition, which will result from reasonable protection, to secure that the farming and pastoral industry shall not suffer. The New South Wales Tariff of 1886, and the amending Tariff of 1887, imposed a duty of 60s. per ton, or a little over 10 per cent. ; in 1892, the duty was reduced to 30s. per ton, or a little over 5 per cent. ; and in 1895, the commodity was made free. I urge: upon honorable senators that this is an industry to which we should give reasonable protection. It is already established, and employs something like 400 men and. lads, with an output valued at £500,000. </para>

                        <para>- The industry was built up at the outset with a duty of 10 per cent., and I learn from inquiries that during; the time there has been no duty it has been struggling, and that it will be utterly impossible to carry it on unless reasonable protection is afforded by the Federal Legislature. Under all the circumstances, we are called upon at this juncture to come to the rescue, and see that fair and reasonable protection is extended. We ought not to give an invitation to the importer to dump his goods here for the purpose of crushing the industry, and, when that has been accomplished, enable him to hold the pastoralists and farmers completely in his owns hands and dictate his own price. </para>

                    <para>. - We have just listened to a speech which would have been convincing but for the simple facts of the case. I invite honorable senators' attention while I review what the Minister said. The honorable gentleman pointed, first of all, to the fact that this industry, during the last few years, has secured half the market, with an output of approximately £500,000; and yet he calls it a struggling industry. He invites honorable senators to believe that this industry is being strangled, because of the dumping which has taken place; and, as evidence of dumping, he points to the reduction of prices. I ask honorable senators to bear in mind the facts, and judge for themselves. During the time there was no duty, prices were high; and now there is a duty, prices, according to the Minister's figures, have been reduced. </para>

At present I am dealing with the Minister's statement about dumping; and I ask  where there was any dumping when the commodity was free, and, to use his own words, every invitation was given to the importer. As a matter of fact, Lysaght's price rose to ^45, and he could not supply orders. </para>

                        <para>- They could not. Through the firm of Gibbs, Bright, and Co. i booked a line of imported wire netting, and had to wait three months for the arrival of a shipload'. . The Minister has made a pathetic attempt to rig up the bogy of dumping. For the last six years there has been no duty ; and we might have imagined that dumping ' would have assumed gigantic proportions, but the fact is that during that period prices rose to a figure they had never reached before in Australia, and I hope never will again. On the 14th May, 1906, Lysaght's quotation for wire netting, of 1 1/2-inch mesh, 17-inch gauge, and 42 inches in width, was .£45, less the ordinary trade discount of 2  J  per cent. That was at a time when the. industry is said to have been struggling. The only struggle connected with it was that made on behalf of the wretched employes who publicly disclosed a tale as to their treatment that should have made their employers heartily ashamed of themselves. We have had in Australia no industry, the' operations of which have been inquired into, in respect of which a more disgraceful state of affairs has been disclosed. The wealthy firm of Gibbs, Bright, and Company, who were obtaining ^45 per ton for as much wire as they could turn out, were paying the men in the. factory wages that were scarcely sufficient to keep body and soul together. </para>

                        <para>- Messrs. Gibbs, Bright, and Company do not import wire netting, because, in a financial sense, they are really Lysaght Brothers. The Minister used the expression "wiping out this industry." Why has it not been wiped out within the last six years, with no Tariff restrictions, with every opportunity for any one to import or to obtain his wire netting through a shipping firm, and with several recognised shipping merchants, in Sydney at all events, anxious to import netting? Concurrent with that state of affairs prices rose to the abnormal figure I have quoted. </para>

Although the price appears considerable, the labour involved in weaving a mile of ordinary wire netting is only 23s. 6d. The prices quoted by the Minister are, therefore, misleading. Are honorable senators proposing to impose a duty to enable a solitary manufacturer to make a profit, or to insure good conditions for the employes in the industry ? </para>

                        <para>- He is sufficiently familiar with the struggles of the farmer to be able to say whether or not this duty will assist them. I desire honorable senators to consider what they propose to do in order to enable employment of the value of 23s. 6d. per mile to be given in respect of every mile of wire netting used? It is rather difficult to ascertain the average price per mile, because of the various gauges and meshes used, but if I state that prices range from £28 to £37 per mile I presume that I shall be fairly within the mark. The average of those prices is about £32 per mile. I understand that the labour involved in the weaving of wire netting does not vary much in respect of 17-in. or 18-in. gauge. The labour consists really of feeding the machines - and this work is done largely by boys - after a superior workman has set the gauge.I am assuming for the purpose of my argument that a mile of wire netting, taking the whole output of the factory, costs about £32. Ten per cent. on that would be £3 4s. per mile, whilst5 per cent. would be £1 12s. per mile. In view of the suggestion made by the Minister as to an increased duty, I propose to assume that we are discussing a 10 per cent. duty. </para>

                        <para>- Lysaght's are turning out 17-in. gauge netting. There is a great deal of confusion on the point. South Australia uses 18-in. gauge, whilst in New South Wales 17-in. gauge is regarded as the standard. I do not know in what direction Victoria is working, but since the Government of New South Wales started to import wire netting we have begun to fall more into line with South Australia. As the number of wire-netting fences is being multiplied and subdivisions are increasing, the necessity for the stouter wire is becoming less.  I  am forming a moderate estimate when I put down the average cost of 42-in.1¼-in. mesh netting at £32 per mile; but to satisfy honorable senators generally I shall assume for the purpose of my argument that the average price is £30. Ten per cent. on that amounts to£3, so that we are asked to levy a duty of £3 upon a mile of wire netting, the labour cost of which is 23s. 6d. Is that reasonable, even from the point of view of a protectionist, having regard to the fact that rabbit-proof fencing has become to-day absolutely necessary for the salvation of the man on the land? </para>

                        <para>- That statement is altogether different from the assertion that the factory has been working only half time. Accepting the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> as correct, what does it mean? We have had a factory equipped with the necessary machinery, able to sell its wire netting at £45 per mile - a much higher price than that obtained for the imported article - and yet conducted by men so wanting in enterprise that it has worked only half time. In face of the fact that Lysaght's factory could sell all the wire that it could turn out during the last few years, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> would have us believe that, owing to importations, it has been working only half time. . During the. last few years Lysaght Brothers' factory has never worked half time. Operations are suspended only at such times as Christmas, in. order that the machinery may be overhauled, and that is exactly what one would expect - that when trade is brisk, as it has been the firm  would get the greatest possible output. I want to pass on to show what this duty means on the total consumption in Australia. The Minister has said that in 1906 the imports were worth £500,000. He has also stated that from the factory of this strangled  or  struggling industry, £500,000 worth was turned out in the year. That shows that Australia is consuming £1,000,000 worth of this wire netting a year. Ten per cent. on that sum comes to £100,000 a year, and that is the amount of tax which we are asked to levy even as the schedule stands to-day. Lysaght's firm, through their manager, have stated that their total wages payment in their highest week was £700. If they work fifty-two weeks in the year, never missing a day, and pay £700 a week in wages, that represents a total sum of £36,400. We are asked then to levy a tax of £100,000 in order to give wages which at the utmost come to only £36,000. </para>

                        <para>- And so would the price of the article. I have never doubted  for a moment that you can increase the employment in certain industries if you impose a duty. But my object in putting forward these figures is to show at what cost to the. users of the netting it is proposed to give this additional employment. I intend to give briefly a few figures, and to show what a tremendous increase Lysaght has placed on his netting as compared with the price at which imported netting can be purchased. In the first place, I shall give the figures in the tenders submitted to the New South Wales Government, when they recently invited a supply of  4,000  miles of the netting. Honorable senators may assume that Lysaght cut his price as low as he possibly could. It was a big order, and naturally following the ordinary rules of business, he would quote a lower price than he would ask for retail lots.  His  price then for supplying the New South Wales Government with  18-  gauge netting,  42  inches by11/4 inches, was £31. The tender accepted by the Government was for <inline font-style="italic">£26,</inline> and they are retailing the netting to the Pastures Protection Boards at <inline font-style="italic">£26</inline> 5s.  a mile. To say that the difference is <inline font-style="italic">£4</inline> 15s.  per mile is perhaps hardly the correct way to put it. Honorable senators can see what the percentage is, and that is far and away the more instructive method of judging the difference. Quite recently the Government of New South Wales has accepted a tender for an additional supply of this netting. I do not quite know the price at which the tender was accepted, but I know the. price at which the netting is being supplied to the Pastures Protection Boards. Of course, there is a small additional expense to be added to the contract price before the Government is in a position to hand the netting to the Boards. The price at which the netting is supplied out of the second order to the Boards is <inline font-style="italic">£22</inline> 10s.  a mile. I now turn to a trade list issued by Armstrong and Co., of O'Connell -street, Sydney, in which they quote a price for Lysaght's netting of a similar kind. It is of no use to ask me why I do not give Lysaght's price direct. He will not sell to me direct, and the only way in which I can get his netting is by going to those firms whom he will supply. This price list of Armstrong and Co. is in entire agreement in all particulars with the price list issued by Rich and Co., a firm in the same city. Therefore, I am entitled to say that they are the trade prices current for this article on a particular date. </para>

                        <para>- No; they are independent firms, and handle either Lysaght's stuff or imported stuff. I can get either article from them when it is on . hand. If one orders Lysaght's netting they will undertake to get it if they can; or if one wants to get imported netting they will quote the prices of the brands which they import. They are both ordinary merchants. The price at which the Government of New South Wales is retailing this wire netting to the Pastures Protection Boards is <inline font-style="italic">£22</inline> 10s.  a mile, and the price quoted by Armstrong and Company and Rich and Company for the same kind of netting is <inline font-style="italic">£28</inline> 12s.  6d. a mile. In other words, there is a difference of  £62s.  6d. a mile in the cost of the netting which to-day is ordinarily used throughout Australia to combat the rabbit pest. </para>

                        <para>- I have shown that Lysaght's tender on a previous occasion for supplying  4,000  miles of the netting was£31, as against the tender of <inline font-style="italic">£26</inline> which the State Government accepted. I do not think that on the last occasion Lysaght tendered, but I know that the Government accepted a tender to supply the netting at£22  10s.  a mile, being£3  10s.  less than the amount in the previous tender. During the last twelve months, the price has been falling all along the line. Up to then it was on the up grade, but since then owing to the reduction in the price of wire, it has been going down steadily, as in the case of every other metal, and unfortunately a great many articles which are not metals. To-day the State Government is enabled, by having accepted the British tender, to supply the netting to the farmers at <inline font-style="italic">£22</inline> 10s.  a mile, and for the same class of netting Lysaght is asking to-day <inline font-style="italic">£28</inline> 12s.  6d. </para>

                        <para>- Nothing. I have used both imported netting and Lysaght's netting, and I never had a man who would  rebate a single shilling. So far as the labour is concerned, I do not know that it makes much difference. But it does make a difference in the appearance of the fence. Netting which has been rolled tightly in order to occupy the least space in a. ship has a tendency when hung on a  fence to ripple in waves, but when netting is rolled loosely, as is Lysaght's, that sagging is absent. </para>

                        <para>- Generally speaking, I think that it is made in  100-yard  lengths. I have shown that in the case of  42-in.  netting there is a difference of <inline font-style="italic">£6</inline> 2s.  6d. per mile in cost between the imported article and Lysaght's article. Let me now take another gauge of the same class of netting, which is being used very largely, and that is the 36-in. width. The Government of New South Wales is supplying that gauge to the Pastures Protection Boards at <inline font-style="italic">£19</inline> 15s.  a mile; whereas Lysaght's price given to the two firms I  have named is  .£24 17s.  6d. - being a difference of <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline> 2s.  6d. Roughly speaking, Lysaght's price to-day for both these articles is  27  per cent, over and above the price at which the State Government is supplying the Boards. He would not be able to ask that price unless he was selling his netting. Therefore, although the State Government is able to place within the reach of farmers and settlers a much cheaper article, it is quite clear that the  factory is not shut up in consequence, because it is going on working, and getting its price. Lysaght would not be able to ask the extra price unless he was getting it. </para>

                        <para>- No, my honorable friend must recognise that the wire netting supplied to the State Government largely finds its way into the hands of the smaller people. It is issued by the Government to the Pastures Protection Boards, who allot it to the ratepayers in their district, who are invariably the smaller farmers and settlers, and it is allotted too on easy payments. I am merely quoting the fact that "the State Government has been able to buy from Great Britain' wire netting at the figures I have quoted, and that at. the same time the local price is from  27  to  28  per cent, higher. </para>

                        <para>- No, I doubt very much whether a large holder in New South Wales could get cheap netting from the Government. The system was initiated primarily to assist the smaller farmers, but I do not wish to go into that aspect of the case. I am merely quoting the figures to show that, the State Government is able to buy abroad, and make available here for distribution at  ,£22  ios. and <inline font-style="italic">£19</inline> 15s.  a mile respectively, the two widths of netting for which Lysaght to-day is asking  27  per cent. more. A little while ago the representatives of Lysaght put forward the very ingenious plea that if the duty originally proposed were left on they would undertake not to raise prices. A more impudent statement was never offered to the public. With the price at a phenomenally high level, and with the certain knowledge that the material of which they made the netting was bound to come clown, they came forward and magnanimously said, " Give us the  25  per cent, duty, and we will undertake not to raise our price." They knew that the price was bound to come down, Tariff or no Tariff, and so their offer not to raise it above the  .£40  at which it then stood was not only a useless promise, but savoured very much of an impudent attempt to mislead the public. Prices have been coming down of late days. The Vice-President of the Executive Council sought to show that that was owing to dumping operations. But he must know, or ought to have been informed by those who undertake to advise him, that the fall in the price of the netting has been concurrent and in complete sympathy with the fall in the price of the material out of which it is made. </para>

                        <para>- Entirely corresponding with the fall in the price of the wire out of which the netting is made. If it were not so, and if the fall was merely due to dumping, how was it that dumping did not take place when the netting was selling at  ,£45  a mile, and that only now, when it has come down to <inline font-style="italic">£36</inline> and  ^39  a mile, the dumpers have got to. work? A few years ago wire netting was, perhaps rightly, regarded as being of special- interest to the larger land-holders - as merely the luxury of the squatter and not the necessity of the small man. But today honorable senators, if they know anything about the matter, must surely abandon that plea. If netting is essential to the grazier, it is doubly so to the man who is farming. No man in certain districts of New South Wales, such as those along the Western line, will venture to put a crop in to-day without reasonable protection against the rabbits. As wire netting has become absolutely essential to the farming community and the small settler, the cost per acre is very much greater to him than to the large man. If there is any sincerity in the demand for closer settlement, any honest desire to assist the man on the land, or to offer greater inducements to others to join him, the last thing we ought to do is to put any impost upon that which is essential to his success when he is there. Let me remind honorable senators to what an extent  the 'small settler is playing his part in the development of the lands of Australia. I have not been able owing to want of time to obtain the figures for all the States, but I have them for New South Wales and South Australia. In New South Wales, out of  72,000  holdings,  70,000  are held in areas of under  5,000  acres. Knowing something of the country, I call men with less than  5,000  acres in New South Wales small settlers. I do not mean that every man with a  5,000-acre  block is a small settler, but it is necessary to place the line somewhere. </para>

Even then, out of  72,000  holdings in New South Wales,  65,000  are held in areas of less than  1,000  acre's. A very big percentage of those holders is faced with the necessity of using rabbit-proof netting, and a still larger number will be faced with it before long. In South Australia, practically the same story is repeated.  According to statistics, that State has  20,000  holdings, of which  19,000  are held in areas of under  5,000  acres. </para>

From  1  to  100  acres there are  6,800  holdings, and from  100  to  1,000  acres,  10,600  holdings. Therefore, whilst a large percentage of the area of a country may be in a few hands, . still there is a very much bigger body of nien on small holdings. In the States which I have named there is a tremendously preponderating percentage of small holders, nearly all of whom not only want netting, but must have it.  . </para>

                        <para>- I am leaving that aspect of the case out, because an argument based even on the necessity for justice to the larger man is apparently not potent in this chamber. ' But I expect sympathetic support from honorable senators opposite when so large a number, of those who can only be regarded as small holders are faced with the problem" of rabbit de:struction, and face it, too, with the knowledge that unless they can successfully cope with it they must say good-bye to their holdings, and good-bye to their occupa-tion. Whatever advantage can be conferred upon the wire-netting industry is not far one moment to be considered side by side with the importance of the interests of those people upon the land. It is impossible to say how many men are employed upon the land, but while Australia could go on well without Lysaght's factory, employing  400  people, mostly boys, it cannot go on for a moment if the man on the land has to give place to the rabbit. That is the alternative before the Committee. The rabbit has ceased to be merely a pest. It is making a challenge for existence against the men who have gone on to the land, and who have done  move to open up, develop, and establish Australia than was ever done by Lysaght's or any other factory. </para>

                        <para>- The Labour Party did not bring it here, but they must be very careful not to do something to establish it here. The honorable senator is evidently disinclined to take any action to eradicate it. The fate of a dozen Lysaght factories hanging in the balance would not compare with the seriousness of the position with which every State in the Union is to-day confronted. Not long ago Western Australia would have laughed at the idea of a rabbit being there. The rabbit is seen and known there now. It is on speaking terms with Western Australians, and they are quite familiar with it. Before long the enormous unoccupied areas of that State will cause the pest to become an even bigger trouble there than it has been in the other States. I ask the Committee to put upon one side the mere question of the probable effect of its decision upon Lysaght's factory, although I have shown that the industry has done very well during the last few years without a duty, and to consider what the effect will be upon the great struggle which is being waged by hundreds and thousands of farmers and settlers on the one hand, and by the rabbit on the other. On which side are honorable senators going to throw their weight? </para>

                            has suffered very acutely, in common with thousands of Australian settlers, because there was no duty, and because no wire-netting industry was established in Australia to the extent that the requirements of Australia demanded.

                        <para>- That is exactly the position. If the honorable senator would restrain his youthful impetuosity until I have finished, he would probably more thoroughly understand what I mean by supporting, not only the duty in the schedule, but an increase of it. I propose to take that course in the interests not only of the manufacturers of wire-netting in Australia, and of the workers employed in the industry, but also of the settlers on whose behalf <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has made so eloquent an appeal, and in whose company <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> has, according to his own declarations, suffered so much because we have not had a wire-netting industry or a duty upon wire-netting in the past. </para>

Shortly after the passing of the Act, and when Vermin Boards, District Councils, and individuals began to take action, there was an immense demand for wire netting, and then the importers and not the manufacturers - because there was no duty on wire netting, and no industry for its manufacture in the State - ran prices up to such an inordinate extent that members of the Labour and Liberal Parties in the local Parliament had to go to the Government and induce them to indent wire netting themselves. </para>

                        <para>- There was no duty on wire netting, and no local industry for its manufacture in Victoria, and what. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bent</inline> did was done to bring down the price charged by importers to the settlers. This applies with equal force to the experience of Queensland, and in New South Wales, even although they had a struggling industry established there, they were placed' in exactly the same position. The price of wire netting went up, because the Government of New South Wales came to the rescue of the people in two ways. First of all, they passed an Act similar to that passed in South Australia, making the State Government responsible for the cost of wire netting, whether manufactured in New South Wales or imported. The Government, having secured the netting, handed it over to some local authority for distribution to the settlers. A very large number of the settlers desired to take advantage of the opportunities afforded to obtain it, with the result that, on account of the extraordinary demand, Lysaght Brothers were not able to supply all that was required, and! the importers, taking advantage of the position, ran the prices up as high as ever they could. Then the New South Wales Government were forced to do what the South Australian Government had to do, and became indentors of wire netting. </para>

                        <para>- It does not matter. I have not the least doubt that Lysaght put in a tender for the supply of a reliable, good article, which it would be in the interest of the people of New South Wales to purchase. But the importers tendered to supply inferior wire netting at a lower price and secured the contract. The proprietor of one of the largest estates in; the southern portion of New South Wales fenced in his property with some of the cheap imported netting, and he is now taking it down and replacing it with Lysaght's netting at a higher price. He knows now that it would have been cheaper for hint to have paid a little more in the first instance for his netting than to have to fence his estate twice over. We, who know these things, are aware that under free-trade in  wire netting the Australian settlers were in every instance bled by the importers and agents in other parts of the world. </para>

                        <para>- I am very ignorant, no doubt, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> is a perfect Solon. The ramifications of his knowledge are most extensive. He knows more than perhaps any other man in the , world, and his potentialities are not yet exhausted. There are some men who think they know so much that they are ready to meet every statement made by other people with a prompt contradiction. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> made a very pathetic appeal to the Committee, because about two years ago, or a little more, he made application to Lysaght Brothers for 3 miles of wire-netting, and had to pay a certain price for it. The honorable senator ridiculed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie's</inline> suggestion that Lysaght's employes were working only about half time. I know for a fact that at the present time Lysaght's are overstocked. It does not matter what the price of wire-netting may be, men at present employed in the industry can expect to have to work half-time, if not to have their services dispensed with altogether. Two or three years ago, when abnormally high prices were ruling for wire-netting, Lysaght Brothers could not supply orders which they could easily supply now, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> must recollect that at that time there was a big strike in Westphalia, where the wire used in the manufacture of wire netting is produced. It is almost certain that the reason why the prices for wire netting were so high at that time was because Lysaght Brothers could not obtain supplies of the wire they required to enable them to manufacture netting, and cope with the competition of the importers. </para>

                        <para>- I am aware of that, and that Lysaght Brothers will bring down their prices, as any other makers would, when they can get cheap wire. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> must have known that at the time ho applied for the 3 miles of wire netting to which he referred, Lysaght ' Brothers could not obtain the wire they required, because of the strike in Westphalia. When an argument of this sort is introduced to influence the views of honorable senators it is only fair that the whole truth should be known, and that the Committee should be informed of the reason why prices were so high. I direct the attention of honorable senators to the fact that if a fair duty is placed on wire netting it is very possible that we shall not be confined to Lysaght Brothers for supplies of locally-manufactured netting, but that the industry will be established in other parts of Australia. If the Honorable  Thomas  Bent could establish the wire-netting industry in a gaol in Victoria, Government, municipal, or private interest may be expected to be able to establish it in some of the other States. To encourage the manufacture of wire netting in the Commonwealth is the proper way in which to protect the interests of the users of the commodity, and to do good service to the settlers of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Before the adjournment I was endeavouring to show the position in which the settlers of Australia were placed in regard to the use of wire netting when there was no duty, and absolute free-trade conditions existed in regard to the supply of this commodity. I do. not think that any honorable senator can deny the statements that I have already made as to the history of this question. By way of illustration, I wish to show what was done in regard to another article upon which there was no duty. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell has special knowledge of the matter to which I shall refer. In South Australia about ten years ago there was no duty on artificial manures, nor were there any manufacturers within the State. The importers and foreign manufacturers were fleecing the farmers all over South Australia. The Government had to step in, and, through their making the statement that they would be compelled to do the same in connexion with artificial manures as they had previously done with regard to wire netting, the importers practically gave a guarantee to the Government that the price of their manures would not exceed a certain amount - <inline font-style="italic">£4</inline> 15s. a ton, I think it was. That fact shows that even where there is no duty, the producers are at the mercy of the foreign manufacturer and the importer. As in the case of artificial manures, so it is with wire netting; the only way to protect the users of the commodity is to encourage the establishment of manufactures here. </para>

                        <para>- Give us a duty on wire netting similar to that which has been imposed for the benefit of the iron industry of Australia. If we are going to establish an iron industry to supply Australia with iron, we must, to do the work on an economic basis, supply everything that is made from iron. We shall not produce steel rails, and steel rails only, and do it cheaply. We cannot make an economic success of the undertaking by manufacturing one or two commodities only. We shall have to manufacture everything, from the ore right up to the finished article, no matter what that article is so long as it is made of iron or steel. But if we are going to do that, and to carry out the hopes of the manufacturers of wire netting in New South Wales, we shall have .to manufacture the wire that is used for the making of wire netting. Until we do manufacture that wire in Australia, the manufacture of wire netting will not be the success that it ought to be. On that assumption, it must be supposed that in the near future we shall manufacture wire. What are we going to do with it when we have manufactured it? Are we going to send it to America, England, or Germany, to be manufactured into wire netting, and sent back to Australia to enter into com petition with the wire-netting industry of this country? I should like honorable senators to answer that position. But I know that they cannot answer it logically, and- they will not attempt to answer it .at all. </para>

Something has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> about the duty itself. I' say that the duty is not high enough. It ought to be at least 15 per cent., and 10 per cent, against the United Kingdom. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has declared that an amount equal to £700 a week, or £36,400 per annum, is paid in wages by the Lysaght Company, in Sydney. </para>

                        <para>- That would amount, as the honorable senator said, to £36,400 in a year, assuming that they paid the same amount every week, and worked full time. The honorable senator wanted to make out that because the wages in the weaving of -wire netting only amounted to £36,400 a year, that is an argument why we should not carry on the industry in Australia. But I wish to point out that where the raw material for the manufacture of any article comprises the greater amount of the value pf that article, there is no comparison between the wages paid in connexion with the finished article and the amount of duty that ought to be charged on. it. </para>

                        <para>- The wages 1paM by the Lysaght Company are only part of the wages paid in connexion with the manufacture of wire netting, if you begin with the ore, and go through all the processes up to the turning out of the wire netting itself. The greater 'portion of the wages would be paid, not in the weaving of the wire netting, 'but in the" mining of the ore the smelting of the iron, and the manufac:.ture of the wire necessary for- the pro-  duction of the wire netting. If we hope to have those processes carried out in Australia in the near future, we must reckon the effect of this percentage of duty on the raising of the ore, and all -the processes up to the production of the finished article. I hope that honorable senators will not forget such a consideration' as that. When we realize that the wire has to be imported at the  present time, and that the galvanized wire for manufacture into wire netting forms more than three-fourths of the value of the wire netting itself, it is evident that the amount of ,£36,400 should be calculated, not on the basis of ,£500,000, but on one-fourth of ,£500,000, which would be a very different consideration from that which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has put. I hope that the facts that have been laid before the Committee will be weighed carefully by honorable senators, and that no selfish consideration will actuate them in giving a vote on a question of such importance, not only to the settlers all over Australia, who have to guard themselves against the ravages of pests, such as wild dogs, rabbits, and other- vermin, but that they will also consider that there are other interests to conserve, such as the mining of ore, the manufacture of iron, and the weaving of the wire netting itself. I hope that honorable senators will give consideration to all these things, and will come to the conclusion that in the best interests of the settlers themselves, the miners, and the manufacturers, it would' be well to put a. reasonable duty on the' article, so that in the future the settlers themselves may reap the benefit of lower prices than they had to pay when entirely dependent on importers and foreign manufacturers. </para>

                    GOULD (New South Wales) [3.14]. - I am- not inclined to allow an important matter of this kind to pass without saying a few words with regard to the position which I take up and the vote that I am about to give. A great deal of the speech just delivered by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline>
                    would have been' very applicable were we discussing the duty upon manufactured wire.  His  arguments would be .very much to the point if we were considering whether there should be a duty of 10 per cent. or . 25 per cent, on imported wire, but I do not think that his arguments, have very much to do with the duty that it is now proposed to place upon wire netting.' I want honorable senators to realize that at the present time we are not considering the propriety of imposing a duty upon wire at all. We are discussing the wisdom of placing a duty upon wire netting which may be manufactured in the Commonwealth from wire imported from, other parts of the world. Therefore, the argument of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline>
                    with regard to the amount of labour employed in the production of wire netting becomes a Very important consideration in connexion with this question. We are not called upon to approach it entirely from a free-trade or a protectionist stand-point. We have to regard it from the position of what is best for the Commonwealth at large. It is practically admitted that the rabbits are a curse to the pastoral and agricultural industries. From day to day we read in the press of various proposals which have been submitted with a view to devising some means of coping with this serious menace to the great industries of the Commonwealth. We find that large sums of money have been expended in experimenting with a new system, whereby a disease might be introduced which would destroy the rabbits and do little or no injury to other animals or to human beings. Not only the Government of the Commonwealth, but also the Governments of the States have recognised the importance of the rabbit pest. They have recognised that they are face to face with an evil which may result in the loss of millions annually to the community, if it is not coped with in a reasonable and proper manner. We must do all we can to reduce the cost of wire netting to the lowest possible extent, and we can only achieve that object by removing the duty thereon. From time to time many schemes have been suggested, but we always come back to a recognition- of the fact that the rabbit pest can only be coped with by means of wire netting - by separating portions of a property from other portions of the estates and getting rid of the rabbit within the wire-netted areas. If we try to .cope with, the rabbits, without shutting them out from particular areas of land, we shall find that we have undertaken a work . beyond the capacity of our people. Queensland fenced herself off from New South Wales in order to prevent as far as possible the pest from crossing the border and becoming a worse evil there than, in the other State. From time to time this question has been discussed in New South Wales, and we have always been compelled to realize that the one remedy is the exclusion of rabbits from particular areas by means of wire netting. I want honorable senators to recognise that, so_far, we have not discovered any means of coping successfully with the rabbit pest, but we have found a means by which we can minimize the injury which" otherwise would be sustained. Let me call their attention to the value of one of the industries which are affected by the spread of the pest. In 1906 we exported wool to the value of £22, 000, 000. If there were no other industry to be considered, the value of the pastoral industry alone would justify us in giving every possible consideration to it, even if it were at the expense of extinguishing industries started in order to produce wire netting. When I mention that a pastoralist has to erect wire netting not for a distance of a few hundred yards, but for a distance of many miles, honorable senators will probably realize the immense burden which will be placed' upon him if they, for the sake of protecting 200 or 300 or 400 men, levy a heavy duty on wire netting.

                        <para>- Then the honorable senator is not so reliable a guide to us as is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> From my stand-point, theory leads me to believe that the price of an article is- increased by the imposition of a duty. Why was this item fought so energetically in the other House? Was the duty cut down there in order to increase the manufacture of wire netting in the Commonwealth? In that House there is a number of men who have had a very large, and, in some cases, an unfortunate, experience of the rabbit pest. They were anxious to cut down the duty to the lowest possible extent, and when they could not get the article made absolutely free, they were compelled to accept a reduced duty. Apart from our annual export" of £22,000,000 worth of wool, the output of the agricultural industry would,  .1  believe, be valued at from £12,000,000 to £14,000,000. Although the whole of the farmers may not have been menaced by the rabbit, yet a great many of our large wheat producers have suffered from its depredations. We ought to consider what will benefit the greatest number of persons in the Commonwealth, and not what will benefit a few score of persons, or even 300 or. 400. I do not remember at the present moment how many persons are engaged in the pastoral and agricultural industries, but will any one tell me that the number of persons who would be engaged in the manufacture of wire netting would represent a tithe of those engaged in those two great industries ? In a matter of this kind, the interests of the smaller number of people must give way to the interests of the bulk of the community. I remind honorable senators that it is not the manufacturing industries which are going to make Australia great during the next ten years. If they destroy  the great pas,toral and agricultural industries, they will destroy the vital foundations on which the welfare of this community is going to rest for many years to come. I do not belittle the great value of manufacturing industries to a country. I should be a foolish man if I did, but "I have a sense of proportion and am enabled to see that with a vast territory occupied by only 4,000,000 or  5,000,000  persons, we shall have to rely on our great primary industries for many years. Any man who does a single act that will destroy or hinder or render less remunerative those industries is striking a blow at the well-being of the community, and interfering wife its foundations. The other day a great deal was said here about the mining industry. We were asked to recognise that it is a great industry, and to make special concessions in that regard. What is the value of gold-mining to the country? In 1906 the output of gold was valued at between £14,000,000 and£15, 000,000. Whereas in that year the output of the pastoral industry was valued at£22,000,000, the output of the pastoral. and agricultural industries combined was worth, I suppose, from£35,000,000 to£40,000,000. I am prepared to assist every primary industry to the fullest possible extent if it can be done without doing any injustice to our two great primary industries. It has been suggested by one honorable senator that the great pastoral magnates can very well afford to bear a little extra taxation in order to assist the smaller, men, who might be employed in the manufacture of wire netting. While I have no sympathy with an argument of that character, I remind that honorable senator that the great bulk of those who are affected by this duty are not so much the great pastoral magnates, as the men with the smaller areas, to whom the exclusion of the rabbit is a more vital matter than it is even to the great pastoralists. There is a class of persons who are taking up land alongside areas held by what some persons are pleased to call the great pastoral magnates. Under the laws of the State the small men are compelled to pay one-half the cost of the rabbit-proof fence which may be erected, and, therefore, the imposition of a duty is a vital matter to them. Where they take up land, apart from anybody else, they have to defray the whole cost of the rabbit-proof fence. We ought to be careful as to how we interfere with their industry just as we ought to be careful as to how we interfere with the industry of the pastoral magnate. I earnestly implore honorable senators to keep in view these points, and not for the sake of giving employment to a few hundred men penalize the primary industries on which the whole prosperity of the Commonwealth is dependent. Some honorable senators argue that if the pastoralists have to pay a little more for their wire netting it will not hurt them very seriously. It may not hurt them in good seasons, but it should be remembered that occasionally they are confronted with very bad times when the saving of every shilling is a matter of vital importance in order that the industry may be carried on. It is not an industry which is confined to simply a few individuals, but it is one on which the whole prosperity of Australia is dependent at the present time. Wipe out the pastoral and agricultural industries, and where would Australia be? She would be down amongst the minor places of the earth - a poor country with poor prospects. Our manufacturing industries would have no prospect of success at all if it were not for those great primary industries. We should be simply struggling on as a primitive people, little removed from barbarism, instead of being a people who claim to take an advanced position in the' ranks of civilization. Honorable senators, if they are true to themselves, and to the people whom they are called upon to represent, and in whose interests it is their duty to legislate, will support the proposal to make wire netting free. What I said in the first instance in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> cannot be impressed too earnestly upon the Committee - that the wire-nettiing industry is at present only an industry which is manufacturing its product from wire imported free. Its raw material is given to it free. Why, then, when it costs 30s. or so to turn the wire into the finished article, should we give a duty of <inline font-style="italic">£3</inline> or£1, or even 15s. a ton? Why give the industry a duty in order that the burden may be placed upon the shoulders of the people who use wire netting? This Parliament has not been unmindful of those engaged in the wire-netting industry because there is now before the Senate a Manufactures Encouragement Bill, in which provision . is made for them to receive assistance, not from a select few in the community, but from the whole of the people. That measure includes the following bounties : Galvanized iron, 10 per cent, on value; wire netting and wire, 10 per cent, on value; and iron and steel . tubes or pipes (except riveted or cast), not more than 4 inches internal diameter, 10 per cent, on value. It is proposed to give a sum of . £50,000 in bounties for the establishment of industries of that character. Is it not far better, if it is thought desirable to establish those industries at the expense of the community, to provide that all the people shall contribute to them directly by means of a bounty, than to tax one section of the community only? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator will find that, so sure as.  they are given a duty, that Bill will be brought forward, and honorable senators will be strongly urged to give them the bounty also. I am prepared to vote for the bounty, and, although I have no authority to speak on their behalf, I believe that my colleagues on this side from New South Wales will be prepared to do the same. But I shall oppose most strenuously the imposition of the duty proposed. I am prepared, by means of the bounty proposed by the Government, to encourage the manufacture of wire netting as a branch of the great iron industry which we hope to see established in Australia. I_ again urge honorable senators to think twice before they adopt any other course than the one embodied in the request to make the item free. </para>

                    </talker>
                    <para>. - Having listened to the speeches of several honorable senators, including that of the last  speaker,  not forgetting those of the three leaders - Senators McGregor, Millen, and Best - I naturally feel somewhat nervous and timid in approaching the question. But it is necessary to give reasons for the vote which I intend to give. If I had always lived in a city, I' might have known a lot more than I do about many subjects, but having lived on the land until the last seven years, I surely ought to know something about a question of this kind. I am not going to sound my own praises, but in addition to having had long experience on the land, I was a member of the Caltowie .District Council for five years, and a member of the Carrieton District Council for three years, and for some time its  chairman.  In that extensive district, the greatest trouble which we as a Council had to face was the vermin difficulty. Many days, and  even weeks, . have I spent without reward in trying to do justice to the district and to the State in combating the rabbit pest. Under the law of the State, the' Government looked to the councils to see that the rabbits were exterminated, and councillors who took an interest in their duties had their' hands full. This question of wire netting is not only ai pastoralists' but also a small holders' question. It concerns not  only  the farmer, for in the north of South Australia men living near the small towns have to protect even their cabbage patches from the vermin.- It is not denied that in order to settle that country and -to check the vermin the principal remedy is to co'm&gt;- pel every man to wire-net his own land, and to kill the vermin upon it. Recently, when I visited Tasmania as the guest of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron,</inline> I saw the amount of employment which he gave in dealing with the rabbit pest. That reminded me of the time when I was connected with the district councils I have mentioned. Unless the large Crown  leases or private estates are fenced, the smaller man has no chance to grow a crop. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> to accompany me in his imagination to the district where the Yongala and Canowie estates join. They were, at the time of which I am speaking, held by private owners. I had the honour at that time to be a member of the Legislative Council of South Australia, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> was also, and various Acts were being passed to make it compulsory for land-holders to destroy the vermin on their own holdings. A neighbouring farmer, in the hundred of Belalie, wanted me to see his property, on which he ' had about 80 acres of crop ready for reaping. I am sure that on that farm I saw many thousands of rabbits. They came by the tens or hundreds of thousands, and in a night Or two that crop was a thing of the past. Honorable senators may not know it, but when rabbits have eaten out one part of the country, they migrate- to another. Therefore, to place upon wire netting a duty that did not previously exist will not improve matters, but will rather have the opposite effect. Whilst it is compulsory for land-holders' to destroy vermin, the Government should not expect to collect duty, upon the material which must be used. The large landed proprietor must protect himself equally with the smaller man, and if he does not do so the smaller man is exposed to still greater trouble. It would be a retrograde step to impose the duty suggested. The eloquent speeches to which I have listened have not altered my opinion in the least, because I have had my mind made up from the first as to the attitude I shall assume on this very important question. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> referred to what is being done in South Australia by the State Government, and I indorse all- that he said. Private enterprise, in the person of the importers, took advantage of. the consumers, when it had the opportunity, by putting up the price of wire netting by several pounds per mile more than was fair, but Socialism came to the rescue, and the Commissioner of Crown Lands,' who did not consider the question of free-trade or protection in the matter, said, " You squatters, and you farmers, who are in absolute want of wire netting, have been got at." I have no particular liking for the squatter or any other land  monopolist, but the State Government could not stand by and see them robbed as they were being to the extent of some pounds per mile. </para>

The Government could see that the people were being taken advantage of, and they said to the importers : " Unless you are prepared to sell wire netting at a reasonable price, we shall become importers and compete againstyou." They did so, and the district councils reaped the advantage in being able to give the people the wire netting they required at a reasonable figure. I may mention that one pastoralist in a very large way, and a highly distinguished man, who is known to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon,</inline> got <inline font-style="italic">£5,000</inline> worth of wire netting from the State Government, although at the time, or shortly afterwards, he was  President  of the National League, and did not believe in Socialism.

I am not complaining that he took advantage of the law of the country. Whether we condemn the laws or not, we. are entitled to make use of them. When I visited the farmer's place at Belalie to which I have referred, I saw rabbits in thousands, not only amongst his crops, but in his out-buildings, and in his hay-stack, and if a bag of chaff were left about they would get into it. I have said that it is not only the large landed proprietors who must use wire netting ; the smaller men must also use if, even if they ' only wish to protect a vegetable garden. A number of people call me a Socialist, and consider that I am a dangerous man, but although I was cried down at the election by the Farmers' Political Union, I told the people during the election contest that if I were returned as' a member of the Senate, the interests of the farmers and the primary producers would be my first and last concern. I told the electors, also, that I was a protectionist, and so I am. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator should not get his little bit of hair off. As he is in the habit of holding the fort for hours at a time, he might permit . me to say a few words. Having been a farmer, I understand the in- . terests and requirements of farmers. It is possible that my colleagues in the Labour Party know more about industrial questions than I do, and on those questions I am to some extent guided by them. I think that I have made my position clear in this matter. It is essentially a question of development. The Government on this occasion may be working with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> but what do I care for the Government? They make use of the members of the Labour Party when they can, and then apparently they come to some arrangement with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and the members of the Labour Party are dished. For the reasons I have given I am in favour of the free admission of this raw material of the settlers of Australia. We should give every encouragement to the small farmers, and we shall then be in a position to say to the large landed proprietors : " We want your land, because we wish to put people on it." I have a few words to say how to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley.</inline> I wish to ask him whether he does not consider that a duty of 5 per cent, on this article, if imported from the United Kingdom, is a revenue duty, and a duty of 10 per cent, on imports under the General Tariff also a revenue duty ? Is the honorable senator here to support revenue duties? I thought he was sent here as an out-and-out protectionist. If so, how can be support revenue duties? I also ask my leader and fellow countryman, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> to say whether these are not revenue duties, and whether he thinks duties of 10 per cent, and 5 per cent, on wire netting are going to make any material difference to those engaged in manufacturing it here? </para>

                            (New South Wales) [3.54]. - I wish to say but a few words in connexion with some remarks I have already made. I roughly estimated the probable value of agricultural production in the Commonwealth at between £12,000,000 and , £14,000,000. Since I resumed my seat, I have received information from the Commonwealth Statistician to the effect that the estimated value of Commonwealth agricultural production during the season 1906-7 was £25,349,000. This, coupled with the value of the export of wool during the year 1906, represents a total value of . £48,994,745. So that it will be seen that these two industries alone, to. which wire netting is so useful, represent nearly £50,000,000 per annum of -wealth production in the Commonwealth. I have ascertained from the same source that the number of persons in the Commonwealth engaged in agricultural pursuits at the date of census, 31st March, 1901, was 276,074. I am not aware of the number of persons engaged in pastoral pursuits, but I wish to say that it was in the interests of the thousands of persons who are engaged in these industries, and in the interests of nearly £50,000,000 of annual wealth production, that I urged honorable senators to make wire netting entirely free of duty. I have no wish to make a second speech, and I thank honorable senators for the opportunity afforded me to correct the figures I previously used.

                    <para>.- From the protectionist stand-point, the speech which has just been delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell was an extraordinary one. We have already heard of geographical protectionists, but in the honorable senator's case, the distinction is still further' narrowed down. He is a rigid metropolitan protectionist, and a rabid rural free-trader. The honorable senator invites the Committee to believe that he is the only person who understands the interests of the farmers, and that, if we were to place a duty on wire netting, the farmers, and the farmers only, would have to suffer a handicap. I venture to say that there is no section of the community in any part of the Commonwealth that has received more direct and indirect benefit from the system of protection than has the farming community. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell should remember that he was returned to the Senate as a Labour protectionist. No reasoning on his part can free him from the charge I level against him here and now - that he is unfaithful to his principles and to the pledges he made when seeking the suffrages of the electors of South Australia. </para>

Well, if the importers could not supply the demand they, like the local manufacturer, are in business not for health's sake but to make as much money as possible; and if the local man was getting, say, ,£45 a mile for wire netting, does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> ask me to believe that the importers would not demand the same price for that quantity of material when they knew that they would be able to get it? </para>

                        <para>- And he voted for free tanks because the farmers use tanks. It is sufficient for me to know - and it ought to be sufficient for any protectionist - that there is one industry in New South Wales that is manufacturing this material ; that the price '.which it is charging is a reasonable one; that there is an ever-increasing, demand for the article manufactured ; that with additional protection the probabilities are that other industries will be established in other States; that the establishment of other industries in other States for the making of this material would create * internal competition ; and that that local and! internal competition would mean bringing; down the price of the imported article, as in. other directions prices have been brought down considerably. In any case, the existence of even one factory has demonstrated that the importer has been kept from charging an exorbitant price for wire netting. Now, however, it is proposed, in order to give an additional field for exploitation to these importers, who have already had too long a run in Australia against Australian interests, that the small duty which stands in the Tariff shall be taken away ; and honorable senators returned on protectionist principles are going to vote in favour of the free admission of wire netting. </para>

If he asks himself that question whenever he is called upon to record a vote in favour of a protectionist principle - if his vote is always to be guided by the consideration of cheapness- he will find himself in queer street, from a protectionist point of view, very often. We know that in many lines of industry prices are momentarily increased as the effect of a duty. If the honorable senator wants cheapness, why not sweep the Customs House into the ocean at once, allow the floodgates of importation to be opened, and permit every commodity to be imported duty free? </para>

He offers them no assistance whatever, although he pledged himself indirectly that he would offer the benefit of a protective duty to assist in the development of Australian industries. Yet we have him here to-day joining hands with the rabid free-traders in order to injure an Australian industry, and by so doing to place additional burdens on those who require to purchase wire 'netting; because, having eliminated that competition, it is certain that the pastoralists and farmers will be at the mercy of the importers. </para>

                    <para>. - It is scarcely necessary for me to mention the fact that Queensland, of all States in Australia, is the one that is most strongly interested in this question. Wire netting is inseparably connected with the cure of the rabbit pest. I intend to quote a few facts and figures from the last report of the Lands Department of Queensland for the year 1907 - that is, the report which includes the operations of the Department for the year 1906. There are several paragraphs in this document which certainly ought to arouse the attention of every honorable senator. I may mention that from many parts of Queensland I have received communications asking me to do what I can to have wire netting admitted free . From not a single body in the whole of Queensland have I received a request for the imposition of a duty, although there are many protectionists in that State. I quote from page 14 of the report to which I have referred - </para>

                <para>A few rabbits were caught in the Darling Downs district, and traces were discovered in the north-eastern part of the Maranoa district, near the junction of the Darling Downs and Leichhardt fences, and in both cases energetic steps were taken by the respective boards to deal with the position presented. The Leichhardt district may still be said to be clean. In the Mitchell district there are rabbits on the runs adjoining the southern fence, and . in isolated colonies in other parts, and at the end of the year they were increasing again in the western section of the district south of the Gregory North fence, and also in the Warrego district, adjacent to the Mitchell district, particularly in the eastern part. Rabbits are scattered over various parts of the Gregory North district, chiefly in isolated colonies. Traces were seen in the extreme north of that district, adjacent to the Burke district fence. A few rabbits were caught in traps on that fence, but the Burke district is probably still clean. Traces were also seen in the Northern Territory, to the west of the Burke district, about twenty miles south of the then terminus of the fence which the Burke Board is erecting along the western boundary of this State. </para>
                <para class="block">The force of that paragraph will be apparent to those who are acquainted more or less intimately with the geography of Queensland. It goes to show that the rabbits are beginning to spread, and to become a menace to a large portion of the State. I have made the quotation for the purpose of satisfying honorable senators that, from our point of view, the pastoralists and graziers being the basis of all our primary industries, have a vital interest in the extinction of the pest. Our straight-out proposition is that, in order to enable them to combat the rabbit, the first requirement is that wire netting should be made as cheap as possible.

The Gregory North Board completed the Winton check fence by erecting forty-nine miles, and the Moreton Board erected 13¼ miles on the south boundary of the State . </para>

                        <para>- I dare say that we shall hear the honorable senator on that point. I prefer to see the pastoralist, the grazier, and the farmer assisted, and I have said so all along, because they represent the primary industries. In Queensland, the total length of the netting for fences amounts to 16,514¼ miles, and I dare say that it will have to be doubled, probably trebled, before the work will be done effectively. In 1906, the Government incurred a total expenditure of £38,099 on these operations, and very probably the expenditure in that direction will increase year by year. As regards the quantity of wire netting which passes through the hands of the Government into the hands of the farmers and graziers, the following paragraph is very significant - </para>

I believe that wire netting of a peculiar character is needed in order to help squatters and graziers to combat that peculiar phase of their difficulties. It has been pointed out here, and I- do not think it can be denied, that it- is upon the development of the primary industries that the progress of Australia depends. That is especially the case with Queensland, because in proportion to territory it has probably the largest and richest area of pastoral, grazing and agricultural land that is to be found in any State, not excepting Western Australia. It is the duty of this Parliament, I submit, to assist Queensland in every possible way to develop those industries. Some of us from "Queensland have not taken a bigoted attitude in regard to the question of protection or free-trade. On the whole, where a reasonable demand for assistance to local industries by a duty has been made we have not turned altogether deaf or unsympathetic ears. But we have frequently said that the demand on the part of the protectionist was far too high. From time to time I have told the electors of . Queensland that I would endeavour to see that no undue fiscal burden was placed upon the backs of the primary producers. I have also said more than once that where the manufacturers could make out a strong case reasonable assistance would be granted so as to help them along. That, I submit, is a fair attitude to take up. I remind the protectionists in the Senate, and the workers in the community, that protection to the manufacturing industries will fail them if the great primary industries be unduly hampered. In order to show the development which is going on in Queensland in connexion with agricultural, pastoral and grazing pursuits, I propose to quote a table from the same report - </para>

Just as in South Australia it is an absolute necessity to the wheat-grower and the large grazier, so in Queensland it is almost the first thing with which some farmers must begin operations. </para>

                        <para>- Although the wire netting may not go through their par,ticular areas, still they are bound to pay for the border fence or for some other kind of fence in another district, because the protection given by the .fence is given to all. A man may not get the wire netting immediately through or round his grazing selection, but he still contributes directly to its cost, because lie receives the benefit of it. I do not know whether every grazier in Queensland is under the Assessment Act, but I believe that a large number of them are, whether the fence touches their property or not. I shall quote one other table to show, the important development of pastoral occupation in Queensland for the last three or four years. In .a table giving the accepted applications for selections in each year under tenures convertible to freehold and leasehold tenures respectively, it is stated that, in the year 1900, 3,063,113 acres were taken up. In 1901, when the drought was coming on, 2,051,156 acres were taken up. In 1902, which was aright in the drought, only 1,035,362 acres were taken up ; while in 1903, 1,061,528 acres, and in 1904 1,658,128 acres, were taken up ; then, as the effect of the drought passed away, the area selected in 1905 was 2,273,094 acres, and in 1906, 3,190,257 nacres. That is a very striking tale of development, which not only reflects credit on the State of Queensland itself, but has materially helped the general prosperity of Australia. The question of wire netting is no unimportant element in that development.  No protectionist, or even, prohibitionist, dares dispute the proposition that the tools of a man's trade must be as free as possible. What is wire netting but a tool of. trade of the pastoralist and the farmer? It is more ; it is an absolute essential. Year by year the danger becomes more menacing, exercising very seriously the minds of the Government as well as of farmers and graziers. It is, therefore/ time for  this  Chamber to pause before granting a demand such as is now made, especially when another  place, after careful consideration, fixed upon the item the low duties of 10 and 3 per cent. There are honorable senators here who would make the duties as high, as possible, but where primary industries are concerned, I like them to be as low as possible. No eloquence or argument could be  more convincing as to the importance of the question to the pastoralists and agriculturists of Queensland than the figures which I have quoted. The almost universal de- ( mand of the people of that State, so far as I can gather, is that wire netting shall be as free from duty as we can make it. I echo that demand strongly, because I agree with the statement made so often from this side that to the workers of Australia there is nothing of more importance than that our primary industries shall be allowed to. develop without undue burdens being placed upon them. When they do develop, and we have prosperous seasons, with an increase of settlement, the area of employment for the workers is continuously widened. It is a' short-sighted and even suicidal fiscal policy to teach the workers that the primary industries and their development are not their great source of strength. It is because I feel that the grazing and farming industries of Australia are of such importance, not only to the States,' but to the workers in the larger cities, that I appeal so strongly to the Committee not to hamper their development. </para>

                    <para>- - I should not like to give a silent vote upon this important question. I am not here to advocate free-trade, because it is now taken for granted that the Commonwealth is committed to a policy of protection. That issue is therefore out of the way at present. At the same time, I am not here to advocate what is called the new protection. I do not think that that would be for the best interests of the Commonwealth. During the whole of the long campaign which I have just gone through, I stated that it was my intention to maintain as far as possible the old Tariff, because, so far as I could ascertain, it had been fairly successful, giving a reasonable amount of protection to our industries, and providing sufficient revenue to carry on the government of the Commonwealth. I intend to hold to that position here. I shall endeavour to keep as near to the old Tariff as possible, unless it can be shown that any industry is being unfairly handicapped, or that injustice is being done. In that event, I shall be prepared to give justice to all industries. In the old Commonwealth Tariff, wire netting was free, and, therefore, I am bound to vote for the request to make it free in this schedule. If it could have been shown that any hardship was being done to the manufacturers of wire netting, I should have been prepared to give the matter further, consideration, but I find from the' reports of the Tariff Commission that no manufacturer of wire netting came before them and made any complaint whatever. One worker in wire netting appeared, but his evidence was exceedingly indefinite, and not much notice can be taken of it. The fact that the manufacturers themselves have been silent is a strong reason why we should allow wire netting to come in free. This item affects the main producers of the Commonwealth - the primary producers - who should receive the greatest consideration at our hands. While I am prepared to help manufacturers in every fair way,  I cannot forget that the primary producers' are the backbone of the Commonwealth. When it is remembered that the value of the wool (produced in Australia in one season is no less than £[28,060,000, and of wheat, something like £[10,000,000, it will be admitted that those industries are of vast importance. This item is of great moment to the primary producers engaged in them. The farmer and squatter are both heavily handicapped.. The farmer has to bear all the expense of clearing his land before he can make use of it, and then he has to combat the rabbit pest. Any one who has travelled through the country, as I have done  lately, can realize the immense  difficulty  of that task. The farmer has to fence and subdivide his land, and adopt all sorts of expedients to protect himself against the ravages of the rabbits: lt is therefore our duty to give him all the consideration possible. Although the rates of duty proposed by the Government in the first instance were very much higher, they were reduced in another place until they became, not protective, but simply revenue duties. Duties so small are not likely to be of any ' particular value to an Australian manufacturer. If the manufacturers themselves had been suffering any very great hardship, and were anxious for high duties to enable them to carry on the industry, they would have made their desires known to the Tariff Commission. But, as they have made no complaint, and as this matter is of such great moment to the primary producers throughout the Commonwealth, I must vote to make the item free. I am bound to do so, because I promised the electors of South Australia that I would stand by the old Tariff as nearly as possible. Seeing that those views were indorsed by over 47,000 of the electors, I can fairly claim to represent the opinion of the people of South Australia in the attitude which I am now taking. I shall be prepared tq adopt that attitude also with regard to other items- I shall not support high, and even prohibitive, duties, but shall endeavour to give a reasonable amount of protection to those who need it, whilst offering every encouragement to our primary producers. </para>

                    <para>.- The Vice-President of the Executive Council stated that he intends to support an increase of this duty. He is therefore running away from the proposals which he has submitted. He is also very much afraid that unless a heavy duty is imposed on this article a great deal of dumping will take place. Wire netting is an article which I should like to see dumped on these shores in enormous quantities as cheaply as ever it can be produced, because the question of its supply has to be considered as beyond the bounds of mere fiscalism. It stands in this Tariff almost entirely by itself. Tn dealing with this matter I am prepared to consider only the. users of the commodity. If I were convinced that the imposition of a duty, no matter how high, would have the effect of providing an enormous supply of wire netting as cheaply or more cheaply than, it is possible to get it now, I should not hesitate to support the duty. The Minister says, however, " Put on the duty and there is a possibility that the article will be manufactured in sufficient quantities in the- Commonwealth to supply the local demand." I am not going to trust the farmers of Aus-' tralia to a mere possibility of that kind. I join with honorable senators who have said that they are prepared to vote against the  imposition of a duty and at the same time to support a substantial bonus to' encourage manufacturers of wire netting in Australia, and then when it has been sufficiently established to impose a duty. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has been very unjustly severe upon his Labour colleague from South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell, because that honorable senator has decided to keep his pledges to the farmers of that State. ' I visited the State in October last, and if there was one question on which I found that the farmers were keen it was that of the duty to be imposed on wire netting. I was spoken to on the subject a number of times, and I am satisfied that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell, by voting as he proposes to do on this item, is acting in the interests of and in accordance with the wishes of the farmers of South Australia. It should be remembered also that in another place seven or eight of the honorable senator's colleagues, in the Labour Party voted for the free admission of wire netting, and some of them are as good protectionists as any member of this Committee. The farmers have had the rabbit pest thrust upon them, and it has been the greatest drawback to farming in Australia. If the pest had never been introduced, farming in this country would have been very different from what it .has been in the past, and the outlook for the industry  in the future would also be very different. One of the chief difficulties is that it is in the drier regions and in those places where farming is carried on under hard conditions that the rabbit seems to find his most suitable habitat. In such districts there is  very  little food for rabbits in the natural herbage, and so they invade the farmer's crops. The remedies suggested for the eradication of the pest have been legion, but it has been found that the -only effective means to cope with them is to fence them  in in order to kill them, and to fence them out to protect the crops. I have represented a rabbit-infested district for twenty-two years. I have been amongst the people settled in that district, and I know what this trouble means. They have to face, not only the first cost of rabbit-proof fencing, but the cost of continually keeping the fences in repair. We req'uire that wire netting shall .be plentiful and cheap. Its manufacture gives employment to comparatively few persons. The machine used in manufacturing wire netting is a simple one, and though a leading mechanic may be required to set it going, an ordinary hand can look after it then until the wire netting is .turned out as a finished article. There is more work provided in the erection of wire netting than in the manufacture of it. For <inline font-style="italic">£24</inline> per mile men will undertake to put up the netting and find the posts, and I suppose they could erect a. mile of wire-netting fence whilst a mile of netting was being manufactured. For the sake of finding work for a few men in a wire-netting factory honorable senators are prepared to take a course which will result in depriving quite a number of men in the country of work. To show the importance of this matter, I may remind honorable senators that the duties at first submitted in another place were 30 and 25 per cent., and the outcry against them was so great that in spite of the express1 determination of the Government to consider the items of the Tariff seriatim they were compelled by the force of outside opinion to consider wire netting out of its. place and to deal with it separately. If we propose to increase these duties as the Minister desires, there will be another outcry .on the subject. A number of protectionists were candidates at the last general election, and when I was- asked what sort of a protectionist I was, I said, " I am a protectionist on the lines of the old Victorian Tariff. " I have considered five or six Tariffs, .and in connexion with every one of them the question of imposing duties on wire netting was the subject of a long discussion. We were told that if we imposed heavy duties on wire netting a local industry for its manufacture would be started. I have been returned to Parliament half-a-dozer times as a protectionist, although I have always voted that wire netting should be admitted free of duty. I should not object in this instance to a small duty being imposed under the general Tariff provided that imports cf wire netting from the </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>United Kingdom were admitted free. But in view of the decision of the Government in this matter to increase these duties,  i  have no option but to vote that the item should be made free all round. <inline font-style="italic">It</inline> is strange that in dealing with these duties honorable senators have no regard for the persons who have to use the article proposed to be taxed. Surely their interests should be considered to some extent.   i  undertake to say that any man going through this country will not find one farmer in one hundred willing that a duty should be imposed on wire netting. They are all afraid that the effect would be to shorten the supply and put up the price, and they prefer rather to -trust themselves to the tender mercies even of the importer than. to have a duty imposed on this article. For the reasons I have given, I shall support a request to make the item free. </para>

If a duty on steel rails is a good thing in the interests of the. country,- in the interests of defence - for that was the plea put forward last night - a duty on wire netting must also be a good thing for the country. In this matter we are dealing, not with a probable enemy, but with an enemy at present in our midst. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> with great force, pointed out last evening the awful possibility of our  supplies of steel rails, small arms and ammunition, being cut off by a hostile navy.  I  agree that that would be an awful condition of affairs, but would it not be equally serious if our supplies of wire netting, the great necessity alike of the squatters, farmers, and other settlers, were cut off by the action of a hostile fleet? </para>

                        <para>- That is the reason I wish to increase the internal supply of wire netting.. Some honorable senators opposite profess to be extremely anxious about the interests of the selector. Senators Gray, Sayers, Millen, Dobson, and those who profess that a protectionist duty is an impost, which the people have to pay, are perfectly consistent in their action in this matter, and I .find no fault- with them. But honorable senators who say that they believe protection is a good thing, but that protection on wire netting would be a bad thing, are difficult to understand. If a tax on wire netting is an impost which the settler must pay, then a tax upon any other article of manufacture is equally an impost- which those who use it must pay. The honorable senators to whom I have last referred are just as illogical as the free-traders on the other side were for five minutes last night, when they voted for protection whilst they preached free-trade. I refer to protectionists like Senators Mulcahy and McColl, and like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser,</inline> who was so anxious that it should be clearly understood that he wished to be considered a protectionist that he sent a letter to the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> declaring it, which was published on the morning before the Senate elections, because there appeared to be some doubt about it. I refer, also, to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell, who votes mostly for protection. The honorable senator must be wrong in voting for protective duties, and so saddling consumers with an impost, or else his assertion that these duties will be a tax upon the squatters, farmers, and other settlers must be incorrect. </para>

Honorable senators opposite appear to have, nobbled the honorable senator. However, 1 am dealing now with the honorable senator's argument. I do not say that it is not within the bounds of possibility that a protectionist duty, as our honorable friends opposite say, must be in every instance an impost on the consumers, but if it is it is a tax upon one section of the community in the interests of another. I do not believe that it is so, but if I believed that it was in one instance I should have to believe that it was so in every instance. I cannot see how such an argument can have force as applied to one industry and not have equal force when applied to another. I cannot believe that steel rails possess some special quality in respect of which they can be protected at the Customs without that protection being a tax upon the people, if a duty upon wire netting, which is made from the same material, is not an impost or tax upon the people. </para>

                        <para>- He was a member of the Labour Government at all events. I suppose that no State in the Commonwealth requires more wire netting than Queensland does. The imposition of this duty will mean" that' the people and the Government of that country will be taxed to the extent of tens of thousands of pounds. Every year wire netting fences have to be renewed and looked after. When I hear that the duty will give employment to a few people, I remind those who use the argument . that the machinery used for making wire netting is mostly worked by boys. But the erection of wire-netting fences really does give a great amount of employment. </para>

                        <para>- I- do not say that it would ; but I urge that we should not impose this heavy tax upon our farmers, and settlers. Whenever a proportion of ' Queensland is subdivided for purposes of settlement wire netting fences have to be erected to keep the rabbits out. There are some portions of the State in which they have not yet done much damage. We do not want them to overrun the whole country. The more difficult we make it for the people to obtain wire netting, the more chance the rabbits will have to increase and multiply. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator would help them in theory, but in practice he damns them. I honestly believe that the effect of the Labour Party's policy is to tell the farmer to go <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the devil. I can make nothing more out of it. It has been said that the effect of the duty will be to make wire netting cheaper. That argument might be used where the amount of protection is so high as to create strong local competition. But how can it be denied that where there is little or no. competition within the Commonwealth the price will be enhanced as. the result of the duty ? </para>

                    <para>.- I want the Committee to agree to a request to delete the words, " for advertising purposes," with a view to inserting the words " and printers' matrices." If the Committee agree to the first request, it will be necessary to move a consequential request in connexion with item 357b, in which the words " printers' matrices " appear under the heading of Paper and Stationery. If printers matrices were allowed to come in under that head, at a duty of 30 per cent.' from foreign countries and at a duty of 25 per cent. from the United Kingdom, it would be little or no protection. First of all, the matter is set up with ordinary type, or composed with a linotype or monoline or monotype machine. It is next sent to a stereotyper, who takes an impression, which is called a printer's matrix, and from the moulds castings or stereos are made. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. I am given to understand that in many of the States there has been a desire on the part of some employing printers, and those engaged in the publication of magazines and other works, to have certain matter set up abroad and a mould taken therefrom, and to import the printers' matrices. Suppose that they were to come in under the head of " Paper and Stationery." The value of the piece of paper in my hand is not, I expect, more than½d. or1d., and if there was a duty of 100 per cent., it would come to only 2d. </para>

                        <para>- On the mould itself, but not on the value of it. At one time the <inline font-style="italic">Review of Reviews</inline> largely imported printers' matrices in connexion with the publication of that magazine. I believe that when the Kingston Tariff was introduced provision was made for printers' matrices to be dutiable to the same extent as stereotypes and electrotypes, with the result that there was a stoppage of the importation of printers' matrices. By that means employment was found for local printers, and all the readable matter now contained in the <inline font-style="italic">Review of Reviews</inline> is set up and printed in Melbourne. This duty, of course, will have a general application. It is to me a manifestly unfair thing to deny protection to any section of the community that desires it. This request comes from the Typographical Associations of Australia. They feel that their employment is being affected, and has been affected for some time, by the importation of printers' matrices. It is unfair, too, to the employing printers who have to observe Australian conditions in respect to wages, overtime rates, hours, and other things.I feel sure that the request I make will appeal to every protectionist. </para>

                        <para>- That would be almost a contradiction in terms, because it is not a stereotype until a casting is taken. It is required for making stereotypes. I have some knowledge of the trade, and I thought that "printers' matrices" would cover the ground that I desire to cover. I know the term "printers' matrices" is used in connexion with the linotypes. However, I recognise that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> is an employing printer, and therefore I shall use the words " stereotype matrices. " </para>

" electrotypes and stereotypes for advertising purposes." Of course, printers import free a great many electrotypes for the purpose of doing job printing and illustrating all sorts of work. For instance, friendly societies require to be supplied with coats-of-arms.  If the words " for advertising purposes " were deleted, it would make dutiable  the whole- of the electrotypes which are used for general purposes, although' very many of -them are not worth more than is. each.

I understand that others do come in, but the main importations are used in connexion with advertising purposes. Then, my honorable friend desires to bring matrices for stereotyping purposes under the item. This division deals with metals and machinery, and the matrices are' included in an item which deals with " Manufactures of paper n.e.i." What the honorable senator seeks to deal with is simply a paper production, and not the stereotype which is made therefrom.' . As regards classification, we are trying to keep the Tariff as regular as possible, and I suggest that the proper item with which to deal with these matrices is 35 7B- The value of a printer's matrix is purely a matter of opinion. Of course, a considerable amount of work is involved, in the setting of the type and preparing the design. That may cost shillings or pounds, but it is out of the question to say exactly what the value of a matrix is. I am disposed to agree with my honorable friend, that'' if it is to be taxed at all, it should be subjected to a fixed duty, as the value is such an unknown quantity. I see no objection to the amendment itself, but I object to tha place in which the honorable senator desires to have it inserted. </para>

                    <para>. - The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended 25 per cent. on "Machines and Machinery, n.e.i." This item really forms part and parcel of that, and was actually postponed in another place, until " Machines and Machinery, n.e.i." were dealt with. It was intended that this item should bear exactly the same duty. I find that the rates on " Machines and Machinery, n.e.i." are 25 per cent. (General Tariff), and 20 per cent. (United Kingdom). The duties should correspond, and therefore I move - </para>

                    <para>. - I ask the honorable senator not to press the request. There were only certain items in the Tariff in regard to which we proposed to give preference. Those items, I still say with great confidence, will mean a concession of three-quarters of a million sterling in duty to the British manufacturer. In this case we consider that the minimum duty should be 15 per cent. It is a small protectionist duty. If we intended to give preference on this item, we should have proposed 20 per cent. (General Tariff), and 15 per cent. (United Kingdom), because the principle which' we have followed is to consider what would be fair and reasonable protection to our own industries. </para>

                <para class="block">I know that this linotype metal is being made-.in one of the suburbs of Sydney, and it is largely used by printers in Queensland,, As it was previously manufactured in the Commonwealth without any duty, I see no reason why country newspaper proprietors who require to use it should now be suddenly faced with the necessity of having to pay duty on it to the extent of 20 per cent. We have received no recommendation in connexion with this item from either section of the Tariff Commission, and the Government are under an obligation to submit some reasonable evidence in support of a proposal to impose a duty of 20 per cent, on an article that was never previously subject to taxation. </para>

According to the Vice-President of the Executive Council, a representative of the establishment at Balmain requisitioned another place for the imposition of a duty. Honorable senators must admit that a duty of  10  per cent. on this item would not be a protectionist, but a revenue duty, and I therefore ask them not to agree to the request. </para>

                    <para>. - I express no surprise at the reasons which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> regards as sufficient to justify the levy of an additional impost, but I think the Committee is entitled to some further reason than that advanced by the honorable senator. He has asked for these duties because he is satisfied that the local manufacturers want them. We have passed through various stages in dealing with this Tariff. At one time attempts were made by submitting evidence to show that there was some justification for the imposition of a duty. Later on, honorable senators opposite have suggested that a duty ought to be imposed because some one has asked for it, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> now desires that the Committee should impose a duty in this case, not because any one has asked for it, but because he is satisfied that some one wants it. </para>

At the close of a long sitting, a colleague of the Vice-President of the Executive Council in another place told a tired Committee, that had been overridden by a brutal majority, that he intended to propose an entirely new item, because he heard that a certain industry had been established at Balmain.

                    <para>.- I desire to ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council how it is that locks and keys are to be admitted at  5  per cent. under the general Tariff and free from the United Kingdom?' Locks can be, and are being, made in the Commonwealth. I have seen some locks which were made in. Tasmania. As a matter of fact, they have been made there for a considerable time. The industry was established under a 20 per cent. duty. It does seem strange to me that the manufacturer should be disadvantaged by- this item. I know that there are locksmiths in other States as well as in Tasmania. </para>

                        <para>- No. I do not know whether an invitation was extended by that body to this gentleman, who now asks for the imposition of a duty, or why he did not appear before them. I have seen a communication from him and also exhibits of his locks and keys, which demonstrate conclusively that the industry is established. That he has given satisfaction is shown by the fact that he has supplied the Tasmanian Government with innumerable locks. He has also satisfied large orders from the Mount Lyell Company, and no doubt in Tasmania he has executed other orders. </para>

                <para>I understand that if the Committee agree, to the request locks  will fall  under item  170A,  " Manufactures of metal n.e.i.," and be liable to duties of 25 and  20  per cent., according to the country of origin. I see no reason why locksmiths should not receive protection. The Minister, has stated that many imported locks are . patented. That is perfectly true, but I hope that he will not urge that as a reason why protection should not be given to those who are engaged in the making of various kinds, of locks in different parts of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- Locks are made in Victoria ; they are extensively made in Tasmania, and I venture to say that they are made in every State. I may mention incidentally that a manufacturer in Tasmania has requisitioned some honorable senators to do what they can on behalf of the industry. It is no protectionist argument to say that because certain rights are held by outside manufacturers of locks the local maker should not be protected. The patent right argument was trotted out by the free-traders many times in connexion-, with the machinery items, that have been made dutiable. In support of their requests for the free admission of such articles, the free-traders urged that, inasmuch as they were patented throughout: the world they could not be made in Australia. We know that , ho one can, without: running the risk, of a penalty or punishment, infringe the patent rights of any manufacturer; but, no doubt, local manufacturers have .taken out patent rights for the particular kinds of locks that they make. The fact that one manufacturer in Tasmania has given entire satisfaction to» its Government, and ample satisfaction lo private railway managers, should carry weight with honorable senators. </para>

                        <para>- I' do not know. But the Tasmanian Government has given* <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jackson</inline> large orders for various kinds of locks, and the Mount Lyell Company have given him repeat orders. I feel certain that orders would not be repeated if" he had not given full satisfaction, and his prices were not as reasonable as those charged for imported locks. It is true that it may be considered a small industry to-day, and that it may never grow to very large dimensions. But if protectionist senators will multiply the hundred and one small industries which exist throughout Australia, and which will continue to exist if a measure of protection is given, they would find that, in the aggregate, there is a large army of persons employed. I believe 'that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> is in a position to amplify some of the statements I have.' made in respect to the lock-making industry which is carried on by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jackson*</inline> at Launceston. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that honorable senators will support the request. Surely if we can manufacture a locomotive in Australia, we can also make a lock ! I remind protec.tionist senators that, in order -to promote local industries, they have imposed duties-' on many articles which are much more intricate in their construction than are locks. It has been stated by the Minister that many of the more valuable locks are patented in other countries. It is the same-' with everything else. We are continually hearing something about inventions that have been discovered by persons in other countries, and patented all over the world, including Australia. I hope that that fact will not restrain the Minister in any direction. I trust that the members and supporters of the Government here will not allow themselves to be bound by any arrangement that has been made in another place with respect to locks and keys, or anything else of that description. </para>

                    (New South Wales) [7.45]. - We have heard nothing to warrant any confidence in the idea that these articles are being made in the Commonwealth. We have heard some vague assertions, but no solid facts have been offered for our consideration. The proposed enormous increase of duty on locks would strike a blow at a great many of our industries. One industry which is coming rapidly to the front in Australia is the manufacture of the common hag, suit case, gladstone bag, and trunk, articles all of which have to be fitted with locks of a more or less intricate kind. Commonplace locks, that anybody can pick, will not do for the traveller - and the Australians are a great travelling people. They travel more, perhaps, than the majority of the peoples of the world do. If we put duties of 30 and 25 per cent. on locks, we shall interfere with a rapidly growing industry of considerable importance. I believe that practically the whole of the articles of a carrying capacity used in Australia are now made here. There are comparatively few imported, as they are bulky, and for freight reasons alone it pays to make them locally. If every lock used upon a trunk or bag is to be charged 30 per cent. duty because there happens to be a little factory in some only recently discovered corner of Tasmania, the industry will be seriously affected. That little factory has been discovered by somebody, it may be by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy.</inline>
                    Necessarily it cannot be a large one, or we should have heard of it before. Why is everybody in business making those articles, of which I have enumerated only a few, to be penalized ? Why is every user of a receptacle, fixed or portable, that is fastened with a lock, to have his or her requirement's penalized with a duty because somebody somewhere is said to be doing something? The position is about as indefinite as that. Let me mention, also, the cabinetmaker, the furniture maker, and the fancy goods maker, because there are an abundance of fancy articles fastened with small locks. How many locks are used on the tables in this chamber? How many in the drawers all round the chamber? The matter of locks is a serious one.

                        <para>- The honorable senator's idea of locks must be extraordinary if he thinks that he can buy them for 3d. There are numbers of patent locks that cannot be made here. There is no possible hope of their being made here, for the very good reason that the expense of making them would be out of all proportion to the number for which there was a sale. That is really one of the difficulties in which we find ourselves. This Tariff was introduced under the supposition that it was to remove anomalies, but I beg to suggest that it is a Tariff which is creating ten anomalies for every one that existed under the previous Tariff, and this proposal would make confusion worse confounded. If by any ill-fortune the request were agreed to, the mover need not feel assured' that locks would come under the item which fixes the very high duty that he suggests, because I am sure that there will be found in this chamber some honorable senator who will move for a new paragraph making locks dutiable at a much more moderate rate than 30 per cent. </para>

                    <para>- - I have great pleasure in supporting the request in its present form, particularly because when the Prime Minister was in Tasmania opening an exhibition of productions and manufactures of the Commonwealth he was greatly struck with the skill and ability shown by a certain firm there in the manufacture of locks of the very best type, and involving skilful workmanship. The Prime Minister's experience has only just come under my notice. In discussing the matter with me he thought it most desirable that we should give every encouragement to this Tasmanian industry. There is also an. industry in Victoria, and I trust that likewise industries in other parts of the Commonwealth will be given encouragement by the means now proposed. The request follows the lines of other items in the Tariffand I commend it to honorable senators as desirable in the interests of an industry which should be firmly and strongly established here. I admit the force of the argument from the other side that locks enter largely into so many industries throughout the Commonwealth that we should hardly be justified in imposing a big duty straight away, but if we give the nucleus of, an industry which is now established the reasonable encouragement suggested, we shall have no reason to despair of its increasing in volume and rapidly meeting the demands of the local market. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley's.</inline> proposition is widely different from the one which he first intended to move. The effect of his original proposal, if another place had agreed to it, would have been to impose immediately high duties of  30  and  25  per cent. upon locks of all kinds imported into Australia. The honorable senator has considerably modified that proposition in  a  way  that  very largely, although not entirely, meets my views. I wish to suggest a further  alteration to make it quite acceptable. Lock-making has been referred to as  a  Tasmanian industry. With every due feeling of patriotism to my little State,  I  do not think that the work can reasonably, be regarded yet as an important Tasmanian industry. We have in the samples- lying before me evidence of a very high class of handiwork, but practically only in one particular direction. The maker was em- - ployed for several years by Chubb's, one of the best lock-making firms in the world. He was engaged to proceed to Japan to instruct the Japanese in the manufacture of locks, and he fulfilled that engagement satisfactorily. I am' somewhat at a loss to know how a man of such attainments decided to settle in Tasmania, but he did so, and has begun the manufacture of what Tasmania is renowned for the production of, and that is a really good article.  I  do not think, however, that it would be fair to impose a high rate of duty in the interests of what is, and is likely for some time to be, quite a. small industry. We should be prepared to assist an industry when it has justified a demand for protection ; but in the meantime we must recognise that hundreds of thousands of locks of all kinds are required every year in the Commonwealth.  I am satisfied that the locks which have been produced were made in Tasmania, but I am sorry to say that I have not information, with respect to the cost of their, production and the price charged for them, which the Committee is entitled to be furnished with, when a request is made for the protection of the. industry. </para>

I am not concerned about the rate of duty proposed', if Parliament is given the opportunity, ' by the easy method proposed, of deciding when the industry has sufficiently progressed to justify the imposition of a duty for protective purposes. As a representative of Tasmania, and a protectionist, I should certainly be justified in asking the Committee to give as much consideration to a Tasmanian manufacturer as has been given to manufacturers in other States, but I have not the slightest desire that Tasmanian industries should be given special treatment. I should like to know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> is prepared to accept my suggestion. </para>

                    <para>. - Whatever my personal views about the Tariff are, I think that if it can be shown that we have established an industry with some promise in it it is entitled to as much as, and no more, consideration than we have extended to every other industry. The trouble is that I am well within a proper limit when I say that there must be several hundred different kinds of locks used in Australia. The information before the Committee is that there is one man, who, from the samples of his work produced, is obviously a skilled! mechanic, who is making one or two kinds: of locks. We have no information, however, as to whether he has sufficient machinery and the financial strength necessary to enable him to put a quantity of these locks upon the market. </para>

As I read the request, it means that every lock required in Australia would have to be made here in reasonable quantities before protection could be given to the manufacture of any class of locks. </para>

                        <para>- I have overlooked that. I accepted the request in the form in which it was handed to me by the  Chairman.  I am content if the issue of the proclamation is to be left to the action of Parliament, because if Parliament at the time it was asked to deal with the matter felt that there ought to be a discrimination, it would be easy to pass a short Bill if it were found otherwise impossible to deal effectively with the matter. I regard the request in its present form as merely postponing the operation of the duty suggested until, in the opinion of Parliament, it is desirable that it should be imposed. </para>

                        <para>- On the evidence that was submitted to them, the Tariff Commission did not recommend any duty on locks, on the ground that there was only one manufacturer of locks in the Commonwealth, who has been making locks since 1890. There is no doubt that locks of a more or less ornamental character are being made in Tasmania, but they are made in limited quantities, and are useful for very few purposes. </para>

                    <para>. - I ant going to ask the Committee to assist me to increase the duty proposed under this item from 5 per cent, to 17^ per cent. ; and to make the duty against goods from the United Kingdom 121 per cent. To do so will only be consistent .with what we have already done in regard to item 200, Droppers patent steel of all lengths. The original duty on that item was 5 per cent., but the House of Representatives increased  it to 17 <inline font-style="italic">\</inline> per cent, on the general Tariff, and 12^ per cent, against the United Kingdom. Honorable senators, are no doubt familiar with the steel wire fencing which is used throughout the Commonwealth. It is essentially an Australian invention. No doubt there is a variety of droppers, standards and pillars, but, speaking generally, they are of Australian invention and are manufactured in the Commonwealth. As it is quite clear that this industry has already been partly dealt with under item soo, there is no reason why we should differentiate by charging only  5  per cent, duty on standards and pillars, which are for the very same purposes as droppers. I can only explain that it was bv an over- ' sight that an amendment was' not made in item 217 in another place. </para>

I propose that we shall deal with this matter as we have dealt with other items. We have in some cases described a certain machine and then dealt with the fittings connected with that machine. Take also the iron industry. Item 181 deals with iron pipes, cas* and wrought, n.e.i., and cast-iron fittings for' pipes are dealt with under item 182. We want to deal with the question comprehensively and as a whole. Strictly speaking, the matters dealt with in items 200 and 217 should have been in one item. But they became separated, and by an oversight the duty of 17i per cent, was not inserted in item 217.

                    <para>. - The Minister has stated, I "think quite accurately, that this item is kindred with one previously passed.  The fences referred to are constructed of metal uprights, and are used in country when*, timber is scarce. As is . the case with .lost fences, posts are erected at certain distances, and in between them are placed droppers, which are attached to the wires, and not fixed in the ground. In item zoo we dealt with the droppers. This item covers the posts, standards, or pillars which are first set into the ground, and to which the wires are attached, the droppers' being subsequently attached to the wires. The articles included in this item are on all fours with the droppers. The Minister stated the only argument for an increase of the duty when he said that the treatment meted out to the one item ought to be meted out to the other. I regret that I was not present this afternoon when item 200 was reached. After sitting here for a long while, I happened to go out for a few minutes, and upon my return, I found that the Committee had absolutely bolted. I was staggered at the evidence I found of indecent haste. Whilst I admit that these items ought to be on all fours, I by no means assent to the proposition that the duty ought to be 17j per cent. I am therefore obliged to oppose the request. If it be defeated it will be incumbent upon the Minister, on his own showing, to get item 200 recommitted in order to bring the two items into line. He was a little inaccurate when he said that this is an Australian invention. Types and patterns have, I believe, been made here, but I am correct in stating that the iron upright for fencing was first used in South Africa where timber is not obtainable. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt the honorable senator did see them used forty years ago in a short line of fencing ; but I am speaking of their use in grazing country where the land is held in large areas. The Minister has stated that this is an established industry. That is true. Thousands upon thousands of these ar-  tides are being turned out every year in Australia without the aid of a duty. There is no evidence that the industry is struggling or depressed. As timber is being cut out in many places, and railway freights are being reduced, there is an increasing tendency to use iron droppers and standards, but the industry, has developed without any artificial aid, and there is no evidence that it needs to be helped now. On the contrary, as it has acquired a position of some stability, we are asked to do what is quite unnecessary, and what, so far as I know, no one has asked for. These iron standards, pillars, and droppers are only used in country which is void of timber. Any land-holder or occupier who has timber handy finds it infinitely  cheaper to use the timber than to use iron substitutes. If we impose the  duty  and the effect of its imposition is to increase the price, we shall still further penalize the man who is already under a great natural disability. To my mind that will <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> a little unjust, seeing that the  industry  is already doing well. I ask the Committee to pause before it makes these unfortunate persons pay for their misfortune in not having a supply of timber. In view of the fact that a big struggle is being made by a large number of our settlers, especially small men, to go out and conquer the more remote portions of  Australia, we ought not to do anything which will place a handicap upon them, more particularly when it is not shown that there is any necessity for us to confer a special favour upon those who are making these articles. </para>

But in this case the item starts with standards and pillars, without defining what they are for or saying anything about them, and then follows steel fencing. I think that the item will have to be recommitted in order to make the fencing' govern the pillars. </para>

                    <para>. It is rather unfortunate that item 200 was allowed to pass while we were in a more or less complacent mood. I "noticed at the time that it dealt with droppers, and that item 217 dealt with standards; but, as I have more than once said, I am not sufficiently familiar with many of those things to be able at the moment* to offer any advice or suggestion. I. am rather sorry, however, that I ' did not draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that it was about to pass an item under which droppers were made dutiable at 171 and 12j per cent., according to country of origin. In a large part of Australia, a dropper is a most important portion of a fence. I could not have delivered the speech that I did with regard , to the duty on wire netting without knowing that a large portion of my remarks applied to the  duty  on droppers. It would be far more consistent if the Government were to accept the pretty strong intimation which we then gave by our vote. I contend- thai the droppers and standards should be treated in very much the same way as we dealt with wire netting. From personal. observation, I can say that the droppers and standards are used extensively 'in Queensland. They are used in .places where it would otherwise be impossible to have any kind of fencing. I should fancy from the extent of. their use that they are included among the most needed requirements for  the settlement of many portions of that State, and I feel certain that they  are equally essential to the settlement of New South Wales and South Australia. After doing so much to assist graziers and farmers by seeking to give them free wire netting, the Committee will stultify itself if it allows the duty on standards and droppers to be increased. In many parts of Australia it will be almost impossible, or at any rate highly expensive, to go on with fencing if these articles, which are of such valuable assistance to the pastoral and kindred industries, are made dearer. Why should they not be free of duty ? We are eternally being told what the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommends. In this case they recommended that the item should be free. </para>

                        <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> does not agree with the protectionist section of the Commission, he tells us what, sort of asses they are, but when he does agree with them he regards them as geniuses. He looks upon them as a sort of Joss, to be kicked when a recommendation does not suit him, and to be smiled on when it does. In recommending that this item should be free, the protectionist section of the Commission had some mercy and consideration for the struggling settlers in the back portions of Australia. I am sorry to see that the influence of men who cannot get their vision off the Yarra, or who possibly have, never been away from the Yarra, is so strong in this Chamber. On this item, as on others, we have had to struggle against the gross provincialism of the Melbourne prohibitionists. If we ask for some assistance for, or some recognition of the struggles of, the settlers in the back-blocks of Australia, they seem to think that we are asking for something which will destroy the foundations of Australian industries. But we are doing nothing of the kind. In spite of the fact that the item was free in the old Tariff ,' these articles are still being made in large quantities in Australia, and the product of the Melbourne  or Sydney manufacturers is being sent out to1 the back-blocks. The industry is, therefore, apparently flourishing, and assisting in the development of Australia. It has done so notwithstanding the absence of a duty. 'It is. therefore, clear that the manufacturers do not need an increase of duty, and it is equally probable that if it is given to them they will, as they are not in the business for the good of their health, take the full benefit of the enhanced duty. To be consistent, the Committee ought to have made droppers absolutely free under the previous item. The two items ought hot to  have  been differentiated. It is because I do not want the Committee to stultify itself that I shall strongly assist the movement to make standards and the other articles mentioned in this item free, in the same way and for the same reasons as wire netting was made free. </para>

I must, to be consistent, vote for duties of 17^ per cent, and 12&amp; per cent, on the other articles in the item, but I wish to separate " standards and pillars, and steel fencing of all lengths " from them.

                        <para>- I am advised that it is technically described  as  the " triangular slotted dropper." The item covers articles which we can manufacture in the Commonwealth. We already . turn out thousands of pounds worth of these articles every year. It is true that there are still importations, but the competition that exists in connexion with these articles throughout the Commonwealth is such that the consumer has no reason to fear an increase in their price as the result of the imposition of protective duties so reasonable as 17 <inline font-style="italic">\</inline> per cent, on imports under the general  Tariff,  and 121 per cent, on imports from the United Kingdom. I ask the Committee not to create the anomaly of imposing different duties on articles which are part and parcel, of the same industry. </para>

                    <para>- - I have already directed attention to the cumbersome way in which the item, is expressed.  However, the time has gone- by for amending it at this stage, and it. remains a question whether it is worth, while recommitting it in order to alter the wording. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> will look at the item more closely, he will find that the patent wedgers are. used for standards as well as droppers. They are pieces of metal which fall into a slot, and which can be used with some forms of standards, as well as with droppers. I point out, however, that we are proposing - to impose a duty on patent wedgers, and I should like to know under what . item wedgers that are not patented, or the patent for which has expired, would come. </para>

Wheels under 18 inches in diameter are by this Tariff made liable to duties of 35 and 30 per cent. But under the item as' it stands, wheels above .18 inches in diameter are dutiable at 5 . per . cent. and free. The reasons for that are, first, that it is understood that the larger wheels are not made- in the Commonwealth, and secondly, that wheels above 18 inches in diameter are greatly used in coal and other mines, and to impose a high duty on them would be a. mistake. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that the Australian Forge Company had a plant, but I do not think that it made wheels above 18 inches in diameter. It is urged that as these wheels are not made in the Commonwealth, a heavy duty would be an undue tax on the mining industry. Under these circumstances, the other Chamber came to the conclusion that a duty of 5 per cent, on the general Tariff would be sufficient. I may add that- my colleague, the Treasurer, himself moved the amendment imposing the duty as it stands. </para>

                        <para>- I find that the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 20 per cent, and the free-trade section one "of 10 per cent. Yet the other House made the duty 5 per cent. Surely that matter should be explained. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly. We had to differentiate between wheels made in Australia and those not made here, and therefore we decided to impose duties of 35 and 30 per cent, on wheels- under 18 inches in diameter, and to treat wheels over that diameter under this item dutiable at 5 per cent, and free. </para>

                        <para>- The common sizes which are made in Victoria, and I believe in the Other States, are 8-inch, 12-inch, and 24-inch wheels. I fancy that the diameter prescribed in the item  ought  to be increased. It is an undoubted fact that these wheels have been made in Melbourne. It will be a remarkable thing if a protectionist Committee agree to admit at a duty of 5 per cent, from foreign' countries, and free from the United Kingdom, an article which can be made here. </para>

                        <para>- One section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 20 per cent. I am not quite clear as to what was done in the other House, but it seems to me a remarkable thing to subject an article which is manufactured locally to a duty of only 5 per cent. when imported from foreign countries, and to admit it free when manufactured in the United Kingdom. I propose to move that the House of Representatives be requested to make the duty in the first column 20 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- The information came from the secretary to the Chamber of Manufactures, and I feel sure that it is authentic. The Steel Company of Australia, which is a local company, has just made 300 wheels with a diameter of 2 feet for the Cape Otway Timber Mills, Warburton. The item has been reached rather quickly, otherwise I might probably have been prepared with more information.I was absolutely certain when I first rose to. address the Committee that the wheels cannot only be made, but are being made, here. The size of the diameter does not enter into the question at all, because it is only a matter of making a larger mould. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> will support a request which is moved in the interests of protection. This is supposed to be a protectionist Government, but on many occasions I have been very much disappointed to find that simply because the other House had made an alteration, and the Minister in charge of the Tariff there had agreed to it, the leader of the Senate has felt compelled to adhere to it. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is now discarding any limit. Just now he said that in Australia we could make any sized wheel, as it was only a matter of making a larger mould. Any one who has ever walked through a casting establishment knows that when a certain size is exceeded, the difficulty is multiplied tremendously. </para>

                    will assent, that the larger the casting the more difficult and costly becomes the operation. That being so,

                    must see that in this case he is giving the smallest measure of protection to the most difficult work and the highest measure of protection to the -work most easily accomplished. We are told that the smaller wheels will carry duties of 35 and 30 per cent, as " Manufactures of metals." Those are the easily made wheels, which every one admits are being made here. Now, when we are dealing . with the larger wheels, which it is more difficult to make, and -which require a larger plant and deserve greater encouragement at our hands,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline>
                    contents himself with proposing a duty of 20 per cent. '.The very least that ought to be done is to put them on a parity. If it is desired by the Committee to impose a duty on these wheels, it seems to me ridiculous to put the lowest measure of duty on the wheels which it is most difficult to make. They ought to be brought into line. On this occasion I agree with the Treasurer, who introduced this as a new item. Originally, the Tariff dealt with all wheels under the one heading.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline>
                    Lyne ascertained, I presume, that the larger wheels were not being profitably made in Australia, and therefore he proposed the insertion of the special .item, -making them practically free. Whilst it may be demurred that the limit of 18 inches is wrong, I still think that the policy represented by the item  is right, and I shall vote against the request.

Bagshaw and Sons, of Adelaide, in connexion with chattcutters, and by J. Martin and Company and others in. connexion- with reaping machines. If Martin and Company can manufacture engines second to none, and send them to the other States, surely it is not beyond their capacity to make wheels over .18 inches in diameter. I wish that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> would take a different view of Australian matters, and credit Australians with the ability to mam: some articles, instead of saying that any important article must be imported from England or China. </para>

I regret to say that my recollection of the circumstances is somewhat imperfect; but I am inclined to think that the larger wheels for the engines to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> has referred, and the engines which were made at Ballarat and Williamstown, were imported. I know there was a difficulty about getting the larger steel-rimmed wheels up to the standard required made locally. There is therefore wisdom in extending the limit, within reason. Any one who knows anything of castings is aware that the difficulties multiply' enormously as the size of the casting increases. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> would be able to speak with much greater  authority on that matter than I can, but I have a distinct recollection of some difficulty in connexion with railway wheels necessary for the engines we were making. </para>

I believe that what is said on the other side about certain wheels being made in Australia is perfectly true. I also have reason to believe that there are' certain wheels, required for special purposes, not being made here, and not likely to be made here commercially for some time, which this item was specially designed to meet. The alteration was introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne in another place on representations being made to him that that class of wheel was not made, and not likely to be  made commercially, in Australia, because of some technicality in their construction. I have suggested to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> to make the limit 2 feet, but apparently he declines to do so.

                <para class="block">As the Tariff was originally introduced, wire cloth and wire gauze were dutiable at 5 per cent. and free. It was subsequently discovered that they were manufactured extensively in the Commonwealth. The item covering them was therefore struck out, and they fell under the heading of " Manufactures of metal n.e.i.," dutiable at 25 per cent. (general Tariff) and 20 per cent. (United Kingdom). The representatives of the mining industry then pointed out that battery screens would also become dutiable at those rates. Further inquiries were made, and it was found that battery screens and similar varieties of woven wire measuring over twenty holes to the lineal inch, or 400 to the square inch, were made to a very limited extent in the Commonwealth. The insertion of the words I propose will make free battery screening, fly-door wire, and other woven wire which is not made here. </para>

I shall not occupy the time of the Committee at length in dealing with this Division VI. a, but I wish to mention that the announcement of the bonus proposal, and the fact that the duties have been increased, differentiates the position with which we are called upon to deal from that with which we were called upon to deal six years ago.

                        <para>- The honorable senator can hardly pretend that he gave any reason for increasing the duties. He certainly referred to the bonus proposal, but his references to it were no justification for the increase of the duties. If I had the slightest hope that I should be able to induce the Committee to join with me in reducing these duties to the rates submitted in 1902, I should be prepared to invite the Committee to do so. But I have not' assisted to deal with half the Tariff without obtaining some knowledge of the temper and desire of honorable senators, and I therefore content myself now by saying that I object to the increases and see no occasion for them. If any other honorable senator chooses to submit a request for a reduction of any of these duties, I shall be prepared to support it, but I do not myself intend to submit such a request. </para>

                        <para>- I thought reapers were also included. My reason for referring to the matter is that unless the Act to which I have referred is administered in such a way as to regulate the price of this machinery, we must consider the protection which is to be afforded to the manufacturers. I think that the Government have been very lax in their administration of the law. When I was before the electors in South Australia I said that I believed in the new protection embodied in the Act to which I have referred, and that the workmen should share with the manufacturers in the benefits conferred by protection. I said that I was prepared to look after the interests of the workmen in this matter, and also to see that the farmer should not have to pay more than a fair price for the agricultural machinery that he requires. I see that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has his eye on me, and I wish to make my position clear. I explained that I was prepared to vote for high protective duties only if the interests of the workmen and the farmers were protected. I direct attention to the lax administration of the law by a weak Government. I describe them so advisedly, in view of what they have failed to do. I can inform the Committee that numbers of harvesters, the price of which was supposed to be regulated by Act. of Parliament- </para>

                        <para>- I am sure that every one of us wants to get through with the Tariff as quickly as possible. We are alive to the serious responsibility that rests upon the Chamber in connexion with it. But I rather differed from my honorable friend when he remarked, in something like the manner of an oracle, that when the Tariff was out of the way the Government would tell us what they intended to do with regard to the business' for the remainder of the session. I .should like the Government to say definitely that they do not intend to proceed with any other business this session, or that they do mean to do so, "as the case may be. What the Minister practically says is that when the Tariff is out of the way we shall see what we shall see. In the meantime, I suppose, we must wait until the Minister feels disposed to tell us what the Government's intentions are. I personally shall do all I can to assist in getting-rid of the business before us. </para>

                    <para>. - I, of course, sympathize to a considerable extent with the appeal made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, but when we consider the importance of the Tariff, and the length of time required to deal with it in the House of Representatives, I think that most people who look at the matter fairly will realize that the Senate has done very well up to the present. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> when he urges that, as far as the remaining portion of the Tariff is concerned, honorable senators are disposed to assist the Minister in getting it out of the way expeditiously. I hope sincerely also that, in dealing with the remainder of the Tariff, the nonsense that we have heard about compacts made in another place, will not come before us again; but that everything will be plain sailing and that the end of the session will be within view when the Tariff is dealt with. Of course, I trust that the Government will be reasonable enough to come to the conclusion after the long session that the members of both Houses of this Parliament have had to endure, that, after the Tariff is passed, only measures of the very utmost importance shall be dealt with, and that those which can reasonably stand over unto next session will be allowed to wait. At any rate, some kind of recess ought to be afforded to honorable senators. </para>

                        <para>- Not Victoria; I think the two States are New South Wales and Tasmania. Steps have been taken to procure the information as early as possible. It would, of course, be most regrettable if the <inline font-style="italic">Year-Book,</inline> were published without the information that is at present lacking. In fact, without that it would perhaps be necessary to bring out the <inline font-style="italic">YearBook</inline> with information down to  1905  only. As it is desired to bring the volume down to  1906,  every effort is being made to obtain the information. As soon as it is available the <inline font-style="italic">Year-Book</inline> will be published within a few days. </para>
