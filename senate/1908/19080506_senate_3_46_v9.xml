                    <para>. - It will be within the knowledge of honorable senators, that we have already passed a resolution that the Committee have leave to sit again on receipt of a message from the House of Representatives with reference to this Bill. The procedure which I propose to invite the Senate to adopt on this occasion is, I admit, a departure to some extent from the practice which has so far obtained in dealing with messages received from the other Chamber. The Senate adjourned until to-day, as it was contemplated that sufficient time would have elapsed by this to permit another place to deal with the 238 requests sent down by us. Certain  things occurred which resulted in our anticipations not being altogether realized, but as the other Chamber has made great progress, and has dealt with 113 of our requests </para>

Hon-  &#39; orable members are aware that in case of urgent necessity, any standing order or sessional order, or orders of the Senate, maybe suspended on motion duly made and seconded, without notice, provided that such motion is carried by an absolute majority of the whole number of senators. I consequently move - </para>

                    <para>That so much of the. Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the Message from the House of ^ Representatives in reference to the Customs Tariff Bill being taken into consideration without such Bill having been returned to the Senate. </para>

                <para class="block">I hope that honorable senators will see their way to pass this motion unanimously, so that we may proceed at once with the consideration of the message received from the House of Representatives. The message -covers the determinations of another place, who have so far dealt with 113 out of a total of 238 requests made by the Senate. The requests with which another place has already dealt represent, in my judgment, infinitely the more important features&#39; of the Tariff. If honorable members do not agree to pass this motion to enable us to get on with the business at once, the alternative is to adjourn the Senate perhaps until the week after next, during which interval the House of Representatives will be engaged in the consideration of the Tariff. It was quite impossible for me to communicate with honorable senators who had of course made their arrangements upon the understanding that the Senate would meet on the 6th May. I say that this is a case of urgent necessity. The business and general trading sections of the community have naturally been looking to us to get through this work expeditiously. I do not believe that honorable senators will permit any mere trifling technical form - for it would be. &#34;nothing more - to interfere with the adoption of the procedure proposed. </para>

                <para>SenatorBEST. - In that connexion I point out that almost without exception, and certainly for the most part, the various items of the Tariff are dependent upon other items contained within the same division, and the message we have received covers all the items included in several divisions. I say, further, that if by any chance it is found that any item considered in dealing with- the message is contingent upon an item we have not vet received it will be quite reasonable for &#39; honorable senators to ask for the postponement of that particular item. If that course were adopted. I submit that every objection to the immediate consideration of the message would be met. In conclusion-, I would ask honorable senators to differentiate between the Customs Tariff Bill and the ordinary class of Bill. The body of the Customs Tariff Bill is the mere enacting part of the measure, and the all important feature in connexion with it is the schedule, each item of which can be dealt with on its individual merits. The other Chamber, in this message, has returned to the Senate, if honorable members please, so many small Bills - regarding each item included in the message as a small Bill. They have sent- us 113 of these items with which they have dealt, and of which they ask our consideration on their own individual merits. I submit that in the interests of the- community and the expedition of our parliamentary work, it is a- fair and business-like proposition that we should now proceed to deal with these items on the understanding I have already mentioned - that if any item is regarded by honorable senators as more or less contingent upon some other item we have not yet received, I will gladly consent to the postponement of its consideration. </para>

                    <para>. - I suppose that in ordinary circumstances, . seeing that the Government have submitted a motion asking the Senate to adopt a distinctly unusual course, any one speaking from this side might be expected to oppose the motion.. However, having regard to the interests at stake, and the obligations which I conceive rest upon members of the Senate, I find myself able  to support the motion. I do so for one or two reasons which I shall take the liberty of outlining. The motion submitted really opens up two matters for consideration. First of all, the Vice-President of the Executive Council has moved the suspension of the Standing Orders. In the next place,  I desire to direct attention to the purpose for. which he seeks that suspension. I come to that first.. The Government is seeking now to induce the Senate to consider a message from the other House, which only partially deals with a Bill which has been transmitted by the Senate to the House of Representatives. I admit at once that that is, so far as our ordinary practice is concerned, quite unusual. But I wish to ask honorable senators to draw a distinction between considering a message on a Bill, and considering the original Bill upon which that message is founded. Some time ago, when an attempt was made to consider the Tariff in sections, I, in common with other honorable senators, made our objections to that course pretty well known. . I emphasized the fact that, in my opinion, there is the widest possible difference between being asked to consider a Tariff in sections, and a message upon the Tariff. In the first case it appeared to me to be essential that the&#39; Tariff should be before the Senate as a whole, in order that honorable senators might be able to see that its various portions were well balanced, and that they dovetailed and fitted one into the other ; and, above all, that we should be able to take some notice of its effect upon the revenue, which we could not do if the Tariff reached us in sections. But the position has been entirely altered now, when we come to deal with what are matters of detail. I have, during the time since the message has been in print, been looking through it, and I have not found one item which, in my judgment, is not capable of being considered solely by itself. There may be some which have relation to other items, but even when items are inter-related, there is nothing to prevent us from considering them, especially as the Vice-President of the Executive Council has given his assurance that he will raise no objection to any application for the postponement of an item, if it is found that one item is inter-related with another item which is not now before us. That appears to me to make the position of the Senate absolutely safe. I have, therefore, to ask myself whether the rights and responsibilities, of the Senate are jeopardized in any way by the new departure which we are asked to take, and my inquiries lead me to the conclusion that the position, of the Senate, its rights, and its duties, are in no way infringed. That being so, we had . to ask the question whether . it was desirable that the Senate, with work before it - and work which, as I have said, I can conceive of no reasonable objection to our proceeding with - should leave that work on one side,, and adjourn,&#39; as the Vice-President of the Executive Council said, possibly for two weeks, but with no certain knowledge that even then we should not be asked to adjourn for a longer period? It appears to me that in the absence of any substantial objection, it is a business-like and commonsense thing that we should follow the course which has been proposed by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. I want to draw the attention of honorable senators to one aspect of the case to which the Vice-President of the Executive Council made no reference, though I can hardly imagine that he . overlooked it. It seems to me that he attached too much importance to standing order 245, which, taken alone, has rendered necessary his motion. But I direct attention to standing, order 242. Standing order 245 deals with a case where a Bill is returned to the Senate. That is not the present circumstance at all. A Bill has not been returned to the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- I am drawing attention to what appears to me to be a standing order that is applicable to present circumstances. The standing order goes on to say that all such messages -  which do not completely comply with the requests of the Senate - -  which again is our position now -  shall be referred to the Committee.  &#34;Under that standing order, I say, it is quite competent for the Senate, quite apart from the matter of desirableness, to receive . the message and refer it to the Committee. It is at this stage that reference may be .made to the other standing order. I submit to the Senate that although the course now proposed to be followed is unusual, that ought not in itself to be fatal to the Government proposal. These standing- orders are, like the Senate itself, m.-w, and it may be found that as time goes on our own experience may suggest the wisdom of modifying some of them. I do not say that there is any immediate necessity for modifying the Standing Orders under review. But there is no sound reason why we should allow ourselves to be hampered by standing orders which may have been framed to meet cases and circumstances which arose in the past. While I admit at once that it might have been within the province of the Government to expedite this business elsewhere, so that we might have had the complete Bill before us- indeed, I am of that opinion - yet I hardly think that the fact that the Government have not made that progress that might have been expected of them, Ought to be considered a sound reason why the. Senate should close its doors when there is business before us waiting to be performed. I can conceive of no sound common-sense or business-like objection to the course now proposed ; and for that reason I propose to support it. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia) &#91;3.12&#93;. - It appears 1 to me that this matter is very important, and that whatever course the, Senate in its wisdom may decide to follow, it would not be consistent with the consideration that we should give to our own powers, our own privileges, and our own- status, that the motion should pass without sufficient discussion. I, personally, am most anxious, as we all are, that the Tariff should be got rid of at the earliest possible date ; and I am particularly anxious that we should expedite, as far as possible, our own business in connexion with the Tariff. But there are some considerations which have to be borne in mind, and which, I think, have been overlooked in the remarks that have already been made. At the first blush the course proposed is undoubtedly a departure from our ordinary procedure. It is a departure in respect of the power of the Constitution, and those powers of the Senate itself, which differentiate this as a legislative body from an ordinary Upper Chamber. My honorable friend the Vice-President of the Executive Council stated that although what he has proposed is a departure, it was, in the words that he added, merely a &#34; slight technical departure. I entirely disagree with that quali&#39;fication. I think it is a departure that instead of being slight and technical is very serious. The Senate ma\&#39; make it. The matter is entirely in the hands of the Senate. But the departure is one which ought to be carefully considered. It is a departure, undoubtedly, to relieve the Government from a very awkward position into which they have got. There can be no doubt about that. Moreover, it is a departure which may be extremely inconvenient to those members of the Senate who are not here. I wish to say for myself, that I was entirely unaware, until coming over to Melbourne in the train last night, that there was any idea whatever of following the course which has now been proposed. I certainly was unaware that it was contemplated, as consistent with the dignity of the Senate, that we, should be placed in the position, so to speak, of picking up the crumbs which fell from the table of the House of Representatives, that we should be asked to deal with this important Bill - with a Bill, and not merely with resolutions of the other House - by instalments, in a manner which is entirely without precedent in any British Legislature. It has never been heard of before. We should all enter, as I propose to do, an emphatic protest against what may be hereafter regarded as a precedent.. I have said that&#39; it is to relieve the Government from, a. difficulty. I believe it to be the case, as
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline>
                    has indicated, that there is no other business for the Senate to proceed with.

                        <para>- It may be more urgent, but the honorable senator put it to the Senate before, as I understood, that there was no other business to be gone on with. Are we to take it that there is business or that there is not? I think that most honorable senators will agree that there is no other business, and that our being brought back without other business to deal with is due to what I cannot help calling grave mismanagement on the part of the Government. Either they ought to have been aware that we should meet to-day without other business, or, if they did not think that there was any other business, they ought to have intimated that an arrangement would be made to adjourn for a week or a fortnight. &#34; I am not complaining of my honorable friend seeking to escape from that difficulty. This is a procedure for the purpose of relieving the Government from a very awkward position. I ask honorable senators to consider what they are asked to do. It is the well understood practice of all Parliaments that, when an ordinary Bill has been dealt with by the revising Chamber, it is returned to the other Chamber with amendments to be considered there, and is then sent back to the revising Chamber with the amendments either assented to or dissented from. This is not an ordinary Bill, but it is a Bill &#39;all the same. When, under the Constitution, the Senate was given the power to deal with Money Bills in the same way as, but in a different form from, that in which it- dealt with ordinary Bills- that is, by request instead of by amendment - the same procedure, as far as possible, was adopted, and that procedure is embodied in the standing orders from 242 to 246. Of course, it is admitted that unless, standing order 245 is suspended, we cannot deal with this message, which invites us to consider particular amendments irrespective of the Bill, which is not returned to us. It is placing the Senate in an altogether inferior position to that which it ought to hold. It is asking us on this occasion to set at naught our Standing Orders, which disable us from considering proposals in regard to our requests unless the Bill is returned to us. </para>

                        <para>- So do I, but the business is to consider the Bill, and not to consider a few requests which have been dealt with by the other House. The object of the Standing Orders was to secure that a financial or tax Bill should come back to the Senate with all its requests considered, and placed before us with the opinions or resolutions of that House in regard thereto. T, of course, feel, as the Government have felt, that standing order 245 is an insuperable bar to this message being considered. My honorable friend thinks that by suspending that rule in the form which he has suggested, he will be able to get rid of that difficultv. but I entirely disagree with. the view that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has put forward in respect of standing order 242. He thought that the Vice-President of the Executive Council had taken too serious a view in thinking that standing order 245 ought to be suspended, and invited him to consider whether all this could not be done under standing order 242. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend, to encourage the Government and assist them, as we are all bound to do in a difficulty, suggested that this  might be done under standing order 242. It is quite obvious that that is simply a general&#39; order prescribing what is to be done with messages which come up in proper form, for the consideration of the Senate. They go before the Committee; but my honorable friend cannot bring a mes-sage of this kind before the Committee, nor can the Committee touch the message unless it is in conformity with standing order 245 ; and, what is more, none of the motions set out in that standing order can be moved upon requests which have been considered by the other House, and which come up either not agreed to or agreed to with modifications to be dealt with here, unless they are accompanied by the Bill. If the Senate intends to suspend the Standing Orders, that should be done in a form which would make it possible to carry out the intention correctly. It would not be sufficient to suspend the Standing Orders so far as they would prevent the message from being taken into consideration in Committee. </para>

                        <para>- That is conditional, not upon a message, but upon the Bill being returned with any request not agreed to. I suggest to my honorable friend .that it would be very much better to adopt my suggestion, so that there should be no difficulty as to the motions which we can move, <inline font-style="italic">no&#39;:</inline> upon requests accompanying a&#39; Bill, but upon a message dealt with by itself under a standing order which has no relation to a Bill, but to the returned Bill and requests. I wish to make an emphatic protest against this departure and against any precedent being established for the Senate agreeing to consider requests, especially in respect of such a Bill as this, on being returned from the House of Representatives in sections. If it is done on this Bill, it may be done on any Bill ; and, except for the consideration which my honorable friend has pointed out - as <inline font-style="italic">\o</inline> the Senate being without business- there is no reason why we should make this departure, and establish an innovation seriously affecting, as I think, the powers and status of the Senate in relation to matters of so much importance . as a taxation Bill of this character. I protest emphatically against it, and  1  do so particularly because I think it is a course which ought not to be adopted in this instance, and one which, if adopted now without a protest, would be considered as an easy precedent for the future to enable the Government to get out of the difficulty. </para>

                        <para>- It is in accordance with our Standing Orders, owing to the power which the framers of the Standing Orders in their wisdom gave us to meet just such critical positions as the . present. They saw that at times difficulties would arise in the way of Parliament carrying out the wishes of the people, and what was most in the interests of the people, at some particular time. The country and Parliament are sick of the Tariff question, and I am sure that honorable senators are full up of it and want to get rid of it. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member is very particular how he gets anything good. I do not care whether I get it in instalments or all in a lump, so long as it effects .the purposes that I desire. It&#34; it is in the best interests of the people and is constitutional, the sooner I get it the better. I do not trouble about the &#34;means, so long as they are not illegal or dishonorable. No one who has spoken has shown that there is anything unconstitutional in the Government&#39;s proposition. It has only been shown that it is against certain of our standing orders, but the Standing Orders themselves give us power to remove that difficulty. </para>

He has been at sea. If anything occurred on th~e ship in which he was employed, would he delay action to consider how his forefathers or his foremothers would have acted in similar circumstances? A man like the honorable senator would jump to a conclusion instantly and take action that would probably save the ship and- the lives of those on board. That is exactly what the Government propose to do in this&#39; case. They propose to take action that will give employment to honorable senators and fulfil the greatest desire of the people - to be finished with the Tariff.  </para>

                        <para>- I am not in a great hurry. I believe that the Senate will deal with the message so expeditiously that we shall have to get another instalment, and then there might be another discussion such as we are having to-day. I do not see therefore that anything will be lost if we continue this&#34; debate for another five minutes. We. are taking- a course of action that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> said has never been taken in Parliament before. What df that? If it is a wise course of action, then we are wiser than our- forefathers were. If they would not have taken the same course in  the same circumstances, their intelligence was not as great as ours. </para>

                        <para>- I believe sometimes in expediency. I believe in doing everything that is in the interests of the people as soon as possible. It is said that this is only a part of the schedule of the Bill, without the Bill itself. If the Bill had never been before the Senate some difficulty might have been raised on that score. But the Bill has been before us. Every item has been discussed ; our requests have gone to another place, and now they are coming back to. us. Are they to be followed by the Bill every time? Is it absolutely necessary that the Bill should be here with the requests, that have already been dealt with? Let us deal with those requests now, and1 accept or reject what has been done By another place. By the time we have finished that work, probably the whole Bill will be before us,  and then we can finish the work of the present session to the advantage of Australia. There is a certain&#39; amount of justification in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> interjection that this course was taken without the knowledge of a certain number of honorable senators. Probably no honorable senator knew of it until he came to Melbourne, or was on his way here. </para>

                        <para>- If they have a mind to make up they are in just as good a position as the honorable senator is, because I have known occasions when even he was doubtful as to which course of action would be wisest for him to pursue. But when the Government obtained the consent of another place&#39; and made up their minds, quite recently, the matter was published as soon as possible. As to sending a notification to every honorable senator that the Senate would continue to sit after the 6th Mav, that would have been an&#39; absurdity. It was the duty of every honorable senator to be here to-day. If any honorable senator is not here, the responsibility rests with himself, and not with the Government, the Senate, or another place. Although any honorable senator who is not here may have a grievance on that score, it does not amount to much, and certainly he would not get the sympathy of the people if he appealed to them for it, because he was absent when a question of this kind was before Parliament. . I hope that the Standing Orders will be suspended. I would1 even go so far as to suggest to the &#34;Vice-President of the Executive Council that, if any difficulty is likely to arise in the future owing to the form of the motion, he might consider the suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> so that everything may be done in as orderly a fashion as possible, and the work be finished in the interests of the .people at the earliest moment. </para>

                    Constitution under which such a method of dealing with&#39; the Bill could have been attempted. Still there is grave objection to be taken to the course submitted by the Government. I own that when the honorable senator gave notice of motion the other day for the suspension of the Standing Orders, I did not gather the gravity of the proposal contained in his proposition.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline>
                    has so well expressed my&#39; views with reference to standing orders 242 and 245 that I shall not attempt to go over the ground again, beyond saying&#39; that I entirely agree with him that standing order 242 has nothing to do with the question, and that the whole situation is governed by standing order 245. But I wish to make myself clear on one or two points connected with this procedure. If it is adopted1, it will be found to have provided an eminent amount of friction between the two Chambers, because we shall have this Chamber dealing with requests that another place refused to agree to, while another place is- dealing with other requests which we have submitted to it. Therefore, instead of there being a single, there will be a double friction between the two Chambers.

                        <para>- Precisely. I am offering reasons why I object to the course of procedure proposed in the Senate, and I take exception to &#39; the manner in which this message was .arrived at. However, I shall not pursue that matter further. While I am speaking, I may certainly direct attention, even if it be only as a matter of privilege, to the manner in which, in defiance of all parliamentary custom, this Chamber has been discussed, in another place, by name, and in a manner derogatory to the status of the Senate and its members. I know, sir, that under your presidency, and the presidency of your predecessor, the greatest care has always been taken .to conserve the well-known parliamentary rule in reference to a discussion involving another branch of the Legislature,. I regret sincerely that the same care and the same  regard for parliamentary method and parliamentary decency has not been recognised and maintained in another place. I have no desire to delay the transaction of public business, but really it is rather too late in , the day, after having had the Tariff under consideration for ten months, to be told that this is a matter of urgency. There has been no urgency about, the Tariff for ten months, and yet the Vice-President of the Executive Council tells us to-day that all Australia is fairly gasping, like a dying fish in the bottom of a boat, for the completion of the Tariff, and we must rush the business through at all cost, and at any hazard, to constitutional usage and parliamentary method. . </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that the procedure proposed will expedite the consideration of the Tariff at all. I have already said that I believe it will cause friction, and friction will certainly cause delay. I . do not propose to quote them, but it is necessary only to compare some of the requests which another place has refused to accept with some of those which still remain to&#39; be dealt with in that Chamber to show that it is certain that friction will be set up. </para>

I do not believe that if we pass the motion it will expedite the consideration of public &#39;business, but I know that by doing so we shall be. making a serious inroad upon -the status of the Senate under the Constitution, and a serious assault upon the methods which should be adopted in dealing with communications, between the two branches of the Legislature which are involved in messages affecting contemplated legislation. </para>

                        <para>-I do not know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> need emphasize the plea of common sense, because I have already said that the absolute necessity of the case is the only justification for the adoption of such a course of procedure. It should be. adopted, however, with a distinct understanding that the matter is not. to be lightly regarded, and that it is only the absolute urgency of the case that secures consent to such a course of procedure. The reason for saying so should be more or less obvious. The most important piece of legislation intrusted to the&#39; Commonwealth Parliament in connexion with which the Senate has co-ordinate or almost co-ordinate powers with the House&#39; of - Representatives is the framing of a Tariff. It is, perhaps, the most important responsibility we have. Whilst in the adoption of the course of procedure proposed in this case we may do no injury, it must be remembered that Tariffs will again be submitted for consideration, and I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that the precedent we are now establishing will then be followed if, unfortunately, the Government of the day should find themselves in the same position as the present Government are in to-day. We are establishing a precedent which will certainly be followed in the time to come. As a senator charged with the duty of seeing that these things are done properly and in order, I take the opportunity to point out the grave danger of the precedent we are asked to establish, and to&#39; repeat that if it were not for the extreme necessity and gravity of the existing position, I should not be prepared to permit the Tariff to be considered in the way  proposed. </para>

                        <para>- I have, another reason for &#39; objecting to this piecemeal method of dealing with the business. Tt seems to me that by dealing with it in this  way we are to some extent limiting what I might call our power of compromise. If we had before us the whole of the results of the deliberations of another place we should be better able to accept this or reject that proposal and to treat all in a spirit of fair arid reasonable compromise, as I suppose we all desire to do. I confess that I do not like the position at all. I further object to the course proposed, because it represents the introduction of quite a startling change of procedure with very great haste and without opportunity for consideration. Although the course may not to-day be fraught with very grave consequences, we shall have a record of proceedings which when followed later may have effects very much more serious than any that may result to-day from the adoption of the course proposed. I notice that the very first item in the schedule is that relating to tobacco. </para>

                        <para>- I merely wish to say that tobacco is an item that is dealt with both in the Excise Tariff Bill and the Customs Tariff Bill. The Senate was very careful to keep both Bills before us while the Customs Tariff Bill was under consideration. That was a wise course. The procedure now proposed is, to some extent, a departure from that course. For these and other reasons I regret that I have to protest against what the Government have proposed. </para>

                        <para>- It was a kind of sympathy that I do not altogether appreciate. I do not admit that the Government were in any difficulty, or that there was anything which can be directly or indirectly construed as a matter of mismanagement in what they have done. As a matter of fact, I invited honorable senators to assist me in assessing the time it would take the other Chamber to deal with the requests which we sent to them ; and, unanimously, we agreed to the 6th May as the date on which the Senate should meet again. </para>

When I consulted the Prime Minister, it was necessary that he should consult with the  Speaker.  I also did myself the honour of consulting the  President.  But I was not then in a position to give any guarantee as to how the House of Representatives would take a proposal to send up to us a schedule showing how they had&#39; dealt with part of our requests. What we did was this : In my presence, the Prime Minister stated to the press, on Monday afternoon, what our intentions were, and he urged that that information should be sent to every Stale. </para>

                        <para>- I have not seen the newspapers of the State represented .by my honorable friend.- All that I can say is that on Monday I was present when the Prime Minister made&#39; a statement to the press as to what we intended to do, and that my chief urged that the information- should receive prominence in the newspapers of all the States. Several of my honorable friends sent telegrams to me asking what  I intended doing. I, of course, as was my duty, at once replied informing them of my intentions. But nothing that I could &#34; say, or that the Prime Minister could do, could bind the other Chamber. The House of Representatives only agreed after, dinner last night to send up their message, and . &#39;the announcement appeared in the press this morning. But we are here, and I am sure that my honorable friends are anxious to do business. </para>

The Tariff being the most urgent measure before us, must be disposed of first. I ask this question : If I had not provided honorable senators with this means of proceeding with business, should I not have been subject to the strictures of honorable senators opposite. Would not an attack have been made upon the Government in this connexion? I submit that, under the circumstances, a proper course has been adopted, and I trust that honorable senators will pass the motion, unanimously. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire, at the outset, to be permitted to make a general explanation. Out of the 238 requests that we sent to the other House, we are invited to consider 112, one having been postponed. It disagreed outright with twenty-four requests ; it modified, or partly agreed to, twenty-two requests,&#39; and it accepted outright sixty-six requests. Out of the accepted requests, sixteen represent increases of duty ; twenty-three represent decreases of duties ; twenty-three do not affect the revenue, or, if they do, only infinitesimally ; while four represent partly increases and partly decreases. The Committee has, I think, every reason, to be satisfied with the manner in which, the other House has dealt with its requests. I trust that honorable senators will . also see fit to exhibit a spirit of compromise, so that the Tariff may be settled to the satisfaction of not one Chamber alone, but of both Chambers and the public generally. Concerning the item before the Committee, the Government originally proposed a duty of is. od. on unstemmed tobacco, but, in view of certain representations that were made to them, they felt that is. 6d. would be a better rate to adopt. The Senate, however, in its wisdom, saw fit to request that the rate be increased to is. od.. The other House has not accepted that rate, and therefore I&#39; move -  </para>

                        <para>- That is the protection which was proposed by the Government, and if would be reduced in each case by 3d. per lb. if our request were adopted. Honorable members will see that if it were persisted in, the effect would be largely to injure the small manufacturer, and really to play into the hands of the combine. I have no doubt that my honorable friend who proposed the req&#39;uest had an idea of altering correspondingly the Excise duty, but we determined to adhere to that! duty. I submit that we should, almost as a matter of course, see our way not to press our request. </para>

                    <para>. - The circumstances under which the Committee was induced to increase the duty on this item will be well remembered. It was not done, I venture to suggest, so much with the view of lessening the protection given to the manufacturer of imported . leaf as with the desire to encourage the use of the. locally. -grown leaf. I voted to increase the duty from is. 6d. to is. 9d. per lb. with. that sole object, and I remember, sir, that you contributed a very informative speech on that occasion, the purpose being to offer an additional inducement of ?d. per lb. to. the local manufacturers to manufacture Australian leaf. I see no reason for altering the vote which T gave.. </para>

                <para class="block">At the same time one has to recognise that, if the -duty be fixed at is. 6d. per lb., it will be giving a very substantial measure ot protection to local growers. I believe -that the average price of tobacco leaf is from 4d. to 6d. per lb. At that rate it would be giving a protection of at least 150 per cent, to the local growers. . It appears to me to be probably one of the most highly protected articles produced in Australia. To that extent it can hardly be said that &#39;the local growers would suffer any injustice if the Senate should recede from its position. I do not regard the matter as being of any serious importance, whatever way it may be decided. The tobacco duties in the Excise Tariff Bill have been assented to by both Houses, and therefore we are free to consider this item without reference to those duties. </para>

I support the proposal of the Government. I was not present when the item was under consideration before. It seems to me that a duty of is.  6d. per lb. is . ample to protect the local grower and encourage the use of the locally-made article. I feel that the Government are taking the only course which, under the circumstances, they could very well take.

I know that an expert was sent down from Queensland to treat with the Government in connexion with tobacco. His instructions were that,  while he was to be careful to try to help the tobacco-growing industry, he was to be particularly careful not to suggest anything which would interfere with the revenue. I believe that the reason why the Government are sticking to the duty of1s. 6d. per lb. is that it means more revenue. </para>

                    <para>. - This is an item in which the Senate tried to obtain a little more protection for the manufacturers and workers in Australia. With regard to the previous request, the Minister put forward the plea that we should preserve to the full all the protection which we could give to the manufacturer. In this case the Minister, on behalf of the Government, argues that we should weakly give in, although to do so will mean a reduction of the protection given to the Australian manufacturer, and worker. There is no reason why this tobacco, when imported, should not be in an unstemmed condition. Ail the stemming work could be done in Australia. The effect of an increased duty would be to bring about that result. We should therefore press the request. </para>

                    <para>. - The Vice-President of the Executive Council states that the request represents a reduction of protection to Australian industries, yet a duty of1&#189;d. is really an increase of 50 per cent, upon the very high rate which was previously enjoyed by the manufacturers of local blue, and under which, as -I am reminded, the industry made substantial and satisfactory progress. This is a matter in which the other place might reasonably have met the Senate. We made no wild inroad upon their proposition. &#39;Qn the contrary, we proposed merely a reduction in the preferential column - a column which is supposed to embody the ardent desire of this Government to treat the products of Great Britain with greater leniency than the products of other parts of the world. Although the Vice-President of the Executive Council gave us figures showing the number of requests accepted by another place, he did not point out the value of the requests which had been accepted, and of those which had been rejected. Had we asked another place to remove the duty altogether, one would not have been surprised at our request being refused, but we made an extremely moderate proposition for a reduction of the duty, not on the whole of the imports, but only on those coming from Great Britain. We asked for a reduction merely of&#189;d., leaving the duty still . 50 per cent, above that contained in the Tariff of 1902. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline>
                    has explained, the lowest rate proposed represents an increase of 50 per cent, on the previously existing duty, whilst the increase proposed on imports from foreign countries is as much as 100 per cent. If I am not too inquisitive I should like to know what connexion exists between the refusal of the Government to accept the request of this Chamber and the well-known fact that they are drawing their financial policy from a laundry-blue source. If we are not going to stand by anything that we have done what are we here for? If we are going to stand by any request we have made this is certainly one on which we should remain firm.

                    <para>. - I submit that we are dealing here with a matter of very great importance to one of our best industries, the stearine candle industry. It is estimated that throughout Australia there has been invested in the stearine candle industry with the associated industries for the manufacture of soap, glycerine, pitch and such like byproducts, something like , &#163;250,000. I admit that the duty under the old Tariff was&#189;d. per lb. on stearine and paraffine wax. We have been asked&#34; why, if the industry was able to exist under the old duty, those engaged in it are now clamoring for an increased duty. The fact is that they were unable to carry on the industry on a profitable basis under the old duty. I can mention one firm, whose books are open to inspection, that has invested some thing like , &#163;100,000 in the candle branch of . the industry alone. The profits made by the firm on that branch of the industry since Federation have been purely nominal, and if we take the whole of their investment in the industry to the extent of &#163;160,000, the profits derived have not exceeded 2&#189; per cent., which, it will be admitted, is not a very satisfactory return. It &#34;is true that paraffine wax is regarded as the raw material of one industry established in the Commonwealth, but as a matter of fact the paraffine wax is imported in very large quantities from Burmah, India and America, and is really a made-up article. So far as my&#39; inquiries go it would be necessary only to mould it and insert wicks to convert it into candles, and less than a score of people doing such work could supply the demand of the whole of the Commonwealth if paraffine candles were to replace the. ordinary stearine candles. It is to protect the stearine candle industry that we ask for the imposition of a duty of1d. &#39;per lb. on stearine and paraffine wax. Throughout the Commonwealth, there are some 600 or 700 people employed in the stearine candle industry, and honorable senators will therefore realize how important it is that we should protect this industry. </para>

                        <para>- That is not so. It is true that progress has been made in the manufacture of soap and other by-products associated with the candle industry, but the stearine candle industry itself did not make any progress under the Federal Tariff of 1902. If we encourage the importation of paraffine wax we shall deal a serious blow at the stearine candle industry. It should not be forgotten that the competition which the local industry has to meet is a very serious competition. Paraffine is a byproduct of shale, and is produced in America, and in Burmah, and in Borneo, and other places where only black labour is employed in its production. The wages paid in the Australian stearine candle industry range between 6s. and ios. per day, and it is quite impossible for those carrying on that industry to pay a reasonable living wage to their employes if they are to be subjected to the competition .of the product of the black labour to which I have referred. </para>

                        <para>- That is so; but I do not agree with the Tariff Commission, In framing this Tariff, we desired to give reasonable encouragement to an industry which must be regarded as essentially an Australian industry. There were exported during the year 1906, 4,000 tons of tallow. If, instead of that tallow being exported, it had been utilized in the production of stearine candles, it would have involved the employment of a large amount of additional labour. There is no reason why it should not have been manufactured into candles in this country. The imports of paraffine wax in 1906 represented 76,345 lbs. Every ton imported means competition with our own stearine candle industry, and I submit, therefore, that, on the facts stated, it is most desirable that we must give additional protection. I am given to understand that there are two or three factories in Tasmania&#39; which &#39; produce paraffine candles, and look upon paraffine wax as their raw material. I suppose that Tasmania .is the only State &#39; in which, by reason of climatic conditions, paraffine wax candles can1 be used all the year round. The industry, I am given tj understand, employs between seventeen and twenty-one - people, and in the candle industry alone - that is, in the moulding and wicking of the paraffine wax - there would be employed only five or six people. </para>

                        <para>- The main imports came from the Standard Oil Company. The portion that, did not come from that source came from Burmah, India, and Borneo, where black labour only is employed. Honorable senators will therefore realize what our own manufacturers have to contend against. Of course, in the estimation of some honorable senators, it is a crime for Kitchen and Sons, or any other manufacturers in this country, to&#39; make any profit.  1  presume that honorable senators have received letters and circulars from various firms bearing upon this subject. I have received a very, interesting letter from the firm of W. H. Burford and Sons Limited, Adelaide. </para>

                        <para>- This letter from Messrs.. W. H. Burford and Sons is a typical one, and I will read it -  &#34;We trust you will use your endeavours to at least&#39; retain the duty on Paraffine Wax as passed by the House of Representatives, viz., id. per lb., otherwise, the stearine candle trade will be most seriously affected, as has already been pointed out. We, ourselves, have spent large sums of money in plant for the .manufacture, of stearine candles from tallow, the raw material and product of our land. A large number of hands are employed in the manufacture of stearine and its bi-products, whereas,  the cost of machinery and labour in moulding imported wax into candles is very small in comparison. Besides this, there would be the loss of bi-products, Glycerine and  Oleine,  and the labour in working these up. The  Oleine  is entering very largely into use in connection with the recovery of ores at the Broken Hill mines. Lessening the output of this product will be a serious loss in this respect. </para>

I do not understand this kind of procedure, nor do I understand* why, when the Vice-President of the Executive Council has a series of letters on the subject, he picks out one of an exceedingly vague character, and ignores the others.

                    <para>During the discussion on paraffine wax last evening <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne referred to me as having influenced several votes in the Senate through misrepresentation, and otherwise made use of such words that left an impression that communications from me to members of the House of Representatives, as regards accepting the Senate&#39;s suggestion that the duty On paraffine wax should be made at the old rate of &#163;d. per lb., were not to be relied on. A man in  his position should not stand&#39; up in the House and tell members that some of the votes in the Senate were gained through misrepresentation by me. It is more than he dare do outside of the privileged Chamber. I challenge him to grove that I have made either a misstatement, or writ- ten a word that is untrue, and I cannot but think he knows it.&#39; About six months ago, when the item of paraffine was before the Representatives last, he will recollect that, after the division was taken, I then challenged his statement, that &#34; I could get all the paraffine wax that I required in the Commonwealth.&#34; I then confronted him with the representative of the only firm who make paraffine wax in Australia, and offered to book 100 tons right away, and pay a deposit. This took place in the presence of himself, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carr,</inline> M.H.R., of New South Wales, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Storrer,</inline> M.H.R., of Tasmania. </para>

                <para>I challenge <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne to purchase for me 100 or 200 tons of Victorian-made paraffine wax at the same price as I am now paying, and openly state that I will fulfil the contract, and pay, in addition, to any benevolent institute he cares to name in Victoria, the sum of&#163;100: If he cannot accept this challenge, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne should publicly withdraw his statement, and apologise to the firms I represent.  </para>
                <para>We in Tasmania are quite prepared to pay a reasonable duty on our raw material, but we strongly object to being forced to close up. our industries, and hand over to &#39;the large firms the connection it has taken us years of . hard work to attain. We maintain that the duty, of&#189;d. is ample for any stearine or paraffine firm, and, at the same time, will prevent the large firms crippling our small industries. After what transpired last night, and the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, how is it possible for any representative for Tasmania to give the present Ministry support? I have already instructed our firm to book no further order&#39;s &#34;for candles, as we cannot pay1d. per. lb. duty and compete with the cheap candles made by the large stearine manufacturers. </para>
                <para class="block">I do not see that anything is going to be gained for the Commonwealth by this system of robbing, Peter to pay Paul, of destroying a comparatively small factory in Tasmania, in- order to benefit a larger factory in Victoria. It is not a form of procedure such as the advocates of Federation ever anticipated. When the Commonwealth was brought into existence, it certainly was not contemplated that the small factories should be destroyed in the interests of the larger ones, or that the whole object of the Union should be centralization, not only of government,- but of factory life in one State; This seems to me to be a cruel case. I do not know anything about the firm. I only received this letter today. I do not know that I have ever seen the writer. It has nothing to do with my State, but as one who Was sent here to assist in the representation of all Australia, I feel that I should say a few words on behalf of a struggling industry against factories which have existed for a great many years, and had protection to help them along. We&#39; know that firms have come into being, and grown up on a duty of&#189;d. per lb. But now they want to crush smaller firms, and are clamouring through their representatives here for a duty 100 per cent, higher than that under which they have lived. I want to know what we are going to do if every request that we make is to be quietly and blandly surrendered with a few words of. protest - with some indignant words of protest it may be, but still comparatively few. It seems to me that the Senate is seeking to occupy a position so absolutely- secondary to another place, so positively puerile from a constitutional stand-point, that if this sort of thing is to continue, the sooner the Constitution is amended, and the Senate put out of its meagre and unhappy existence, the better it will be. It is sup- . posed to have duties to discharge under the Constitution ; but if every one of them is to be abrogated because somebody elsewhere objects, it is a most deplorable condition of affair&#39;s. </para>

                        <para>- &#34; Our &#34; industries, are the great natural industries which to-day are carrying the burden of Australia. What the honorable gentleman wishes to do is to bring into existence more and more the industries of other lands. . I do not know whether honorable senators generally are aware that Australia sells more of its&#39; produce to the rest of the world proportionately to its population than does any other country. There is no country that sells so many million pounds worth of its goods to the rest of the world as does  Australia. We cannot continue to do this splendid business unless we allow some goods to come here. If we will not allow to come in the goods that we want most some goods will come here that we want least. </para>

                        <para>- I am sure that you, sir, will be one of the first to see the bearing of that statement on the question in hand. We requested a duty of Jd. per lb. on paraffine wax, which the Minister has told us is worth, when landed here, a little over 2d. per lb. I suppose that at the most it is worth something under that price in New York,&#39; so that a duty of Jd.&#39; per lb. is at least 25 per cent, on the American value. If that is not enough duty to impose on an article, even if it were completely manufactured, I do not know what is. When we come to remember that paraffine wax is the raw material for certain manufactures in the Commonwealth, 1 cannot see why the Committee should hesitate for a moment in pressing its request. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline>
                    this afternoon. I am doubtful whether, in respect of some of the minor requests involving small amounts and secured here by comparatively small majorities on close divisions, it would be desirable  to precipitate a conflict with another place. I notice with satisfaction that the Vice-President of the Executive Council cheers that sentiment. . I shall expect him to cheer the corollary which I propose to attach to it. When I find that a request embodies the sentiment of justice of this Chamber as expressed by a very large majority, I feel that we ought to insist upon it. -This is certainly one of the first that we have come across in respect of which honorable senators ought to abstain from making an unconditional and humiliating surrender right off the reel. It was carried by a majority of eighteen votes ; the numbers being twenty-three to five. If, the moment that it is indicated to the Senate that the House of Representatives has expressed its dis&#39; approval of what was really the unanimous feeling and wish of the Senate, we are immediately and basely to surrender bur position, we had better swallow the whole message at once.

                        <para>- The House of Representatives have in some respects taken a very reasonable view of some things, but I do not think the Government are entitled to the credit for that. I was astonished that the Minister, who usually feels the weight of a majority, should urge us at&#39; the first time of asking - if it were the third time of asking we might reconsider it - to give way. We ought not, at the very first time of asking, to surrender after a practically unanimous vote. If we did so people would be in a position to say that the Senate had/ no backbone; that it was ready to stultify itself on the smallest provocation, and to eat its requests in order to secure an early adjournment and to get rid of the Tariff. I ask the Minister &#39;to withdraw his motion, and to uphold the dignity and justice of the Senate by assenting to what I am sure will be the feeling of the chamber - that the request should be pressed. In addition to the fact that there was that big majority, one of the strongest supporters of. the request, which was moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> who declared - and gave his reasons - that it was the desire of the Tariff Commission that the duty should be reduced from id. to ½d. </para>

                    <para>-33l- - I  hope  the Minister will withdraw the motion.  His  speech bristled with the assumption that paraffine wax would largely interfere with the manufacture of stearine candles. It does nothing of the kind. Paraffine candles are, in nine cases out of ten, a mixture with stearine. It is only because Tasmania has a cooler climate that the manufacturers there are able to put a larger amount of paraffine wax into the candle, and give a better flame. The Treasurer was evidently misinformed on this matter, and, consequently, misrepresented the position to another place. The following letter- from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Upton,</inline> a New South Wales manufacturer, confirms <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Metz&#39;s  letter - - </para>

With regard to the Commonwealth Oil Company : First, the said company, I believe, cannot produce .a marketable cheap wax similar to American 118/120 melting point. Second, the said company, I believe, cannot produce a wax of Rangoon quality, <inline font-style="italic">viz.,</inline> 134/136 melting point. Third, the said company make, as far as I know, only one quality of good colour wax, at about 128 melting point. This wax is too good, or, rather, too dear for a cheap household candle, and not good enough for a mining candle, so if the duty on wax is kept up to id., both the cheap household and best mining candle must advance in price. Fourth, 1 know, as a fact, the Commonwealth </para>

                    <para>- - The effect of the duty, if it is retained, will certainly be to enable the large candle manufacturers, who make stearine, to eat up the small candle manufacturers, who do not. That will be the sole effect of it, whatever may be the intention of those who favour it. So far as I understand the principles of the manufacturing process, a plant for the manufacture of stearine is very costly, and, when installed, is capable of turning out very large quantities - so much so that one. or two plants are quite equal to supply the whole Australian demand. The large manufacturers of candles, like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kitchen</inline> and the firms with which he is associated, have installed a stearine plant, and are also makers of candles, but the smaller candle manufacturers, not having a sufficiently large business, and, it may be, not a sufficiently large capital, have not put up a stearine plant, and therefore are bound to apply to their competitors, the opulent candle makers, like Kitchen and Sons,, for a supply of their raw material. The effect of putting an increased duty on stearine is simply to enable Kitchen and Sons to charge a higher price to their smaller competitors, with the inevitable result that, as they can get the stearine, they manufacture themselves at cost price,! and are- enabled by means of the duty to charge an increased price to their competitors, they will in a small space of time absolutely crush out the smaller men who are seeking to gain a livelihood as honest as their own. </para>

                        <para>- Whilst I propose to stand by the vote which I gave before. I would suggest to those who contend that, paraffine wax is the competitor at which they are aiming, that the way out of the difficulty would be to separate the two articles. Rather than consent to put a duty of id. per lb. on both articles, I am prepared to support a proposal to increase the duty on paraffine wax, leaving that upon stearine as it is at present. The duty on stearine has been Jd. since 1902, and during that time, according to the figures quoted by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, the manufacturers of it have captured the Australian market so successfully that not a single lb. of it is now being imported. That indicates clearly that the plants in Australia are turning out all the stearine required to meet the demands of the whole of Australia. What justification therefore is there for imposing an additional duty on stearine, seeing that the only people who purchase from those manufacturers are the small candle-makers who come into competition with them ? Does this Chamber want deliberately to encourage a policy the effect of which is to  say  to the larger manufacturers : &#39;&#39;&#34;You can with confidence look to the Senate- to help you to crush your smaller competitors &#34;? </para>

                        <para>- I affirm - and the honorable senator can try to disprove it - that the cost and output of a stearine plant are so great that a small manufacturer could not face the undertaking. The cost of an up-to-date stearine plant is, I  believe,  somewhere in the neighbourhood of ,&#163;50,000 or .&#163;60,000. That plant, having been in stalled, must necessarily turn out such a large quantity that a small manufacturer cannot hope to grapple with the business. He is bound, therefore, to look to the larger firms, who are making stearine, and also candles, for his supply of raw material. Even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> will understand the enormous advantage which that must give to the larger manufacturers, who can, by means of the duty now proposed, put such a price on the raw material as to make it impossible for the smaller men to compete with . them. The effect must be that the smaller manufacturers will have to transfer their legitimate business to the already flourishing and satisfactory business carried on by Kitchen and Sons. I ask the Committee to hesitate before it sanctions a proposal of that kind. I have said that I consider the duty suggested by the Senate sufficiently high. If honorable senators are -not prepared to go with me to that extent, believing that paraffine wax should be suppressed, they might agree to divide the item  into two lines and impose a duty of id. per lb. on paraffine wax, and at the same time decline to increase the duty on stearine, seeing that for six or seven years the old duty proved ample protection to secure the market for the local manufacturer. Any increase upon that duty must have the effect of transferring to the larger manufacturers the business of their smaller competitors. T voted for the request as it left the Senate, but rather than see the duty of id. per lb., originally proposed, reverted to, in the case of stearine* I shall  gladly  support a proposal to divide the item into two lines in the way I have suggested. </para>

                    <para>. - I should be inclined to say that, in the absence of any more definite argument against it than we have yet heard, the Committee should stand to its original decision. This matter was threshed out here a few weeks ago, and apparently overwhelming reasons were given which justified a strong majority in favour of fixing the duty at Jd. per lb. on both stearine and paraffine wax. Since that time we have had a. remarkably clear and precise declaration by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Metz,</inline> a manufacturer in a small way in Tasmania. The Minister has not attempted to contradict it. The case this gentleman makes out is a very strong one, and in the absence of Contradiction, his statement must be taken to be absolutely true. He has made out the cost which, over and over again, we intimated would be a result of much of this Tariff making. We said that the manufacture of many of these articles would inevitably pass into the hands of monopolists. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has said that we are framing a Tariff for the Commonwealth, but the answer given by the Tasmanian manufacturer is that the honorable gentleman proposes to destroy his industry. He says that he has been able to compete successfully with the bigger manufacturers, because of the comparatively small duty previously imposed on the raw material he uses. . He says that if the increased duty is imposed, on one of the raw materials he uses, he will be unable to&#39; obtain it, and, to make his case good, explains that he must go to larger firms in Sydney and Melbourne to obtain the raw material he requires for his smaller industry. When the Vice-President of the Executive Council speaks of building up a Commonwealth Tariff, I ask him whether, in this case, he is not proposing to frame a Tariff which, on the uncontradicted statement of a small manufacturer, will result in the destruction of his industry. It is. entirely inconsistent with either the dignity or, what is more, the duty of the Senate that the Committee should stultify itself by reversing a carefully considered decision, arrived . at after an exhaustive debate, when not a single additional argument has been submitted in support of the change. The position previously taken- up by the Committee is strengthened by the statement of the small manufacturer in Tasmania that he anticipates that his industry will be ruined if the alteration is made. In the circumstances, I hope that the original decision of the Committee will be adhered to, and that the majority in favour of it will be greater than it was when the matter, was last under our consideration. </para>

I wish to be able to vote in support of the request as originally submitted by the Senate.- Failing that,I wish to divide the two items of stearine and paraffine wax. If we are called upon to vote on. the motion submitted by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, no opportunity will be given later - on for a modification of our original request. I hardly know how to proceed, but I &#39; am sure that there is no desire on the part of the  Chairman  or any member of the Committee to prevent a full expression of the opinion of the Committee being recorded. I would ask you, sir, if it is not possible to divide the items in some, way so that we may take a vote upon the duty to be imposed upon each, separately. </para>

                        <para>- It is not. I think it would be a great pity to divide stearine from paraffine wax. I wish only to say at this stage that I shall vote against the motion that the request be not pressed for reasons which I have already given, and which were given on the merits when the matter was originally before the Committee. I think that the duty on both should be&#189;d. per lb. - I am entirely opposed to an increase of the duty on  paraffine wax. The question was exhaustively debated both as regards stearine and paraffine when the matter was first before the Committee of the Senate. The . deliberate judgment of the Committee, indicated by a majority of eighteen, which represented an almost unanimous vote of the senators then present, was that both paraffine and stearine should be dutiable at &#189;d. per lb. It does not appear to me that anything has been or could be added to the discussion which then took place. </para>

                        <para>- That is so; they were debated together. Honorable senators will recollect that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kitchen,</inline> whose letters were read by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, put the two together. He was the exponent of the wishes of the trade, and he contended that both paraffine wax and stearine are really finished articles, and are made by him in circumstances which justify him in asking for protection for his industry to the extent . represented by a duty of1d. per lb. on both. He said that they needed merely to be moulded into candles on arrival here, and should not, therefore, be allowed to come into the Commonwealth at a low rate of duty, when they competed with the locally-manufactured candles in just the same way as candles which originally were admitted at the same rate of duty. &#39;With that statement before us we dealt with the request of the industry, for a uniform duty on these two articles, and by a practically unanimous vote decided that a uniform duty should be imposed upon them. As honorable senators are aware, we took these articles out of the general category of item 42, leaving beeswax and other articles, including Japanese and vegetable wax, in that item dutiable at1d. per lb. We then adopted a special item making the duty on stearine and paraffine wax&#189;d. I think that we should be simply making ourselves ridiculous to separate these articles now. It would be better to take a division straight out on the motion of the Vice-President of the Executive Council. </para>

                    <para>. - The former duty of&#189;d. on stearine has been sufficient to enable the local manufacturers to capture the market, and 1 understand that now there is no importation of this article. But paraffine wax is imported, and comes into unfair competition with stearine. I was very much in favour of separating the two articles, so that the duty on stearine might remain the same as previously, . and a larger duty put on paraffine wax. As the matter presents itself to my mind, the local manufacturers, having captured the market, and no stearine being imported,&#39; it does not matter whether we take the duty off or leave it on, because all that is used in Australia is manufactured here; but I want to see the duty retained on paraffine wax, because it enters into competition with our own manufacturers of stearine candles. </para>

                    <para>. - I propose to ask the Committee to agree to the duty of 3d. per lb. in the general Tariff in order to secure a preferential duty of&#189;d. per lb. In 1905 we imported 2,230,000 lbs. of confectionery from the United Kingdom and 466,000 lbs. from other countries, while in 1906 we imported 2,609,000 lbs. from the United Kingdom, and 575,000 lbs. from other countries. Our object in proposing a preference is to afford to the United Kingdom an opportunity of obtaining additional trade with Australia. I move - </para>

After a lengthy consideration, however, the Committee determined not to request the imposition of an Excise duty, and the non-compliance with our request is practically consequential upon that. vote.

                    <para>. - I think that this request was made by the Committee to some extent under a misapprehension. The class of liquorice that is manufactured locally has always been regarded as confectionery and subject to the same rate of duty as that article. It will be remembered that the proposal to request a reduction of duty was suddenly sprung upon us. The general impression was that the object of the duty was to protect that class of liquorice which is purchased in chemists&#39; shops, whereas as a matter of fact the real intention was to protect the class of tasty, wholesome, and digestible sweetmeats which are produced in the Commonwealth: Here are various samples of them. </para>

                    <para>.- I suppose that we shall have to do exactly as we are ordered -  bow down and place our necks under the yoke. It is very absurd that we cannot be supplied at a fairly moderate price with liquorice confectionery ; but because the Minister is able to tell us that one firm has written a letter saying that unless the duty be retained they will suffer, we are asked not to press our request. Apparently the community can go to the dogs so long as certain firms can derive a benefit. </para>

                <para>Since our request was made, it was found by the Department that importers had been importing in tins and bottles fish preserved in salt or brine, and demanding its admission under paragraph D at 5s. per cwt. The Department had no choice but to accede to the demand. It was intended that such fish should be dutiable under item 53c at1d. per lb. The modification of our request will remove all possible doubt as to our intention. The effect will be to impose the same rate on fish whether imported in brine or oil. For example, smoked sardines in oil will pay exactly the same rate as plain sardines in oil. It is certainly a desirable amendment to make. </para>

                <para class="block">Honorable senators are aware, I suppose, that in certain parts of Victoria there is a drought. In Australia a drought is a constant thing. When it is not in one part, it is in another. Therefore, the reason why the freedom of the item from duty should be extended to November next on behalf of Victoria may be safely assumed to exist for some other State after November, and for various other States from time to time. In 1902-3 there was a most appalling drought, extending over almost the whole  of New South Wales . and into Queensland. The losses of stock at that time were fabulous. We lost sheep by the tens of millions, cattle to the extent of two or three millions, and horses to- the number of several hundred thousands. . It was pretty well known at the time that the effects of the drought would have been modified if we had been able to get cheaper supplies of fodder from New Zealand. Drought is a very serious matter, and the fact that it has been considered desirable in the interests of Victoria at the present time to leave the item free, shows that another place recognised that where drought exists there ought to be a possibility of obtaining free fodder. </para>

                    <para>. - There hardly seems to be a large enough attendance to deal with a big item like this. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Quorum formed.&#93;</inline> I do not propose to discuss the, main arguments which were addressed to the Committee when the item was previously before us, but I always believe in giving honour to those to whom honour is due, and I certainly should like to pay honour to the&#39; Vice-President of the Executive Council for the success with which he has entered the ranks of the humourists. Immediately before the suspension of the sitting he made a perfervid appeal to the Committee not to stultify itself. Seeing that riot many minutes before he had used all h&#39;is logic and persuasion, and had succeeded in getting the Committee to stultify itself to the extent of reversing a vote arrived at by eighteen to five, it appeared to me that he was qualifying for a position on the staff of the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> or some other journal devoted to light reading. I should like honorable senators tq note the modification proposed by another place. No stronger indictment was ever made of a request submitted&#39; by this Chamber. We proposed, from my point of view wrongly, that there should be a duty upon fodder. To that the House of Representatives agreed with a modification,&#39; proposed by the representative of a drought-stricken district, postponing the date upon which the duty was to apply, until a time when it was thought that the drought would be over in that immediate locality. The laughter I hear is the right reception for a modification of that kind. In any other assembly in the world 1 such a proposition would have been scouted the moment it was stated. Honorable members who profess to believe in the protectionist faith come forward with the proposal that we should inflict a duty upon fodder, but they say, &#34; For Heaven&#39;s sake shield our particular electorates from it for a few months while the drought lasts.&#34; There is never a moment or . a month or a. year in which1 a- drought is not prevailing somewhere in Australia. If there is_a.ny virtue in the protectionist theory, anything in the ostensible object with .which that duty was imposed, this is the very time that it should be enforced. &#34;It was advocated here by Senator-W. Russell and others as being distinctly the farmer&#39;s opportunity - -the time when a drought prevailed. Now is the time that duty ought to be enforced and collected, if there is anything in the plea- that a drought is the .one chance of enabling the farmer  to turn cannibal and eat up <inline font-weight="bold">Ms unfortunate</inline> &#39; and struggling brother. </para>

                        <para>- It is a truthful way of stating it. I shall leave it to the farmer to determine whether it is fair or not. IK  was frankly admitted, when we discussed the item before, that the duty would be in-  operative in all normal or good seasons, and that only when the drought fell heavily upon the land, when nature was unkind, the season adverse, when in a time of stress those upon the land might be struggling to their last ounce and their last shilling, in a valiant effort to save their few remaining head of stock, we should place the farmers  in a position to . say, &#34; Heavy as is your adversity, Ave demand our pound of flesh, even if by means of that levy we still further cripple you in the undertaking in which you are engaged.&#34; If there was anything in that plea - the only one addressed to this Chamber - now is the time that those who were sincere in making it ought to enforce the duty. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> has moved to postpone the duty indefinitely. That is another way ..of stating that he believes that -fodder ought to be free, as I do. </para>

                        <para>- Moss Vale was never in a better position than it is in today. The southwestern district and a good portion of the western district of New South Wales is to-day in as pitiable a condition is I have even seen it. If any one wants to know how to spell drought, he has only to travel from here to Albury to see it. If Ave are to suspend the duty because the climatic conditions of the districts to which I ha%&#39;e referred are likely to be relieved before the date named, that , is a justification for suspending it for all time, because no sooner will the drought be relieved in those portions of Victoria and New South Wales than Ave shall hear of it somewhere else in Australia. As a matter of fairness and justice, if it is right to suspend the fodder duty because certain localities are troubled to-day, it is equally fair and right to suspend it when other portions of Australia are similarly afflicted. I ask .those who have supported the duty to be&#39; consistent, and either to vote to. strike it Out, or, Avith <inline font-weight="bold">Senator&#34; Pulsford,</inline> practically to postpone it to a time before which  Ave may reasonably assume that the Tariff will again come under review. I ask them not to make fish of one and fowl of the other, but to hold the scales of. justice evenly between: all parts of Australia - not to make a favorite of one particular&#39; locality because it happens at this, time tha) a  certain&#39;  representative  who may be supporting a party can secure for that district a concession which Ave refuse elsewhere. Whatever Ave do, let us stand before Australia as extending&#39; the same policy, the same rule, and. the same justice! to  every  man,  whether  he lives north, south/ east or west. &#60; </para>

                    <para>- - I agree Avith the leader on this &#34;side that it is almost impossible to  win  this battle, but he would be a very poor, soldier who, because he thought he might, be defeated, would not be prepared to face the foe again and again. In  view  of the extent of their territory, their vast resources and possibilities, New South Wales and Queensland must certainly, if one can forecast the future at all, be the two great  States of the Commonwealth, and the f  foun1.dation  of their wealth, and of that of the Commonwealth, since they form a part of it, is to be found in their herds of cattle and flocks of sheep.  When Federation was first proposed, these two great States, hesitated longer than any of the others to. accept it, and they did so because their people believed that past experience indicated that if they . entered the Federation their great resources might not be adequately appreciated by the people of the southern States, and that, consequently,&#39; the development of their territories and resources might be retarded. The prediction&#39;, made at that time by the people in  New  South Wales and Queensland opposed to Federation has been strongly justified by. the course proposed in connexion Avith this,, item. I do not care two straws whether  the appeal I nbw make is made in vain,  but certainly a remark which fell from; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> who is a stalwart protectionist, justifies a speech&#39; from representatives of either New South Wales or Queensland. When it was pointed out: that those two great States would specially suffer under this proposal, and Senator; Pulsford mentioned that New South Wales ; stock had been decimated by hundreds of , thousands in the drought, and that the. losses of stock from drought in Queens- , land might be estimated by millions,- Sena- , tor <inline font-style="italic">Trenwith&#39;s</inline> reply was that those  losses  were due to want of water </para>

                        <para>- And I say that the interjection justifies the prediction of some of the opponents of Federation when the Commonwealth Bill was first placed before the people of New South Wales and Queensland. Want of water was an aggravation of the disaster, due to lack of fodder and the high price which was charged for the fodder necessary to keep stock alive, added still more to the difficulties which settlers in New South Wales and Queensland had to face. </para>

                        <para>- I dare say that if I push the matter very much further I shall be charged, even by honorable senators, on&#39; this side, with trying to obstruct business, knowing that the obstruction will be in vain.. But I have felt it necessary to take advantage of the opportunity to speak as I have done, because of what I regard as a gross exhibition of un-Federal spirit displayed in the action of the Government in this matter. I know of a case in history where, through the failure of supplies, the lives of many citizens of a nation were at stake. The protectionists then said in answer to an appeal for cheap food for these people, &#34; No, if you agree to that you will be violating the principles of protection.&#34; That example will never be repeated again. But a somewhat analogous reply is, in this case, being given to the appeal on behalf &#34;of the flocks and herds of the people in Queensland and New South Wales. I believe that the people of the great State I represent are entitled to every assistance that can be given them, and I should be doing less than my duty if I did not protest in the strongest possible language against this duty. </para>

                    voted for this duty on the last occasion, notwithstanding the fact that Victorian pastoralists were in as bad a position as the pastoralists of New South Wales. It is simply a question of the application of the principle of protection all round.

                        <para>- The  Chairman  would call me to order if I discussed tanks even to oblige the honorable senator. If protection is a good principle to adopt, are we going to impose protective duties on the agricultural implements and machinery required by farmers, and at the same time permit farmers in New Zealand, which is not connected with the Commonwealth in any way, when they can find a better market here than in their own Dominion, to send their produce to the Commonwealth by the shipload, and so reduce the value of the produce grown by farmers in Australia ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> in dealing with the question before, desired to score a point, and in order to do so was prepared to sacrifice what he laid down forhimstlf as a principle to follow. </para>

                        <para>- I should not have been in the least surprised if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> had moved that the operation of this protective Tariff should be suspended for the next thousand years. Is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> the leader of the party opposite, going to be led by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> on this question? I suppose that the honorable senator considers it cowardly of the Government, and of their supporters, not to insist upon immediately bringing this duty into operation, and so bring the Senate into conflict with another place. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> knows that politics are carried on by compromise, and it is another place that has the power, to say what is to be or is not to be in a matter of this kind. It is for us to suggest, but we can go no further. Every year there is drought in some part of Australia. It so happens that this year there has been no drought in South Australia; and I believe that the same remark applies to Western Australia. In the State from which I have come we have many thousands of tons of fodder lying ready- for market. People who have been prudent enough to look ahead, and &#39; to preserve fodder for emergencies, deserve to be encouraged. It is only reasonable and fair that- we should Consider their interests. I have a free hand in regard to such matters as this. When I was before the electors I told them that farming interests would at all times have my first consideration, and I am acting on that principle now. As the six States have banded themselves together to receive the benefits of Federation, and as at the same time they have to bear the expense of it, why should New Zealand be allowed to profit in times of emergency ? </para>

They ought to be satisfied now that wire netting has been placed on the free list, and I helped to place it there. When I find honorable senators opposite interjecting in the snappy way in which they have been doing, I always think that I am rubbing them up in a manner that they do notlike.I hope that the Committee will support the Government in this matter, and stand by protectionist principles. Although we may not get all that we should like, let us take what we can, and do our best to get the rest by- and-by. </para>

                    <para>. - If ever there was an illustration of the selfishness which underlies the policy of some of our &#39; &#39; geographical protectionists,&#34; it has been exhibited by my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell, as well as by a certain gentleman in the House of Representatives. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell professes to believe in the principle of protection, I venture to say that his votes in regard to wire netting and  tanks make his arguments simply ridiculous. I point to what was done by another member of Parliament in regard to the item under consideration. It was proposed by a certain gentleman who represents. Riverina, that the duty under consideration should come into operation at a certain date. The constituency of that gentleman is suffering at the present time . from, drought. But when the great drought overtook New South Wales some years ago, almost desolating our flocks, and making the price of fodder prohibitory, so that the prosperity of the great pastoral industry was seriously threatened, the very gentleman who proposed recently that the fodder duties should be deferred to a certain date, most strongly opposed, any&#39; relief being given to New South Wales and Queensland ; because he stated that there were . two or three individuals in his constituency who had some corn to sell. Similarly, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell has informed us that there is plenty of hay in South Australia, and therefore he considers that the farmers in his State should get the highest possible price for it. The honorable senator cannot realize the present condition of affairs. I. assure the Committee that though the drought of a few years ago was severe in many parts of Australia, it is equally severe to-day. In New South Wales fodder is selling at an almost prohibitive price. Chaff is fetching from&#163;7 5s. to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;7</inline> 10s. per ton, maize <inline font-style="italic">&#163;9</inline> per ton, and the prices of other commodities are equally high. It is a well-known fact, vouched for by those who are in a position to know, that there was never a time in Australia when the small farmers in some parts of the country were in, such a precarious position as they are now.- There are hundreds of them who cannot afford to buy fodder for their horses to enable them to plough their land and put in their seed. Every carter, every cabman, every dairyman, every person who has horses to feed or cows to stall feed, is suffering severely. Milk is at present selling for 6d. per quart in Sydney, whilst twelve months ago it was fetching only 3d. -The duties levied by this Parliament operate most cruelly on the pastoral and farming industries; and especially cruel are these fodder duties. At such a time we ought to do all we can to assist the country people. In other countries similar duties have been suspended in. times of drought. Such was the case in America; and even in Spain duties were suspended until the drought had broken up and the farmers could buy fodder at reasonable prices. These . duties may suit people in some parts of Australia to-day, but they will severely injure people in other parts. From knowledge which I have obtained- for practical purposes 1 can say that under no circumstances will fodder be cheap until at least the beginning of next year. The rains that have fallen in some .. parts of the country have come too late. The consequence is that practically the only fodder obtainable in Australia is in, South Australia and a small portion of . Western Australia. These duties may therefore&#39; benefit people in those States if they have a good season. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. Are honorable senators prepared to handicap all those whose living depends upon their ability to obtain cheap fodder? Are they prepared to enable the farmers of South Australia to get famine prices for their fodder at the expense of the farming community in other parts of Australia? I can realize that under ordinary conditions <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell as a protectionist is in favour of the imposition of a duty, but his arguments show the utter want of principle which actuates a geographical protectionist. How he can possibly call himself a friend of the farmer is beyond my comprehension. If he says, &#34;Iama friend of the South Australian farmers at the present time because the conditions will enable them to get a high price for their chaff at the expense of all other farmers &#34; he will be consistent, but not otherwise. I hope that the Committee will see its way to agree to the-, amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford.</inline></para>

                    <para>. - If anything were needed to show the absurdity of our request to levy a duty on hay and chaff, it is the proposition from the other House to suspend its collection until the 1st November, 1908. I believe  that a good many honorable senators voted for the request under a misapprehension. There is no doubt that at the present time the most severe drought which has been experienced for many years is afflicting Victoria and a large part of New South&#39; Wales. The very fact that the other House wants the collection of the duty to be postponed until the 1st . November, 1908, shows that we were wrong in requesting its imposition. It indicates that no matter when the duty may be enforced, some other portion of Australia may then be suffering from a drought. I remember -the. time when Queensland suffered as badly from a drought as are Victoria and New South Wales to-day. It may be in that position next year and the year after. If it is in the best interests of the Commonwealth that the collection of this duty should be suspended on behalf of a large portion&#39; of Victoria and New South Wales, for a certain time, surely it is desirable that it should be suspended altogether ! </para>

                            Russell is advocating the imposition of this duty, but I do not believe that in Australia there is a farmer who wants to live on the misery and heart&#39;s blood of the farmers in those States which are afflicted with a drought. I do not believe, even though the honorable senator says it is the case, that in South Australia there is a farmer who wants to live on the sweat and blood of his brother farmers, in the drought-stricken States.&#39;

                        <para>- The honorable senator&#39;s argument was to the effect that the distress of the farmers in other States made* the opportunity for . the farmers in South Australia. If that is not living on the sweat and blood of other farmers, I do not know what is. I have never heard a more cold-blooded argument used. I do not think &#39;that the honorable senator is so hard-hearted as his language would lead one to suppose, but I was surprised at him rising here and stating that the farmers of South Australia want this duty imposed. Sup- &#39; pose that that State was afflicted with a drought as it has been, and its farmers could not procure food for their teams and plough their lands. Does any one imagine . for a moment that the farmers of New South Wales or Victoria would want to take advantage of the position to bleed the men whose; stock were face to face with starvation* No. I was shocked indeed to hear the honorable senator make such assertions about the farmers of South Australia. I do not. believe that they would indorse them. I, do not think- that they would ask that a duty on fodder should be levied when drought conditions prevailed in other parts of the Commonwealth. What are we asked to do? . We are simply asked to suspend, the collection of the duty until a certain date. Why ? Because, at the present time, a drought prevails in Victoria and a large part of New South Wales. The message from the other House proves that we made a request which was not fair and just to the people of the Commonwealth. We are therefore&#39; asked to suspend the collection of the duty until such time as it is believed the drought will have broken up in Victoria arid New South Wales.- What will the people of Australia say if we refuse to remit the duty ? I am sure that they will say that it is a wrong tax to levy, because, while&#39; it presses hard on one State this year, it may press hard on another State next year. Alt the States are subject to the visitation of a drought, I can remember the great drought  in Queensland, which lasted for seven or eight years, ruining thousands of small men, with their 500 or 600 head of cattle. Fodder went up to ah enormous price. After the men had spent all their means in trying to keep their stock alive, the drought continued. Let us also consider the position of the carters on a gold-field. </para>

                        <para>- It will help to keep out importations and to increase the price of local fodder. I believe that when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> was estimating the price of fodder in the future he was speaking by the book. I remember that, during the great drought in Queensland, many . a man was obliged to mortgage his property in order to keep his team alive. Is not the fact that we are asked to suspend the collection of this duty until the 1st November positive proof that we did something wrong ? </para>

                        <para>- Queensland has had a bountiful season, but I am sure that its farmers do not wish to penalize the farmers of Victoria or New South Wales. At the present time Victoria has to send stock to Queensland in order to keep them alive. We in Queensland do not want to penalize the southern farmers or to charge them exhorbitant rates. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator knows in his heart that he is wrong. He is going to vote to undo to a certain extent what he did before. He ought to remember the conditions in other portions of the Commonwealth, and not to forget that portions which are prosperous to-day  may be suffering from a drought later on. If it is wise to suspend the collection of the duty at the present time for the sake of Victoria and New South Wales, surely it will be wise to remove it ? Why should there be a duty collected on fodder when a drought is visiting Queensland, Western Australia, or South Australia? We ought either to repeal the duty or to postpone its imposition until such time as people shall have acquired a little more common-sense than, they appear to possess to-day. I intend to support the proposal of&#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> if &#34;no other amendment is moved, but I should like to see the duty taken off. </para>

                        <para>- It does not follow. If protection is the law, why should not the farming industry reap the benefit of. it? We hear a lot about the farming community and their terrible troubles. I think we hear a lot more than is really felt..I have seen land in South Australia, near Georgetown, in the month of April, nearly as bare as the floor of this chamber, and, with an abundant rain during the winter, we could in September or October mow the grass for hay. We hear a great deal about the trouble of keeping a few cows on a farm, but with two inches of rain in a mild climate like that of New South Wales or Queensland the feed comes up very quickly. In 1888, at Beridleby and Eurilpa, where I was living, in the north of South Australia, we had a severe drought. Four inches of rain fell on the 1 st of January, and fourteen days afterwards, when I measured it, the grass was 10&#189; inches high. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator ought to know better than to ask  such senseless questions. What I have Stated shows how quickly the feed grows after rain in a moderately warm climate. There is nothing unreasonable in the modification proposed by another place. Two inches of rain at any time throughout the Commonwealth will, if the temperature is moderate, be followed by an immense growth of grass. I fallowed 530 acres in the year following the drought to which I referred without using &#39; a single bag of chaff or a Sheaf of hay. I speak simply of what I have seen. I resent being told that I have no sympathy with suffering humanity. If that had been said by any one but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> I should have been annoyed, but I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will bridle that jokey mischievous member of his party. If we are to have protection, let all classes Share in it straight away. The action which the Senate took in imposing this duty in the Tariff of 1902 was the right one. The Government will always have the power in a case of great emergency, if Australia as a whole is suffering from drought, to suspend the operation of the duty. </para>

I am fighting for a principle, and surely those honorable senators will give me credit for being sincere, and not bloodthirsty. That is generally an attribute of the Conservatives. We on this side take a different view. I hope that we shall adhere to the decision &#39;we arrived at by a large majority in a fuller Committee. </para>

                    <para>. - The modification proposed by another place is the most lamentable instance of parochialism that I ever came across. If it is right to suspend the duty until November, it will be right then to suspend it for another six months on behalf of some other State, and beyond that again for some other drought-stricken part of 7i&#233; Commonwealth. There is scarcely a time when some part of Australia is not suffering from drought. To postpone the operation of the duty for the benefit of one locality that is suffering from drought at the present time is certainly parochialism.&#39; I have just been to the south-east of South Australia, where there is scarcely a blade of grass to be seen, and one squatter is trucking 2,000&#39; head of cattle- 900 miles to save their lives.  If the duty is to be postponed at all, it ought to be postponed altogether. The difficulty I see is that if we agree to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford&#39;s</inline> amendment there is not the least chance of another place adopting it, and we shall only have to fight the matter out again. The duty is either right or wrong. Although I owed my election largely to the farmers&#39; vote, if I had been here at the time I should not have voted for imposing this duty. I am quite sure that the farmers, of South Australia do not demand that it should be imposed, because what is the case of Riverina to-day may be the case of South Australia to-morrow, and in times of drought farmers, generally recognise that they should be mutually helpful one to the other. I do not think that the farming community generally would make any strenuous- demand to have the duty imposed. It has, however, been  put on at the request of  the  Senate. There is no possible way of removing it altogether. If it was right to impose it, it is right to enforce it straight away. If not, it should be put off indefinitely. I do not -see any way of removing it now that the other Chamber has accepted it. As it is in the schedule, I am going* to vote against the modification proposed and force the thing home, because I think that is the best thing to do. </para>

                    (Western Australia)&#91;8;55J - To&#176; much altogether has been said about the Riverina in debating this Question. Those who take a broader view of the Commonwealth recognise that the Riverina . is not the only district of- New South Wales that, at the present time, is unfortunately afflicted bv the drought. Its effects extend across the border into Victoria.

                    <para>- A very large area in New South Wales and Victoria is affected by the drought, and it is possible that action in the matter was taken by the honorable member for Riverina under an influence that is exerted in both Chambers in dealing with the Tariff. In the first instance honorable members in another place dealt in their own way with the Tariff, and honorable senators did the same later on. Then the arrival of the time to adjust differences between the Houses, suggests a reason for the proposal to postpone the operation of this duty until November next. </para>

                        <para>- I am suggesting that it is probably due to the influence of the spirit of compromise. It may be that the proposal to postpone the operation of the duty was made with a view to secure a winning vote for the duty in another place. One would imagine from the remarks made by honorable senators opposite that Australia is doomed to perpetually suffer and be scourged by drought, when, as a matter of fact, the statistical records prove that during the trying time of 1902-3 we exported more hay and chaff than we imported. </para>

                        <para>- I find that the value of the imports of hay and chaff for 1902 was . &#163;10,000. For 1903 it was&#163;3,000, and for 1904 <inline font-style="italic">&#163;168.</inline> No one will deny that in 1902 the whole Commonwealth suffered more or less from the effects . of drought. The yield of wheat per acre in that year was the lowest on record, and our imports of wheat in 1902 or in 1903 were higher than in any other year of our history. That is a clear indication of the character of the season in that year. Yet during, that drought-stricken year we exported , &#163;252,000 worth of hay and chaff. In 1903, our exports were valued at &#163;43,000, or an excess of . &#163;40,000 over the value of the imports of hay and chaff in that year. In 1904, our exports of hay and chaff were valued at . &#163;28,000, and in 1905 they were, valued at . &#163;21,000. We can safely brush aside the arguments urged by honorable senators opposite, whose sole object is to place Australian producers . at the mercy of outsiders who may wish to send produce into the Commonwealth in ordinary seasons. I flatly refuse to assist by my vote to do anything of the kind. The figures I have quoted prove that the Commonwealth is, in this matter, self-sustaining, even during the most trying time of drought. I do not care to remind, the leader of the Opposition of his promise to uphold the rates of duties imposed under the old Tariff, but there is yet one more chance left the honorable senator to keep faith with the Committee. in this matter. Under the Tariff of 1902 a duty of1s. per cwt. was imposed on hay and chaff, and under its operation the Commonwealth did not suffer, as is shown by the fact that we exported more than we imported. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell is the only honorable senator on the other side who has attempted to deal with the great objection to the imposition of this duty, and he did so only in his second address, and after he was brought to his feet by some remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers.</inline> The honorable senator rose to defend himself against the supposition that he was likely to do anything inhuman. No member of the Committee dare face the ghastliness of this proposal.

Are honorable senators prepared to say that they support a policy, the adoption of which may be fraught with great destruction to stock? I have here the new issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth YearBook,</inline> and I find in it some figures showing the falling off in the number of stock in Australia in 1901 and in 1902. I find that horses decreased in number by 96,000, cattle by 1,420,000, sheep by 18,000,000, and pigs by 150,000. </para>

                        <para>- Many &#39; of us tried hard to get the duty taken off. At that time there was a certain amount of fodder produced in New Zealand, and a great deal of it might have been used to save stock if the duty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> per ton had not been imposed. I want honorable senators opposite to be game to face the reaL position. Let the Minister rise in his place and tell the Committee that the Government are prepared to back this policy whatever . its consequences may be. They are not prepared to put the policy into operation over the next few months, because that would affect sheep and cattle in Victoria. I wish to know what is to be done for the sheep and cattle of Australia generally. I have submitted a just and constitutional proposal. The Constitution requires that all the States should be placed on the same footing. I ask that what is proposed for a time for the special benefit of Victoria shall be granted in perpetuity for the benefit of all Australia. I should like to remind honorable senators that pastoralists are not the only persons interested in this matter. I suppose that hundreds of thousands of cabmen in our great cities are to-day feeling the pinch of the hard times due to the effects of drought. Surely they . are . entitled to a little consideration even from protectionists? I ask on their behalf that this duty should not be imposed. </para>

The honorable senator has said that in a time of drought more stock die from want of water than from want of fodder: That idea is due to a misconception of what occurs in parts of Australia outside the small State in which we are assembled. It is notorious that however much water is conserved by means of dams and artesian wells the great loss of stock in times of drought is due to the weakness brought about by the stock being continually travelled backwards and forwards to water without the necessary food to sustain their strength: This is proved by the fact that thousands of stock in such seasons are trucked from the western districts to the coastal districts that they may be brought within easy reach of fodder supplies. </para>

                        <para>- One thing clear to my mind after listening to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell is that if the duty is imposed the cost of feeding stock trucked to the coastal districts will be &#39; increased. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell described the wonderful way in which a fall of a few inches of rain will cause the grass to spring up in every part, of Australia. I quite agree with the honorable senator that the recuperative powers of Australia are most remarkable. &#39; But we are discussing, the effect of the duty at a time when, the rain has&#39; not fallen. It is useless to tell us that the grass will grow when there is rain, at a time when we are urging the Senate to postpone for the next twenty years the application of the duty upon the fodder that is required to keep our stock alive before the rain falls to produce the grass. Another honorable senator declared that he had not any doubt that in case of emergency the Government would suspend the duty. I do not profess to know very much about the powers of the Government in this respect, but I take it&#39; that there is nothing within the four corners of our Customs legislation to enable the Government to do anything of the kind. I cannot refrain from drawing attention &#39; to the extraordinary . form in which this proposal comes before us. It reminds me very much of the old saying - </para>

                <para class="block">Our protectionist friends want these duties, but they are sick where there is a drought, and therefore wish the duties to be suspended. But by about next November, when they anticipate that the drought will have been broken up, and there will be plenty of fodder, it will be a case of &#34;The Devil a saint is he.&#34; Honorable senators surely recognise how such an action as this must stink in the nostrils of. every Federalist in Australia when he sees in a Tariff which is -intended to settle the fiscal issue for years to come a duty which is only to take effect at the end of six months, simply because there is a corner of Australia in which it is believed that by that time the drought will have broken up. The proposal in its present form is an absolutely disgraceful one, of which this Parliament, I feel sure, will feel thoroughly ashamed in the not far-distant future. Let us either impose the duty from -the present date or let it be put off altogether, but do not let us carry a proposal which, if it were not unparliamentary, I should call dishonest. It practically means this : &#34; Here is a duty which, we believe to be desirable, but just at present it does not suit us to have it in operation, because there is a certain part of Australia which is drought stricken ; but within a few months the drought will have- disappeared, so that we will fix the duty to come into operation at that  time &#34; -regardless of the fact that later on exactly the same conditions may exist in other parts of Australia. </para>

At that time a statement was made to the effect that matches had been sent out by a certain firm in boxes that did. not contain the number that they should contain. The firm concerned felt greatly aggrieved, and I told them that if they furnished me with a statement with  regard to the matter I would place it. before the Committee when the item came up again for consideration, so that their side of the case might be placed on record. I have in consequence received the following communication from Messrs.&#39; Bell and Company, and I shall read it without comment. &#91; express no opinion of my own.

                    <para>You further said that we had undertaken to supply 410 matches because our name was upon the box. &#39; In the first place, we may say that we have never had any contract with the State Tender Board, and, consequently, have never guaranteed 410 matches in a box, or any other number, to it. The contract, if one was entered into, was made with a person who apparently obtained some of the matches  from us  to enable him to carry it out. If, therefore, any guarantee of number was given, it must have been given by that person. The name of the person was openly mentioned, so that there  can be no doubt as to the sale by us which was referred to ; there was no contract with this person to supply him with our vestas over a. given period, but only a sale to him of10 cases. </para>
                    <para>The following is an exact copy (omitting, only for obvious reasons, the name of buyer and the price) of &#39; the contract or sold note. The press copy in our letter-book has already been exhibited to you, and. we are quite prepared to allow any other member to see it :  - &#34;11th February, 1908. &#34;Dear Sirs, &#34;We have now to thank you for and confirm the following order :  - &#34; 10 (ten) cases, each a gross, Brown dip, R. Bell and Co.&#39;s London make, No. 10 Vestas, in tins, at- per gross, duty paid on Melbourne wharf. &#34;For prompt shipment from London.  &#34; Terms : Cash on arrival, less 2&#189; per cent.  &#34; We have sent Messrs. R. Bell and Co. instructions regarding length and thickness of taper, and we have advised them that should it be necessary to charge more for these special matches, you are prepared to&#39; pay up to - per gross extra for same. We think, however, that Messrs. Bell and Co. will be able to supply the match you want without extra cost to you. &#34;Yours faithfully, &#34; (Sgd.) Philips and Pike.&#34; </para>
                    <para>Philips and Pike are the company&#39;s brokers. </para>
                    <para>The reference to thickness and extra price is made because the buyer particularly desired the vestas to be of extra thickness. It will be seen that there is no mention whatever of any guaranteed number to the box. No number was guaranteed. Vesta boxes are known by names and numbers in the trade, and whether made here or elsewhere, by us or any other manufacturer, boxes with a specific name or. number are exactly of the  same size. The vestas sold in the instance referred to were No. 10. They were of the regular size and were quite full. </para>
                    <para>If, as was stated, the Tender Board has been unable for years to obtain 410 vestas in a box, it is quite evident, as we have only supplied a small quantity to <inline font-style="italic">the contractor, that other</inline> makers do not get more into their boxes than we do. The number in. the box depends upon the thickness of the taper used, and if extra thick matches are specified, a fewer number will go into a box. </para>

                    <para>. - The item of mustard is somewhat similar to the item of blue. The Government picked out certain items in connexion with which they could afford to give a preference to the United Kingdom. Their list did not include this item for the reason, amongst others, that practically the whole of our importations of mustard come from the United Kingdom. In1906for instance, we imported from the United Kingdom &#163;41,445 worth, and from other countries&#39; only&#163;719 worth. Practically the United Kingdom requires no preference, and it is simply a question of fixing the duty. The Government considered that the old duty of 2d. per lb. was insufficient, and therefore proposed a duty of 3d., which was accepted by the other House. We feel that that&#39; duty is necessary in order to afford sufficient protection to the local manufacturers. I move - </para>

                        <para>- In no sense can the Senate ever look to the Minister for any guidance or help in a matter of this kind. So long as we have responsible government we must always understand that the Ministers here, as -part of the Cabinet, are bound to ask the Senate to do not what it might wish or ought to do, but what has been decided by the Cabinet and the other House. Instead of being our leaders and guides, the Ministers&#39; sole object must be to mislead and misguide us. </para>

                        <para>- In his introductory speech the Minister did allude to that matter, but he was very careful not to refer to the nature of some of the suggestions accepted. I remind the honorable senator&#39; that some of the alterations which have been made and which swell the total of the acceptances were suggested at the instance of the Minister here who said that .mistakes had been made elsewhere, and that alterations were desired for departmental reasons. One suggestion, I believe, was to insert a semicolon. That is one of the requests which the other House has accepted. </para>

                        <para>- I will not, sir. I feel satisfied that the other House will be highly gratified to have <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith&#39;</inline> s assurance that it has acted wisely sometimes. -. So far as we have gone, the Committee has merely said to the other House, &#34; We humbly apologize for having ventured to make any suggestions, and by the shortest possible cut, and in the briefest possible space of time we withdraw them.&#34; Is it not due to the Committee that these matters should be . considered on their merits? I should like to ask it to adhere to its request concerning this item, but in view of its decisions I am hardly justified in doing so. I. invite the Minister to consider if he cannot accept a compromise. There is no earthly reason why the Senate should give way any more than the other House. The difference between the Houses is as to whether the duty shall be 3d. or 2d. per lb. This Committee did not seek to interfere with the duty of 3d. per lb. in the general Tariff, but merely ventured to request- in pursuance of the policy of preference in which the Government ardently believe - that a duty of 2d. per lbs should be levied on imports from the United Kingdom. I ask the Government to accept a duty of 2^-d. as a fair compromise. </para>

                    <para>. - I dare say that from one point of view it is a wise policy in a Chamber disposed to increase duties to try to throw overboard some cargo in order to save the rest. On the score of prudence, I shall not obstruct any . attempt to try to save something. I rise to point out an admission which we have had from the Vice-President of the Executive Council. It more or less illustrates what I believe has been called on more, than one occasion the gross fiscal hypocrisy of the &#39; Government. When the Minister was driven to find an argument in favour of a duty of 3d. per lb. on mustard, although it was pointed out to him that it represented an increase of. 50 per cent, on the old duty, . he at once directed attention to the fact that the Government desired to strike at the import  trade from the United Kingdom. That was about as clear a declaration as could possibly be made with regard to what some people would call sincerity, and what others would probably call hypocrisy. Why the honorable senator had the courage to make it, I do not know. I should have thought that he would almost have blushed to do so.. </para>

                        <para>- No. Nobody need rise here to illustrate anything about hypocrisy with regard to the framing of a Tariff after the example which the honorable senator has just given. I shall not fellow my leader in the matter of . this compromise if I can find any other course to pursue. If it is a step which I must take, . I shall take it . very reluctantly. . I should not have expressed my reluctance so strongly had not the Minister - naked and unashamed, as. it were - declared that on this item, and no doubt on very many others, he intended to abandon a request for a preferential duty. He does not care one straw about the trade from the Old Country, but whenever it suits him he will strike a blow at it. It is very , seldom that we get such a clear and frank admission from him as we did just now. , He has shown that when it comes to a question of fiscal politics, he does not care two. straws about assisting the trade of the Mother Country. </para>

I recognise that. the Minister is now making a proposition which accords with&#39; the general action of both Chambers in reference to United Kingdom preference. There has generally been . a difference of 5 per cent. In this ease the difference is 10 per cent. I am therefore willing, personally, to accept the compromise suggested, because it will bring the item into line with the rest of the Tariff.

                        <para>. - This is rather an important matter. I am certain that the request was made by the Senate under a misapprehension. The item as originally passed by another place provided for a duty of 3s. 4d. per cental on uncleaned rice, and of 6s. on cleaned rice. Those articles have a relative value, 100 lbs. of uncleaned rice would produce only 70 lbs. of cleaned rice. It would therefore take about 143 lbs. of uncleaned rice to produce 100 lbs. of cleaned rice. The duty on 10c lbs. of cleaned rice would consequently be equal to the duty on 143 lbs.&#39; of uncleaned rice at 3s. 4d. per cental, or 4s. 9d. If a man wanted to get 100 lbs. of cleaned rice, it would be necessary for him to pay duty to the extent of4s. 9d. In addition, the cost of cleaning the rice comes to1s. 3d. By. adding that to the 4s. 9d. we arrive at the &#39; duty of 6s. per cental which was proposed by the Government on cleaned rice. </para>

                        <para>-Yes. . It was scientifically adjusted in that way. If the Senate&#39;s request to reduce the duty on cleaned rice to  4s.  3d. were agreed to, the result would be that&#39; only cleaned rice  would be imported, and no cleaning would be done here at all. If cleaned rice could be imported for 4s. 3d. per 100 lbs., it is not likely that people would pay 4s.9d. in duty in order to import that amount of uncleaned rice which would produce 100 lbs. of cleaned rice,, and in addition, pay 1s. 3d. for the cost of cleaning it. The effect of the requested amendment would therefore be to completely disturb the adjustment of the duties and wipe out the rice-cleaning industry in Australia. I move - </para>

                    <para>.- The Minister has given a very strong reason why his motion should not be carried without at least some modification. I am willing to admit his contention that when the Committee arrived at its previous decision we were in some doubt as to how the figures would work out. But the honorable senator has shown that the proportion which uncleaned rice bears to cleaned rice is 100 to 70, and upon that proportion the duty upon the item we are now discussing should be 4s.9d. per cental to. represent a duty equivalent to that imposed on &#39;uncleaned rice. To that the Minister says that the Government add1s. &#34; 3d. per cental as the cost  of cleaning) which brings the duty up to 6s. That is tantamount, as the honorable senator admitted in reply to an interjection of mine, to a duty equal to the whole cost of labour in the industry. In submitting the Tariff in the first instance, the most that the Minister claimed for the protective policy was the imposition of a duty which would equalize the difference between the cost of labour here and elsewhere, with a little to spare. Now, the honorable senator goes much further, and proposes a duty equal to the whole cost of the labour employed in the industry,. I admit that we, made a mistake in dealing with this item on the last occasion, and should rectify it, but when the Minister asks us to impose a duty equal to the whole cost of labour involved in this industry he is asking us to do more than we ought to do. Whilst the honorable senator has said that the whole cost of the labour of cleaning amounts to is. 3d. per cental, he has said nothing with respect to the commercial value of the byproducts derived in the process of cleaning. They are utilized in connexion with the manufacture of starch, and represent a factor which&#39; should be taken into consideration. Though they are certainly worth, something, I discard them for the purpose of my argument, because .1 am not in a position to estimate their commercial value. If we impose a duty equal to one-half the cost of the labour involved in the industry, that will surely meet any difference between the cost of labour here and elsewhere. Half the cost of the labour would be 7jd. I am prepared to&#39; go a little further, and concede od., which would make the duty 5s. 6-1. per cental. That, in my opinion, would amply protect those who clean rice in Australia against any competition they might have to face from abroad. I move - </para>

                    <para>- That does not apply to the article we are now discussing. Honorable senators are aware that our request for a reduction of the duty at first submitted was carried by only one vote. I  have no doubt that honorable senators have received a circular in connexion with the proposed reduction of this duty from 6s. to 4s. 3d. per cental. It was evidently drawn up by those engaged in the industry, and it points out that the proposed reduction would absolutely ruin an industry established under the 1902 Tariff. It is stated that there are five rice mills in Sydney, one in Brisbane, one in Adelaide, and one in Fremantle, and all were brought into existence under the 1902 Tariff. _ It is pointed out also that, in connexion with the cleansing of rice, there is a loss involved of from 20 to 25 per cent., which is entirely lost sight of by those who support a reduction of the duty. I feel that it would he a very great injustice to this industry established under the 1902- Tariff, to reduce the protective duty imposed from 6s. to 4s. 3d. per cental. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> who reminds people of what was said on the hustings, seems to forget that the duty imposed under the 1902 Tariff on a portion of this item - ricemeal and flour - was only 4s.2d. per cental, and not, as he apparently supposes, 6s. per cental. When this item was previously under consideration, I particularly asked the Minister whether the  uncleaned rice imported was the rice known as &#34;paddy &#34; rice. I went so far as to suggest that the word &#34; paddy &#34; should be inserted in the item. When I voted for a certain &#39; reduction of the duty, I was- unr&#62;er the impression that the uncleaned rice imported was &#34;paddy&#34; rice, and that the very important byproduct obtained in Hulling the rice would add to the profits derived by those who hulled it in the Commonwealth. Since the matter was last under consideration I have made inquiries, and I find that the so-called uncleaned rice imported is really to a large extent cleaned rice, and that the cleaning process, carried out in the Commonwealth, is not so much the cleaning as the polishing of the rice. If I was misled when we were dealing with the matter when the item was previously before the Committee, I can at least plead that when I sought information from the Minister I was unable to get it. I have received several letters referring to the remarks I previously made on the question, and explaining that it would be absurd to describe this uncleaned rice as &#34; paddy&#34; rice, because, paddy rice is never imported. The rice is imported already hulled, and, therefore, those cleaning rice in the Commonwealth are deprived of the advantage of the important by-product obtained in hulling the rice. . .. </para>

                    <para>. - The original proposal was that the duty on unground spices should be  2d.  per lb., and that the duty on ground spices should be  4d. <inline font-style="italic">;</inline> the intention being to make the protection on the finished article  2d.  The Senate requested that unground spices should be made duty free. . The effect, would be not only to remove the protection on the raw material, but practically to put some  ^18,000  per annum into the pockets of the manufacturers who under ordinary circumstances were satisfied with a duty of  4d.  on ground spices. I do not think that that was the intention. I am well aware of what was intended by honorable senators .opposite, but they did hot succeed. They wanted to strike out the duty of  2d.  on unground spices and then reduce the duty on the manufactured article from  4d.  to  2d%  I. move -  </para>
