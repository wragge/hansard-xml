                        <para>- In regard to the conduct of business, the position of a Minister is entirely distinct from that of a private senator. The rule under which the Minister has the right to submit a motion for adjournment is one which for very obvious reasons obtains in all Parliaments. At the same time I recognise that another standing order provides that it is in order at any time for an honorable senator to move, without notice, that any resolution of the Senate be communicated by message to the House of Representatives. Although there is no doubt that it was not intended to be used in this particular way, still in view of its clear words, I am not prepared to rule that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> is out of order. If he desires to proceed with the motion I shall not prevent him from doing so. </para>

                        <para>- I was absolutely unaware of the facts mentioned in the honorable senator's question. I doubt very much if the Postmaster-General himself is aware that such a condition of things obtains. Under ordinary circumstances the arrangement made between the Postmaster-General's Department and contractors relates almost exclusively to the carriage of mails. Only in very exceptional circumstances are other provisions inserted in those contracts. If the honorable senator thinks that the Post and Telegraph Department can obviate the recurrence of such an unfortunate condition of things as is disclosed in his question, I shall be very happy to bring his representations before my honorable colleague. </para>

                            <para>Section 9 (b). No attempt was made either by the importer or the shippers, to describe the -spirit as " brandy." The age certificate, stating that the liquor had been matured in wood for two years, described it as spirits of wine, and it was bonded as spirits. It was charged duty as spirits (not brandy), and paid 14s. per proof gallon after having been re-gauged and re-tested on 17th August, 1908. </para>
                            <para>Section 11. A certificate, satisfactory to the Collector, was produced stating that the spirit had been matured by storage in wood for two years. </para>
                            <para>Section 13. The Analyst, after examination of the samples, stated that in his opinion they were spirits distilled from grape. </para>

                            <para>The liquor was imported on 26th November, 1907. As already stated under (2) the spirit was analyzed and the analysis disclosed no reason for refusing delivery. </para>
                            <para>The spirit when cleared from bond was of a strength of 28.7 over proof, and was contained in an octave, but the spirit seized was found to be only 22.7 under proof and was in bottles. It is evident from the Analyst's evidence in the police court that, after leaving the Customs' control, the spirit had been doctored and prepared to simulate brandy. </para>

                <para class="block">Honorable senators will be aware that it was mv intention to move the motion on Wednesday last. However, we saw fit to adjourn until to-day. Assuming that the motion would have been moved on Wednesday last, I contemplated a discussion occupying Wednesday and Thursday, and perhaps Friday, and intended that tomorrow, the 29th October, should be fixed as the day on which this exhaustive ballot should be taken. Honorable senators will be aware that the scheme proposed is that we should agree, by passing the motion I intend to submit, to proceed to the selection of a site. Assuming that the motion is carried by to-night, to-morrow night, or Friday afternoon, after a general discussion has taken place, it is contemplated that we should then fix a day for the exhaustive ballot, and that on that day it should be taken without debate. In the altered circumstances, I desire to amend the motion by fixing Thursday, 5th November, as the date for the taking of the exhaustive ballot. I think that will probably meet the convenience of honorable senators. I ask leave to so amend the motion. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators will be at liberty, should they see fit, to express an opinion on this matter, even though it should be contrary to the provisions of an Act of this Parliament now on the statute-book. The motion, if carried, can have no effect until it is embodied in an Act of Parliament. I think that the Vice-President of the Executive Council has proposed a 'very convenient way for obtaining the opinion of honorable senators as to whether some site other than Dalgety should be selected. I should like further to point out that the course now proposed has been followed in another place, for the express purpose of permitting honorable members to express an opinion at the  present  time as to a suitable site, in view of all the circumstances that have arisen. </para>

The question to be considered at the moment is whether it is desirable to proceed with the debate on the motion submitted bv the Vice-President of the Executive Council. If, in the opinion of honorable senators, it is desirable to do so, that course may be followed without detriment to the dignity or position of the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators are aware that under the terms of the Constitution, to which I shall have occasion to refer more fully later, it is within the power of the Federal Parliament, consisting as it does of both Chambers, together with  His Excellency  the Governor-General, to determine the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth. It is within the knowledge-01 honorable senators that a Bill was passed dealing with this subject. Honorable members in another place have taken an opportunity to reconsider their determination in regard to this matter. A particular process was resorted to, in order to secure a true expression of the opinion of the other branch of the Legislature. It is now thought desirable that, as this all-important matter has been reconsidered elsewhere, the Senate should be given an equal opportunity to reconsider its decision as to the selection of the Capital site. I think that we are all agreed that, recognising that New South Wales is entitled to have the Capital within her borders, we are loyally bound within a reasonable time to select a site, and thus redeem our pledge to the mother State. </para>

                        <para>- I do not care whether it was put first or last. In April. 1901, the matter was considered by the Federal Cabinet, and it was decided to ask the Government of New: South Wales whether it was prepared to offer any sites, and to see that Crown lands within suggested areas were reserved from alienation. In the same month, the New South Wales Government replied forwarding a copy of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver's</inline> report, offering the Federal Government a choice of the three sites mentioned bv him, and intimating that if any other site were considered more suitable it would endeavour, as far as possible, to meet their views. The reply also intimated that steps were being taken to prevent the alienation of Crown land within any of the three areas recommended by the Commissioner. It will be remembered by honorable senators that, in pursuance of the suggestion, the New South Wales Government reserved Crown lands in connexion with Southern Monaro, Yass, and Orange. Skipping various events which took place, in  1902  a resolution was passed by this Parliament that a Committee of experts 'be appointed to examine and report on sites in the following localities : - Albury, Armidale, Bombala, Lake George, Orange (including Bathurst and Lyndhurst), and Tumut. Accordingly, a Royal Commission, consisting of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kirkpatrick. Mr. Howitt, Mr. H.</inline> C. Stanley, and Mr. Graham Stewart, was appointed, and, in July,  1903,  their report was presented. It did not recommend any site, but simply dealt with the relative merits of the sites as regards water supply. Early in October,  1903,  the House of Representatives determined that Tumut should be the Seat of Government ; but, on the  15th,  the Senate substituted Bombala for Tumut. In  1903,  the services of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chesterman</inline> were obtained from the New South Wales Government to survey country around' the Bombala and Tumut sites respectively. In May and June,  1904,  reports were received from those surveyors and presented to Parliament. In September,  1904,  it passed the Seat of Government Bill, fixing Dalgety as the site, and defining the area of the Federal territory. In December,  1904,  the Premier of New South Wales forwarded copies of resolutions, passed by both Houses of its Legislature, to the following effect - </para>

                <para class="block">It has been suggested - and it is a suggestion with which I cannot agree - that what is meant is that the first process should be a grant of some territory to the Commonwealth by the State of New South Wales. After giving the matter fuller consideration than previously I had an opportunity of doing, I think that it simply means that the first thing which this Parliament should do is to determine where the Seat of Government shall be, and that ultimately it shall be within territory which we have secured either by grant or by acquisition. </para>

                <para class="block">The first procedure is to determine the Seat of Government - which we have already done - and next we are enjoined to secure by grant or acquisition territory within which the Seat of Government shall be. Practically the Seat of Government is the territory and <inline font-style="italic">vice versa.</inline> Finally comes the establishment of the Seat of Government in the territory which has been so acquired. The Seat of Government Act, 1904, provides that the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth shall be within 17 miles of Dalgety in the State of New South Wales; that the Federal Territory shall contain an area of not less than 900 square miles and shall have access to the sea, that is, to Twofold Bay. It also provides for the valuation of lands within the Federal Territory and the payment of compensation. It practically directs that the value of the land shall be its value as at and on the 1st January, 1904.Various legal questions have been raised and discussed, and ultimately some conferences have taken place between the Federal Attorney-General and the Attorney-General of New South Wales. The latter submitted to his Premier a version of what took place, and it was laid before the State Parliament on the 18th October, 1905. I may mention in passing that the advisability of submitting to the High Court certain legal questions as to the true interpretation of section 125 was discussed, but it was ultimately agreed that such a course was impracticable, as there were no means of submitting abstract questions of law for its decision. Amongst other things in his minute, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> said - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>As a result of the discussion, with the Federal Attorney-General, two points became clear : First, that it would be useless for this State to enter upon an action for trespass or to challenge the right of the Commonwealth to drive in a survey peg if that step were to be first sanctioned by Act of Parliament ; and secondly, that the Commonwealth had no authority to drive in a survey peg or exercise any act of ownership by virtue of the Seat of Government Act. In other words, confirmation was given to the repeated contention of this State that the Seat of Government Act was not a determination of the Seat of Government within the meaning of the Constitution. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">The contention was that the Seat of Government Act was a mere expression of opinion on our part, and that it did not authorize the Commonwealth to take any steps in the way of driving pegs into territory. But New South Wales subsequently conceded that if the Federal Parliament did determine that a survey should be made, that would be a proper authorization. But what I specially desire to emphasize in regard to this memorandum is that after discussing the differences of opinion in regard to the legal aspects of the question, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> went on to say - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Whichever view is correct is really immaterial at the present time, because both Governments seem now to agree that the next step is to define some area by metes and bounds, next to open negotiations for the grant, or acquisition of that territory, and, finally, when such territory becomes the property of the Commonwealth in terms of the Constitution, it will be necessary for Parliament by formal Act to determine the Seat of Government within that area. Under the circumstances, I pointed out to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Isaacs</inline> that this State had no concern or interest in the proposed Survey Bill. We could neither dissent nor consent to the proposed Bill; that inasmuch as the discussion had shown that the Seat of Government Act was not a determination by the Federal Parliament, they should take further steps as they thought fit, whilst this State would endeavour to conserve its rights under the Constitution. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>The fact that I wish to emphasize is that an agreement was practically arrived at that after the Act determining the Seat of Government had been passed in August, 1904, a Bill should be introduced delimiting the territory, and defining it by metes and bounds. Accordingly a Bill was prepared and submitted to the other Chamber which contained provisions regarding the requisite territory for the Seat of Government. That territory was described in the schedule to the measure, which schedule was prepared by two officers of the New South Wales Government. The territory within which the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth should be established was thereby determined. The measure also provided that private owners of land within that territory should hold their land from the Commonwealth, and not from New South Wales. It further proposed that until they had been superseded by Commonwealth laws the State laws should continue to operate in the territory, and that the land valuation provided for should be the valuation made as from 1st January, 1904. It also affirmed that access to the sea should be gained by the grant of a strip of territory within fifteen miles of the route described in schedule B. When that Bill was submitted to the other Chamber, it was decided that the question of the site of the future Seat of Government of the Commonwealth should be reconsidered, and as the result of an exhaustive ballot, with a view to obtaining a true expression of opinion in that connexion, the site known as Yass-Canberra was selected. So far as my honorable colleague and myself are concerned, I wish honorable senators distinctly to understand that whilst upon this question we are prepared to assist in obtaining a true expression of the opinion of honorable senators at every stage and upon every occasion, we intend to support the selection of Dalgety. I do not desire my own position to be misunderstood in any way. </para>

                        <para>- Every honorable senator is entitled to his own opinion upon this question. I hope that we shall endeavour to look at it from a national, and not from a State, stand-point. I am not going to reproach my honorable friend because he happens to think that one particular site is better than all others. But in common with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dugald</inline> Thomson I was under the impression that Dalgety had been finally chosen as the permanent Seat of Government. In the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid,</inline> I thought that the decision which we arrived at in that connexion was " final and mandatory, and binding on the Commonwealth and the State of New South Wales." </para>

                        <para>- If the Senate affirms that the site of the Federal Capital shall be altered - in other words, if both Houses- select some place other than Dalgety - the repeal of the Seat of Government Act must inevitably follow. But it would be idle to repeal its provisions until the views of both Chambers have been completely ascertained. I think that the most extraordinary and unfair contention has recently been set up in this connexion, namely, that the selection of Dalgety amounts to a breach of the constitutional compact between the Commonwealth and New South Wales. In other words, it has been urged that if that compact is to be honorably observed, the Seat of Government must be adjacent to the one hundred miles limit. Such a contention is absolutely unwarranted. It appears to have been founded upon some report of the Premiers' Conference of 1899, which has been unearthed. </para>

                <para>In connexion with that Bill a referendum was taken in New South Wales at which the 80,000 affirmative votes required to carry that measure were not secured. One branch of the New South Wales Legislature had previously urged that Sydney should be the Federal Capital. But ultimately a Conference of Premiers was convened in 1899, at which the clause that I have already quoted was amended to read - </para>

                    <para>It is considered that the fixing of the site of the Capital is a question which might well be left to the Parliament to decide; but in view of the strong expression of opinion in relation to this matter in New South Wales, the Premiers have modified the clause so that while the Capital cannot be fixed at Sydney or in ils neighbourhood, provision is made in the Constitution for its establishment in New South Wales at a reasonable distance from that city. Accordingly, the request of New South Wales that the Capital should be in that colony was granted, but with two conditions which Victoria insisted upon, t. That it should not be within 100 miles of Sydney, a. That the Parliament should sit in Melbourne until it met at the Seat of Government. </para>

                <para class="block">I have already pointed out that the Premiers themselves amended the clause to read - " That the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth shall be determined1 by the Parliament, and shall be within territory," &amp;c. It was slightly altered afterwards, when the Bill went before the Imperial Parliament, by the elimination of certain words. But this report is now quoted as a reason why the Seat of Government should be adjacent to the 100-mile limit, and it is suggested that there was a compact. To my mind, the report, read in conjunction with the clause as settled by the Premiers, could not fairly bear that construction. It means what it says, that Parliament should have uncontrolled and unlimited discretion and power to fix the .Seat of Government where it liked. That power was unqualified. It was " left within the power of Parliament, if Parliament in its discretion thought proper, to fix a site adjacent to the 100-mile limit. That, to my mind, is the meaning of the report. But, in addition to that, I point out that we have hardly any right at all to refer to preliminary negotiations or debates. The question is, what is the meaning of the section as settled by the Premiers, and as submitted to and approved by the people? It is not competent for Parliament to read into that section something that does not appear in it. </para>

                        <para>- Parliament has an unfettered discretion; and I submit that it would be a breach of faith to the people to evade the section as I have read it, and to attempt to read into it something that is not there. I also point out that the idea that the Seat of Government must be adjacent to the100-mile limit was never urged by New South Wales itself until after the Dalgety site was fixed. That is an ominous circumstance. If, as suggested, there was an understanding that the site should be adjacent to the100-mile limit, then, certainly, the Government and Parliament of New South Wales would have been acquainted with that circumstance. But never was it suggested or urged by them until after this Parliament had fixed upon Dalgety as the Seat of Government in the year 1904. </para>

                        <para>- Of course that cannot be disputed. Further, the idea that it could be disputed was never within the mind of the Government of New South Wales, or of the Parliament of that State, until after the action of this Parliament in 1904. The New South Wales Government reserved all Crown lands in the Southern Monaro district, as well as in other districts. I do hope that in regard to this really great national question we shall, as far as possible, eliminate State considerations. Under other circumstances there would have been competition between the States themselves to secure the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth within their territory. In that case the Commonwealth might readily have secured very generous treatment from the State in whose territory the Capital was located. Except for this provision in the Constitution we might have been iii the same position in regard to the selection of a site for the Capital as were the United States and Canada. But in this instance we are confined to the selection of a territory in New South Wales. Consequently we must loyally, within the terms of the Constitution, select a site for the Seat of Government with fair and reasonable expedition. In so doing, however, we must exercise an untrammelled discretion and do what is best in the interest, not of New South Wales, whose reasonable claims have a right to consideration, and will not be overlooked by the Senate, but of the Commonwealth. I hardly think that it is necessary to explain further the motion that I have submitted. The idea is to obtain a true expression of opinion on the part of the Senate. I understand that the  President  proposes to permit a general discussion of the merits of the various sites if honorable senators think that desirable. If the motion be adopted it will be competent for any honorable senator, supported by two others, to rise in his place and nominate any site. Those nominations having been made, we shall on the date fixed proceed, without any debate, to take the exhaustiveballot. </para>

                    <para>. - In the consideration of this important matter it has always appeared to me that there is one controlling: factor which we should do well to remember; and that is the factor of population, the flesh and blood of the community. This is a democratic country. We are supposed to be governed by what is best for the people. It is worth while, therefore, to consider the situation of the population of Australia. Some time ago I took the census returns for 1861, and found that in that year the latitude of the centre of population of Australia was in the neighbourhood of Albury. On the same basis I find from the census of 1901 that the latitude of the population of Australia is now a few miles south of Lyndhurst. This fact shows that the population centre of Australia has been marching northward at the rate of something like three miles per year ; and I have no doubt that in the course of another quarter of a century the latitude of the centre of population of Australia will be nearer to the New England district. On that basis I always advocated the Lyndhurst site. I thought that we could not get higher up - that Parliament was not prepared to select Armidale.  In fact I think that the Armidale district is shut out by the 100-mile limit. </para>

Seat of Government shall be in a certain neighborhood, and therefore I was prepared to accept Lyndhurst as a reasonable selection. But I cannot understand for a moment how, if honorable senators are prepared to settle this question in a reasonable way, with justice to the requirements of the population, they ,can go down to the remote corner of New South Wales represented by Dalgety. If honorable senators look at the map they will see that even part Of Victoria is north of the latitude of Dalgety, and of course the whole of the rest of Australia, barring the State of Tasmania, lies to the north. </para>

                        <para>- The whole of South Australia lies to the north of the latitude of Dalgety. I think that the question is simplified by the consideration of this fact. It is very easy for thirty-six gentlemen to have thirty-six views as to the site. We might spend an eternity in arguing the merits of various sites, and in canvassing what can be said in regard to water supply, accessibility, and various other considerations. But I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> in his concluding words, that we have to decide for the Commonwealth. I contend that New South Wales, in the position that she has taken up, has been fighting rather the battle of the Commonwealth than her own battle. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has referred to a bargain having been made. I have always said that there was no bargain, but certain words were put into the Constitution which were a recognition of the fact that, on the basis of population, the Capi-tal  of the Commonwealth must be in New South Wales. It is a curious thing that, such being the case, an arrangement should have been made by which the Capital is brought down to a  place  which is really nearer the centre of Victoria than the centre of New South Wales. I find that south of the thirty-third parallel of latitude, the latitude in which Newcastle and  Lyndhurst lie,  20 per cent, of the area of the Commonwealth is situated, and north of it no less than 80 per cent, of its area. Thus there is four times the area of land north of the latitude in which Newcastle lies as compared with the area south of it. It is clear from that where the greater growth of population must be in the future. Considering where the centre of population is to  day  it is quite evident that it must -move further north, and ultimately will be well up in the New England district. If New South Wales representatives were prepared to come as far south as Lyndhurst some time ago, and are now prepared to make a still greater concession by coming down to Yass-Canberra, it must be admitted that they are willing to give up a very great deal. Representatives of New South Wales, in agreeing to accept Yass-Canberra as a  Capi-  tal site, are, perhaps, open to blame at the hands of their friends from Queensland. I feel quite certain that Queenslanders have not yet recognised their interest in the selection of the Federal Capital site. Queensland is going to be a great, and populous State, and it is right that the people of that State should have fairly reasonable access to the Federal Capital. </para>

                        <para>- Queenslanders would have had reasonable access to the Capital if Lyndhurst had been selected. Owing to the fact that a vote has been taken elsewhere in favour of Yass-Canberra, I am somewhat reluctantly willing to vote for that site, but in doing so I make what I regard as a big concession. If there had been a majority in favour of one of the western sites, such as Lyndhurst, Canobolas, or Bathurst, I should have preferred to vote for it, just as under existing circumstances I am prepared to vote for a site <inline font-style="italic">to be selected</inline> in the Yass-Canberra district. </para>

                        <para>- I have no doubt at all that I am. The Conference of Premiers, held in 1899, passed a resolution in which they decided that the Capital must be at some reasonable distance from Sydney. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> was quite right when he said that the use of the words " reasonable distance" had been overlooked. It is singular that they should have been overlooked for so long, but it is; nevertheless, true that when the agreement was made the terms appeared in full in the newspapers throughout Australia, and were published in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Agc</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Argus.</inline> If honorable senators will turn up the files, as I did some time ago, they will find the agreement in those newspapers, and both recognise that at the Premier's Conference it was agreed that the Federal Capital was to be selected somewhere near Sydney, but not  within  100  miles of that city. </para>

But honorable senators are aware that it would be nonsense to suggest anything of the kind. They are well acquainted with the fact that the centre of population, and every important factor which should govern the settlement of this State question, witness to the fairness of the arrangement. It is based upon reason and truth, and it is on that we rest, rather than on the terms of section 125. </para>

                        <para>- It has been said that it is not fair to propose the Yass-Canberra district, because it really embraces several sites. But I direct attention to the fact that what is known as the Tumut site is really a district in which there are four sites that have been reported upon, namely, Batlow, Gadara, Wyangle, and  Toomorrn ma.  We have, therefore, a precedent for the selection of a district like Yass-Canberra, and there would really be no difficulty in finally deciding what' part of the Yass-Canberra district should be selected for the Capital city. If honorable senators cannot suggest  any  better means for the selection. I might suggest that it should be left to the Governor-General of Australia, the Governor of New South Wales, and the Prime Minister to select the exact site in the Yass-Canberra district. I may say, with regard to the necessity for access to a port, it has always seemed to be one, if not the, principal recommendation of the Dalgety site, and perhaps the only claim which has upheld it, that, if it were selected, there would be a possibility of access to the port of Twofold Bay. But that port cannot be compared with Jervis Bay. </para>

                <para>Senior PULSFORD.- I should like to direct the attention of honorable members to the position in the matter of railway communication. I have before me a map, showing the proposed Federal sites, with existing railways and probable new railways. Every one knows that a number of new railway lines will be constructed within a certain number of years. It might well be that our friends from South Australia will in time be able to go from their State to the Yass-Canberra district almost in a direct line from Morgan, <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Wentworth, Hay, and Junee. I have no doubt also that arrangements might be made by which Queenslanders would be able to reach the centre of New South Wales without passing through Sydney ; whilst our friends from the far West would be able to come right through <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Port Augusta. Everything seems to point to the extreme folly of honorable senators thinking for a moment that Dalgety would be a suitable site for the Federal Capital. I do not think it would suit  any  one. Another very important point is that in selecting the Capital site we should have due regard for the military position, and the readiness with which troops or ammunition might be sent from the Capital to the various States. Certainly Dalgety is not conveniently situated in this respect. Lyndhurst or Canobolas would be much more convenient, but, as I have said, I am prepared to make a still further concession, and come down as far south as Yass-Canberra, in order that this matter may be definitely settled. From a military point of view, Yass-Canberra is certainly more suitable than Dalgety would be. I have no intention to labour the matter, but it all rests upon the; question of  popu-1  lation - the population of to-day, and the probable population of coming years. We want to make some reasonable arrangement that will suit existing and coming wants. And when we do this, we shall find that we  are  in full agreement with the wishes of New South Wales, and the requirements of the Constitution. </para>

                        <para>- At great cost, members of this Parliament had travelled over large areas of New South Wales ; at great cost plans, maps, and reports had been supplied to us, and, of course, Crown lands had been reserved temporarily by the Government of New South Wales. Dalgety was selected without any bias by men representing various parts of the Commonwealth. It was a choice which, I contend, came within the terms of the Constitution, and which should have been observed, not only by the Parliament of the Commonwealth, but also by the State Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- That is, I think, a very unfair inference. No member of the Senate, not even a representative of New South Wales, is more anxious to see the Parliament removed from Melbourne than I am. I should be( equally anxious were we sitting in Sydney, because, I recognise that so long as this Parliament sits in a State capital, it will be subject to a State atmosphere, and will not do that justice to the- respective States which it would do if sitting in a Federal Capital. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that if we should be so fortunate as to be members of the Federal Parliament when the Capital is built, we will not be so comfortable as we are here,. Any one who is acquainted' with country life in Australia, and the slow growth of cities, must concede that point. We are not here to settle this question from the stand-point of our personal comfort, and I do not believe there is a single senator who looks at the question from that stand-point. I consider that the Parliament of 1904 was as well capable of coming to a choice) in this matter as is this- Parliament. The former was certainly better informed than is the latter. </para>

                        <para>- I did not mean any offence to new senators. It is simply through misfortune that they have not been able to visit all the sites. In 1904 there was a public discussion on the subject, and we came to a choice after having made a personal inspection of the sites, and been taken over them by men who understood the various peculiarities required in a capital city. At that time we were armed with full information, but during the intervening four years it has been gradually slipping from our recollections, and has only been re-read intermittently. In 1904 we were called upon to deal with a live subject. Equipped with complete information, we were shown over the sites in a most thorough manner, returned to Melbourne, and came to a decision - certainly quite free from conscious bias on my part. Dalgety may not be the most suitable site from the New South Wales standpoint, and it may be the most suitable site from the Victorian stand-point. But I conscientiously believed that I was casting a vote for the most suitable site from the Australian stand-point. Even in the light of additional information, and of opposing sites which have been brought forward since that occasion. I still think that we acted with sound judgment in selecting Dalgety. The movement which has led to the reopening of this question here is not an Australian movement. It had its foundation in parochialism, and its mainspring is in Sydney. Obviously, the desire is to so place the Federal Capital that the traffic in goods and passengers shall filter through Sydney. The prime movers recognise that whilst they cannot hope to have the Federal Parliament in Sydney, the nearer they can bring it to that city the more they will bring it within its environment and atmosphere, and derive the advantages which Melbourne has derived from the location of the Parliament here. One has only to deal with one Tariff to appreciate the immense advantage which it was to Melbourne to have its details settled here. </para>

                        <para>- Had this Parliament been sitting in Sydney when the Tariff was being considered, Sydney manufacturers would have derived a like advantage. I believe that this agitation to upset the choice of Dalgety by this Parliament is largely due to the belief on the part of certain persons that the nearer it is to Sydney the more it will be brought under its influence and within its atmosphere. It should be removed as far as possible from State influences. </para>

                <para>No analysis of the soil of this site appears to have been made, but a large proportion of the site is of granite, with some basaltic and slate formation. It is stated to be very fertile and of considerable depth, and to be capable of growing excellent crops of all cereals and most English fruits; 20 bushels of wheat to the acre, and sometimes much more had been obtained, also excellent crops of oats and potatoes. No exception can be taken in the matter of foundations for heavy buildings. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator has been to Dalgety, he should bc aware that within ten miles of it one finds both granite and basaltic formation. I am not sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell was conducted as I was beyond Dalgety to the basaltic formation, but at any rate it is there, and very rich land it is indeed. In my opinion it is capable of supporting an immense population. I' was reared in a country district, and know what good soil is. Recently, I returned from a visit to some of the choice portions of South Australia, but the valley of basaltic formation within ten miles of Dalgety contains land equal to anything which South Australia possesses - not a small patch, but an immense valley, extending for miles. </para>

                        <para>- They may have had a bad- season at Dalgety, but at the end of that great drought in 1902 Dalgety was the one corner in New South Wales where we saw green' grass and flowing rivers. The Murrumbidgee was really a series of stinking water-holes just connected with a trickle of water here and there. The only other spot in New South Wales where we saw green grass and water was Armidale, in New England - a site that is not even suggested in the Sydney press. At that time, Lake; George, which is a portion of the Yass-Canberra site, was simply a morass. In the deepest portion of that lake there were a few inches of filthy yellow mud. That was the state of the country when we visited it in 1902. </para>

                <para>It was exactly similar country to Northern Victoria, which was also suffering from a disastrous drought. But when we reached Dalgety we found the Snowy River flowing full, clear, and powerful, providing a beautiful supply of fresh water. We discovered that, bad as the rest of New South Wales was at that time, better feed could be obtained in the neighbourhood of Dalgety than in any other portion of the State, with the exception of Armidale. </para>

Under such circumstances, what could have been the state of the tributaries themselves? It is exceedingly unfortunate that, in this discussion, we are obliged to pit one site against half-a-dozen sites, which are spread oyer a very considerable area. When we admit that at 'Canberra a comparatively cheap water supply may be obtained, but say that the selection of that site would necessitate the building of the Capital upon what was once a swamp- </para>

But when I come to discuss the merits of that site, I find that I shall have to revise all my ideas in reference to water supply. I think it is generally admitted that the site at Canberra, in the centre of which stands a church, is altogether unsuitable for the erection of heavy buildings. Everybody acquainted with the first principles of building knows that a good foundation is a most important thing. Now, at Canberra there is quite 20 feet of alluvial soil. It is composed of waterworn pebbles- </para>

I know that whether this is so or not is all a matter of levels. It depends entirely upon the level in the centre of the valley and the level of the Cotter River. If the site be shifted from the valley to the hill, we at once destroy the basis of the water supply. </para>

                    <para>AH other south-western sites having been rejected, Goulburn and Yass alone remain for consideration and' comparison. In regard to water resources, if Goulburn had to be supplied by gravitation its position is rather low on the comparative list prepared by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blomfield,</inline> having been placed by him between Queanbeyan and Cootamundra. On the other hand, Yass, if supplied by  a  pumping scheme from the Mumimbidgee, has been assigned a somewhat similar position between Wagga Wagga and Junee; but, subsequently to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blomfield's</inline> inspection, it had been claimed in favour of Yass, that thu Micalong catchment can provide that site with an effective gravitation scheme ; but that scheme is, in consequence of length of pipe line and other circumstances, an expensive one - £270.000 for piping alone. The Upper Woolondilly has not been, it must be admitted, thoroughly ' examined for a gravitation supply for Goulburn ; but even if the water resources of Goulburn were equal or nearly equal to those of Yass - and neither are particularly promising - yet there are good reasons why the Yass site possesses more advantages than that of Goulburn, namely (1) Although Yass does not possess the altitude above sea level of Goulburn, the Yass climate is, on the whole, better than the Goulburn climate. </para>

                    <para>There are two possible sources of supply for the proposed Federal city site at Yass, namely, the Yass River and the Murrumbidgee River. In the Yass River the fall is so small that a gravitation scheme is out of the question, as, going high enough up to get the necessary head, so limits the catchment area that there would not be sufficient water for a large population. A supply could be obtained by storage and' pumping; but, as storage would be unnecessary in the Murrumbidgee, and the supply would be purer, it would be best to obtain the supply from the latter river. At Good Hope, a point of the Murrumbidgee River, about roi miles away from Yass, the river is about 540 feet below Yass, and at the Dog Trap Ford, about 22^ miles from Yass, the river is 310 feet below Yass. </para>

I then inspected the Micalong River, which enters the Goodradigbee River about five miles above Weejasper, and found a suitable supply. This river rises in precipitous granite country subject to heavy falls of snow during many months of the year; and what is known as the Micalong Swamp at its upper end seems to act as a reservoir, keeping up the flow for a long time after rainfalls. From statements made to me by Messrs. Jones and McBean, station holders, Messrs. Martin, Vaughan, Marzol, and others, small landowners, and Taylor, a working miner, as well as from discharges taken by myself, I consider that the least flow of this river during the driest years does not fall below 12 cubic feet per second, and at the time of my visit, after rain, the discharge was 2,000 cubic feet per second. The best off-take for a gravitation scheme would be on portion 20, parish of 'Weejasper, at an elevation of 500 feet above Yass township. </para>

                    <para>Since my previous report on the above subject I have again examined the Micalong River, which, on my previous visit, was in high flood, and the surrounding country difficult of access. The Federal city site, which was before fixed on the south side of Yass, has now been transferred to the plains along the railway line under Bowning Hill. From the point of view of water supply this is a better position, as, being lower than the other, a better head is available which will equal about 690 feet ; or, allowing 100 feet for the distributing reservoir, equals 590 feet available head. I have made further inquiries as to the flow in the Micalong Creek, and all the replies I received showed that it was permanent during the driest summer. In case, however, it is found necessary to store water at the head of the pipeline a good reservoir could be constructed. . . . A dam could be built in the narrow gorge which, with a height of sixty feet, would store about 500,000,000 gallons of water, equal to 403 days' supply for 40,000 people. </para>

                <para>In making this investigation I have adhered to these figures for purposes of comparison, but it may be pointed out that 50,000 is a large population to allow for the Federal Capital in the immediate future, and in considering an estimate for the cost of the water supply to such a population it should be borne in mind that the expenditure immediately necessary on the establishment of the Capital will be very much less, probably only a fraction of the total. </para>

                    <para>The catchment above this dam site is no square miles, and the average daily flow of the river amounts to 59,000,000 gallons, or twelve times the 5,000,000 gallons required for the city supply. Taking the period of twelve years for 1895 to 1906, the only occasion on which the daily flow of the river failed to supply 5,000,000 gallons was for the months of February, April, and May- in I002, when a shortage of 4,000,000 gallons occurred. To compensate for such possible shortage, I have introduced a storage of 653,000,000 gallons. From this storage reservoir it is proposed to convey the water by a steel main 27 inches in diameter, and approximately 45 miles in length to the service reservoir at Canberra city. This main is the weak point in the scheme. Its length and the difficult nature of the country traversed making it a heavy charge against capital, while on account of the nature of the material its renewal in a comparatively short period, say, twenty -five years, must be allowed for. </para>

Assuming that the Federal Capital has a total population of 50,000, that would mean a levy of £1 per annum for every resident - man, woman, and child - to meet the interest on the capital involved in the gravitation scheme. It  would  be the costliest water scheme in the world. I venture to say it would be more costly than the Kalgoorlie water scheme. I have referred to the estimates of cost apart from maintenance, the amount involved in interest on capital and redemption of the necessary loan. I quote' further from the report - </para>

It is proposed to erect at the dam pumps capable of lifting 5,830,670 gallons per day, six days a week, through a main 27 inches in diameter, and 3^ miles in length, to an auxiliary service reservoir situated at level 2,100, whence the water will gravitate to the surface reservoir adjacent to the Capital at level 2,050 through a main 27 inches diameter and 7^ miles in length. Each of the service reservoirs will have <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> capacity of 5,000,000 gallons. . . .

                <para>I point out that this again assumes that we shall select the very lowest spot for the Capital. Every foot higher we went would mean an increased charge for pumping, as it would involve more costly machinery, and an increased annual charge for upkeep. I ask honorable senators to bear in mind that these estimates are only of value on the assumption that we select the swamp for the site of the Capital city. If we went out of the swamp and decided to build on Mount Ainslie, we might throw all these estimates into the waste-paper basket. </para>

                    <para>During the limited time that I had for my investigation, I saw only one spot where the Colter River opened out, giving an opportunity to making a fairly capacious storage reservoir. This site fortunately is at a sufficient elevation, and has been selected for the storage reservoir. At the lower end of this valley, known locally as the "top flats," a hard granite bar has withstood the erosion of the water hence the flats. A concrete dam could be erected at a reasonable outlay on this impermeable formation to retain sufficient water to guarantee the required supply for the proposed city. . . The supply would be by gravitation, and the head obtained at the storage reservoir is sufficient to fill a service reservoir located at a suitable elevation above the city. Length of pipe main will be about 24 miles. </para>
                    <para>The general height of the proposed city site, as a result of aneroid readings, is taken at 1,906 feet above sea level. The service reservoir at 2,130 feet, and the storage reservoir site at 2,370 feet, giving a total fall of 464 feet for gravitation purposes. </para>

                        <para>- I intend to deal with the report in my own way, referring to one paragraph at a time. I say that on the evidence of the report by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. de</inline> Burgh himself, from which I have already quoted, almost the whole of the water to which he refers in this latest report is absolutely beyond the reach of the Federal Capital sites we are being asked to consider. It. could only be brought to those  sites by means of very costly gravitation schemes, as in the case of Yass and Canberra, or by  costly  pumping schemes, which in the case of Yass would require to raise the water 600 feet, and a considerable height in the case of Canberra. To speak of the Murrumbidgee as being available, is simply to say something that is not a fact. It is, of course, available, but at a price which would be entirely prohibitive, and which would put it beyond all practical consideration. In the next paragraph, to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has directed my attention- </para>

Those  are not words which I have put into his mouth, but they are in print. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> shakes his head, but if he will refer to the report, he will find that, after stating that it would cost £873.000, the writer says : " On consideration I have rejected this scheme in favour of the following." He proceeds to refer to a pumping scheme, which is estimated to cost £339&gt;°°°, but, evidently thinking that it would be too costly, he assumed that the Commonwealth would need to supply only 10,000 persons. He goes on to deal with a third pumping scheme for a population of that number, which is to cost £185,000. He has endeavoured to throw dust in our eyes. He says, " This magnificent supply of pure water, which so few cities in the world have available, is too costly, and I propose pumping schemes." One of them is co supply - how many persons? - 10,000 persons. Further on he says - </para>

                    <para>When, however, we come to consider the sites in the vicinity of the town of Yass, which are marked Nos. 1, 2, and H, it might be advisable to consider the construction of works upon the Goodradigbee River or the Micalong Creek, for comparison with the supply from the Cotter. As I have already pointed out, the discharge of the Goodradigbee exceeds that of the Cotter, and its catchment area above the Micalong Creek amounts to 317 square miles. The water is of magnificent quality, similar to the Cotter. The information at our disposal at present is not sufficient to enable me to submit any comparative estimates, and, indeed, with regard to the whole of these sites, such estimates can only be prepared when the exact location of the city is indicated ; but, speaking generally, having regard to the compact water-shed of the Cotter., and its eminent suitability as a water supply for a city, it would appear that, viewed from the stand-point of water supply alone, the nearer the site of the city fs to the junction of the Cotter River and the Mumimbidgee the more convenient will be its situation with regard to water supply, and the lower will be the cost of such supply. </para>

                <para class="block">Therefore, on the authority of this gentleman, the farther we go from Canberra in the direction of Yass, the more unsuitable is the water supply. If my criticism against Canberra is sound, the other sites can be left out of consideration, because, on the statement of this gentleman, who evidently was trying to make out the best case he could for Canberra, the farther we go away from it, the more shall we decrease the water supply.

Any one who has been*  to Canberra knows that whilst there is a supply of good soil at Canberra itself the outside country is rugged and mountainous. If the honorable senator will glance at the map he will see that the site will comprise all the good land of the locality, because it is surrounded by low hills in the immediate vicinity, and bv mountains in the distance. But when we take out the site at Dalgety  Ave  have not touched the good land. We have only taken good building land, and there we can get a perfect water supply at a cheap price and capable of yielding a magnificent supply of electric power. In the basaltic country at the back of Dalgety there is some of the best land to be found in New South Wales, and it is favoured with a certain rainfall and enjoys good seasons. Honorable senators may inquire why more farming has not been carried on in the Monaro district. </para>

                        <para>- It is owing partly to land monopoly, but chiefly to the influence of Sydney, whose people were determined not to open up Twofold Bay by means of a railway, and thus give the people of the Monaro district an opportunity to use their natural outlet. On the contrary, they preferred to run a railway parallel with the coast for a distance of 200 miles to Cooma, in order to compel the farmers to send their produce not to the nearest port, whence it could be shipped to other countries,, but by the railway to Sydney. Any  one  who has been through the district knows that even if the best land were made available for farming it would not pay a man to send his produce by railway to Sydney. </para>

                        <para>- That is, I venture to say, a very serious matter, considering that wheat is often worth only 2s. 6d. per bushel. It represents 20 per cent, on the value. I do not believe that the bulk of the farmers in South Australia have to pay at that rate for the carriage of their wheat. The honorable senator  has lived  in a northern district of that State, and he knows that if the farmers had been compelled to send their wheat to Adelaide more sheep would have been grown and less wheat. It was because the Government ran railways to the nearest port that wheat-growing has been developed to such a large extent. I guarantee that my honorable friend never sent his wheat to Adelaide. I will guarantee that he sent his wheat to Port Pirie, the nearest point. What would he have thought of the South Australian Government if he had been compelled, by reason of their railway  policy,  to send his wheat from near Port Augusta to Adelaide, notwithstanding that there are ports within a few miles of his farm which the Government refused to open up? </para>

                        <para>- But she could have constructed a railway from the Monaro district to Twofold  Bay  more cheaply than she could have built a line from that district to Sydney. The Government of that State embraced the dearest proposition in order that they might still further concentrate trade in Sydney. Personally, I hold that we have  already  determined the site of the permanent Seat of Government, apart altogether from parochial considerations. We selected what we deemed to be the best site in the interests of Australia, and I appeal to the Senate to recognise that, in securing a settlement of this Question, we must not bow to any "State. We have the interests of the Commonwealth to consider. I desire the speedy settlement of the question in order that we may be removed from undue parochial and State influences. Looking at it from that stand-point, I hold that Dalgety possesses immense advantages as against Canberra, whilst Canberra possesses no advantages whatever as against Dalgety. I hope that the Senate will be true to its former decision, and that it will back up the Government in insisting upon its choice  being  respected. </para>

But at the time the Seat of Government Bill was under consideration every honorable member was fully armed. Nobody voted in ignorance or from parochial bias. Having arrived at its choice I maintain that the Australian Parliament should insist upon its choice being respected. </para>

                    <para>. - I was one of those who supported the selection of Tumut, and if that site had any chance of being chosen, as the future Seat of Government by this Parliament, I should still advocate its claims. But in view of what has taken place elsewhere I cannot fail to recognise that by so doing I should simply be throwing away my vote. To me it is quite apparent that the choice of this Parliament lies between Dalgety and Yass-Canberra. </para>

If that be a reason why Dalgety should be chosen as the permanent Seat of Government I desire to say that Canberra possesses a very much better port - a port boasting a greater depth of water, and one which will afford more protection to shipping. I hold in my hand a plan, which can be laid on the table of the Senate, and which shows <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> relative sizes of Twofold Bay and Jervis Bay.

                    <para>- We have as much guarantee in the one case as we have in the other. I may perhaps be permitted to tell the Senate the history of the provision in the Constitution relating to the establishment of the Seat of Government in New South Wales. At the Adelaide Convention, I was the first to suggest that the Federal Capital should be located in Federal territory. The leader of the Convention, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr., now Sir Edmund,</inline> Barton, opposed that suggestion, with the result that it was not pressed at that gathering. But when the Convention met at Melbourne, I took advantage of the opportunity to confer privately with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner upon this matter.  I said to him, <inline font-style="italic">"T</inline> recognise that you are an honest  federationist,  and I can assure you that unless the Constitution Bill stipulates that the Federal Capital shall be established in Federal territory there is very little chance of it being acceptable to the people of New South Wales. You have such influence with the Convention that I feel sure that if you will submit a proposal of that character it will be carried, and I believe that the Constitution will then be accepted by the people of New South Wales." Accordingly <inline font-weight="bold">Sir</inline></para>
                </talk.start></continue><para class="block">George Turner submitted a proposition to that effect, and it was carried. It is only just to him to say that he recognised that the Federal Capital should be located in Federal territory. When the Premiers of the States subsequently met in Conference they decided that the Seat of Government should be located in New South Wales, and upon the strength of that provision the Constitution was accepted by the electors  of  that State, as well as by the other States. I say emphatically that if we establish the Federal Capital in the extreme south-east of New South Wales, whilst we may be honouring the letter of the compact, we shall certainly not be observing its spirit. Let us act honorably in this matter. New South Wales is generous. She is prepared to give to the Commonwealth a larger area than it was at first thought that we were entitled to have. She is the most populous State and also the mother State. She has therefore a right to be considered. The climate of Dalgety has been alluded to. In winter time it is a very trying climate indeed. Personally. I come from a cold country, and I dare say that I could stand it. But is it reasonable to expect men who come from North Queensland and other hot parts of Australia to live in such a trying climate as that of Dalgety in the winter time? I do not think that there has been any jealousy on the part of New South Wales with regard to the Monaro district. It is not true that attempts have been made to prevent that locality from going ahead. But it has to be remembered that the size of the population did not justify the State in going to -the expense of constructing a railway, which would necessarily be a very heavy work. The newspapers have been referring to this subject during the last week or two, and we are now called upon as a Senate to take a national view of it. A site has been chosen by another place. If we agree to accept that selection, the question will probably be settled. If, however, we disagree, it will be hung up for a long time. I propose now to read a leading article from a Victorian newspaper called <inline font-style="italic">Advance Australia.</inline> I understand that it is the organ of the Australian Natives' Association. I was very pleased when I read it, to think that there is in Victoria a newspaper which has the courage to write as this journal has done, especially when we remember that the Prime Minister is one of the most prominent members of the Association. The article says - </para><para>The selection by the House of Representatives of the district in New. South Wales known as Yass-Canberra as the most appropriate place for the national capital must appeal to all who recognise the important bearing which water conservation and irrigation have in Australia's destiny. Australia's root problem is water, population, population, water. Where there is water in Australia, settlement follows. </para><interjection>

                    <para>. - I do not know that it is necessary to say much, because the whole matter was considered in  1904,  when we had an opportunity of hearing all the arguments that could be brought forward. I see no reason why the decision then arrived at should be altered. The action that has been taken, with a view of altering it, has strengthened me in my determination to stand out. If it was necessary to ask Parliament to change its mind, I cannot, for the life of me, understand the procedure adopted. There is an Act of Parliament upon the statute- book, and I should have thought that the proper procedure would be to repeal that Act before proceeding; to choose another site. </para>

                        <para>- It can do so; but there is a regular method of procedure. The proper method is to repeal an Act in which Parliament does not believe, and to substitute another Act in its place. Why has not that procedure been adopted on the present occasion? A question has been raised as to the suitability of the port at Dalgety as compared with that available in connexion with the Yass-Canberra site. It is, at all events, admitted that Dalgety is closer to the sea than is any site that could <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> obtained in the Yass-Canberra neighbourhood. As far as relates to the capabilities of the two ports, I may quote from the sailing directions compiled by Captain Charles Yuel, R.N., for the Admiralty. Writing in relation to Jervis Bay, he says - </para>

                    <para>Outside Jervis Bay, and along the coast to the northward as far as Beecroft Head, a heavy confused sea will be experienced during even moderately bad weather and perhaps along the shores of the whole province there is no place where greater care is required in managing small vessels in bad weather than in the vicinity of this steep peninsula, in consequence of the agitated state of the sea, which may be attributed to the current out of Shoalhaven Bight meeting at Beecroft Head, another branch of the stream in a disturbed state from interruption whilst crossing Young Banks, and the currents being so much stronger near projecting headlands than elsewhere. </para>

But experience has shown that Darling Road is the preferable of the two. ... A sandspit with two fathoms water on it projects half a mile north-westward from the eastern part of the bay. . . . The whole of the west side of the bay is exposed to the heavy swell thrown in by south-east gales, and is, consequently, unsafe for an anchorage; the sea breaking on it may be heard at a considerable distance. </para>

I am prepared to admit that Jervis Bay, as compared with Twofold' Bay, encloses a bigger area of water. I can say that, after battling outside in bad weather in a leaky ship, I was glad to run into Twofold Bay for shelter, and got shelter there from one of the strongest gales I ever experienced on the Australian coast.

I have read enough to show that there is just as good, if not better, harbor to be found at Twofold Bay as at Jervis Bay. I think that every honorable senator has made up his mind on this question. We had a very full discussion of it before. I regard it from a national stand-point. Honorable senators are aware of the jealousy and rivalry that exist between Victoria and New South Wales. I have no doubt that in the near future we shall have to launch forth upon a ship-building policy, and unless we can establish a ship-building yard in a Commonwealth port, I have no doubt that we will be called upon to establish duplicate yards in Melbourne and in Sydney. We shall require not only to duplicate the whole plant and machinery necessary, but the management also. Even the building in New South Wales of our only ship, the trawler, has excited this State jealousy, which is likely to lead to a good deal of unnecessary expenditure in the future. If we could establish shipbuilding yards in our own territory, we should be at the expense of only one establishment. </para>

                        <para>- I shall vote for what I believe to be the best as I suppose the honorable senator will do. I find that when I trench upon matters the honorable senator does not like, his interruptions become very frequent. This question should be settled from a democratic and population point of view, and since it was previously discussed politics in New South Wales and Queensland have developed in a remarkable way. </para>

                <para class="block">Population is drifting in that direction. If there is one thing which a man can confidently predict more than another in regard to Queensland, it is that its population will also spread south and west and north. The great railway policy of that State will be to connect four trunk lines, and, happily for ourselves, our population is spreading in those directions. Apart from party politics, it is quite clear that the guiding principle for the development of Queensland will be the linking up of those four great lines. The development of the Northern Territory will depend upon the carrying out of that policy. The provision of that railway communication will be the means of opening up some of the richest districts in Australia-, and a reasonable inference is that its population will increase mainly in the direction which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> has pointed out. A. glimpse at the development of New South Wales and Queensland shows that that is where the density of population will he in half a century. To settle the question of the Capital site in relation to the development of the population of Australia, that factor must be considered. Suppose that Australia progresses in the future at anything like the rate at which it has progressed in the past, especially in those districts, it will be seen at once that a railway line is bound to pass through the continent, in the first instance, as I have indicated. Therefore, if the location of the Capital site has to be considered from the point of view of population, and from the national point of view, that factor has to be taken into consideration. Now, can it be said that Dalgety would be either central or convenient for the rest of Australia, especially in the near future? In comparison with a site fixed in relation to the circumstances I have pointed out. I have good ground for saying that if it were not for the fact that the Federation is supposed, by a large number of persons, to consist mainly of Victoria, Dalgety could not be considered from the national point of view, or the other point of view I have mentioned. It is situated at the extreme south-east corner of Australia. From a harbor stand-point, it may possess very great attractions indeed. I do not desire to enter into that question, but if the fixing of the Capital site is to be considered in relation to centrality and the development of population, then, from the national point of view, Dalgety is completely out of the running. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that the honorable senator will be able to point out why, in the vast area  1  have suggested, we cannot select a site which, from every point of view, may not be as suitable for the requirements of the Commonwealth as is Dalgety, in the south-east corner. The claims of Dalgety are, I believe, based largely on the fact that it is accessible from a port, which is one of the essential requirements of a Federal Capital. </para>

                        <para>- Well, one of the claims, and a fairly strong claim, of Dalgety is that the Federal Territory could have a very convenient and suitable port at Twofold Bay. I hold the opinion that a port is not necessary for a Federal territory ; in fact, it may be a disadvantage from many stand-points. Let me cite a historical incident in support of my view. When, in, I think, 1812, America was disputing the supremacy of Great Britain on the sea, the latter quickly put an end to the contest by getting into Washington and burning the Capital. So while a port for a Federal territory has some advantages from a political point of view, and very many drawbacks in the event of war, I regard it as being rather an impediment to the development of its government. I dismiss entirely from my mind the weight which some honorable senators attach to that point. For the purpose of safety, integrity, and carrying on the operations of the Federal Government in emergencies, especially in times of war, I think it will be an advantage in many respects that the Federal Territory should be removed as far as possible from the danger of attack by an enemy. I think that it is regretted by Americans that a Federal territory so close to the sea as Columbia was selected for the United States. When; during the presidency of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cleveland,</inline> relations were strained with regard to some arrangements in Venezuela, people were talking in the United States and Great Britain about the possibility of war between those two great Empires. When the question of war arose, and some very smart passages had been exchanged between the nations, it was a significant factor, in deciding that the quarrel should be settled amicably, that the United States could not, for twenty-four hours, stop the British from getting into Washington or New York. When that was pointed out to people in the United States, and what I might call the yellow journalistic politicians, a demand was quickly made that the question in dispute should be referred to arbitration. In all these matters we have to anticipate the future. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly, and may I remind the honorable senator that there was a range of mountains protecting Washington and Richmond, but that, nevertheless, the northerners were not long in getting into the latter place. If Twofold Bay were captured by a battleship or stray cruisers, the Commonwealth Government, located at Dalgety, would be in a very perilous position. I feel quite certain that all these points have not been carefully considered by those who have strongly recommended that site. </para>

                        <para>- If that is the case, it is an objection, from the point of view I have mentioned. I shall give my vote, with some regret, in favour of the Yass-Canberra site, because it is impossible for us at this stage to get a site at a point which, if my views are correct, would be the best in the interests of Australia. I believe that if one single choice had to be made, some, if not all, of the representatives of Queensland would favour a site close to Armidale. If a proposition to that effect is submitted, I shall have no hesitation in voting for it. Possibly I may be influenced by the provincial point of view, but if I am taunted with being provincial my retort will be that every member of </para>

                <para class="block">Parliament is necessarily more or less influenced or biased in that way. In view of the considerations I have suggested, and the potentialities of the future, I regard Armidale as an ideal site for a Federal Capital. But if I cannot get a site near that city, I shall be justified in voting for a site which will bring the Federal Capital as near as possible to that very rich and suitable district. Within 150 or 200 miles of Armidale we have on the north the finest and largest territory in the Commonwealth - the Darling Downs of Queensland - and immediately to the south we, have a very rich agricultural district. So that on the eastern side of Australia, and in those districts which, in point of population and wealth, are increasing more rapidly than are any portions of Victoria, South Australia,  or Western Australia, we have several central towns, and every indication that the great backbone of the stability of the Commonwealth is going to be centred close up to the New England district. Comparatively speaking, if I may be permitted to use the metaphor, Armidale is within a stone's throw of our Darling Downs. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator has made that statement after travelling through the country, I can say with the prophet that he " hath eyes and seeth not, and he hath ears and heareth not." That is the richest district in the two great States of Australia Within the past ten years, the population of the Darling Downs has been increased by 100,000 of the sturdiest settlers to be found in Australia. No other district which I have visited in Queensland, New South Wales, or Victoria, has made; such material and rapid progress. Every honorable senator, I think, will admit that from an agricultural stand-point it is destined to become the garden and granary of Australia. These facts constitute a powerful reason why we should establish the Federal Capital' there, or thereabouts. To my mind, the battle of the sites is one which is more or less a discredit to the Commonwealth. Rightly or wrongly, I interpret section 125 of the Constitution to mean that, owing to the jealousy which existed between Victoria and New South Wales, it was impossible to make either Melbourne or Sydney the permanent Seat of Government. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators will pardon me for emphasizing the important part, from a national standpoint, which the development' of Queensland and New South Wales ought to play in our selection of a Federal Capital. As evidencing the progress which has been made in the district to which I have referred, I intend to quote) some figures, for which I am indebted to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford.</inline> They bear out my contention to the very letter, and, as a representative of Queensland, I make no apology for dwelling upon their importance. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> has already pointed out that ever since i860 the population of the district in question has steadily increased. From the Budget, I gather that between 1900 and 1908 there was a proportionate decrease in the population of Victoria of 2. 11 per cent. That is to say that whilst on the 30th June, 1900, 31.85 per cent, of the population of Australia was settled in Victoria, on 31st December, ' 1907, that proportion- had declined to 29.74 per cent., a decrease of 2. 11 per cent, during the brief space of seven and a half years, whilst it is estimated that by the 31st December, 1908, the proportion will have further declined to 26.69 Per cent., a decrease of 2.16 per cent. On the other hand, whilst on the 30th June, 1900, 49.23 per cent, of the population of Australia was settled in New South Wales and Queensland, the estimate for the 3) st December, 1908, is 50.42 per cent., an increase of 1.19 per cent. These figures confirm all that I have contended in respect of the tendency of population to centralize itself in one of the richest districts in Australia. Whilst the estimated increase in the population of Victoria for the same period is only 76,933, that of Queensland and New South Wales is 512,635, or, approximately, fourfold. If there is anything more than cant and hypocrisy implied in the word "national," these facts should claim the earnest attention of honorable senators. </para>

                        <para>- Then what will happen to us at Dalgety ? I haVe visited Armidale and the adjacent towns, and I know that during the winter they enjoy one of the most bracing climates to be found in Australia, and possibly on God's earth. I am aware that the reasons which I have advanced against the selection of Dalgety apply with almost equal force to the choice of Yass-Canberra. But there is a very strong reason why I differentiate between the two places. If I have read the history of this pitiable fight aright, the Government of New South Wales, and the people of that State, will resist the selection of Dalgety by this Parliament by every constitutional means in their power. </para>

                        <para>- There is no doubt that, under the Constitution, the people of New South Wales are the donors of the Federal Territory. In using the word " acquired," in the way that he did, for the purpose of influencing us in our selection of the permanent Seat of Government, the Vice-President of the Executive Council was merely pursuing a willo'thewisp. We cannot acquire that territory without the consent of New South Wales. We must remember that that State has to be the donor. </para>

                        <para>- That remark emphasizes my point, that New South Wales will be the donor of the territory, and so much as is Crown land will be a free gift to the Commonwealth. New South Wales will also facilitate the acquisition by the Commonwealth of such areas of freehold and leasehold land as are not now held by the Crown. Remembering that fact it is our duty to listen respectfully to what the Mother State has to say. That is the reason which influences rae. notwithstanding that, in some respects, there may not be much difference between the two possible sites. I have long held the opinion that the sooner the Federal Government gets into its own territory the sooner we shall realize what I may call the true Federal spirit. Cant about the matter as we may, or disguise the fact as much as we like. Parliament is very much under the whip of the press. It is certainly strongly influenced by newspaper criticism. It would be mere cant to profess that our judgment is not often affected by the writing of the press upon public affairs. If we were meeting in Sydney there is not the slightest doubt that the same remark would apply. </para>

                <para class="block">The State press is naturally strongly biased by State considerations, which it is 'the duty of the newspapers of a State to conserve, and it is almost impossible for members of the Federal Parliament, sitting for the time being in any one State, to be uninfluenced by purely local considerations. When we consider the great Federal questions awaiting solution, it will be recognised that it will be of immense advantage to us to have a territory of our own, however small and humble the beginnings of the Capital may be, in which we may develop a truly national Australian spirit. The discussion of this question has always involved points relating to the interpretation of the section under which the selection of the Capital site must be determined. During the speech of the Vice-President of the Executive Council I asked him whether he interpreted the words as to the  100  miles limit, as meaning that the Federal Government was free to select any portion of New South Wales outside the prescribed area. He answered  Yes." The honorable senator holds that the Federal Government is free to select an area in any part of New South Wales. My answer is that if that had been the intention of the Constitution it was remarkably easy for those who drafted it to find a few simple English words in which to express the meaning that the Federal Government might select an area anywhere in New South Wales outside the  100  miles limit. It is a matter of history that, in  1899,  when the Premiers met to settle the final draft of the Constitution it was understood that the  100  miles limit was fixed as a guide. It was also understood amongst the Premiers and by the people of New South Wales that what was meant was that the Capital area should be within a reasonable distance of Sydney outside the limit mentioned. I do not think that there is any honorable senator who will say that the words " reasonable distance " in connexion with the  100  miles provision means " anywhere " in New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that: but I think that the Premiers intended that the spirit of the Constitution should be observed. It was well known that New South Wales would stand outside the Federation unless there was a clear understanding as to the location of the Federal Capital. In my opinion, it is not logical to contend that the words " reasonable distance" must not be read in conjunction with the words as to the  100-miles  limit, in interpreting the spirit of the Constitution. The Premiers themselves understood it to mean that in choosing the site, we were to go as nearly as the Constitution would permit to the prescribed distance from Sydney. With all respect to the Vice-President of the Executive Council, I say that it smacks somewhat of unwarrantable audacity to put any other meaning upon the section, if we are to attach any significance to the agreement arrived at by the Premiers. The intention is further evidenced by the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> went to New South Wales after the Constitution was drafted, and incurred some amount of odium, because it was held that he had left the Capital site question too open. At the first referendum, New South Wales did not decide to enter the Federation. </para>

                        <para>- I do not believe in using such expressions about public men. I believe in giving every man credit for good faith and sincerity concerning what he says either inside or outside Parliament. Considering the question from an historical point of view, I say that New South Wales would never have entered the Federation except for the understanding that the Capital would be in that State. Without New South Wales, Federation would have been synonymous with a farce. I believe that if the people of Victoria had had the question put to them, removed from party or political passion and prejudice, that there was an understanding that the Capital should be fixed somewhere as nearly as possible to the 1:00-miles limit, they would have acquiesced. If we eliminate party prejudice, I do not believe that the people in the two great centres of population in the Commonwealth care very much how far from, or how near, the Federal Capital site may be to either. I believe that the people of Victoria, if the question were put to them as a mere abstract question, would say that we should observe the intention of the understanding arrived at between the Premiers, and on the strength of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> brought New South Wales into the Federation. </para>

                        <para>- With that qualification, there is not much difference of opinion between the honorable senator and myself, but I think that a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> interpretation of that section of the Constitution lies in the direction I have indicated rather than in that indicated by the honorable senator. There is an opinion entertained by many of the people, and by some of the leading politicians in Australia, that it would be better, for some time to come, to defer the selection of the Capital site. lt is suggested that the Seat of Government should be permitted to remain in Melbourne for ten years, and should afterwards be removed for ten years to Sydney ; that by that time many doubtful factors will have been determined, and, in the light of the experience gained, we shall be better able to select a site for the Federal Capital. * The answer to that suggestion is that, under the Constitution, even though a referendum were arranged for its amendment, there is no possible chance of ever having the Federal Capital established either in Sydney or in Melbourne. The reason, of course, is that the territory must belong to the Commonwealth. The site of the Capital and the territory surrounding it must be absolutely our own property. We must be established there as masters, without the slightest possibility of interference by the authorities of any State. Again, it is not imaginable that any State would be prepared to give its capital as part of the Federal territory. It is not thinkable that Victoria would hand over to the Commonwealth 100 square miles, of which Melbourne would form a part. The people would not entertain such a proposition, nor would such a proposition in respect of Sydney be entertained by the people of New South Wales. Again, where should we find the money which would be necessary to pay for the- private properties held in a great city like Sydney or Melbourne ? </para>

                        <para>- By that excursion I intended to show that the establishment of the Federal Capital in Sydney or Melbourne is unthinkable, and certainly unarguable. We must select some site where we can secure territory at a reasonable figure. Of course, we hope to get a portion of the territory from New South Wales as a free gift. In the circumstances, an inland Capital, or, if honorable members please, a bush Capital, with all its real or imaginary inconveniences is, to my mind, an inevitable corollary of the Constitution. I regard the centralization of , our great public Departments, our great High Court, and the possession of some territory absolutely our own, as essential factors in the development of a Federal spirit, and I feel that I must, therefore, vote for an inland site" as against a port site, or a site close to either of the State capitals. Honorable senators who desire the immediate establishment of the Federal Capital will give due weight to the arguments I have submitted. It appears that Armidale is not acceptable to either House of this Parliament, and that the only two sites that are" possible are Dalgety and Yass-Canberra. Honorable senators should remember that if we select Yass-Canberra we shall be welcomed by the Mother State, the donor of the Federal territory, and the Government of that State will facilitate our early establishment there. We should not disregard the expressed intention of the Government of New South Wales to assist in the establishment of the Federal Capital at Yass-Canberra. Unless there is to be another instance of what, with all respect to previous Governments, I must describe as intrigue, and at times open and palpable engineering, extending even into the ranks of the Cabinet itself, the Senate will follow the example of the House of Representatives on this occasion. I take the vote given in the House of Representatives to mean that honorable members in another place desire to put an  end  to all this intriguing and engineering. </para>

                        <para>- That ma,y be so, and I have admitted more than once that honorable senators are at liberty to put whatever construction they like on my observations on this question. Certain considerations have weighed with me, and if I am to do my duty to my State, I feel bound to give effect to those considerations. I believe myself to be right, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> must permit me that luxury. If we are honestly and genuinely sincere in the expression of the desire to establish the Federal Capital on the lines set out in the Constitution, as interpreted by the history of; this great question at the time, we must consider the fact that the House of Representatives has willingly and openly changed1 its opinion, and, by a fairly strong majority, has said that Yass-Canberra is the proper site to select. I have no doubt that the fact that the New South Wales Government are prepared to assist in the early establishment of the Capital if Yass-Canberra be selected was a powerful argument in determining its selection by the House of" Representatives. If there be any importance in the immediate selection of a Federal Capital - a. home of our own, from which we might speak from, a national and federal point of view - and if the Senate cannot see its way to accept Armidale,, which would be my choice, we shall be acting fairly by New South Wales and by the Constitution if we select Yass-Canberra, which, if I may use the term, has been so generously put forward by the Mother State. </para>

                    <para>- I do not wish to be found by precedents, but that is no reason why we should take the action now proposed. I am pointing' out that honorable members opposite, who are usually so hidebound as to be unable ever to get away from precedents, are here being asked to depart from a precedent. This Parliament, after long, careful, and anxious consideration, four years ago, arrived at a definite decision with regard to the Federal Capital site. Several Commissions were sent out to report on the subject, and, after the matter was fully and anxiously debated, both Houses of this Parliament arrived at a conclusion, which was embodied in an Act, that the neighbourhood of Dalgety should be fixed as the site for the Commonwealth Seat of Government. That Act remains the law of the land to this day. In the circumstances, it seems to me extraordinary that the Government should now ask for an expression of opinion as to whether that Act should be repealed, when they have not the courage to propose its repeal themselves. The Government are seeking instruction from the Senate, as they sought instruction from honorable members in another place, as to whether the Act fixing Dalgety as the Seat of Government should or should not be repealed. Why has this question been re-opened? Has the Parliament, as a whole, expressed :any desire that it should be re-opened? Parliament never expressed any opinion on the matter, good, bad, or indifferent, until it was invited to do so by the Government. </para>

It was taken in response to the pettifogging outcry of the anti-Federal crowd in the various States, and the parochial cry of the people of Sydney. I am satisfied that the people of New South Wales, as a whole, would have accepted the selection of Dalgety loyally as the deliberate selection of the Federal Parliament, and as giving full justice to their State, and honorably carrying out the provisions of the Constitution. But a miserable parochial crowd in Sydney desire that the Federal Capital shall, for all time, be -a mere appendage and suburb of that city. </para>

No one but this Parliament had any right to reopen the question after that decision was arrived at. But, in order to  try  to tie its hands, the Sydney crowd put every possible difficulty in its way. They created imaginary difficulties. They refused to be loyal to the spirit and letter of the Constitution, and to give us the area which we had selected. They did not rest until they had practically dictated to this Parliament a different site. In other words, they took the power of deciding what should be the site of the Capital, from this Parliament, which was made the custodian of that authority by the people of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I am pointing out that until this microbe of parochialism got hold of trie Sydney people, the Government of New South Wales, and its officers, did not see through narrow spectacles at all. At that time they were broad-minded enough t'"i recognise that one portion of the State which was reported on by their Commissioner as being the! most suitable site should be offered to the Commonwealth. With regard to the 100 miles limit we had a rigmarole from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger as to what it meant. He pointed out that, in his opinion, it meant a reasonable distance from Sydney, and, in support of his view, he mentioned that at a meeting of Premiers it was agreed that the- limit should be interpreted as meaning that the site should be within a reasonable distance of Sydney. </para>

                        <para>- I think I am stating the case fairly when I say that the Premiers arrived at the conclusion that the limit  should be interpreted as meaning within a reasonable distance of Sydney. Now what is a reasonable distance ? The fact that the Convention, while conceding that the Federal Capital ought to be in New South Wales, insisted that it should not be within 100 miles of Sydney is a clear indication that its members considered that it would be an evil to have the Capital identified with any State capital, and also that it would be an evil to have the Capital too close to any of the State capitals, or the commercial influences of the States. Therefore, they said, " You can put the Capital where you like in New South Wales, but it must not be within 100 miles of Sydney." I interpret the term " reasonable distance " to mean just so far away from the State capitals as to be entirely outside their influence. Evidently that is what the members of the Convention had in their minds, otherwise they would not have used the phrase " a distance of at least 100 miles." They said that it must be a reasonable distance away, so that it would not be dominated by the influence of the State capital or by its commercial or political spirit, and from that stand-point a reasonable distance must mean such a distance from the State capital as will secure the Federal Capital from that domination. I have not the slightest doubt that if the Federal Capital had been conceded to Victoria, it would have been provided that the Seat of Government should not be within 100 miles of Melbourne. I interpret the term reasonable distance" to mean that the Federal Capital shall be sufficiently far away to insure tha Parliament and Government of the Commonwealth against undue domination by the State capital. </para>

                        <para>- No; but there is a plain and definite statement that the Federal Capital shall not be within 100 miles of Sydney, although it must be in New South Wales. That is the agreement which the people of Australia ratified, and any subsequent agreement or interpretation . arrived at by the State Premiers had no binding effect upon them or the Commonwealth Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- Then the honorable senator did not travel very far through the Southern Monaro district. I venture to say that between Dalgety and the Victorian border there is as good land from an agricultural stand-point as is to be found in New South Wales. I shall presently read what some independent authorities say upon that aspect of the question. </para>

                        <para>- I heard what he said, and I agree with his arguments. " What," I ask, " is wrong with the selection of Dalgety from a national point of view?" It is a fine, rich district, it is located in one of the healthiest portions of Australia, and, without doubt, possesses the most permanent river to be found in New South Wales. The only reason which can be urged against the Federal Capital being established there is that it is too far removed from Sydney. To my mind, however, it is an almost ideal site for the permanent Seat of Government. It is not located so far inland that access to it can be gained only through a particular State. As a matter of fact, the Commonwealth would be able to form a little independent territory there - a territory that would be bounded on one side by Victoria, upon another by New South Wales, and upon a third by the sea. If we possessed such a self-contained territory with our own port, it would be tantamount to adding a new province to New South Wales. To-day, notwithstanding that Southern Monaro is a large and fertile district possessed of a bracing climate, it is practically empty. </para>

I recollect that in the first speech which he delivered in this chamber, he declared that one-half of Australia was too hot for white men to live in. Apparently he now wishes to argue that the other half is too cold. Are we a tropical race? Are we not accustomed to frost and cold ? Are not the residents of Dalgety fine, sturdy, specimens of our race? If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> will refer to the vital statistics of New South Wales he will find that Southern Monaro is just as healthy a district as is any in that State. </para>

Dalgety, I repeat, would possess a port of its own, and in that respect its selection would make the Federation entirely independent of Sydney. It is exceedingly desirable that the Commonwealth should have a port of its own. By-and-by we shall probably possess coastal defence vessels, torpedo boats, and submarines, and it will then be necessary for us to have a port in which they can be provided with shelter and in which docks can be established for the building and repair of such vessels. We ought to be independent of any State in that respect? </para>

                        <para>- And politicians of that State are dominated by Sydney interests. If the honorable senator had his way he would make the members of this Parliament submit to similar domination. In selecting Dalgety as the site of the Federal Capital we have fulfilled every obligation imposed upon us by the Constitution both in the letter and the spirit. That being the case, the Government have merely to put into operation the law which this Parliament has enacted. I intend to loyally adhere to the decision at which we have already arrived; I decline to be carried away by any parochial cry or to be influenced by any attempt to make the permanent Seat of Government a mere appanage of Sydney, and to subject this Parliament to the dominating influences - commercial and otherwise - of that city. When we compare Dalgety with the site that has been selected by the other Chamber, what do we find? That in no respect is the Yass-Canberra site the equal of Dalgety, except from the stand-point that it is closer to Sydney. That is its only recommendation. This afternoon some honorable senators "mouthed" in this chamber about an exhibition of "national spirit." Yet outside I heard them say that they must support the New South Wales Government. Consequently I submit that their " mouthings " here were so much -flam. </para>

It can be approached either by way of the sea from Twofold Bay, to which it is very adjacent, or through Victoria, or through New South Wales. But if we select a site in the heart of New South Wales there will be nothing "to prevent the Government of that State telling us that they will not permit us to enter the Federal Territory except over th* roads which they may choose to mark out for us. </para>

                        <para>- New South Wales is quite capable of such conduct judged by the narrow, miserable spirit that she has already exhibited. I do not blame the New South Wales people for it. The mouthpieces of the State are dominated by Sydney influences, and New South Wales as a whole is really innocent. But her good name is dragged in the mire by people who do things of which not 1 per cent, of the people ' of the State outside of Sydney would approve. </para>

                        <para>- Because they are fooled bv the Sydney press. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver,</inline> the special Commissioner appointed by the New South Wales Government, recommended Dalgety as the best site for the Capital. One of his principal reasons was the magnificent water supply. and the splendid river flowing in the vicinity. Of course, he did not mention Dalgety specifically, but he mentioned Southern Monaro as decidedly the best district for the purpose. It was offered to us by the New South Wales Government". Honorable senators opposite have sheltered themselves behind the quibble that the people of New South Wales did not offer the site, because it was not offered by the New South Wales Parliament. But if they did  not speak, their Government did, and we had no means of knowing what the mind of New South Wales was except through the Government of the State. The very fact that the site was recommended by the special Commissioner appointed by the New South Wales Government, and offered by the Government of the State, is an evidence that this -Parliament acted in good faith in choosing the site as the most suitable one. Compare the new site with Dalgety, and what do we find ? There is no specific area laid down at all. Yass-Canberra is about 60 or 70 miles across. </para>

                        <para>- The area is not defined. Yass-Canberra may mean 500 or 50,000 square miles. It goes by Lake George, includes the old Yass site, and the new Canberra site. In fact, we have been told that there are several better sites in the area than either Yass or Canberra. What are the facts in regard to these sites ? There is only one that is of any real importance. Dalgety does not possess the advantage of Being nearer to Sydney than Yass-Canberra, and that, in the minds of some honorable senators, outweighs everything that may be placed in the balance in its favour. If the Capital were placed at Dalgety, it would be independent of Sydney. If, however, it were placed at Yass-Canberra, it would be an appanage of Sydney, and consequently under the domination of the commercial and political interests of that city. </para>

                        <para>- Wherever the Capital is, it should be absolutely independent of Sydney, and have a water supply of its own. I do not think that any one can have any doubt as to the sort. of treatment we should receive if we were dependent upon the New South Wales Government. Knowing what has been the attitude of that Government towards the Commonwealth in the past, we can realize how we should fare if we had to go cap iri hand to them and' ask them for a drink of water. What is. the position as to the water supply in the newly-discovered sites? Unless we put the Capital in a hole, we shall have to undertake extensive and expensive pumping schemes to get water into it. </para>

Not only could we get .sufficient water by gravitation for domestic purposes at Dalgety, but we could get sufficient to give us unlimited electric power for doing everything that might be required. We should have the whole of the upper waters of the Snowy River, which are fed by the everlasting snows of Mount Kosciusko. We shall want a great deal of power in the Federal Capital. We shall require electric trams, electric light, and electric services of various kinds. We shall require power for machinery for factories. At Dalgety we can obtain the cheapest and most economical electric power possible. </para>

                        <para>- As a matter of fact, the members of the Federal Parliament and its officers are the most water-drinking people who can be found anywhere in Australia. But what is the position as to water supply in Yass-Canberra? As I have said, unless we are to build the Capital in a hole, we cannot get a drop of water into it except by means of an expensive pumping scheme. There is a scheme by which water can be obtained from the Cotter Creek, but it would be necessary to build a very high dam for the supply of water to Canberra. Assuming that we could get sufficient, we should require also a big dam lower down, in conjunction with an expensive pumping scheme. </para>

                        <para>- I never hear it called a river, I wish to point out, further, that when we are told that we can get water from the Murrumbidgee by pumping, that that is a long river, which flows through settled districts. Any one who "knows anything of such matters must be aware that a river flowing through settled country cannot supply anything but tainted water. If it were used for domestic purposes, it would be likely to cause epidemics that would decimate the population in a very short time. We cannot have a water supply of that kind for the Capital of the Commonwealth. That we should be forced to depend upon a tainted source like the Murrumbidgee seems to be out of reason altogether. Beyond that, there seem to be only two available creeks, the Cotter and the Micalong. From this point of view, therefore, we cannot accept Yass-Canberra, or any site in that district, as being a sufficient compensation for the loss of such a magnificent site as Dalgety. I should like, for the information of honorable senators and the public, to read a portion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver's</inline> report dealing with the Southern Monaro district. Honorable senators from New South Wales have been continually belittling that portion of their own State by. saying that the climate is so bad that it would kill off every member of the Federal Parliament within a couple of years. </para>

If the Commonwealth i : to have a navy of its own, or even a  training  ; ship, Twofold Bay would be a convenient Nation, particularly for gunnery practice, and suggests itself as the convenient head-quarters of the Naval Commandant. As the breakwater would be fortified, the port of Eden could be made practically impregnable. In such a harbor the Commonwealth would have two roads for reaching the various State capitals - one by sea, the other by land - and of facilitating t-n.' collection, mobilisation, and dispatch of troops, munitions, and equipments. </para>

                    <para>I have given special attention to the harbor advantages associated with this site, because they are in one respect its chief distinguishing feature, but there is another aspect in which the' site is distinguished from all others. If the Federal Capital is established in Southern Monaro it is considered certain that Victoria wi'l extend her Gippsland line, now terminating at Bairnsdale, through Orbost, and contouring the coast, up to the Victorian border near Delegate, or Timbillillica, and so complete a coastal circuit of railway communication which would be of great strategical value, and would al.-o be a relief to the Main Trunk Line, and possibly an effective substitute  for  a duplication of the roadway of that line, the ordinary traffic on which must, with intercolonial free trade, become more and more congested. The cost of such an extension, which it is presumed would <inline font-style="italic">h-.</inline> borne by Victoria, is estimated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rennick,</inline> the Victorian Engineer-in-Chief for Construction, at £665,493 15s., or £4,500 per mile for 147 miles 71 chains. The cost of extension m Delegate River or Bendock would be much higher, viz., £1,351,212 10s.', and £1,442,237 10. </para>
                    <para>In regard to water supply, whatever rank is to be assigned to the site which possesses the most abundant as well as the cheapest, by gravitation, from a never-failing source, with 280 feet of head, Southern Monaro has hardly a rival, even under the conditions of the original proposal ; but, with the Snowy River thrown in, as it win be by the enlargement of the site as suggested, Southern Monaro stands absolutely first in the important matter of Water Resources; and the same site gives better promise than any other of affording water power for hydraulic lift.! and the development of electrical energy. Th; character of the water supply is treated at length in the report on this site at page 31). It may, however, be mentioned here that most of the catchment areas of the Delegate, and) Little Plains Rivers, are in New South Wak. and within the proposed Federal territory, as enlarged, although the sources of both are in swamps and springs on the other side of th : Victorian border. </para>
                    <para>In regard to Accessibility, although the distance from Sydney to Melbourne, <inline font-style="italic">vid</inline> Goulburn and Cooma railway, as extended to the Victorian border, and thence <inline font-style="italic">vid</inline> Orbost and Bairnsdale to Melbourne, would be approximately 676 miles or 100 miles more than the distance between the same two points by the Main Southwestern Trunk Line <inline font-style="italic">vid</inline> Albury ; yet the Southern Monaro site would be very nearly equi-distant as between Sydney and Melbourne by rail, and by water the difference would not be very much in favour of Sydney. The disadvantage of ICC miles more railway road between the two cap'tals would, however, be more than counterbalanced by the advantages of the alternative sea route, and the connexion of our Southern Railway System with the Victorian-Gippsland-System. </para>

                    <para>Summing up the conclusions reached on the foregoing review of the various sites proposed, your Commissioner considers that when any one of the three sites (1) Orange, (or Canoblas), (2^ Yass, (3I Bombala-Eden, (Southern Monaro), will be suitable for the establishment therein of the seat of Government of the Commonwealth; and whether for the area as originally proposed, or enlarged as suggested, or as may be subsequently determined. </para>
                    <para>If the final selection is to be governed, namely by considerations of co«t of acquisition and present accessibility, as between New South Wales and Victoria, Yass would be entitled to first place ; but the resources of that site for an effective water supply for a large population are not as satisfactory as could be desired </para>
                    <para>If the quality of the soil and the character of the climate are accepted as the controlling  factors, Orange (or Canoblas) would be entitled to first place; but the cost of resuming land within this area will be very heavy, and the water supply from the Canoblas catchment is not very promising for a large population. This site has the additional drawback of not being in respect of Accessibility a fair compromise as between Sydney and Melbourne. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>If the Federal territory is, within reasonable limits, to be selected independently of cost and of present accessibility, Southern Monaro combines more distinctly appropriate features  than either Canoblas or Yass. </para>
                <para>On their own merits, apart from the considerations indicated above, and having regard to the future, rather than the initial requirements of the Commonwealth, Southern Monaro is entitled to first place, and Canoblas and Yass may be bracketed as about equally suitable. </para>
                <para class="block">I have quoted sufficient to show that a New South Wales Commissioner, at the invitation of the Government of that State, reporting on sites offered by the State, came to the conclusion that the site already selected by this Parliament is the most suitable site in New South Wales for the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- Of course they did. and immediately we chose Dalgety they said, " That will not do. That is not adhering to the principle or the letter of the Constitution. You are not putting the Federal Capital at or near 100 miles from Sydney. You are not going to make it a joint in the caudal appendix of this State." That is the position which they took up. Is the Commonwealth Parliament to give up its right to settle this question in an independent manner, and to be dominated bv the miserable parochial feeling displayed bv a section of the people in Sydney ? T never hear a word of dissatisfaction coming from any portion of New South Wales except Sydney. The cry is. " Oh, Dalgety is too near Melbourne. The Capital will be only  too  mile* nearer to Sydney than to Melbourne." What has that to do with the question? Is it for the people of Sydney after having got their full terms in the bond, to dictate to us? When the first referendum was taken, the people of New South Wales did not really reject the Constitution Bill, because after agreeing to a minimum affirmative vote of 50,000, the Government meanly and basely went behind their backs and raised it. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad that the honorable senator has got in his little egotism, and I hope that it will do much credit to him. By whomsoever it was done, it was a mean, paltry, and contemptible thing to try to muzzle the people. A verdict in favour of Federation was given, but because the affirmative vote did not reach the artificial minimum fixed by interested persons, acting for Sydney then, as they are now doing, as against the interests of the people of New South Wales, they threw the Constitution Bill aside. Then they got their price, and it is embodied in the Constitution that the Federal Capital must be in New South Wales, but not within 100 miles of Sydney. </para>

Whatever else they might have been talking about, that was the main difficulty, and as soon as it was settled, he turned round, and advocated with all his might that the Constitution Bill should be adopted. The Sydney people got their price, and it is embodied in the Constitution. I am perfectly satisfied that the majority of the members of this Parliament have been not only willing but anxious to fulfil the obligation as soon as possible, but the people of Sydney and the representatives of its interests in this Parliament and elsewhere have stood in the way. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly, so far as I am concerned. I, as well as others, have been told by those who are interested in bringing about the proposed alteration that the proper way to settle this matter is to fall in with the ideas of New South Wales, and that then she will treat the Commonwealth generously. Perhaps she will. We are told that if we adhere to Dalgety we shall not get a Federal port at Twofold Bay, because New South Wales will always stand as a lion in our path. I am quite satisfied that if the time ever comes when the State adopts that attitude, and it is necessary for the Commonwealth to have a port, the people will insist upon our having the port, no matter what Sydney people may say. I feel quite certain that when the people of the Commonwealth have made up their minds to do a certain thing they will allow no small section of the people to stand in the way of its accomplishment. </para>

                        <para>- Why should I alter my vote in favour of Dalgety, when I do not think that we should be any better off in respect of those matters? Certainly we should be getting a poorer site. What reliance can be placed upon the offer of the State Government to do this thing for the Commonwealth, seeing that formerly the State offered Dalgety to us, and as soon as it was selected refused to give it to us? Is it not possible that the State might refuse to make the other concessions? If she wants us to treat her generously, and consider her wishes in .the most favorable way, she has her remedy. If she is sincere, let her embody in an Act of Parliament an offer of the territory, with that access to and control of a port which is essential for our purposes. </para>

                        <para>- That may not be interpreted as doing full justice to Sydney, but this Parliament is not concerned about Sydney, or any other city in the Commonwealth. It is only concerned about settling this question in a way which will be most conducive to the interest, not of one town or section of the people of a particular State, but of the people of the Commonwealth as a whole. I claim that the selection of Dalgety -would be one of the best things which could happen to New South Wales. It would practically add a new province, because I am satisfied, from personal knowledge, that if the Federal Capital were established in the vicinity of Dalgety, the Eden-Monaro district, from Cooma to the Victorian border, would, in-, the course of twenty-five years, carry ai population of a quarter of a million at the least, whereas now it carries only a few hundred persons. That could not be otherwise than advantageous to New South Wales. But, apparently, that State is going to wrap itself up in its own selfishness, and deny to this Parliament the right which has been conceded to it by the people of the Commonwealth, including those of New South Wales. We are here to give effect to the wishes of the people of Australia - not those of a miserable little coterie in Sydney - and so long as we recognise our duty in that connexion we cannot do otherwise than adhere to our selection of Dalgety as the site of the permanent Seat of" Government. </para>
