                        <para>- I shall be very glad, by leave of the Senate, to move forthwith that the despatch be printed, so that it may be made available to honorable senators quickly. There is another despatch which I have not yet laid upon the table, and which refers to resolution No. 9 of the Navigation Conference. I thought it was only fair that the despatch, and our reply thereto, should be tabled at the same time. It is a very short despatch, which I shall endeavour to have ready for presentation to the Senate by Wednesday or Thursday next. I beg to move, with concurrence - </para>

                    <para>. - When my speech was interrupted last evening I was attempting to deal with some of the objections raised to the Dalgety site by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell, and other supporters of Canberra. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell, as a farmer, is no doubt exceedingly anxious that the territory on which the Capital site is to be built shall be suitable for agriculture. Whilst the country surrounding Dalgety might not be classed as being as fertile as many portions of Queensland or the northern part of New South Wales, it will, I think, compare favorably even from an agricultural point of view with other parts of the temperate districts of Australia. I wish to impress upon the honorable senator that a capacity for the growth of produce is not what is specially necessary in a Federal Capital site. If the honorable senator will ask himself what he, as a member of the Socialist Party, wishes to do in the Federal Territory, he will discover that suitability for the growth of wheat, barley, potatoes, corn, pumpkins, and so on is but a subsidiary qualification for a Federal Capital site. </para>

                        <para>- I propose to advance a few reasons to show why the anti-Sosh party wish that Dalgety, the deliberate choice of the Commonwealth Parliament, should again be put into the melting pot. Two or three reasons stand out prominently. One is based on the proposal that the Federal Territory shall include an area of  900  square miles. Our anti-Sosh friends have apparently come to the conclusion that if such an area is acquired by the Commonwealth, there will be no pickings for them. What they are anxious to secure is a small Capital site, on which large sums of public money will be spent in such a way as to increase the value of the land surrounding that site, and give the land-boodler a chance of making a huge profit. </para>

Another reason for the objection of our friends to Dalgety is that the Federal Parliament carried  a  resolution that there should be no sales of land within the Federal Territory. </para>

They live by that sort of thing. They exploit the country by that sort of thing. Community-created increment is what they gorge and fatten upon. It is in this way they have obstructed the progress of Australia. They know as well as I do that if an object lesson in the nationalization of the land-

                </quote><para class="block">The motion then sets out the method proposed for determining the opinion of honorable senators. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> would; be perfectly in order in discussing any particular site, and referring to its advantages, or disadvantages, and to its relative merits as compared with any other site, in order to induce honorable senators to make what, in his opinion, would be the most suitable choice. But surely the honorable senator must realize that the desire of any party to boom lands for the purpose of making money cannot have any relation to the question now before the Senate? Such a discussion as the honorable senator's remarks have suggested might be pertinent in a debate upon the policy of administration of the Federal Territory, proposed by the Government. At present we are not concerned with the area to be acquired for the Federal Territory, or the policy to be followed in its administration, but only with the situation of the Federal Capital site. I ask the honorable senator to conform to my ruling, or take the necessary steps to disagree with it. </para><continue>

Without particularizing any site suggested, it might be proposed that we should select a site where all the land was already alienated, and where we should have no opportunity to give effect to the expressed policy of this Parliament. If the selection of another site, such as Dalgety, were proposed, it might include a large area of Crown lands on which we should be in a position to put the policy of land nationalization into force. </para>

At the time I interrupted him he was debating the opinions of the Anti-Socialist Party, and he had declared that that party were in favour of securing an opportunity to make money by means of land speculation. That was the substance of his remarks in that connexion. If he desires to point out that one site is better than another for the purpose of enabling an experiment in land nationalization to be undertaken he will be at liberty to do so, though not at great length.

If ever the Senate was asked to decide a matter which is not urgent, surely it is asked 'to do so now. I. have no desire to delay business, nor will business be delayed if this debate be adjourned, because there is another important Bill before the Senate. I submit that if the concluding portion of standing order  415  is binding at all the present debate must be) at once adjourned. </para>

                        <para>-  The Vice-President of the Executive Council has stated that he regards it as possible to proceed with the motion under discussion, and desirable to do so. I quite agree that it would be eminently desirable to proceed. But I am compelled to look at the wording of the standing order, which makes no reference to desirableness or convenience, but solely to urgency. That being so, the Vice-President of the Executive Council missed the mark when he dealt with the desirableness of doing something. The standing order lays down in clear language that when a ruling of the Chair is dissented from, the discussion shall be adjourned until the next sitting day. That is the prime direction of the standing order. Then there is a saving provision - unless the matter requires immediate attention. If this matter could be said to require immediate attention, the formal words providing that the matter should be adjourned might as well be struck out at once, because any matter can be said to require immediate attention if it is business which the Senate has to transact. </para>

                        <para>-  There are. I will instance a case where urgency might present itself. Suppose a Supply Bill came to us on Friday, that a point of order was raised during debate upon it, and that a motion was proposed to dissent from the President's ruling. There would be a case of urgency, in that the Supply Bill ought to be passed and the public creditor paid. It might then be proposed that we should immediately proceed to deal with the main question. But surely this is not a matter of that kind. I should like also to say, with regard to your suggestion that the Senate itself should decide whether the question is one of urgency, that, with all deference, I think that that would be an undesirable practice to introduce. Very frequently these points of order are taken when the Senate is more or less heated by controversy. *I think that the decision on a question of this kind would come with a great deal more authority and calmness from the Chair. Therefore I hope that whatever the ultimate decision of the Senate may be, a matter of this kind, involving a determination between striving sections, will not be left to a chance majority of the moment, but that a decision will be given with authority from the Chair. </para>

I do not think that such a point has arisen before, but I find that on the 4th and .5th October, 1906, a case arose when objection was taken to a ruling of the  President.

                        <para>-  The Vice-President of the Executive Council has been long enough a member of the Senate to know how to proceed. The standing order is framed in language that is not ambiguous or hard to understand. An ordinary senator, to say nothing of one occupying the position of Vice-President of the Executive Council, should know what our procedure is. We have used this standing order before. We have worked under it. When a ruling of the  President  has been disputed, the business before the Senate, whether it has had relation to a Bill or a resolution, has been automatically adjourned until the next sitting day. </para>

                        <para>-  The  President  has ruled that a certain line of discussion is out of order. Until that ruling has been dissented from by the Senate, it stands. The standing order does not provide that the debate on the main question shall be adjourned, but simply that the discussion on the point of order shall be adjourned. Whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> can as well proceed with his speech now as he could have done had the  President  not ruled is quite another question. The point we are discussing is the effect of the standing order, and I contend that the effect of it simply is to adjourn the discussion as to the President's ruling. </para>

                        <para>-  I am not concerned about how it is to be debated. I am endeavouring to deal with the situation with which we are confronted. The standing order is quite definite. When the  President  has given a ruling, and a motion has been submitted to dissent from it, then, automatically, the debate on that motion of dissent is adjourned until the next sitting day, unless it is determined to proceed with it as a matter of urgency. If the Senate determines that the matter is not urgent, the motion of dissent must be adjourned. But the debate on the main debate is not adjourned automatically, and cannot be adjourned except by special resolution of the Senate. </para>

                        <para>-  There is no escape from that position. The  President,  if I may be permitted to say so, has interpreted the standing order in the only possible way, and why should his ruling be departed from? I understood that there was a general desire on the part of honorable senators to deal with the question of the Federal Capital site as an urgent matter once it was launched. Why should the debate on my motion be postponed? It is undesirable that the true meaning of the standing order should be departed from, and certainly most undesirable that the debate on the main question should be adjourned. </para>

What are the facts in this case? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> was interrupted in his speech by a point of order. Honorable senators must be aware that the Standing Orders provide, and it is in accordance with our usual procedure, that when a point of order is raised whilst an honorable senator is addressing the. Chair, he must immediately resume his seat, and he cannot resume his speech until the point of order has been decided. That is the rule followed in every Parliament of which we have any knowledge, and our own standing order 415 is emphatic on the point. </para>

Several instances of the kind have occurred in the Senate, and the procedure followed, if the matter was not decided to be one of urgency, was that the debate on the question on which the point of order was raised stood over until the point of order was decided. </para>

I am not confining myself to the ruling of a past  President.  I have frequently said that I do not desire to be tied down by precedents, but I do say that we should obey the laws which we have laid down for ourselves. Our Standing Orders are emphatic, and the practice of every Parliament in the world supports the common interpretation of those Standing Orders that when a point of order is raised whilst an honorable senator is addressing the Chair, he must at once take his seat, and cannot resume his speech until the point of order is decided. </para><interjection>

Whether that way is right or wrong has not yet been decided. The  President  took exception to the manner in which the honorable senator was debating the question, and ruled that he was not in order. What would be the dilemma in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> would find himself if he were now called upon to resume his speech? Would the honorable senator be at liberty to resume his speech on the lines on which he was called to order, or would he be confined within the restrictions of a ruling which has been challenged ? Suppose the honorable senator addressed himself to some other aspect of the question, that another point of order was raised and was upheld by the  President,  would <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> right to speak on the subject be entirely abrogated? I contend that in accordance with our previous practice and our Standing Orders, the debate on the main question must be adjourned until such time as the point of order taken against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> speech has been decided by the Senate. </para>

                        <para>-  I have been addressing you, sir, all the time, and I submit in a perfectly orderly manner. If it is decided that this is a matter of urgency the point of order can be settled, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> can resume his speech. But until such time as the honorable senator is informed as to the lines on which he will be allowed to proceed, he should not be called upon to resume his speech at all. If an honorable senator is to be permitted to resume his speech before a point of order raised against him has been decided, the practice must lead to disorder. I will ask what would be thought of me if, when a point of order was raised' against me, I insisted on my right to continue speaking, while you, sir, were considering the point of order. If that course were followed there would be an end to all order in this Chamber. I submit that we should follow the practice which we have already laid down, and the Standing Orders, which we have adopted, for the orderly conduct of business. </para>

                        <para>-  I should like to point out that what happened on the occasion on which a similar point arose in connexion with the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill entirely bears: out the contention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> that it has been the practice of the Senate to automatically adjourn the debate upon a motion that the ruling of the  President  be dissented from. In the case quoted I direct attention to the fact that the Senate was in Committee when the point arose. A ruling by the  Chairman  was dissented from. That was referred to the  President,  and then a ruling by the  President  was dissented from, and the debate on that motion was immediately adjourned. It is obvious that the Bill could not be left hung, as it were, between heaven and earth, and so the Senate went again into Committee and progress was reported, that being the only way in which the Committee could terminate its business. That, as the record quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> shows, is exactly what the Committee did, and it was the only thing which the Committee could do if its proceedings were to be carried over in conformity with standing order 415. </para>

                        <para>-  I take it, sir, that on your interpretation of the Standing Orders your ruling on the point of order raised must, until the next sitting day, hold good as against the motion of dissent submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline> If that be so, according to your ruling, and the contention of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> may now continue his speech, and at any moment he might desire to introduce matter which you have decided is inadmissible. Any other honorable senator following him might do the same. In the circumstances, I submit, if I may be pardoned for the use of the expression, that your ruling would permit of a tyrannical abuse of power by the  President,  which would interfere to a material! extent with the liberty of debate. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> resumed his speech, was again ruled out of order, and again moved that the ruling be disagreed with, that ruling would still hold good under your interpretation until the next sitting day'. And, again, if I may 6e pardoned the expression, in such circumstances honorable senators would be brought absolutely under the whip of the  President.  I can scarcely conceive that it was intended by the Standing Orders to give such drastic powers to any  President.  I presume that it is in  order  to avoid the consequences to which I have referred that an opportunity is afforded by standing order 415 to treat a motion of dissent from the President's ruling as a matter of urgency. The Vice-President of the Executive Council, who is responsible for the conduct of business, might on this occasion .have submitted a motion to that effect. But as he has not done so it seems to me that the opportunity -.to which I have alluded has been lost. </para>

                        <para>-  It seems to me that the majority of those who have spoken in opposition to the decision "which VOl- have outlined, rather than given, have confined themselves  tq  pointing out not so much the true interpretation which should be placed upon the standing order as the inconvenience that would flow from such an interpretation of it. I admit the awkwardness of the position, but I contend that the ruling outlined by you is the only one which could possibly be given under the circumstances. I recognise all that Senators Givens and St. Ledger have said regarding the. inconvenience that would result from a strict interpretation of the standing order. But I submit that it is less your duty to consider the consequences that would follow the enforcement of the standing order than it is to consider the language of the standing order itself. With great respect, I contend that it is your duty to interpret the Standing Orders as they are printed, and as they have been adopted. It is not for you to trouble yourself about the inconveniences that may flow from their rigid enforcement. I do not see how it is possible to construe the words "and motion made" as applying to the main motion before the Chair, because that motion was submitted days aero. The standing order provides that when any objection is taken to the ruling or decision of the  President,  it must be taken at once and a motion of dissent submitted, which, if seconded, ' shall be proposed to the Senate, and it declares that debate thereon shall be forthwith adjourned till the next day of sitting. It does not contain a single word in reference to the question which was before the Chair when the President's ruling was given. I would further point out that the word "motion" could not apply to an Order of the Day. I am not quite sure  whether  the motion relating to the Federal Capital site is not an Order of the Day. But, clearly, the  President  might be called upon to give a ruling upon an Order of the Day, and who could then say that the word " motion " in the standing order referred to that Order of the Day. I submit that the only motion under consideration at the present time is the motion of dissent from your ruling. </para>

                        <para>-  It is extraordinary that we should be called upon to seriously entertain the view of your ruling which has been expressed by some honorable senators.. In the first place, <inline font-weight="bold">'Senator Stewart</inline> was addressing himself to the motion relating to the selection of the Federal Capital site. He was making some pointed references to the lands in the vicinity of the eligible sites. You, sir, ruled that in referring to the land nationalization aspect of the matter, his remarks were out of order. He dissented from your ruling, and put his objection in writing. As a result, we are now asked to proceed with the discussion of the main question, and to listen possibly to further remarks by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> which you may rule out of order, so that he will again feel called upon to dissent from your ruling. And this farce, according to some honorable senators, must be continued until the next day of sitting. It seems to me that when your ruling, sir, is dissented from, the debate on the main question, as was pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> - becomes automatically adjourned. If the standing order does not mean that, I do not understand its meaning. In the interests of the Senate itself, it would be far better to adjourn the debate upon the main question. </para>

                        <para>-  Exactly. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> does not continue the line of argument that he was following when he was ruled out of order, possibly another honorable senator may desire to do so. In that case the honorable senator in question would be ruled out of order, and would be obliged to dissent from your ruling. Under such circumstances, how could the debate upon the main question be continued? It is quite conceivable that a number of honorable senators may desire to adopt the same line of reasoning as that followed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> and, if they are to be ruled out of order, there will thus be eight or ten motions of dissent from your ruling before the Chamber. I am sure that that is not what the standing order contemplates. </para>

                        <para>-  The position in which we now find ourselves is largely the fault of the Senate itself. While <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> was speaking, you, sir, ruled that it was not competent for him to refer to any party as being interested in land transactions. He took exception to that ruling, and the Senate was then asked to decide whether or not the question at issue was one of urgency. But it did not decide that question, nor did it determine that the debate should be adjourned. Consequently I hold that there is no other course open to you than to call upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> to continue his speech. I admit that the position is an almost impossible one, seeing that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> cannot continue his remarks with the limitation that you have imposed upon them. </para>

You ruled that my remarks were out of order - that they were not relevant to the subject - and therefore could not be continued. I dissented from your ruling, and put my dissent in writing. Under standing order 415, the Senate decided that the discussion of your ruling was not a matter which required immediate attention. That decision was arrived at by the Senate failing to affirm that it was a matter of urgency. Now the question is:' Can the' debate upon the motion submitted by the Vice-President of the Executive Council proceed, seeing that you have objected to my pursuing a certain line of argument and that I have questioned your ruling in that connexion ? I wish to continue my speech upon my own lines. You have declared that my remarks are out of order. I have said that they are in order. Consequently your ruling must be remitted to the Senate for its decision. Until that decision is forthcoming I do not see how it is possible for me to continue my speech. To do so would be opposed to all parliamentary rules and precedents. In the present instance it appears to me that the Vice-President of the Executive Council is afflicted with a desire to too literally interpret our Standing Orders. </para>

                        <para>- When the question now under consideration has been decided, it would be in order for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> to submit a. motion of that kind. I have no doubt in my own mind as to the true interpretation of the standing order in question. The practice of the Senate and of other Parliaments is also clear. When I first had the honour of a seat in Parliament, I recollect that it was the practice, in the event of an honorable member dissenting from the ruling of the Chair, for the point in dispute to be debated forthwith. That practice was found to be fruitful in enabling honorable members to delay public business by making frivolous objections to rulings, which gave rise to lengthy debates. It was then decided that if an honorable member dissented from the ruling of the Chair, he should place his dissent in writing, and it should be taken into consideration at a later date - three days afterwards, I think. Under that practice, tha honorable member who was ruled out of order had to accept the ruling of the Chair for the time being. That is the practice under which I was educated. When this Senate was first considering its Standing Orders the matter in question received full consideration. It was desired that there should be no interruption of a debate on account of objection being taken to a ruling on a point of order. Accordingly, the standing order adopted was - </para>

If  the Senate does not see fit to decide that the matter requires immediate determination, the debate upon the motion of dissent from the President's ruling passes over automatically to the next sitting day. But that procedure does not interfere with the debate in progress. The honorable senator addressing himself to the main question can proceed with his speech if he wishes to do so, but he must obey the ruling given from the Chair. In pointing this out, I may also indicate what the Senate has previously done in similar circumstances. There is a report from the Standing Orders Committee with regard to the rulings of the  President.  It says - </para><quote>

            <para>In Committee :</para>
            <para>Clause 1 (short title and incorporation). </para>
            <para>The Committee proceeded to deal with the Bill as far as clause 5. So that the matter was not automatically postponed for the purpose of allowing the point of order to be settled. It will be observed that the matter then in dispute being with reference to a desire to give an instruction enlarging the power of the Committee, it was necessary that that point should be settled. Otherwise the Committee would be prevented from dealing with matters which, if a certain determination was arrived at, might have been dealt with. This Senate, however, simply allowed the business to proceed, subject, of course, to the ruling given by the President; and that ruling precluded the desired instruction being given, and precluded the Committee from dealing with the particular phase of the question that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> desired the Committee to be empowered to deal with. That case is absolutely on all-fours with the present position. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> was in the middle of a speech. Exception was taken to his line of argument. A ruling was given against him. Then he did what he had a perfect right to do; he gave notice of dissent from the ruling of the  President.  The standing order specifically provides that such a motion cannot be discussed at the time unless the Senate resolves that it is a matter for immediate determination. So far the Senate has failed so to determine. Consequently it has left the matter to stand over. But that does not interfere with the debate on the main question. The ruling of the  President  has to be accepted; and, until it is altered in a proper and constitutional way, the ruling must govern the debate. In due course an opportunity will be given for the Senate to say whether the ruling shall be maintained or not. The question is simply one of the true interpretation of the standing order. It has been said by one honorable senator that there is a possibility of a tyrannical  President  abusing his power and improperly limiting discussion. While such a possibility can be imagined, we can hardly conceive of an honorable senator being put in the Chair who would use his authority so tyrannically and unjustly. There must be some ultimate authority if Parliament is to proceed with its business in an orderly manner. The authority is in the  President  or the  Chairman  of Committees; and if the. Senate considers that a mistake is made by either of these officers, the standing order prescribes the method of rectifying the error. But it does not say that the debate on the main question shall be adjonrned. I have no hesitation in ruling that the true interpretation of the standing order is that it simply provides for the debate on the motion of dissent being adjourned until a later date, and does not provide for the adjournment of the debate on the main question. I should like honorable senators to realize also that if the  President  were not placed in such a position, it would be open to any honorable senator to raise a point of order, however frivolous for the purpose of blocking business. The Senate might be prevented from doing any business by the raising of such points. It was not the intention of the Senate to permit abuses of that character to come into vogue. The intention was that the Senate's business should be proceeded with in an orderly manner, and that no opportunity should be given to frustrate the intentions of the majority. The object of the Standing Orders is to permit business to be proceeded with, unless the Senate desires it it to be postponed. Another question has been raised. It is said : Suppose <inline font-weight="bold">Senator :</inline> Stewart were to resume his speech upon the main question, and again transgressed the ruling of the  President,  what would his position be? An honorable senator is bound to obey a ruling of the Chair and the Standing Orders enable the ruling to be insisted upon. </para>

                    <para>- What has been adjourned until next week is the consideration of the motion to dissent from the ruling of the Chair ; but, in the meantime, the ruling is binding upon the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> was entitled, in the absence of any motion, to resume his speech. If he does not choose to proceed he need not but, of course, he will be held to have spoken to the main question, and will not be entitled to speak again unless a further amendment is submitted. The ruling I give now is that tinder standing order 415 the only question which stands adjourned is the debate on the motion to dissent from the ruling; that the debate on the main question is not automatically adjourned; and that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is entitled to resume his speech subject, of course, to the observance of the ruling given. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> asked just now whether it would be competent to submit a motion that this matter should be adjourned immediately. Apart from the point of order, no business has intervened, and it will be open to the honorable senator to submit a motion of that character if he sees fit, but if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> had resumed his speech that would not have been in order. </para>

                    <para>. - The clause to which the Minister has drawn our attention provides that masters of ships who are granted pilotage exemptions must be British subjects, just as masters or officers who wish to get certificates must be. So far as I know there is nothing in the Bill to the effect that a foreigner should not be admitted a pilot. I think it is absolutely necessary, if we are to admit pilots to the Public Service, that they should be British subjects. </para>

If a foreigner desires to enter the Public Service of the Commonwealth, surely he should become a naturalized subject before he is admitted. Clause 15 only deals with masters of ships, whereas clause 335 deals with masters of ships who apply for a certificate of exemption from pilotage. It enables a master to pilot his own ship, but not other ships. </para>

                        <para>- Why should a person be required to spend a certain time at sea before he is admitted to examination ? Surely the examination is intended to be a test of his ability. Some men might be able, after a few years' service at sea, to pass satisfactorily. Why should it be left to the Government to prescribe that a man shall not be admitted to examination unless he has served for ten, fifteen, or twenty years at sea? I ask the Minister to state what qualifications, other than those I have mentioned, are likely to be required, before a man can submit himself for examination. This clause refers only to the qualifications required of an applicant for examination for a certificate, and not to the character of the examination itself. </para>

                    <para>. - Certain qualifications have always been required of applicants for these examinations. For instance, before a man is allowed to go up for examination as a second mate he must have been a certain number of years at sea, and must have served as an able seaman for a certain time. The fact that he is able to produce his discharge is evidence to the examiners that he has been to sea in a certain capacity for a certain number of years. In the same way a man holding a second mate's certificate must show that he has been to sea for a certain length of time in that capacity before he is allowed to go up for examination for a first mate's certificate. Then a man holding a first mate's certificate must show that he has had certain experience as an officer practically in charge of a ship and must produce discharges as a first mate to render him eligible for examination for a master's certificate. In my opinion that is the procedure involved in the use of the words " possesses the prescribed qualifications " to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> has objected. </para>

                    <para>. - I find it difficult to discover what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> is driving at. Surely the honorable senator does not suggest that the utmost care should not be exercised by the Committee to make it quite certain that only highly qualified men shall be appointed to discharge the duties of officers. I thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> for his full explanation. Before a man is permitted to enter for certain examinations he must satisfy the Board of Examiners that he has had experience at sea, or must produce previous certificates. It is essential that we should have the power to prescribe by regulations the qualifications required. To attempt to stereotype those qualifications by setting them out in detail in the Bill would only cause difficulty, as it might subsequently be found necessary to vary those which at the present moment might appear to be suitable. </para>

                        <para>- I have here a publication which is an official copy of the Board of Trade examination for deck officers. I have also another volume setting out the examination for engineers. Honorable senators will see that it would be quite impossible to include the matter in these publications in the Bill. I find it is provided that a candidate for a second mate's certificate must be not less than seventeen years of age, and must have served four years at sea. It is prescribed that there shall be an examination in navigation for a second mate's certificate. The candidate must be able to write legibly and spell correctly. This is to be decided by not less than a quarter-hour's dictation. He must write a short description of various astronomical and other terms and draft a diagram explaining them. He must be acquainted with the first five rules of arithmetic and so on. Honorable senators will see that it would be quite impossible to include all such particulars in the Bill. Let me say, further, that it is scarcely possible for the Government in prescribing regulations under this clause to make any serious departure from the requirements of the Board of Trade. It is expected that certificates granted under this Bill shall be recognised all over the world, and they certainly will not be so recognised if they are not in conformity with the regulations prescribed by the Board of Trade. In the circumstances honorable senators may safely pass the clause as it stands. </para>

                <para class="block">It seems to me that the term " physically unfit " is open to a number of different interpretations. We ought, I think, to make it perfectly clear that if the holder of any certificate is unfit to perform his duties - no matter from what cause his incapacity may arise - he shall be required to submit himself to a medical examination, and be liable to have his certificate indorsed with the result of the inquiry into his competency. I can readily conceive of an officer, who may be physically unable to discharge duties requiring the possession of a very robust constitution, being mentally very alert, and quite competent to take charge of any vessel. If we excise the word " physically," the meaning of the clause will be made much clearer. </para>

It is not difficult to conceive of the cases of men who may be physically robust while sober, but who may be habitual drunkards. Provision should be made for such cases in this clause. </para>

                        <para>- Then why is not the treatment of officers, who are unfit to discharge their duties, dealt with exclusively by clause 365 ? I. think that a Court of Marine Inquiry, such as is provided for in that clause, is the proper tribunal to deal with cases of this description. At any rate, the word "physically" should be omitted from the clause under consideration, because a man may be mentally well -equipped to discharge his duties, and yet possess but a delicate constitution. </para>

                        <para>- But the clause provides for no measure of physical unfitness. To my mind, it would be much clearer if we excised the word "physically." We should then place it beyond doubt that an officer, addicted to drink, would be liable to have his certificate taken away from him'. I know of soma officers who are not strong men, but who are mentally very alert. Their work is not laborious, and I contend that by retaining the word " physically," their certificates will be endangered. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that when my honorable friend comprehends the meaning of this clause he will be amongst the first to support it. I admit that the provision is not contained in the Merchant Shipping Act. It merely provides that if, for example, it should come to the knowledge of the Minister that an officer is colour-blind, or subject, say, to epileptic fits - in short, if he is really a danger to the community - he may be required to deliver up his certificate, and, after a proper inquiry has been held, that certificate may be indorsed with a statement as to his physical unfitness. An attempt to do something similar was made by the Marine Board in Victoria some years ago. </para>

                        <para>- The Marine Board of Victoria thought fit to provide that the certificates of officers, who were physically unfit, should bear an indorsement to that effect. It was acting in the best interests of the community, but, being ultimately unable to establish its position; it was mulcted in damages as the result of an action for libel. But we have to recollect that it is our duty to protect the community. If a man is suffering from infirmities, such as I have suggested, we have to protect the community against the danger of allowing him to continue in the performance of responsible duties, by indorsing upon his certificate a statement as to his physical unfitness. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has referred to cases of drunkenness. But that class of misconduct is provided for in the usual way in clause 357. Ultimately, in clause 365, the Court of Marine Inquiry is empowered' .to suspend or cancel the certificate of any officer who is deemed to be incompetent, or to have been guilty of any gross act of misconduct. In the clause immediately under consideration, we wish to provide a more summary method of dealing with certain cases. Should it come to the knowledge of the Minister that an officer is colour-blind, or subject to epileptic fits, or to any other" physical infirmity, he is empowered to say to him, "You must give me your certificate." </para>

                        <para>- At. any rate, ' the matter is one for the consideration of honorable senators. As we are making considerable advance upon State legislation in this connexion, and as the clause is intended to empower us to deal with officers whose incompetency is patent, the Minister should, I think, have the power to indorse their certificates with a statement of their infirmities. That is the real gist of this clause. I think we are making a very big advance, and it would be a little unreasonable to extend the provision. If we do so, it means giving wider power to the Minister than the Bill asks for. The objection has hitherto been that the Bill makes that power of the Minister too great. Besides, " unfit " is a very wide word. </para>

                    <para>. - The Vice-President of the Executive Council has urged, as a principal reason for not adopting the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, that we have made a very big advance from what has hitherto been the law and practice. That is hardly an argument that ought to appeal to us. The question is whether what is proposed is desirable or not, no matter whether it makes a big or little advance. Seeing that life and property are dependent upon the competency of officers in charge of vessels - and by competency we mean something more than mere skill - it is necessary to have power to place the possessor of a certificate under examination. I am not at all fearful that there would be an arbitrary exercise of the power. On the contrary, I am inclined to think that the use of it would be rather lax. It would only be used in an extreme case that it would not be possible to overlook. For that reason, I am in entire sympathy with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie's proposal. But I draw attention to another slight defect in the clause. The clause as it stands would cover all certificates which might be held in Australia. Have we a right to review a Board of Trade certificate? </para>

                    <para>. - I shall support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie's amendment. I can call to mind a case in which it would have been advisable to review the conduct of a captain before he left port. I remember a ship sailing from an outport in South Australia . where the captain had kicked up queer capers ashore. He sailed away, but the ship came back a little while after with the captain in irons. He had been put under restraint by the crew. There was a case in which it would have been desirable to have power to deal with the master's certificate before sailing. The difficulty was not physical, but mental, incapacity. The question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> should make us pause before we insert the clause in the Bill. The Board of Trade issues certificates to officers under an Act in which there is no provision of this sort. I remember the case of a mate in Melbourne who went up for examination for a master's certificate. When he was being examined it was found that he was colour-blind, and the Marine Board not only refused his master's certificate, but indorsed his mate's certificate to the effect that he was colourblind. He at once sued for damages, and the Court awarded them to him. If we were to review a certificate issued by the Board of Trade, an appeal might be made to that authority, who might reverse the decision given in Australia, on the ground that it was contrary to Imperial law. That is what I. am afraid would happen. If we are going to test the question, however, it would be just as well to leave out the word " physically," and make the clause apply to all unfitness. I know of instances where such a power would have been a very desirable one to exercise. Take a ship, the . master of which has been commissioned by his owners to engage a crew. The crew are shipped within twenty-four hours of sailing. The master is a stranger to them. Something occurs just before sailing which causes the men to say, " If we go to sea in this ship it will probably be our last voyage." Under the old law they had to go to sea and put up with things, no matter what might happen, until they reached the next port, or go to gaol for three months. The amendment is a most desirable one to make, but the question I raise is whether we shall be able to maintain our position in cancelling or suspending a certificate issued by the Board of Trade. At present, every Australian State except Western Australia has a King's Order in Council, making certificates issued in mis country valid throughout the British Dominions. British certificates are recognised in every State of Australia. While our State Acts were in conformity with the Imperial Act we had power to cancel or suspend. But there have been cases where the decisions of local Marine Boards have been upset by the Board of Trade. If we, under our Com.monwealth Act, cancel a British certificate, will the Board of Trade recognise the cancellation ? </para>

                    <para>. - I desire it to be recognised that this is a special clause for a special purpose. It contains its own machinery. The case of a master being mad or drunk has been referred to. Suppose that it is indorsed upon a master's certificate that he is a drunkard. Suppose that time passes, that an appeal is made to the Minister, and that it is found in the meantime that .he has become a teetotaller. Would the indorsement on the certificate then be - " This man is no longer a drunkard?" Would not that be an extraordinary state of affairs? Or, suppose the second indorsement were, " This man is no longer mad?" The object of the clause is to provide for the indorsement of certificates. If, on the other hand, a master is proceeded against for misconduct or incompetence, all that is done by the Marine Board is either to cancel or suspend his certificate. But the object of the clause is totally different. We must not damn a man with faint praise and then, after an inquiry, make an indorsement on his certificate that he is not a drunkard or a lunatic. Because an indorsement of that character would be a serious detriment to him in the practice of his calling. I am disposed to think that it would be better to strike out the clause than to maim it in the way suggested. The object of the clause is to deal with patent things which come under the attention of the Minister. Take, for instance, the subject of colour-blindness. Suppose that after a man's certificate has been indorsed to that effect an inquiry is held, and it is shown that his sight has recovered, an indorsement would be made on the certificate that he suffered no longer from colour-blindness. I. ask honorable senators to bear in mind that the object of the clause is totally different from the object of clauses  357  and  368. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps it may be necessary to insert a few words to meet ;i contingency of that kind. The responsibility is thrown upon us to see that the public are protected by compelling any  man who is thought to be physically unfit to submit himself for medical examination. From the wording of the clause it is not absolutely clear that a man's certificate could not be demanded by the Minister if he refused to submit himself for medical examination. But perhaps it will be advisable to provide for a contingency of that kind. Subject to that emendation, and having regard to the primary object of the clause, I think it would be unwise to extend its scope. </para>

                    <para>. - I am sure that no honorable senator desires to deal other than justly with such a case as the Minister has suggested. I do not anticipate any difficulty arising if we strike out the word "physically." If we make that amendment we can put the clause in proper form by leaving out the provision for an " indorsement on the certificate." I do not think that an indorsement should be placed on a certificate for all time, and whether rr.y amendment is agreed to or not, the provision for indorsing  a  certificate should be struck out. An indorsed certificate would be practically useless to an officer. Once a certificate is blemished it loses its value, to a great extent. </para>

                        <para>- That would be much more considerate than to hand back to a man a certificate which would always be indorsed with a black mark. We treat our criminals much more leniently. We do not require them to carry the brand of criminality throughout their lives simply because they have once made a mistake. Unless the word " physically " is struck out very unfit officers may go to sea. To all appearances they may be quite fit to perform their duties, but as soon as they get to sea they may give way to the drinking habit, and go on the bridge in a state of drunkenness, to the danger of all the persons in their charge. Under the clause as it stands the Minister would have no power to deal with the certificate of a man who had been guilty of such misconduct. But if the word "physically" is omitted he would be able to deal with any cases of unfitness which might me brought to his notice. </para>

                        <para>- I have suggested an amendment of the wording of the New Zealand, section which 1 think  would meet the objections raised to the clause before the Committee. I think it would not be wise to leave out the word " physically " as proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. On the other point I am not sure that the New Zealand Act requires that the finding after an inquiry shall be indorsed on the certificate. My present impression is that it would be better to pass the clause as it stands, but I should prefer the New Zealand section, amended as I have suggested, to the clause, if amended as proposed bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. </para>

Honorable senators will see that such a charge might be laid a few hours before the sailing of a ship. It would not wait for the officer, and he might as a consequence be out of work for a considerable time. In a despatch on the subject of marine inquiries received from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Chamberlain when he was Secretary of State for the Colonies in 1898, a reference is made to this matter.

                        <para>- Just so; we are entirely agreed that the procedure should be as nearly as possible the same throughout the Empire. The point to which I wish to direct special attention may be put in this way : An officer holding a certificate in a foreign-going ship might be asked to undergo a medical examination. Would he do so ; and if not, could we force him to do so? Under this clause I do not think we could. I have no doubt that we should have the power in the case of an officer engaged in the Australian trade, but I doubt very much whether an officer in a foreign-going ship, even though he held one of our own certificates, could be compelled under this clause to undergo a medical examination. That is a matter which requires serious consideration. I have said that officers should be protected against unjust charges under this -clause, and there should be some provision for compensation where a charge is not sustained. I take the case of an owner having engaged a master to get a ship ready for sea. He incurs perhaps a larger expenditure than the owner anticipated, and as a result a quarrel arises between them. When the ship is ready to go to sea, the owner wishing to be rid of the master, under this clause trumps up a charge against him, which cannot be heard at once. The ship is sent to sea under another master, and the man against whom the charge is laid loses his employment. When the matter is investigated by the Court of Marine Inquiry, it is found that the charge is not sustained, and what then is the position of the master? </para>

                        <para>- That despatch does not dispute such a position for a moment. No exception is taken to this clause in the last despatch, and it clearly applies to British and foreign-going ships. It would have been unfair and unreasonable for the Board of Trade to take exception to the exercise of this power when it has already been conceded for so long. I may have occasion at some time to show honorable senators how far we have been prepared to go to secure that uniformity of practice which the Board of Trade suggests. We recognise that it is desirable in the interests of all parties that we should do so. I hope it is quite clear that we have full power to deal with Board of Trade certificates in the case of charges of incompetence or misconduct. That has been the practice in all the States in the past, and no exception has been taken to it. </para>

                        <para>- I am prepared to argue the matter on the assumption of <inline font-style="italic">bona, fides</inline> on the part of the Minister.  His  duty then would be to refer the matter to the medical officer. Should the officer declare that unfitness existed, and was likely to be of a permanent character, then, and then only, could the Minister require the holder to deliver up his certificate. In accordance with the suggestion of my honorable friend, I shall, at a later stage, move the insertion of a new paragraph, which will provide for cases in which officers refuse to submit themselves to a medical examination. But I would point out that if a captain acted in the malevolent manner suggested he would render himself liable to very heavy damages. My honorable friend will therefore see that the clause provides for the very contingencies to which he has pointed. The fact that it has not been taken exception to by the Board of Trade is fairly conclusive evidence upon that point. </para>

                    <para>. - The proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie would, if adopted, have the effect of nullifying the decision at which the Committee have just arrived. Let us suppose that, in Melbourne, a certain charge was preferred against the holder of a certificate, and that he was found guilty of that charge. Under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie's proposal the record of his conviction would be retained by the Court in Melbourne. That being so, the offender would not be so foolish as to again attempt to ship from this city. He would merely ship from Hong Kong or some other place with a clean certificate. I submit that where a man has been found guilty of any charge under this clause, the ship-owner who engages him will be cognizant of what has happened. In some cases a man may not be fit to take charge of steamers like the <inline font-style="italic">Lusitania,</inline> or a vessel of 10,000 or 12,000 tons, but may be quite competent to navigate a smaller vessel. The Board of Trade has given us power to suspend or cancel certificates, and we are now taking to ourselves only the power of indorsing them. </para>

An officer may go to some other part of the world and secure an engagement. But he could not be engaged in Australia ; and I do not know that we are legislating for the whole world. </para>

                    <para>- I think my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, would be well advised in not persisting with his amendment. As a matter of fact, having regard to the alteration made in the clause, it would be wise to strike it out altogether. First of all, misconduct such as drunkenness is already provided for in clause 357, which deals with charges of incompetency or misconduct. " Incompetent " is defined to mean "unable from any cause whatever to perform efficiently the duties of the person in relation to which the word is used." I have already indicated the special purpose for which clause 18 was inserted. It is intended to deal with such cases as colour-blindness, liability to epileptic fits, or physical ailments of any character. But the word "physically" having been struck out, the clause is placed on a level with what is provided for in clause 357, and becomes unnecessary. </para>

                    <para>- I think that the Committee has not grasped <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie's purpose. He proposes to leave out of his amendment the words " indorsed upon the certificate " with a view to put in "recorded;" and he has said that he would also leave out all the remaining words of the subclause after the word "Court." What he desires is, I think, that if an officer clears himself of a charge he should get back his certificate without a mark upon it. Suppose, however, that an officer is charged with being mentally unfit and the Court of Inquiry says "Yes; we find that this man is mentally deficient." That finding would be recorded, and the Minister would retain the certificate. The officer might have to go into an asylum for a time. If he came out cured he should have his certificate returned to him without an indorsement upon it. All that would be recorded against him would be the entry in the books of the Court of Marine Inquiry, and the certificate would be as good as new. But if it were indorsed that the man had been mentally deficient no shipowner would intrust him with a vessel.  His  chance of employment would be killed for ever, and his certificate might as well be cancelled. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie is trying to achieve is that, if an officer clears himself of a charge of unfitness, he should get back, not a damaged certificate, but one clear of any indorsement. That is what I think he ought to get. </para>

                        <para>- No. That provision covers a man who has cleared himself from a charge. For instance, if he had been charged with being mentally unfit, and a mental examination proved that he was fit, there would be no indorsement, and his certificate would be handed back to him. It is only , after the Court has inquired into a charge that the Bill says that the record must be indorsed on the certificate. When the man comes back, having recovered from the illness, or freed himself from the charge of incapacity, he should not receive a certificate with a damaging indorsement upon it rendering it practically useless. The Vice-President of the Executive Council was not, I think, quite conclusive when he said that all that is desired is covered by clauses 357 and 365. Clause 357 deals with cases where damage has been done. I take it that clause18 is intended to meet the case of a captain who has become a dipsomaniac to the knowledge of the officers and the crew, but who, so far, has not wrecked a ship or done any damage, or brought himself under any provision in clause 357. If that clause is examined, it will be found that every sub-clause presupposes that something has occurred as to charges of incompetency against the master. </para>

                        <para>- Take the case of a captain who has become addicted to the drinking habit. It one case it will be for an officer or a member of the crew to make a definite charge against the captain when the ship comes to port, but in the other case, an officer can go to the Minister, and tell him what happened during the voyage, and, if the Minister is satisfied, he can call upon the captain to hand over his certificate, and cause a Court of Marine Inquiry to be held to investigate the charge. In the latter case, the Minister makes the charge against the captain, but in the other case, an officer or a seaman is required to make a charge. </para>

                        <para>- Take the case of a captain who has become mentally deficient, and against whom the officers or seamen have made a charge. If the captain had a lucid moment when he is being examined medically, and passes the examination, what will become of his accusers? They would have a very rough time, I presume, if they shipped with that man again. We have to consider the safety of the ship, the crew, and, it may be, the passengers, without doing an injustice to an innocent and competent officer. Under clause  357  it is proposed, in a case of mental deficiency which is not continuous but only occasional, to place the onus of making a charge upon the officers, or the officers and the crew. But under clause  18,  the Minister can take action on  any  complaint or report made to him. The amendment will put the officer in a better position, because the clause, if passed in its present form, will practically damage a man for ever. The amendment will safeguard the crew, the ship, and the passengers by preventing a man who has become mentally unfit from having charge of a ship while he is in that state, and the moment it is proved by medical examination that he has recovered his faculties, he will receive his certificate, free of blemish or damaging indorsement. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment.I think that if it is not carried, the clause had better be omitted, because it would be preferable to take the power of cancelling a certificate. I hope that the Committee will see that there is a good deal of reason for making the amendment, and that it is not open to the Minister's criticism, because it does not give an officer freedom to wander round and take other employment while he is unfit mentally or physically. </para>

                    <para>. - It seems to me that there is something to be said on the other side of this question. It should be regarded from the point of view of the officer. What is the present practice? If a master loses a ship, the Board of Trade cancels his master's certificate, but does not prevent him from earning a living when he is well fitted to take another position as an officer. To many a man who has been guilty of losing a ship, no matter from what cause, and from whom his master's certificate has been taken after an inquiry, there has been issued a mate's or second mate's certificate, so that he could go and earn a living at his calling. What will be the position if the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie is carried? If a man's sight is supposed to be defective, and it is proved on examination that it is not so good as it should be, his living will betaken away from him, because his master's certificate will be retained. He will have no chance to find employment in any other capacity at sea until he can prove that he has regained his sight; Is there any reason why that should be done ? Owing to some defect, many a man may not be fit to take charge of one of the big ships running round the coast. I know men who, for some rare reason or other, have been taken out of big vessels on the coast, and put in charge of other vessels where they had not to take anything like the same amount of responsibility or risk, to carry a large number of passengers, to make as many trips, or to work strictly to a time-table, racking their nerves the whole time. In the opinion of their employers, those men, although not fit to take charge of first class ships, are fit to take charge of small vessels in the limited coast' trade. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Under the amendment, 'if carried, every means of earning a livelihood is taken from a master against whom a charge of any description has been lodged, because, without a certificate, he cannot get a position of any sort' as an officer. It would be far better, even if his certificate had to be indorsed, to leave that man an opportunity of getting employment - probably under the same firm, but not on one of their first-class ships - as a second or third mate. </para>
