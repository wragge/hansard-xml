                        <para>- Last night, the Minister of Defence, replying to a question asked by me early in the day, said that the honorable member for Hume had explained a previous statement, to the effect that if, when he made it, he had been in possession of information which he received later he would not have made it. But, according to a report in this morning&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> which the Minister has probably seen the honorable member did not withdraw the statement, or suggestion, that an action which should have been proceeded with was dropped, and that the Customs Department has been negligent in the performance of a duty to the public. I therefore ask the Minister again if he was correct in saying last night that the honorable member for Hume had withdrawn his statement, and whether, if it was withdrawn, there was any reservation? </para>

                        <para>- I have seen the press accounts referred to, and have obtained a proof of the official report of the speech made by the honorable member for Hume in the House of Representatives. He referred to two South Australian Customs cases, admitting in regard to the first that action had been taken of which he was  not aware, and that, had he known of it, he would not have made his statement, though, later on, he expressed dissatisfaction with what has occurred. With regard to the second case, he indicated that, in his opinion, it is unsatisfactory that no action has been taken. In the first case, the Adelaide firm of Messrs. Harris, Scarfe, and Company was prosecuted by the Customs Department. The honorable member for Hume seemed to be of opinion that the prosecution had not been proceeded with; but that is not so. Seventeen charges were made, fourteen alleging evasion of the payment of duties, and three alleging fraud. On the matter being referred to the Crown Solicitor, he reported that the evidence to support the charges of fraud was very weak, and when the prosecution was commenced the firm entered a demurrer against these charges, pleading guilty to the charges of evading the payment of duty. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator should not say that. This was not a back-stairs settlement. The case was argued in Court, the settlement was arrived at by the counsel to the parties, and the penalty imposed was determined by the Judge who presided. In regard to the second case, the honorable member for Hume was incorrect in suggesting that no action had been taken ; it is listed for hearing before the High Court in Adelaide this month. </para>

The honorable senator and my self more than once joined in voting for such a request when someone else held the office, and I am sure that in the event of any other member of the Senate becoming  President  in the future we shall take exactly the same action. I find an additional reason for supporting the request, in that I intend to endeavour to effect economies in other directions in the Estimates, and it is well to begin with ourselves. </para>

                        <para>- He is under the absolute control of Parliament, and it is for Parliament to say whether he shall or shall not receive an increase. I am objecting, not to the fact that he may receive certain increments, but to the system under which they are to be granted. Strong opinions have previously been expressed in the Senate as to the office of Usher of the Black Rod. It is a remnant of old world worn-out superstition, pageantry, show, and grandeur. In these days, when sensible people are supposed to manage their business in a sensible way, why should we think it necessary to have an officer wearing a swallow-tail coat, with brass buttons, knee breeches, silk stockings, patent leather shoes, with pointed toes and buckles on them, to walk with a black stick in his hands before the  President,  or to announce the arrival of the Governor-General ? If a body of savages were to adopt such a practice one would not be surprised, but it is astounding that sensible men in this twentieth century should resort to such ridiculous &#34; flummery.&#34; The present occupant of the position is far too good a man to be degraded by so menial an office. In the old days the office was certainly regarded as a menial one, and we should do away with it. If this officer is required for other purposes, let us say so plainly and put it in black and white, that we pay him for those services. It is a mere waste of good material to have in the position a gentleman of the ability of the present occupant. I have not a word to say against him, nor had I a word to say against the former occupant of the office when I raised a similar objection. I have a most friendly feeling towards both gentlemen, but personal considerations should not lead us to continue to countenance so absurd an office. Who pays for the silk stockings, the knee breeches, the swallow-tailed coat, the pointed leather shoes with buckles, and the black rod? While people are going hungry, is the community to be taxed to provide such things? I shall support &#39; the request because I believe it is time the Senate took up a strong stand and attempted to cleanse itself of this remnant of an Old World superstition. </para>

There is another matter that I should like to mention.

On a former occasion I protested against the system of providing for the remuneration of an officer in different items, believing it an excellent principle that the emoluments of an office should appear in one item, so that we may see at a glance what any officer receives.

                    has always consistently opposed the item on the Estimates providing for the salary of the Usher of the Black Rod, and if the sole duty appertaining to the office were that of remaining in the Chamber while the Senate is sitting there would be strong reason for taking exception to it. But as has been explained over and over again, the Usher of the Black Rod has other very important and special duties to perform, and it is really in relation to those duties that his salary is voted.

                    has spoken very1 favorably of the present occupant of the office as a man, but says that he is degraded by being called upon to act as Usher of the Black Rod. I would remind him- that in the House of Lords the position has always been regarded as one that should be held by a man of ability enjoying the esteem of his fellow citizens, and so with the office of Sergeant-at-Arms in the House of Commons, as well as in another place. The Usher of the Black Rod is also  Clerk  of
                </para>
                <para class="block">Select Committees, which includes the Printing Committee, the Joint House Committee, and the Committee of Disputed Returns and Qualifications. As Secretary to the Joint House Committee he has supervision over the Refreshment Rooms, the Parliament Gardens, the Queen&#39;s Hall, and repairs to the building. As Usher of the Black Rod he has to deal with the Press gallery and other galleries generally during the sittings of the Senate. Then, again, he assists in the work of the office, such as preparing Bills, as amended for the Printer, and drawing up schedules of amendments, which cannot be done by the Clerks as the work in the Chamber proceeds. Honorable members will recognise therefore that he has to discharge multifarious duties many affecting the comfort and convenience of every member of the Parliament. If we did away with the office, and so&#187; reduced our staff, the work of the Senate would speedily fall into arrears and confusion, since the remaining Clerks would not have time to attend to the additional duties that would devolve upon them. As to the granting of increases, we all recognise that Parliament has supreme control, but, as was pertinently pointed out just now by the Minister of Defence, the  President  stands in the position of the Public Service Commissioner so far as officers of the Senate are concerned. The Public Service Act provides that- </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline>
                    that I should make this explanation. We now come -to the proposed increment which appears on the Estimates. The maximum salary for the  Clerk  of Select Committees, Usher of the Black Rod, and Secretary to the Joint House Committee, is  ,&#163;550,  while the salary proposed now is  &#163;475.  The officer who occupies the position was promoted from one in which, he received  ,&#163;420,  whereas his predecessor received the maximum of  ^550.  in addition to a further allowance of  &#163;50  for acting as Secretary to the Joint House Committee, so that the salary was really &#163;600 a  year. It is considered that an opportunity is now presented for having one salary; and the proposal is that the maximum shall remain as at present, without the additional allowance of  ^50,  though the officer will continue to perform the duty of Secretary to the Joint House Committee. In the early days of this Parliament, it was agreed that certain salaries should be fixed, and in this instance the rate was  ^550,  and it was thought unreasonable to ask Parliament to raise the new officer&#39;s salary at once from
                    <inline font-style="italic">&#163;420</inline>
                    to  ,&#163;550.  The position was, therefore, arranged so that the smaller amount I have mentioned would be paid to commence with, and gradually be increased, as is the case in Departments under the Public Service Commissioner. Promotion, of course, is made according to the law;, and depends on reports that may be submitted from time to time ; and following that precedent it has been thought wise to adopt the course I have indicated, so that the maximum salary should be reached on the recommendation of the  President,  who occupies in this connexion the position of the Public Service Commissioner. Honorable senators will realize that that is a fair and reasonable way in which to deal with a matter of the kind, and also to effect economy. Of course, a great deal depends on the salaries paid to those in similar positions in another place, and it is considered that they should be much the same. I have not the exact provision with me as to the terms of the appointments of these officers, but the appointments were made subject to the increments to be granted from time to time on the recommendation of the  President.  I realize, of course, that the ultimate decision must remain with honorable senators, and we know that any fair and proper proposal will always receive the support of the Senate. I hope that, under the circumstances, honorable senators will come to the conclusion that it is undesirable to cut down any of the salaries of the officers of the Senate, and that as the retention of the office of the Usher of the Black Rod does not add to the expense of Parliament, there can be no reasonable objection to its retention. Some honorable senators may think that an office of the kind does not add any dignity to the Chamber ; but, after all, certain forms and procedures must be followed, and a similar officer is retained in every important Legislative Chamber in the world. It is desirable to have some dignity attaching to offices of importance under the Constitution.

                        <para>- It is desirable that the occupants of certain offices should be provided with a distinct dress to distinguish them from others who appear in the Chamber. The members of the Defence Forces, on which the maintenance of the Empire depends, wear uniforms showing that they have to perform certain duties. If the idea, of some honorable members were carried to its logical conclusion, the Clerks at the table would have to be robbed of their, wigs and gowns when Parliament was opened or prorogued. The conditions attaching to the office of Usher of the Black Rod are no derogation to the officer, any more than are the conditions attaching to the office of Serjeant-at-Arms in another place. Certain duties have to be&#39; performed by the Usher of the Black .Rod, and it is well to have a suitable officer to precede the  President,  to convey messages to the other House, and to introduce the GovernorGene.ral at the opening or closing of Parliament. It is better that the present arrangement should be retained, than that a messenger should be employed to perform duties of the kind. There are other duties of the Usher, to which I do not desire to refer, and which, I hope and believe, will probably remain in abeyance; and under all the circumstances I hope honorable senators will allow the vote to pass. </para>

                        <para>- I have not said that the speech was not pertinent; but, excellent as it was in parts, the main result has been to gloss over and hide - unintentionally, of course - what is a departure from a practice that has obtained in connexion with the Appropriation Bill, ever since we have been a Federal Chamber. I refer, of course, to the asterisks which appear after the item. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has already pointed out that certain annual increments are to be granted, subject to the recommendation of the  President  of the Senate, and we have been told that that course has been adopted, because the  President,  so far as the officers of the Senate are concerned, is in the position of  the  Public Service Commissioner. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> quoted from the Public Service Act; but, if honorable senators paid close attention, they must have noted that all the Act provides is that, as regards these officers, the  President  &#34; may &#34; take the place of the Commissioner, not that the  President  &#34;shall &#34; do so. In my opinion, the  President  is not, by virtue of the Act, in the position of the Public Service Commissioner in regard to these increases; and this is the first time that asterisks have ever appeared in this way in the Estimates. </para>

                        <para>- But the  President,  as such, cannot be in a position to appraise the work of these officers, unless he is taxed beyond the ordinary capacity of a human being; and, further, he ought not to be asked to deal with such a matter, because it places on the  President  a serious responsibility which I do not think he ought to bear. It is rather a strange suggestion to make, but I hope that these asterisks will be struck out. No harm will thereby be done to the officers ; and we shall be merely saying that we do not avail ourselves of the opportunity presented by the Public Service Act, in order to make the  President  the Public Service Commissioner, and the arbiter in such cases. This is a matter for the Ministry. </para>

If any honorable senator desires to raise the issue as to whether the  President  should or should not make a nomination or recommendation, the proper course is to move for an amendment of the Public Service Act. But this is not the time to discuss that question. Of course, the asterisk appears on these Estimates for the first time, because it is only since the last Estimates were printed that the alteration has been made. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blackmore</inline> resigned, and the late Government, by arrangement with the  President  and the  Speaker,  made the new appointment at a lower salary than that previously voted. In view of the fact that the appointee started&#39; at bedrock salary, an intimation is made to Parliament, by means of an asterisk and a footnote, that it is proposed to increase it gradually until he reaches the maximum. If Parliament considers that the amount of the salary is excessive it can be reduced. But so far as the powers of the  President  are concerned they seem to be so clear as to need no debate. </para>

                    <para>. - We should be guided by the opinion of the  President  as to whether this is a proper salary to be paid to the officer. He has shown that the performance of the duties appertaining to the office is worth &#163;475 a year. I have no particular love for frills and fripperies, but I do not understand why all the attacks are made on this unfortunate officer. I admit that it seems rather funny sometimes to see the Usher of the Black Rod in his uniform, but if we intend to do away with these things, do not let us confine our efforts to one particular officer. Let us take the  wig and gown and knee breeches off the  President,  and the wigs and gowns off the Clerks. We have the Governor-General coming here in a cocked hat, and escorted by a number of men decorated with gold lace and wearing swords. If we intend to make a change, let us go the whole distance, and not confine our efforts to one officer. I have heard this attack on the office, if not on its occupant, several times, and it seems to me rather invidious and unfair that he should be picked out. I am rather in sympathy with the proposal to do away with anything in the nature of unnecessary display. But I am not prepared to begin with one individual, and to leave the others alone. To my mind, the only question is, whether this officer earns the proposed salary ; and, if the statement made by the  President  is right - as I have no doubt it is - he does. Therefore, I shall support the item. </para>

                    <para>. - I intend to support the request, though perhaps on different grounds from other senators. The  President  has enumerated the duties which this officer has to perform. If the performance of those duties is worth the amount which was paid to his predecessor, he should receive the salary of &#163;550  at  once. If he is not worth that amount now, he will not be worth it in three years&#39; time. I object to any member of the Senate having the power to recommend an officer for an increase of ^33 6s. 8d. a year. Let the Ministry take the responsibility of recommending any increase, and do not let the recommendation come from the  President.  I have no personal ill-will against this officer. If he is worth a salary of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;550,</inline> I am quite prepared to vote it. But I do not see why, after having acted in the position for over twelve months, he is not entitled to receive the full salary if he is entitled to receive anything. For that reason I intend to vote to strike out the item. I do not want to see a man sweated for three years, and this officer is being put in that position. It is of no use to tell us about his duties, because we all happen to know the duties of parliamentary officers. In this case we should be told straight out that the salary of .&#163;475 a year is sufficient. It is a very fair salary, I admit. But I oppose the item on the ground that the officer should get either <inline font-style="italic">&#163;550</inline> a year or nothing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> laughs. But he is like a good many other persons. Whenever any reform is attempted we always find gentlemen of his calibre resisting it. We must make a beginning some day. Unfortunately, in every Parliament exactly the same &#34;cry is raised by opponents of reform, &#34; Oh, don&#39;t do this or that.&#34; But we must begin some day. In this instance I am beginning to-day. We had a decent vote to-day, and I think that if we keep on hammering away we shall in time get a vote which will put a stop to all this humbug. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is desirous of wiping out this office, for which a salary of ^475 is required, on the ground that it is a superfluity. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> supports his request on the ground, not that it is a superfluity, but that the officer is inadequately paid. He goes further, and says that, in his opinion, the officer is sweated, while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is desirous of wiping out the office, on the- ground that the officer is overpaid. The main objection which has been raised to the position occupied by the officer is that his garb is of such a character that it does not please certain honorable senators. We have been informed by the  President  that this officer fills other positions. </para>

                        <para>- I withdraw the word. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has made many remarks with regard to the dress of this official, but we know that either by precedent or regulation these officials are bound to wear a certain dress. In the circumstances, why on earth <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> and other honorable senators should make their remarks personal in the way they have done, I am at a loss to understand. I consider it remarkably bad form in making an attack upon an official, to hold up to ridicule the dress he wears, when we know that following custom, precedent, or regulation, he is&#39; forced to wear that dress. If honorable senators object to the dress of officials, they should take action in a straightforward way, and give a distinct instruction to the  President  and officials as to the dress which they should wear. It is remarkably bad form, and a shameful waste of time to discuss these matters in such a way. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not understand why so much heat should be introduced into the debate, or why I should be accused of having any personal animus in this matter towards the present occupant of the office of Usher of the Black Rod. I have no such feeling&#39;. I am trying to perform what I regard as a public duty, and under very great difficulties, because I meet with but scant sympathy in quarters where I might reasonably took for different treatment. Let us analyze this item. The first position held by the officer under discussion is that of  Clerk  of Select Committees. It would have assisted honorable senators if the  President  had been able to give some information as to the number of Select Committees that have been appointed during the present financial year. I believe that there has not been one, so that the work of this officer under this head amounts to next to nothing. Then he occupies the position of Usher of the Black Rod. We know something of the duties of that office, and I want to ask honorable senators whether they think that the work performed by the Usher of the Black Rod is worth &#163;475 a year. We know that he stands on the platform at the rear entrance to the chamber, bows,, and says, &#34; Gentlemen, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President&#34;</inline> at the opening of each sitting. After the  President  has engaged in prayer, and opened the proceedings of the Senate, the Usher of the Black Rod comes and sits in a seat opposite to where I stand. </para>

                        <para>- I am not satisfying <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> just now, and consequently he is in a bit of a temper. I am not exactly pleasing him at this moment, and therefore he is inclined to snarl a little. But I have shown that the officer whose salary is under consideration has performed no work as Secretary of Select Committees appointed by the Senate during the current financial year. I have also pointed out that he has very little work to do as Usher of the Black Rod. In his capacity as Secretary of the Joint House Committee, the  President  knows the amount of work that he has to perform. The  President  probably knows how often that Committee meets. I say that it is absolutely ridiculous - that it is a shameful waste of public money - t&#176; Pay <inline font-style="italic">&#163;475</inline> a year to this officer for discharging these duties. I will tell honorable senators the practice which is adopted in the Legislative Council of Queensland. There the  Clerk  of the Council also acts as Usher of the Black Rod. The two offices are combined, and the Occupant of them is paid a salary of &#163;400 a year. In the Legislative Assembly of Queensland there are seventy-two members, many of whom are very much more unruly than are honorable members of the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and at a considerable saving upon the present expenditure. My parliamentary experience has taught me that the Usher of the Black Rod is almost an unknown quantity. In the Legislative Council of South Australia, which maintains just as much dignity as does this Senate, his principal duty is dispensed with by the ringing of an electric bell. The only other duty which is discharged by our own Usher of the Black Rod consists of bearing to the other Chamber a message announcing that  His Excellency  the Governor-General desires the presence of its members in the Senate. That work,.- I maintain, could be equally well done by the  Clerk  Assistant. If the Clerks at the table require extra assistance, by all means let us provide it, but do not let us make provision for continuing the office of Usher of the Black Rod. I recognise that there is an absolute necessity for some officer to be in training to fill the positions of  Clerk  Assistant and  Clerk  of the Senate. But there is no necessity whatever to retain the office of Usher of the Black Rod. </para>

                <para>I venture to say that we have not the slightest justification for voting the money. I do not wish to use too strong language, but I regard the proposed vote as one to appropriate other people&#39;s money. Why should we vote ourselves&#163;100 for the conveyance of our luggage? Upon what ground ? Is the object in view that we may add to our parliamentary allowance, which comes in quite another category, and which is not voted in the annual Appropriation Bill ? If we carry the idea thus far, </para>
                <para>We  might just as well go a little further, and vote&#163;100 or&#163;500 to cover the cost of honorable senators&#39; lodging in Melbourne. There is an extremely narrow margin between the two things. Of course, I cannot particularize members of the Senate ; but I think that I may, without offence, speak of the representatives of the different States. Practically no portion of this&#163;100 is spent on senators for the State of Victoria. It is hardly conceivable that any senator from that State makes any demand upon the funds. In the same way demands upon the fund are rarely made by. senators from Queensland. </para>

                        <para>- Practically the vote does not apply to them. For precisely similar reasons it does not generally apply to senators from Western Australia. But it does apply to senators who travel frequently from the States of South Australia, New South Wales, and Tasmania. Practically speaking, we may say that the whole of this item is devoted to the convenience of the senators from those three States. </para>

                        <para>- I do not intend to enter into minute details. But I say that the principle is utterly wrong and indefensible. I do not think that we have the slightest justification for voting this amount. As we are entering upon the consideration of this Appropriation Bill with a desire to effect economies, let us start at home, and reduce amounts affecting ourselves. The very fact that the money is spent on senators from only three States - including my own - is a reason for not agreeing to it. Imagine the effect if it were published throughout the Commonwealth that we voted this money for our </para>

                            Russell can talk about the poor attendance, and if he likes to particularize senators - as I have not done - and to display bad taste which I reprehend, he is at liberty to do so. If he cares to apply his remarks to me, I am quite willing to answer him. If he applies them to other honorable senators who are not now present I say that they are cowardly and unworthy. I have refrained from referring to individuals. This is a general item which I consider to be a disgrace to the Senate. What would be said if it were placarded throughout Australia that senators vote themselves  &#163;100  to pay for their cab hire. It is, in my opinion, a disgraceful thing for senators to vote  &#163;100  for such a purpose. Their luggage should be carried at their own cost.

                        <para>- I pointed out how the vote affected senators from certain States, because, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> knows, sometimes an argument that does not appear to be powerful to one&#39;s own mind, has an unsuspected effect upon the minds of others. I might have been open to suspicion if I had not pointed out that the item mainly affects the senators from three States. But my objection to the item is one of principle, and I hope that other honorable senators will join in supporting the motion - </para>

                        <para>- I am not familiar with what is done in Sydney, but it is a fact that when cabs are placed at the disposal of the members of the Federal Parliament, when there is a late sitting, the fares are paid by the Ministry. I consider that we ought to set an example and wipe out this vote. If honorable senators from distant States have a large amount of personal luggage, there is no reason why the taxpayers should be called upon to pay for its conveyance. I shall support the request. </para>

                    <para>. - I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> that senators who travel on Inter-State trains have no more right to have their luggage conveyed to and from the railway station at Commonwealth expense than members of Parliament have to be provided with cabs when Parliament sits late. But what is the position in regard to this vote for the conveyance of luggage? Since I have been a member of this Parliament it has been my practice never to leave the chamber until the  President  leaves the chair, and, except for the conveyance provided on Fridays, I should frequently have had to kick my heels around Melbourne instead of going home at the week end. . </para>

When I see that they are prepared to decline to receive railway fares or steamboat fares, or other services, then I shall begin to believe that they have a legitimate claim to invite me to join with them in striking out the item. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to point out that there is some excuse for this item appearing on the Estimates. Some years ago the cabmen of this city demanded very exorbitant fares, and at that time an influential member of Parliament suggested that one general cab should be provided. I believe that was the reason why the custom was instituted. I do not intend to defend the item, because I think that members of Parliament might very well pay for these small services. </para>

                        <para>- We might each buy a sixpenny packet of letter paper in the street, and economy would be carried out so rigidly that no complaint would be made outside. I do not avail myself of the cab or travelling accommodation more than about once in a session. I do not know whether it will ever save me a sixpence, but up to the present moment it has not. At the same time, I recognise that it is a great convenience to members of Parliament who reside in other States, and who, geographically speaking, are in a somewhat better situation than I am. If I could repair to my home at every week-end I should do so most willingly. I only stay here because I am compelled to do so. I think that it would be a mistake to abolish the convenience which is provided by the carrying of luggage to the railway station, unless, of course; we are prepared to adopt the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and to abolish every privilege apart from cur salary; and then probably honorable senators would recognise the necessity of raising the salary to something like  &#163;1,000  a year, to enable us to pay for all these conveniences. Were they not provided at the present time, I do not know exactly the position in which some of us would be placed. I recognise that it is only fair to avoid extravagant expenditure of public money ; but when members of Parliament have to undergo so many inconveniences, I consider that this item, can be legitimately defended here. So long as I am here I shall not attempt to cut out the item, unless I am satisfied that every item of a cognate character is to be cut out, so that every member of Parliament shall be on precisely the same footing. On one occasion a record was taken of the postage stamps supplied to honorable senators, and it was ascertained that the individual amounts for the session, varied from  &#163;1  to  &#163;15,  so that greater conveniences were enjoyed by some than by others. The maintenance of this cab service enables an honorable senator to devote to public business here time which otherwise would be expended by him in taking his luggage to the railway station or the steamboat. </para>

With respect to the item &#34; Travelling expenses,&#34; let me say that when the Estimates were being made up for the first Parliament it was thought that some travelling expenses would be incurred. Honorable senators will see that votes for travelling expenses appear in the Estimates for every Department in the Public Service. Such a vote was included in the Estimates for the Senate, and it has never been eliminated, although as a matter of fact, no travelling expenses have been incurred. During the present financial year&#163;55 of the vote has been expended on the conveyance of senators&#39; luggage. </para>

Without any hypocrisy I may say that I certainly expected something better from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> I was astounded to find the honorable senator suggesting that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> and myself are posing as political purists because we can get no advantage out of this particular vote. I have had to listen to interjections from an honorable senator who sits behind me, and who has accused me of advertising , myself. I can leave it to the Committee to say whether I am in the habit of advertising myself. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to discuss the item &#34; Incidental and petty cash expenditure,&#163;80,&#34; in division 1, &#34; The Senate.&#34; I do not know what this vote is intended to cover, but I assume that it is used to maintain the ridiculous paraphernalia and dress in which apparently the officers of the Senate are compelled to rig themselves out. I notice that the  President  is expected to preside in this Chamber in a ridiculous wig and gown. In fact, the only officer of the Senate who seems to be permitted to act as a sensible individual is the  Chairman  of Committees, who is allowed to take his chair in ordinary dress. The wig and gown of the  President  might have been appropriate five centuries ago. But in this twentieth century they are altogether out of place. I am satisfied that the  President  would prefer to take the chair in his ordinary dress. It can be no pleasure to him on a sweltering day in summer to have his head wrapped up in 5 or 8 lbs. of curled horse-hair. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so; but when such statements are made in this Chamber, people outside may be led to believe that there is some truth in them. No portion Of the President&#39;s official dress is paid for by the Commonwealth. As to the purpose of the vote to which the honorable senator has directed attention, he must be aware that, in all large Departments, contingencies have to be met. The vote is used, among other purposes, to provide uniforms for the messengers, and for the cost of such requisites as typewriting machines, which have been secured at the request of honorable senators, for their convenience, and other necessary and reasonable requirements. Honorable senators will recognise that &#163;80 is a very small vote to cover the incidental and petty cash expenditure of such a large establishment as the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to obtain an expression of opinion from the Committee as to whether the officers of the Senate, such as the clerks at the table, the Usher of the Black Rod, and the messengers, should be burdened with uniforms, wigs, and other paraphernalia, which I regard as perfectly ridiculous. As the proposed vote of&#163;80 covers the expenditure incurred under this heading, I intend to test the feeling of honorable senators upon it. Personally, I am strongly opposed to the wearing of uniform by any of our officers, but especially by the messengers. I claim that by putting them in uniform - just as every big nob does his servants - we reduce them to the level of lackeys. The practice does not accord with the democratic spirit of the Senate.I wish the Senate to resort to more sensible methods of conducting its business, and therefore I move - </para>

I have been assured that the typists themselves would prefer to accept even 10s. per week if they were placed upon the permanent list of public servants rather than continue at their present salary of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4</inline> 10s. per week whilst the Houses are in session. Of course, it may be urged that only limited employment can be provided for these men whilst Parliament is in recess. But I would point out that they are not ordinary typists, but men who represent the very best class of operators to be found in our cities. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that work can be found for them. Seeing that the very best class of typists are required in connexion with the transcription of our Parliamentary Debates, it seems rather hard that they should be employed only for a certain number of months during the year. In view of the large number of Departments which are under the control of the Commonwealth, it ought to be easy to provide them with constant employment. I understand that they are willing to accept a reduction of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> per week in their salaries if they are placed upon the permanent staff, and I think that the Government ought to consider whether something cannot be done for them. </para>

                    in the other House, and he promised to consult with me with a view to seeing if any recommendation in favour of providing the typists in question with permanent employment could be made. Upon making inquiry, we found that there are six sessional typists employed at a salary of
                    <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4</inline>
                    10s. per week. Their salaries average about ^170 or ;&#163;i8o a year. During recess, they are perfectly free to enter into any engagements that they choose, and if their services during the previous session have been of a satisfactory character, they are always re-employed if they are willing to re-engage. But, during the recess, there is not sufficient in their own class of work to keep them employed, and, as a result, they would - if appointed permanently - really be idle during that period. Of course, if they were appointed to the permanent staff, they would be precluded from accepting outside work.

                        <para>- We are not discussing the question of whether they are expert shorthand writers, but of whether it is desirable that they should be appointed to the permanent staff. The honorable senator has suggested that there are other Departments in which their services might be utilized during the recess. Upon this point, the Public Service Commissioner has been consulted, and he reports that in response to previous communications on this subject, very little work of the nature in question could be found in the Departments for parliamentary typists, the clerical staffs, including typists, who in ordinary circumstances are not in need of relief, being quite able to cope even with many of the exceptional demands made upon their services. So that, from the departmental point of view, there would be no advantage in transferring these typists to the permanent staff. Nor do I think it is desirable, in their own interests, that they should be permanently appointed at a salary of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;i&#38;o</inline> a year. It is very necessary that they should be very expert typist, and, with that object in view, an effort has always been made to secure the most efficient men offering. The Principal Parliamentary Reporter has informed me that he experiences no difficulty in obtaining typists  of this character. Whenever vacancies occur, the practice is to fill them &#39;by drawing in turn upon the different States. The Department has carefully abstained from keeping these positions open only to applicants from a particular State. I mention this matter, because it is desirable that honorable senators should know the plan which has been followed. I believe that the last typists appointed were secured .from Adelaide. Previously they had been obtained from Sydney. Although the mat1ter has not been formally settled, I may say that, after consulting with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and the Principal Parliamentary Reporter, it does not seem to me that the present position would be improved, from the stand-point of efficiency, by the appointment of permanent typists. </para>

I understand that the Government contemplate stopping or curtailing the present privilege. Whether it is intended to save money I do not know ; but if there is to be an alteration, I should like to know the reason for it. It is a great convenience to honorable senators to be able to take from the Library standard works having reference to questions under consideration by Parliament. It will be a disadvantage if we are deprived of the opportunity of studying those works at home, and have to come to the Library every time we want to look at them. </para>

                        <para>- Given a strict interpretation, the vote of&#163;1,800 for books and book-binding is, in the opinion of the Library Committee, intended for the purchase of books to be added permanently to the Library. That view being taken, the question arose as to whether any portion of that sum should be spent on the purchase of books which are not intended to be added to the Library, but which belong to the class of light literature. As a rule, books of that character are supplied to us at an agreed price. We keep them for six months, and then they are repurchased from us at9d. per volume. We pay  2s.  or more per volume for the books in the first instance. Personally, I have always regarded light literature as being of considerable service to members of Parliament, who have to travel to and from Melbourne in the Inter-State trains. Many complaints have been made as to the class of books obtained in this way, and when we inquired as to obtaining a more expensive type of book, we found that the extra expense would be considerable - over  50  per cent., in fact. The Committee deliberated, and the decision was that the present arrangement should be continued until after the recess, and a request was made to the Government to place a sum upon the Estimates for the acquisition of books which are not intended to be added to the permanent library. It will be open to honorable senators to say whether they desire the continuance of the convenience which they have hitherto enjoyed; but until honorable senators have had an opportunity of expressing their opinion, it is proposed to continue the present system. Another question relative to the Library is this. There are certain reference books as to which the rule has been that they shall not be removed from the Library. The reason for that is that they should always be available for the use of the members of this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- Unfortunately the rule has not been adhered to strictly, and the Committee have given instructions to the Librarian that it is to be strictly enforced in future. An exception has, however, been made to the rule. We possess a number of books relating to constitutional law, and particularly embodying and discussing decisions given by the Courts in the United States. As honorable senators are aware, American decisions are in many instances pertinent to points of law arising in our own High Court. At present the Library of the High Court does not embrace the whole of the valuable works possessed by the Commonwealth Parliamentary Library. Consequently the Judges have been in the habit of sending to the Library to obtain the loan of such books as it might be necessary for them to consult before giving judgment. The Library Committee considered that it was wise to permit such books to be borrowed by the Judges as long as a written request for the loan of any particular work was sent. The Committee were largely actuated by the consideration that the judgments of the High Court affect the public interest to such an important degree that it is desirable that every facility should be given to the Judges to consult works dealing with constitutional questions. Until the High Court Library is fully supplied with the necessary works, we consider that if there is any book in our Library which the Judges would like to see the public interest demands that it should be lent to them. I have no doubt, however, that steps will be taken by the Government to supply the necessary funds in order that all books which ought to be in the High Court Library shall be furnished. </para>

                    <para>. - I take it that division 6, &#34; Water power for Parliament House,&#34; covers the supply of water to the urinals and other conveniences at Parliament House. Changes have recently been made affecting the draining of the building. So far as concerns the supply of water to the urinals on the floor on a level with this chamber, I consider that the new system is less satisfactory than the old one. It may be economical, but there is not the slightest doubt that the place opposite the lavatory is inclined to smell more than it did before the structural alterations were made - and that is saying a good deal. I am not prepared to ask the Government to have the system altered, but I do not think that we can be very well satisfied with the new plan under which you press a knob and water does not come. At any rate, some improvement should be made, so that when the knob is pressed water may come. </para>

I have not made any inquiries into his antecedents, but I understand he has been employed in this capacity for six or seven years? I desire to know the process by which he can hope to look for promotion. Is he to remain always as lift attendant unless he severs his connexion with Parliament House and looks for employment in another direction ? Is he to remain here as lift attendant until he grows grey-haired, and is pensioned off under the old-age pensions system ? Every youth who enters the parliamentary service should be able to look forward to reasonable promotion, if he does his work properly and behaves himself. I suppose that this youth is now twenty-six or twenty-seven years of age. I shall be glad if the Minister can explain whether such an employe has any possible opportunity of getting promotion here. </para>

A  position is always accepted with the knowledge that the possibility of advancement is extremely limited.

If any position for which he was eligible became vacant his claim would be carefully considered. There would be no desire on the part of either

                    or myself to introduce a stranger to fill any position to which he could fairly and reasonably expect promotion. But as the Minister has pointed out, the opportunities for promotion are very limited, while possibilities of exchange from one Department to another are very remote.

                <para>That the House of Representatives be requested to reduce the item, &#34; Secretary, ^900,&#34; by  &#163;100. </para>
                <para class="block">When it was proposed some time ago to raise the salary of this officer from j&#163;750 to &#163;800, I moved a request to restore the former amount, believing that his services would always be fairly well remunerated at that salary. But the Senate did not see eye to eye with me and voted &#163;800. On this occasion we are asked to vote &#163;900. It is very strange that large increments should be submitted in the Estimates without any statement as to an increase of duties or responsibilities. Because that officer has been in an office for a certain number of years, quite irrespective of whether it demands any higher remuneration, he is put down for .an increase of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100</inline> a year. It does appear as though &#163;100 was a mere nothing. At the same time, we are cavilling about the difficulties of our financial position. Every speaker on finance during the last two days has alluded to an extreme moment when we shall not know which way to turn in order to obtain the funds with which to meet our liabilities. Nevertheless, we are asked, without any reason assigned, to increase a salary of &#163;800 by &#163;100. If an increase of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;,S&#176;&#62;</inline> 0r <inline font-style="italic">&#163;&#38;o,</inline> or even &#163;100, had been proposed for some of the officers who are being paid at the rate of &#163;150, I do not know that I should have raised my voice in opposition ; but when I notice that a man who is working for <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> or &#163;3 a week is an unconsidered quantity so far as theseEstimates are concerned, while a man with a salary of &#163;800, whether his services are very great or very small, is set down, without rhyme or reason, for an increase ot &#163;100, I begin to question the wisdom of the proposal. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, I think it is fair to assume that the Secretary to the Department of External Affairs is excellently remunerated at a salary of &#163;800. if, of course, it could be shown that his services are of such great value to the Commonwealth as to demand higher remuneration, I do not know that T should offer any particular objection; but, in all the circumstances, I believe that he is amply paid for every service he renders with a salary of &#163;800, and, therefore, I submit this request, hoping that it will be carried. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline>
                    has seen fit to submit the request. He said that, if he could be assured that the services of this officer warranted the proposed increase, he would adopt a different tone. The increments proposed for this officer, and other heads of Departments, were considered very carefully and thoughtfully by the members of the late Government. The ex-Prime Minister, under whom this officer worked for many years, might be regarded as the most capable judge of his merits. He was so impressed with the ability, conscientiousness, and deservedness of the Secretary, that he recommended that his salary should be increased by  &#163;100.

                        <para>- I am not complaining of that. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> asked me to give some evidence to justify the proposed increase in the salary of this officer. I have given the testimony of the late Prime Minister, who gave the members of his Government the assurance that this officer&#39;s merits did warrant the proposed increase. What I have said with respect to this officer I shall be prepared to repeat concerning <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garran, Colonel Miller,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allen.</inline> Any one who has come into contact with these officers must be satisfied as to their efficiency, zeal, and anxiety to do justice to the important positions which they hold. It is unreasonable to suggest that, whilst increases are proposed to the heads of Departments, officers occupying more humble positions have been, neglected. I hope that Parliament will always be anxious to do justice to every one in the Public Service, no matter what position he holds. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> can bring under notice a case in which an officer occupying a humble position in the service is not receiving justice, I will say that that case should receive every consideration. </para>

                        <para>- Every one must acknowledge that the work of the External Affairs Department, as well as every other Department of the Commonwealth Public Service, is growing, and must continue to grow. With respect to lift attendants and men occupying similar positions in the service, I believe that the Estimates for past years, as well as those now under consideration, disclose the fact that they have been very fairly considered. I might inform <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> that last year &#163;54,000 was distributed as increments of salary to officers in the humbler grades of the service, and this year it is proposed to distribute  . &#163;10,000  in the same way. I am satisfied that these officers deserve the increases granted to them. The increases proposed in these Estimates for officers of the administrative staffs total no more than &#163;400. It is not fair for honorable senators to be mean in dealing with such a matter. If a proposal were made involving the expenditure of hundreds of thousands of pounds, honorable senators would have something to talk to the country about ; but it is hardly fair that this increase should be opposed in the way in which some honorable senators are opposing it. I agree to a very great extent with what has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> as to the merits of the officer filling the position of Secretary to the External Affairs Department at the present time. I have always found him courteous and willing to give information, and to assist those visiting his office to carry out the object they have in view. If there is an office in the service requiring high qualifications in the man called upon to fill it, it is the office of Secretary to the External Affairs Department. </para>

                        <para>- Such an officer must possess great ability and discretion. He has to keep the secrets of the Government and the Department to which he is attached, and, so far as I can learn, not the slightest suspicion has been cast upon the officer now holding the position, as to the way in which he has performed his duties during his term of service. The External Affairs Department has charge of communications with the rest of the world, and I understand that it is the experience of the late Minister of External Affairs, as well as of the present Minister, that in connexion with the correspondence between the  Commonwealth and the outside world, the officer occupying this position has displayed great efficiency. It is all very well to say that officers receiving  &#163;150  a year should receive greater consideration. I have always contended that the men receiving the lower salaries are entitled to every consideration ; but, when we come to deal with officers occupying important positions, we should recognise that a false step or injudicious action on their part might involve the Commonwealth, in enormous expenditure, the cause of which might escape the attention of the public and of Parliament. Members of the Senate should recognise, as honorable members elsewhere have done, that the men occupying such positions should be given some little encouragement to faithfully perform the duties of their office. </para>

                        <para>- If I am I shall not require any greasing. I do not hold the present Government responsible for these increases. They have accepted a position which has been forced upon them owing to the late period of the session at which they assumed office. I am satisfied that if they had had time to prepare Estimates for themselves, they would have adopted a different policy. I have no wish, in dealing with this matter, to refer personally to the officer who occupies the position of Secretary to the External Affairs Department ; but when we are told that we require in such an officer great discretion and ability, my reply is that that is what we are paying . &#163;800 a year for. If we wish to secure a figurehead for the position, we should be able to get one for much less than &#163;800 a year. </para>

                        <para>- I am quite certain that no one will characterize me as a public sweater when I am prepared to vote for a salary of &#163;800 a year for the performance of the duties attached to this office. When the Vice-President of the Executive Council talks of sweating I remind him that at the present time, the Government are calling for applications for storemen in the Customs Department in North Queensland at 7s. per day, when private firms offer for similar positions&#163;3 10s. and  &#163;4  per week ; and labourers employed by the Harbor Trust and municipalities at the place to which I refer receive 9s. per day. The honorable senator suggests that I may be called a public sweater, if I refuse an increase of  &#163;100  a year to an officer who is already in receipt of&#163;800 a year, I should like the Government to exhibit the same solicitude for the welfare of officers in the lower grades of the service that they display for those in the higher grades. The Vice-President of the Executive Council stated a few minutes ago that the sum of &#163;54,000 had been provided for increments to the paid officers of the service. But that amount represents only statutory increments, and when we bear in mind that there are many thousands of officers in our Public Service it at once becomes apparent that that amount represents a mere trifle. In the present instance, however, we are dealing with an officer who is fairly well paid, and whose duties are not too strenuous. He is already receiving <inline font-style="italic">&#163;800</inline> a year. We have been told that for a number of years he has been waiting for an increase. May I point out that he has only been in the service for seven years, and that at the end of the first three years of his service his salary was increased. Yet there are officers in receipt of  &#163;100  and  &#163;200  a year who have not had an increment for twenty years. I think that I have said sufficient to show that in the granting of these increments no system has been followed. What reason is there for singling out for large increments a few officers who are at the top of the tree, whilst ignoring the claims of the great majority of our public servants? I hope that in justice to the entire service the Committee will see that this system of extending generosity to a few favoured individuals is nipped in the bud. </para>

                    <para>. - In discussing this question I think it is desirable that we should obtain a correct view of the importance to Australia of the Department of External Affairs. If honorable senators will look at the Estimates they will see that the work of that Department touches a great many matters of vital importance to the Commonwealth. For instance, it has to administer the Immigration Restriction Act, the mail services to the New Hebrides, and the South Sea Islands generally are under its control, as is also the administration of Papua. The affairs of Papua alone occupy its attention to a very considerable extent. The work that has to be performed in connexion with the administration of the Immigration Restriction Act is very great, and the officer who is in charge of the Department must have gained a great deal of experience during the eight years that have elapsed since his appointment. Consequently his services ought to be much more valuable to Australia to-day than they were formerly. Personally I have always found <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt careful, attentive, and a master of the work which he has to perform, and I think that the increment proposed is only a reasonable recognition of merit. </para>

If I could be convinced that he possesses that capability I should probably vote for the proposed increase. But I entertain very serious doubts as to whether it is wise for us to authorize the payment of an increment in his case, and also as to whether he deserves it. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has urged, as one of the strongest claims of this particular officer, that he is able to hold his tongue. If the possession of that qualification constitutes a claim for advancement, it appears to me that the greatest dullard in the community would be entitled to a far larger salary than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt. </para>

                <para class="block">Thus we have <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt declaring that we cannot have a tropical agriculture in Australia unless we have a slave race, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> simultaneously claiming that, given reasonable wages, white men can do the work required in our cane-fields. That is an instance in which unfortunately <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunt</inline> did not hold his tongue. To my mind it is complete evidence that that officer, to whom we are now asked to grant an increase of &#163;100, should be allowed to remain at his handsome salary of &#163;800 per annum until he has learned to hold his tongue. I may perhaps be pardoned for referring to the appalling muddling that has characterized the action which has been taken in connexion with the land scandals in Papua. We know perfectly well that the officer at the head of this Department is expected to act as a guide to Ministers. Yet in connexion with the scandals to which&#39; I have alluded, letters which have been written one day, have had to be contradicted the next - a position of affairs which, must be very humiliating to the Commonwealth Government and to members of this Parliament who have had to back up the Ministry in the very devious course of action it has pursued, owing to the incompetence of the head of this Department. But even if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt could hold his tongue, there are times when it would have been better that he should not have done so, but when he should have used it for the benefit- of Australia. I refer particularly to an occasion in  1904,  when I was* the humble instrument who directed the attention of the Queensland Government, and through it, of the Federal Government, to the undoubted evidence which existed! that Chinese were being surreptitiously introduced into Australia, despite the provisions of the Immigration Restriction Act. I am not in a position to say what occurred1 between the Queensland Government and1 the Federal Government during the ensuing two years. But at the beginning of last year I made it my business to lay exactly the same position before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt in his own office. He said that what I represented might have been true in the past ; but he was perfectly satisfied that it was not true now. Talking about the improper landing of Chinese in the Far North, he set forth, in a marvellously intelligent explanation, that the viciousness of the savage blacks there was such that they would never allow a Chinaman to land. Since this occurred, further inquiries have been made, and at this very moment the Government have a Bill on the stocks to enable - them to make further efforts to deal with the illicit importation of coloured aliens. Consequently, after four years, the permanent head of the External Affairs Department has had to admit that what he was told four years ago and two years ago, and then denied, is true. I propose to say no more on the subject. I am not going behind any man&#39;s back in saying that, in my opinion, the Secretary of the Department should not receive an increase in his salary. I do not say that because I think that, under all circumstances, a higher salary should not be paid to the Secretary of the Department. I should be prepared to pay more to a perfectly competent officer. But I do not believe, from the evidence before me, that this officer is competent enough to merit an increase in his salary, and I have reasonable doubts as to whether he is competent to earn the salary that he is now receiving. </para>

                        <para>- What <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt said, according to the extract, was that the Northern Territory was suitable for pastoral and dairying purposes ; and then he was asked by the writer, whoever he may be, &#34; What about tropical agriculture?&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt said, as I gathered, that the Government had no intentions in connexion with tropical agriculture, as they meant to maintain the principle of a White Australia. Exactly what that meant I am not sure. There are <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> hundred and one tropical industries that might have been in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt&#39;s mind at the time. But I always entertain some doubt about the accuracy of interviews with public men which are printed either in England or in Australia. Even if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt said what was represented, he might have had in his mind some of the industries carried on in China or India, which there is no probability of introducing into any part of Australia. I do not believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt had any idea of alluding to the sugar industry, or any other industry, conducted in Queensland. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> seems to be almost exasperated because the Secretary of the Department did not agree with something that he said two years ago concerning the introduction of Asiatic aliens into North Queensland. I should like the position to be clearly understood. I do not suppose that there will be any great anxiety on the part of Chinamen to land in those parts of Australia where the aboriginals are numerous and savage. But we have had evidence of the surreptitious entry of Chinese into Australia, not in the Far North, but in. Brisbane, Sydney, and Fremantle. I do not suppose that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt had any knowledge of these practices at the time he was interviewed. The fact of the entry of the Chinese is only becoming public property now. I hope the, the practice will be stopped, ind I am quite sure that the Secretary of External Affairs is anxious to assist in stopping it. </para>

As far as the whole service is concerned, the increments amount to over ^26,000 on the present Estimates. This fact shows that the services of officers in the lower grades are being recognised.

Not only did <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt, as reported in this newspaper, cast a reflection on Queensland, but, apparently, a most unfortunate utterance was made by the ex-Prime Minister at the Colonial Conference. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Mackay, when dealing with the navigation proposal^, quoted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> as saying that the tropical conditions of labour in &#34;Queensland would probably be found to be similar to those in India, and that white men would not be able to do certain work, which in India was done by Hindoos. It ls quite true that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> afterwards made some remarks in which he explained his position. But I think it is unfortunate that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Mackay derived his impression from what the ex-Prime Minister said, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin&#39;s</inline> own explanation, as reported in the minutes of the Conference, was unfortunate as affecting Queensland.

                        <para>- I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that, however well informed <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Mackay may be, I know rather more about tropical Queensland than he does. What he said about tropical conditions in that State was a gross misrepresentation. The position as to the influx of aliens, and especially of Chinese, has not been properly understood by the Commonwealth Government. When the position was put to the officials of the External Affairs Department, they always assumed that their machinery for excluding the Chinese from Australia was so superior that the&#39; Asiatics could not come. When reports, and sometimes statistics, were shown to the Commonwealth officials indicating an influx equal to what was going on before Federation,, they refused to believe it, and made a comparison based on the assumption that the Queensland Government before Federation connived at the introduction of Chinese. The representations made were set on one side, r.nd not attended to as they ought to have been. </para>

                        <para>- At any rate, all the judicial proceedings which have arisen out of the Immigration Restriction Act have passed through the Department of External Affairs, which I hold responsible. About four or five years ago, this question called for a great deal of consideration in Queensland. I happened to be present at an interview which had been arranged by the Minister of the Crown with on-i of the largest planters in Queensland for the purpose of discussing a probable influx of Chinese. The planter said: &#34;We do not want to get Chinese into this country. We should prefer to have the white man all the time, because, economically, he is, as a rule, the best of all labour. But we cannot get him, &#39; &#39; and they were forced to use the kanakas they could get until they were finally deported. The planter in question made a remarkable statement to me. He said : &#34; If we wanted to get Chinese in today, we could.&#34; I pointed out to him the difficulty under the Immigration Restriction Act, and also the precautions which previously had been taken. &#34; In my opinion,&#34; he replied, &#34; they are not worth the paper on which they are written &#34; ; and he gave me his assurance that if he wanted 1,000 Chinese labourers he could, by writing to a certain quarter, have them delivered at a certain time almost like bales of goods. &#34; But,&#34; he added, &#34;it would be ruinous to try to get Chinese labour so long as there was a possibility of getting white labour.&#34; At that time, the planters were endeavouring as far as they could to look for white labour in every direction to supplant the labour of the kanakas, which had been displaced by our legislation. These facts were related to the Department of External Affairs. Whether it is strictly responsible or not, I am not going to consider at this moment, but it was informed of the facts, and they were practically laughed out  of  court. That shows a want of both attention and vigilance on the part of the officers of the Department regarding a most important subject, which, at any rate, requires some reflection, and it calls for some censure or remonstrance on the part of the Senate. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to make a few remarks regarding the method of conducting the offices of the Commonwealth in London, for which we are asked, in division 13, to vote . &#163;2,350. No provision is made there for the principal representative of the Commonwealth.  His  salary - and perhaps other expenses in connexion with the representation of the Commonwealth in London - is charged to the Defence Department. Although he has to do work in connexion with that Department in London, I do not think it will be contended that his salary is properly chargeable to it. We should be able to see at a glance what the representation of the Commonwealth costs. We can have no adequate idea of what it costs, unless the whole of the proposed expenditure is submitted to us under one heading. I protest against this irregular method of conducting the affairs of the Commonwealth. The Defence Department should not be charged with the salary of Captain Collins, while he is representing the Commonwealth in London. We ought to have a statement from the Ministry that that undesirable arrangement will not be continued. </para>

                    <para>. - I believe that every one agrees. to some extent with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has said ; but we must have some regard to the circumstances out of which the present position arose. I believe that Captain Collins was sent to London with the idea of attending to matters in connexion with the Defence Department; but there has been delay in the introduction of a Bill for the appointment of a High Commissioner, and the organization of an establishment in London. We do not desire to take any step which&#39; might hamper the High Commissioner when he is appointed in the selection of his staff.. It was thought that it would be a convenient thing to get Captain Collins to represent the Commonwealth while he was in London. Every one must acknowledge that he has done fairly well in the position.  His  salary is still paid by the Defence Department, but an allowance of &#163;150 is voted for the External Affairs Department, to cover his expenses in connexion with the representation of the Commonwealth. I hope - and so do my colleagues -that when the next Estimates are submitted, something will have been done  to  allocate the expenditure in a different manner. The probability is that the Commonwealth offices will then have been organized in a systematic way. The occupancy of the temporary position will give Captain Collins no preferential claim to any office under the High Commissioner. We have merely continued what has been the practice. I do not think that we can do anything else but pass the item, and&#34; afterwards, the Government will see whether something cannot be done to organize the London offices properly. </para>

                    <para>. - The position of affairs with regard to the representation of the Commonwealth in London is entirely unsatisfactory, as it has been for a very long time. I feel sure that things will be allowed to drift. The man, whoever he may be, who acts as the representative of the Commonwealth in London, is ridiculously remunerated at &#163;150 a year. On the other hand, it is improper and wrong to pay any person, whether he be Captain Collins or any one else, &#163;900 a year as Secretary for Defence, while he is, as he has been for years, out of the Commonwealth. I venture to say that no one could justify these positions. Something is utterly wrong with regard to our representation in London, and also with regard to our Defence Department. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> what is precisely the value of the services which Captain Collins renders in London at the present time. Is he wanted there? What important work does he discharge there for the Commonwealth ? What is there to warrant his continuance in his present position ? I think there is very little, but there is certainly every reason why the Defence Department, the condition of which is as chaotic now as it was seven years ago, should have the services of a Secretary resident in Australia. Although I dislike it intensely, I cannot avoid some personal references in connexion with this matter. I say, without the slightest fear of contradiction, that the contingency of Captain Collins finding himself in London, and on the spot to render the Commonwealth general services as its representative there, was contemplated and carefully considered before he left Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I make the statement with full responsibility for what I say, and with a certain amount of knowledge. I venture to say that the suggestion that Captain Collins, on his arrival in London, ostensibly for the purpose of supervising the purchase of warlike stores, should remain there and find himself useful to the Commonwealth as its representative in London, was one which did not come from any person occupying the exalted position of Prime Minister or Minister of External Affairs, or from any private member of the Federal Parliament. I venture to say that it came from the man most interested in the subject, Captain Collins himself. I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that his position in London at the present time is due to his own deliberate and successful attempt to secure it. He did secure it, and in my opinion wrongly. </para>

                        <para>- He went to London to prepare the way for himself. He has held the position now for some years, and apparently he will hold it for at least one year longer. The only way in which I can enter my protest against the arrangement - and I should like to do something besides merely talking about it - is to move that the House of Representatives be requested to leave out the item, &#34;Allowance to Captain Collins while acting as representative of Commonwealth in London, &#163;150.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- I might propose such a request if I fail to carry the request I have suggested. I am quite satisfied that Captain Collins was never appointed Secretary to the Defence Department in order that he might act as representative of the Commonwealth in London, and Parliament has never sanctioned the payment of his salary as such a representative. I see no reason why we should not go back to the position which existed when Captain Collins was allowed to go. Home as Secretary to the Defence Department to supervise the purchase of warlike stores. That, in my opinion, is the only way in which we can protest against a state of things which is muddling and chaotic, and which is not creditable to the Commonwealth Parliament. </para>

I may inform the Committee that the recommendation that Captain Collins should go to London was made by the Secretary to the Treasurer, since it was advisable that some one should be in London to represent the Treasurer at the time Captain Collins was sent Home. </para>

                        <para>- I have so far given only one reason why Captain Collins was sent to London. At the time Captain Collins was sent to London the Defence Department was making very large purchases there. It has continued to do so ever since, and it was considered that it would be a very good thing to have some one in London to represent the Commonwealth in exercising some supervision over these purchases, which involved the expenditure of from &#163;100,000 to . &#163;200,000 a year. The Minister of Defence informs me that last year about &#163;100,000 was spent in this way. </para>

                        <para>- I have no doubt that the Minister of Defence, when his Estimates are under consideration, will be able to tell the honorable senator why Captain Creswell was sent Home. I have told honorable senators what Captain Collins is doing in London. Until some change is made he is entitled to be considered as the Commonwealth representative in London. Honorable senators ask why the whole of his salary should not appear in the votes for the offices of the Commonwealth in London, but the difficulty is that if that course were pursued Captain Collins would have a claim to be appointed as Secretary to the High Commissioner when such an office is created. The present Government have no intention to appoint Captain Collins as Secretary to the High Commissioner. He is paid as Secretary to the Defence Department, and he has some claim to that position. </para>

                    <para>. - I feel that it is only fair to Captain Collins that I should say that when I was in London recently I took some trouble to ascertain what he was doing. I found that he took a great deal of trouble to begin with to secure a reduction in the bank charges, and he succeeded in doing so. He is also very useful indeed in giving information to members of Parliament and other persons from the Commonwealth visiting London. </para>

                        <para>- I can assure the Committee that Captain Collins occupies a very important position in London. After the request submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> is dealt with, I had it in mind to suggest that the allowance to Captain Collins be increased from &#163;150 to , &#163;300, because the man is out of pocket with the allowance at present given. Captain Collins may have wished to go to London himself. I do not say that he did not, but he is as useful there to the Commonwealth as many of the Agents-General are to the States which they represent. </para>

I do not wish to labour the matter, but I saw Captain Collins often, and heard a good deal about him. On more than one occasion he had to assert the pre-eminence of the Commonwealth over the States, and he went to some trouble to see that the Commonwealth advertisement should appear above those inserted by the States Governments. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> will probably follow me with even stronger remarks on this subject. I oppose the request, and, if I had my way, I should increase the allowance proposed. </para>

                        <para>- If it is contended that Captain Collins, as Secretary to the Defence Department, was sent Home to carry out a financial operation, we are getting very near the regions of &#34; Pinafore,&#34; and are trespassing upon the domain of Gilbert and Sullivan. I understood that Captain Collins was sent Home to supervise the purchase of military stores for the Commonwealth, but, without the matter having been brought before Parliament in any way, except indirectly, in the shape of a vote on the Estimates, the Federal Government took it upon themselves practically to establish a permanent office in London, and to appoint Captain Collins to the position of head of that office. He figures as the representative of the Commonwealth in London, and we are told that he left Australia for that purpose. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> who has some knowledge of human nature, says that Captain Collins left Australia with that intention. I think that is very probable; but it is more than curious that this state of affairs should have been allowed to continue from year to year. In the first instance, Captain Collins was sent Home to perform a specific duty in connexion with his own Department, and now he has apparently taken root in London, and figures on the Estimates, not as Secretary to the Defence Department, temporarily in London in connexion with the affairs of that Department, but as the full-blown representative of the Commonwealth Government. If we are to have an official representative of the Commonwealth in London, he should be properly appointed. I do not hold the Government responsible for the present position, but I do hope they will take immediate steps to remedy it. </para>

In my judgment, it would be most unjust to refuse to pay that officer the proposed allowance of&#163;150, seeing that he has actually expended the money for the benefit of Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - The proposal to reduce this item appears to me to be based upon very paltry grounds. If honorable senators are antagonistic to the way in which the Commonwealth Offices in London are managed, the obvious course open to them is to submit a proposal to reduce the total amount. It is very undesirable that arguments should be directed specifically at  Captain  Collins. When I was in London recently, I saw that officer upon two occasions. During my stay there, I had a good deal of correspondence with him, and I must say that he was very prompt and careful in all the work that he did for me. He even went to the length of cabling to Australia to obtain information for me. When I desired to ascertain whether the Tariff had passed both Houses of this Parliament he despatched a cable asking for the information. </para>

                        <para>- I will explain. A paragraph had appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">London Times,</inline> stating that the Tariff had passed the Commonwealth Parliament. Thereupon I wrote to Captain Collins, asking whether the announcement in question meant anything more than that the Tariff had passed the House of Representatives. He replied that he did not know, but that he had received other inquiries of the same kind, and was therefore cabling to Australia to ascertain the real position. Later on, I found that Captain Collins had an immense number of inquiries to reply to. At the time I saw him, in January last, he was doing a very considerable amount of work. I do not think it is fair that any dissatisfaction in regard to the way in which the business of the Commonwealth has been conducted in London should be voiced in submitting a proposal which is distinctly levelled at Captain Collins. </para>

                    <para>. - I would urge the Committee not to make the proposed alteration without very good reason. If honorable senators think that Captain Collins is too highly paid, their proper course is to move a reduction in his salary as Secretary of the Defence Department. But they must recognise that if they hold that he is not the officer who should have been sent to England to temporarily fill his present position, the proper time for them to have entered their protest against the adoption of that course was when the Estimates of two years ago were under consideration. For two years that officer has remained in London without any protest having teen made. </para>

Why, the Agent-General representing the smallest of the States receives a larger salary than does Captain Collins. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. Parliament has not passed the necessary legislation to enable a High Commissioner to be appointed. I speak from an entirely disinterested stand-point, because, when the first Estimates were submitted for our consideration, I moved to reduce the salary of Captain Collins to . &#163;750, because I thought there was no reason why he should receive more than the secretaries of other Departments.. That circumstance should1  prove that I have no desire to favour this officer. In conclusion, I would again point out that any alteration of these Estimates will place the Government in a most embarrassing position, inasmuch as it will then have to say that, in the opinion of the Senate, either the Commonwealth Offices in London should be abandoned, or Captain Collins should be recalled, because he is not fitted for his present position. </para>

                    <para>. - I regret that the Minister should have seemed to infer that the criticism which has been offered upon this item has been induced by a desire to embarrass the Government. I would point out to him that so far there is no evidence of party lines having been drawn anywhere. Even upon the proposal under consideration, to my surprise and regret, three of my honorable friends upon this side of the Chamber, have exhibited a desire to slavishly support the Government. Under the circumstances, it was a little inopportune for the Minister to make either the suggestion or the appeal which he did. Some of the criticism which has been levelled against this item he has entirely ignored. I have not questioned the qualifications of Captain Collins in the slightest degree, because I know nothing of that gentleman, or of his work. Hut it seems to me to be absolutely subversive of all parliamentary control for Ministers to be permitted to send the head of a Department, who is paid to be here - and whose duties here have to be discharged - to the other side of the world to temporarily fill an office, which he is now to be permitted to occupy permanently. Because objection has been urged to the course which has . been adopted, the Minister says, in effect, &#34;Seeing that you did not object when it appeared that Captain Collins was to occupy this position temporarily, you have no right to object now that he is to fill it permanently.&#34; Obviously, Parliament approved of Captain Coffins being sent to London as the Secretary of the Defence Department. But there seems to be a point at which it is called upon to interpose, and to say, &#34; This temporary arrangement has lasted long enough, and we ask the Government to terminate it, and to map out some definite course under which we may know in future that the Secretary of Defence is in the Defence Department, and that the representative of the Commonwealth is in his office in London.&#34; That is largely the purpose which the mover of the request has in view, and I would again suggest to the Minister that there has been no desire exhibited to embarrass the Government. </para>

                    CAMERON (Tasmania) &#91;4.30&#93;. - Ido not intend to waste the time of the Committee in discussing this question. But I cannot help taking exception to the tone in which the request was submitted. Where a Government take responsibility for the appointment of an officer, either temporarily or permanently, there is a way of expressing opposition to their action without casting any slur upon the officer. It is not, in my opinion, the business of the members of the Senate to attack an officer who is unable to defend himself. Let honorable senators attack the Government, if they like, but to attack an individual in the position of this officer is a cowardly thing to do.

It is cowardly to say such a thing. If the question is one of principle, relating to the appointment of Captain Collins to a position in London without filling the office of Secretary to the Defence Department in Australia, let it be discussed on that ground. I admit that there is something to be said from that point of view. But it is the Government that should be attacked for making the appointment, which was at first intended to be a temporary one. </para>

We have sent there one of our permanent officials, who knows the state of things in Australia, and knows his way about London. He is, I believe, carrying out his duties loyally and well in the interests of this country. Fair play should be given to this man. If honorable senators want to attack his office, let them do so by means of an attack upon the Government. But they should not attack the individual. To attack an unfortunate man who is unable to defend himself is anything but dignified, and anything but calculated to maintain a high sense of honour in the Senate. </para>

                    <para>. - I should not have risen again, but for the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> I should like to inform <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> in the first place that he is not the custodian of my honour, nor is he, except in a self-constituted fashion, the critic of my conduct. Whatever he chooses to say with regard to my cowardice, I can afford to laugh at. I am quite prepared to hold my own on questions of cowardice, but there is nothing cowardly in what I have done. 1 repeat every word that I have said. I made no personal attack upon Captain Collins. But I have said, and I repeat, that the Secretary of Defence, in the person of Captain Collins, is not the man who should have been sent Home as the representative of the Commonwealth. It astonished me that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron,</inline> whose interests are almost entirely centred in the Defence Forces of this country - or, rather, who takes more interest in the defences of the Commonwealth than does any other man present - should have appeared to-day as the advocate of the continuance of the Secretary of Defence in London. What does it mean ? It surely cannot mean that Captain Collins in his present position can exercise any influence in the direction of maintaining the Defence Forces in a proper condition of efficiency? How any man who has the interest of the Defence Forces at heart can advocate a continuance of the present system I&#39; am unable to imagine. I am not going to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> knows nothing about defence, nor am I going to use, concerning him, any epithets that might be unpleasant or unfair. I leave him to reflect whether any of his remarks about me were justified. I turn to the observations of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> He has made an attack upon me on somewhat similar lines. He has said two things that are absolutely contrary to fact. He said that no protest had. been made against this appointment previously. So far as I am concerned, I have protested from the beginning. If I have happened to be out of the Chamber when this Department has been under consideration in previous sessions, I may have failed to enter a protest on those occasions, but I have never been present when we were discussing these Estimates without taking the opportunity of entering my protest against the present condition of affairs in relation to the representation in London and the secretaryship for Defence. Not only have I protested, but I have taken action. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was utterly incorrect, therefore, when he said that no protest was made. He was also unfair when he said that the time to protest was long ago. The time to protest was not when Captain Collins was appointed to his present position. No one denied that he was a fit and proper person to go to England to purchase warlike stores. We were originally told that he had been sent for that purpose. I entered no protest then, because I knew of no reason why he should not go. </para>

                        <para>- Captain Collins was sent Home for a specific purpose. We were at that time buying a large quantity of warlike stores. It was considered desirable that we should have on the spot some one to supervise the purchases. I do not know whether Captain Collins continues to purchase warlike stores for the Commonwealth. If he does, he might be limited to that function, and we might make some other arrangement with regard to the Defence Department secretaryship. If the present Secretary is to devote the whole of his services to buying warlike stores, a new appointment certainly ought to be made in Australia. We ought to have an officer to look after this extremely disorganized Defence Department. We do not want the Secretary for Defence to be living in London in receipt of &#163;150 a year. </para>

Am I to be curtailed in taking action upon a matter as to which I have felt so keenly for several years, because the present Government are in office? I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that if any Government had been in office - even a Government that I was supporting - I should have taken precisely the same side. </para>

                    <para>. - I am sorry that it is necessary to repeat that there must be some clear understanding of the position before honorable senators can vote intelligentlv. One honorable senator says that Captain Collins was appointed for one purpose; another says that he was appointed for another purpose. I have said before, and I repeat, that a combination of conditions induced the Commonwealth Government to send Captain Collins to London. The Secretary of the Treasury, probably knowing that there was some talk of an officer being sent to buy warlike stores, and feeling the responsibility resting on his shoulders respecting Commonwealth affairs in London, recommended that if an officer was sent with reference to the one matter he should be sent with reference to both. The added weight of his recommendation brought about the appointment, and Captain Collins was sent. One of his duties was to inspect warlike stores ; the other was to look after the financial affairs of the Commonwealth in London. Both functions were temporary. What &#34; temporary &#34; means has been canvassed all round. I want to know what the request, if carried, will mean ? To my mind, &#34; temporary &#34; means until such time as Parliament has made provision for the appointment of a High Commissioner, and the establishment of Commonwealth offices in London. It must be represented there by some person. Is this request, if carried, to be taken as an instruction to the Government that a High Commissioner shall be appointed as soon as possible? If that be the intention, honorable senators should be more candid in their criticism, and they ought to have in their mind&#39;s eye some person who would fill the position when created. At the same time they must recognise that a Bill will have to be introduced and passed. They are aware that when that is done, it will increase considerably the cost of the Commonwealth offices. With those considerations in view, and with a promise that some action will be taken before the next Estimates are submitted, is it worth their while to carry a request of this kind? When the Minister of Defence said that it would embarrass and inconvenience the Government to carry the request, I do not think that he meant for a moment that it was submitted with that intention. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that my honorable colleague meant that. He was merely explaining to honorable senators that it would be an embarrassing position for. the Government to be placed in. It would mean, either the recall of Captain Collins, or the immediate appointment of a High Commissioner and the establishment of Commonwealth offices in London. It would mean a great many things which there is no time to discuss this afternoon. I may add that Captain Pethebridge is acting in place of Captain Collins, and carrying out the work very efficiently. The Commonwealth is gaining by the temporary absence of Captain </para>

                    <para>. - Last year we voted &#163;20,000 towards the expenses of administering Papua, and &#163;5.000 towards its development, but this year we are only asked to vote , &#163;20,000 for the former purpose. If we earnestly desire to bring Papua into profitable use to enable it to realize its destiny and become a prosperous land under the control of the Commonwealth, the vote of &#163;5,000 towards its development ought to be continued. I believe that the vote of &#163;20,000 is pretty well absorbed by the cost of administration. An annual vote of &#163;5,000 would not be too much to devote to the development of the Territory. It is a rugged, new country, with very considerable rivers and high mountains, and many parts are inaccessible owing to the dense scrub which clothes the valleys and sides of the mountains. If &#163;5,000 were expended yearly in the simple process of making roads, it would do as much to develop the Territory as, perhaps, anything else. Persons experience an immense difficulty in travelling from one portion of Papua to another. They find that it is almost impossible to travel over and explore territory in search of land, minerals, timber, or anything else. If, however, fairly decent roads were provided, that difficulty would be minimized very much, if not removed. The miners on the gold-fields, and persons engaged in business of one kind and another in various places, are very heavily handicapped owing to the fact that there are only pads where there ought to be roads. A man cannot even take a pack mule over&#39; the pads, because they are not cleared or made accessible in any way. Consequently the residents have to employ native carriers at, in some cases, almost prohibitive cost, for carrying tools of trade, stores, machinery, building material, and other things. If money were expended in making good roads, which would be suitable for vehicular traffic, or even for pack mules or horses, the expenditure would be exceedingly profitable, and would, I believe, do more to open up the Territory than anything else which could be done. I now desire to bring under the notice of the Committee another matter concerning Papua. The late Government were exceedingly dilatory in ending a very unsatisfactory condition of affairs there, and I was glad to notice that the present Government were not in office very long before they accomplished that object. I allude, of course, to the appointment of a permanent Lieutenant-Governor. The matter hung fire for a. very long time, and it seemed to be impossible to induce the late Government to make up their mind. I understand that when they were displaced they had pretty well decided on a definite course of action, and that it was the one which was adopted by the present Government. I do not believe, however, that the best course was taken in appointing, not only a Lieutenant-Governor, but also an Acting Lieutenant-Governor, who is Administrator too. These two gentlemen aspired to the higher office. I had reason to believe that when ex-Senator Staniforth Smith received the appointment of Director of Agriculture, Mines, and Lands, he dropped his aspiration for the Lieutenant-Governorship; but afterwards I was informed that I was incorrect in that supposition, and that, as a matter of fact, he did aspire to it. </para>

                        <para>- He told me once that he was satisfied with his appointment, and that he was willing to forego any claim upon the Lieutenant- Governorship. The method adopted by the Government in deciding between the claims of these two rival aspirants was extremely unsatisfactory, because we shall now have one occupying the position permanently and the other occupying it temporarily, always ready to step into the other&#39;s shoes at any moment. I believe that the right thing was done by the Government in appointing Judge Murray as Lieutenant-Governor. I have not met him, and do not know him, except from reading and hearsay. I believe that I have as many correspondents in Papua as has any man in Australia. They represent every shade of political opinion, and are engaged in every walk of life. From time to time they have all expressed a very high admiration for Judge Murray, and indulged in the hope that he would be appointed Lieutenant-Governor. I am bound to add that I have received nothing but the best accounts of the work of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Staniforth</inline> Smith in Papua. A certain rivalry appears to have existed between these two gentlemen, which led to the formation of two rival factions. I know that anything which would encourage such a condition of affairs in the Territory would be most obnoxious to members of the Committee, who, I am sure, desire that the utmost good feeling should prevail amongst the officers there.  In  the circumstances, I think it would have been very much wiser if the Government had followed the course previously adopted, and had been content with the appointment of Judge Murray as Lieutenant-Governor, leaving <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Staniforth</inline> Smith to continue to occupy the high position he formerly held. However, the Government, apparently in order to gratify rival aspirations and to placate a rival faction, appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith</inline> as Administrator and Acting Lieutenant-Governor. I am afraid that the course which has been pursued is not calculated to put an end to the rivalry and jealousy previously existing in the Territory, and which we know are so injurious in a small community. </para>

I hope also that no time will be lost in connecting Papua with the main land, either by wireless telegraph, or by means of a cable. We ought to have facilities for daily communication with the Territory. It may perhaps interest honorable senators to learn that a former Administrator of Papua, Captain Barton, has received an appointment as British representative at Zanzibar, and the experience he gained in New Guinea is now to be availed of by the Imperial Government. </para>

                        <para>- No ; the Act provides that such an officer shall be appointed, and specifies his duties. The honorable senator might have learned as much from the reply given to a question recently asked in the Senate on the subject. It will be admitted that the Lieutenant-Governor might sometimes be prevented from discharging his duties by illness, or absence, and it is necessary that in such an emergency there should be some one in New Guinea to carry out the duties of the office. The absence of telegraphic communication referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> is one of the strongest arguments in support of the appointments that have been made. I hope it will be in the power of the Government at an early date to provide better means of communication between the mainland and Papua. </para>

                        <para>- No, it is not debited twice over. The amount is credited by the External Affairs Department to the Trade and Customs Department, and is paid out by the latter. With respect to the Commonwealth Literary Fund, it is possible that it is included in the Estimates of the External Affairs Department, because it can be most conveniently managed by that Department, and perhaps in order to give an officer who was referred to some time ago something to do. The administration of the fund is in the hands of a Committee consisting of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sugden,</inline> Principal of Queen&#39;s College, Melbourne; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bladen,</inline> Librarian of Sydney, -and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Langdon</inline> Bonython. It is not considered advisable to publish the names of the recipients of gratuities paid from the fund.

Suppose, for instance, an educated Austrian were to land in Australia, would the education test be applied to him ?

                        <para>- The test is sometimes applied, and we should know exactly what are the instructions given to determine the character of the test. There is an impression abroad that the dictation test, whenever it is used, is used absolutely for the purpose of preventing the landing of the person to whom it is applied. If that be&#34; so, the test is worse &#34;than a delusion. I have been told of instances where the test applied has been designedly such as to make it impossible for the person to whom it was applied to p?.ss it, and that the object has been to keep out a desirable immigrant. </para>

                    <para>. - I think the honorable senator ought to recognise that this is a question of policy, and one therefore which ought scarcely to be discussed at length upon the Estimates. It ought rather to be debated in connexion with an amendment of the Immigration Restriction Act. The Government, however, are not averse to giving the honorable senator all the information which they can, and I may tell him that the education test is usually applied at the discretion of the officer. </para>

                        <para>- The Commonwealth, as a Commonwealth, does not possess any resources. It does not own an inch of land in any part of Australia, and it cannot, therefore, provide land for immigrants. I . am quite aware that for a considerable period a small section has been raising the cry that Australia is badly in need of additional population. It has endeavoured to show that there is ample room in this country for thousands of new settlers. That there is ample room for them none will deny. But that there is ample opportunity for thousands of fresh settlers to earn a livelihood at the present time I do deny. The section to which I have referred holds the view that if to-morrow we could attract to our shores thousands of human beings, we should at once begin to prosper. They believe that population is synonymous with prosperity. That, I contend, is a false economic view. If the prosperity of a country could be measured by the number of its inhabitants, China and Japan would be the wealthiest countries in the world. But, as a matter of fact, we know that in those countries are to be found the world&#39;s poorest poor. I desire to know the direction in which the Government propose to spend any sum in advertising the Commonwealth throughout Great Britain, Today, some of the States are expending large amounts for the purpose of attracting settlers. For some time past Queensland has attempted, by the distribution of literature in England, by the insertion of large advertisements in many prominent newspapers there, and by means of its Agent-General, to draw attention to the possibilities which exist in that State for immigrants. I venture to say that that expenditure of effort and money has produced industrial conditions in Queensland which do not obtain in any other portion of the Commonwealth. The standard of comfort and living there is lower than it is in any other State. </para>

                        <para>- The standard in Tasmania is fairly low, but, judging by facts and figures which have recently been presented to organizations which periodically meet in Melbourne for the purpose of considering industrial matters, the position in Queensland is even worse. Only the other day paragraphs were published in the Melbourne newspapers declaring that the wage conditions of the whiteworkers in Queensland are being seriously threatened by reason of the fact that the wages being paid there for the making of shirts and other garments are so low that certain persons find it to their advantage to send their goods to Queensland to be manufactured there, instead of being manufactured locally. </para>

                        <para>- In Queensland, the waees being paid in the printing&#39; trade - which is the trade with which I am most familiar - are lower than those which obtain in any other State. Not long ago, whilst I was visiting Brisbane for the purpose of attending a Labour Conference, my services were requisitioned for the purpose of bringing about a better method of organization and more unity amongst the printers of that city. I was amazed to find, first, that there were a number of unemployed in that trade; second, that there were men working in job printing offices for  &#163;2  a week; and, third, that the standard wage payable in Brisbane, where the cost of living is probably a little higher than it is in the capitals of the other States- </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. I was surprised to find that in Brisbane the printers were working for forty-eight hours a week for 48s., which is the lowest standard wage paid in the trade throughout Australia. Other trades were in no better condition. . Probably I shall be told that Queensland offers many opportunities for immigrants in respect of land settlement - that there are thousands of acres available for settlement. But I hold that the best lands of that State are already occupied, or are in the possession of those who intend to utilize them at a later period. If there are extensive areas of good land available, it is remarkable that the Queensland Government should be re-purchasing estates. To my mind, that is conclusive evidence that the best lands of that State have been alienated. Of course, there may be tracts of country far removed from the railway and sea-board which are available for settlement by those who wish to isolate themselves- </para>

                        <para>- The circumstances which obtained years ago cannot be applied to Australia to-day. Circumstances have materially changed. The fact stares us in the face that those who are living in Queensland to-day are not too pleased with their lot, because many of them find a difficulty in obtaining employment. There is also dissatisfaction in respect of the wages and conditions of employment. The labour organizations of Queensland have made a strong objection, and those who desire to obtain land for permanent settlement protest against the action taken by the Government in advertising extensively the resources of the State, and flooding Queensland with immigrants. New South Wales has also advertised its resources. In that State, almost every week, one can read in the newspapers accounts of Land Boards before which innumerable applicants for land have been disappointed. I remember reading in one of the New South Wales journals, not long ago, an account of one man, who had been for seven years journeying to different parts of that State, presenting himself before various Land Boards, in the hope that he would eventually be successful in his application for land. The only State that is not directly spending money in advertising is South Australia, which is one of the most prosperous States in the Commonwealth.  But  South Australia adopts a policy that advertises itself in the best possible way, and by so doing, attracts immigrants. </para>

                    <para>The cry with regard to the necessity for immigration arises principally from one class,  namely,  the employers of labour. Employers  may  desire that the State shall introduce labour, but, in my opinion, the principle is unjust. I suppose there are few who would not object to the introduction of competition if it affected ourselves. The merchants would do so, and the professional man would take the same view of the case. But it is singular that the objections heard of when the introduction of labour to compete with the labour already here is spoken of. Immigration to be just should be applied equally to all classes. </para>

I dare say that there would be strong opposition if it were proposed to encourage the immigration of solicitors and barristers. Similarly, the traders and merchants would object if the Common wealth proposed to encourage the immigration of other merchants and traders to compete with them. </para>

                        <para>- I agree with the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higinbotham</inline> that immigration, to be just, should be applied equally to all classes. But it is proposed to apply it only to a few - to bring to Australia men and women who have only their labour to sell. The employing class hope that wages will be reduced owing to the increase of the number of persons- seeking employment. </para>

I have said here, and am prepared to say outside, that it is one of the best countries on God&#39;s earth. There are possibilities here for five or six times our present population. We shall never be able to carry an immense population unless the lands of this country are put to their fullest and best use, and unless the rivers are locked and the water conserved. It is cruel to extensively advertise that land and homes can be .obtained by men and employment and husbands by women who come here. That is not a fact; it is an untruth. </para>

                        <para>- Every State possesses resources, and most of the States are advertising them. But the Commonwealth, as such, have no resources at the present time. It does not own art inch of land, and cannot provide work for a single immigrant, male or female. Under those circumstances, it is wrong for any Government to expend public money in advertising that which the Commonwealth&#39; does not possess. What sort of advertising are they about to encourage? The late Government advertised in a newspaper which practically had no existence until a contract was signed for the insertion of an advertisement at the rate of 27 s. per inch, which has but a very small circulation, which does not find its way into the homes of the working classes, and is read by persons who are not likely in any circumstances to come to any part of Australia. There is another extravagant project on the part of the Government in connexion with its advertising scheme ! The other day we were informed that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Drakard,</inline> a Victorian, I believe, had entered into an arrangement with the Commonwealth Government to print and circulate throughout the United Kingdom, for the sum of&#163;250, 50,000 copies of a circular containing information likely to attract persons to Australia. But, now that he has obtained that official permission to print and circulate the pamphlets, the probability is that he will go to various advertisers - patent medicine men, and others - and that the most inviting pages of the pamphlet will not be those concerning Australia, but those containing the advertisements, and the Commonwealth will be overshadowed. Probably the chief concern of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Drakard</inline> will be to get as much money as possible from the advertisers. I am opposed at the present time to advertising schemes altogether. But if the Commonwealth intends to advertise, let it do so in a way which will give it a good advertisement. The scheme adopted by the late Government is petty, paltry, and puny, and is calculated to do more harm than good to the Commonwealth.. Such a form of advertising as that cheapens the Commonwealth. If it is going to advertise, surely it is rich enough to engage men to supervise its own reading matter, to have printing which would be a credit to the trade and to itself, and to arrange for an organized distribution. What assurance or guarantee have we as a Parliament that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Drakard</inline> is going to print and publish 50,000 copies of a circular? None whatever. Having entered my protest against the item of &#163;20,000 in the Estimates, and drawn attention to one or two matters incidental to advertising, I submit my request. I hope that any honorable senators who may be disposed to follow me will not misunderstand what I have said. I know that they would not consciously endeavour to misrepresent me. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator cannot do two things at once. For the last half-hour or so his attention has been devoted to a book, and in order to try to be funny, and to say something nasty, he interjects at a time when I am about to close my remarks. That is a trick, a characteristic of the honorable senator. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to make some reply to the very disparaging and very incorrect remarks which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has made with regard to Queensland. The honorable senator has grossly misrepresented the condition of affairs in that State. I believe he has also misrepresented, to a greater or less extent, the conditions existing in the other States of Australia. I do not know that the honorable senator has treated his own State very much better, and he will have himself to blame if he is charged with disparaging that State as well as the other States of Australia. He has said substantially that there is no land available in Australia for immigrants. I do not intend to deal with that statement at length in a speech ; but I have here a table of figures from which I propose to make certain selections, in order to meet what the honorable senator has said. In the year 1860-1, the population of Australia! was 1,168,149, and there was under cultivation in that year 1,188,282 acres. In 1870-1, the population was 1,700,888, and there were 2,185,534 acres under cultivation. In 1 880-1, the population was -2,306,736, and the area under cultivation was 4,577,699 acres. So that whilst in  1860-1 there was very little more than 1 acre under cultivation per head of population, in 1880-1 we had nearly 2 acres under cultivation per head of population. In 1885-6 the population of Australia had increased to 2,788,050, and the area under cultivation to 5,306,762 acres. In 1900-1 the population was 3,826,286, and the area under cultivation 8,812,463 acres. That is to say, that between i860 and 1900 we had almost doubled the area of land under cultivation per head of population. In 1906-7, the population had increased to 4,119,481, and we had 9,545,856 acres under cultivation. These figures show that we have been increasing the area under cultivation  at  a greater rate than the increase in. our population. The inference from these figures, which are taken from the Statistical <inline font-style="italic">Year-Book,</inline> are, to  my  mind, as plain as the results, of  a  multiplication table. If we bring people into Australia, those who are industrious and courageous will very pro.bably find land. And if we secure the right sort of immigrants, they will no doubt set to work at once  to  develop the resources of the country for their own benefit, and to the great advantage of the Commonwealth. Listening to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> and many other honorable senators opposite, one might be excused for thinking that Australia is one of the most wretched, desolated, congested countries on the face of the earth. As good a test  as  we could Ti  ave  of the general prosperity of the people, and especially of what might be called the middle-class people, who, I suppose, represent about 75 per cent, of the population of Australia, is the investment of money in the Savings Banks. Honorable senators will excuse me, since I must read &#34;the figures to secure their publication in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> for troubling them while I go through the whole of the figures with respect to the investments in the Savings Banks from 1901 - </para>

                <para>Honorable senators will note the last figures I have given.

                        <para>- That is so; and the difficulty is overcome by persons lodging deposits in the names of relatives and trustees. But after all that may be said by way of objection, the figures remain, and they show that Australia is one of the richest countries- in the world to-day, and the amount of Savings Bank deposits per head is higher in Australia than in any other country in the world. Again, the thrift and industry of a people is often indicated by the extent to which they take advantage of the opportunities afforded them to insure their lives, or the lives of persons dependent upon them. And, in the matter of life insurance, I believe that the people of Australia also hold the record against the world. That is to say, that the general thrift and standard of living of the people in Australia are exceeded in no other country in the world. I am astonished to find in the Senate, and in representative bodies throughout Australia, that the very men whose presence in the country, it may be admitted, is a benefit to Australia as well as of great benefit to themselves, and who may thank God for the day 011 which their fathers, or themselves, came to this country, are the very men who to-day say that what Governments have in the past done for their fathers, or for themselves, shall be done for nobody else. I wish to enter a strong protest against anything which disparages a single State in Australia or Australia itself, and suggests that it is an undesirable place for people to come to. It seems to me to follow, as an axiom, that if this is not a desirable country for our kith and &#34;kin to come to, it is not a desirable country for our children to stay in. We all hope that Australia will prove to be a good country for our children, and surely, if it is, it must be a good country for other people to come to. I shall give another test of the extraordinary prosperity and advancement of Australia coincidentally with the increase of our population. I take now the deposits in banks, which may be said to represent very largely investments and profits in business, and I select three or four figures from a table before me. I find that, in  1901,  we had in our banks non-interest-bearing deposits amounting; to &#163;37,457,960, and interest-bearing deposits amounting to  , &#163;54,529,188,  making a total of &#163;91,487,148, averaging  , &#163;24 2s. 9d.  per head of population. In  1904,  the figures were - non-interest-bearing deposits,  . &#163;35,630,255 ;  interest-bearing deposits, &#163;55,917,848; total, &#163;91,548,103, representing  , &#163;23 3s. 3d.  per head of the population. In  1907,  the figures had increased enormously, and we had non-interest-bearing deposits,  , &#163;46,781,234;  interest-bearing deposits, &#163;65,916,735; total, &#163;1  12,697,969;  representing  &#163;27 2s.1d.  per head of our population. I doubt if any country on earth can show such wealth per head of population. It is therefore absurd for honorable senators opposite to say that Australia is not a desirable country for people to come to. </para>

                        <para>- If Australia is a rich and prosperous country, I hold that that should be made known to the world ; but some honorable senators wish that the facts about Australia should not be made known to the world. They blame the late Government for having spent only  , &#163;3,000  of a vote of  , &#163;20,000  for advertising the resources of Australia, but my complaint is that a vote of &#163;20,000 is not sufficient. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> now says that he does not doubt the richness of Australia, and is not prepared to deny the marvellous progress we have made ; and I ask whether the honorable senator wishes to keep his knowledge on these points entirely for home consumption ? Is no one abroad to be told of these things? It is extraordinary that when people are so ready to seize and remember the many libels cast upon Australia, the honorable senator should find fault with the Government for doing what they can to remove the false impressions of Australia held abroad. </para>

                        <para>- Surely there is no harm in letting the facts be known? That is what the late Government tried to do. Doubtless, the object of letting the facts be known abroad is to attract persons to this country. There might be some dispute about the extent to which financial assistance should be afforded to persons coming to Australia, but there should be no dispute about advertising the resources of the country to induce immigration. I believe that a continuation of the policy of assisted immigration is justifiable to-day. We should do our best to attract to Australia a desirable type  of  settlers. Many of those who were assisted to reach this country by the expenditure of the different States are amongst our best citizens to-day. Viewing this question from the historical side, and bearing in mind the progress of events,  I  maintain that the party which is opposed to immigration could not do more effective work than it is doing for China and Japan. The population of China and Japan: is estimated at more than  400,000,000.  At its present rate of increase, in sixty-five years it will number  800,000,000.  Within the same period the population of Australia will be only about  8,000,000.  Seeing that a vanguard of  40,000,000  of Mongolians is within three days&#39; sail of he Commonwealth what do these figures suggest? If the members of the party which is opposed to immigration were the paid spies of the Court of. Japan, they could not take steps more calculated to make Australia the home of the yellow race than those which they are taking. Look at the awakening of China. See how Japan has recently fought and defeated one of the greatest military nations in the world. If our present policy of inaction continues, it will need the special interposition of Providence to prevent Australia from becoming a mere province of Japan. </para>

                    <para>. - I should not have risen to address the Committee had it not been for the reply which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> vouchsafed to an innocent interjection which I made whilst he was addressing the Chamber. In discussing the motion for the first reading of this Bill yesterday afternoon, I briefly expressed my views upon the proposed expenditure by the Commonwealth in advertising its resources. I  pointed out that until we taxed the unimproved values of land it would be idle to spend money in that direction, because the Commonwealth really has no land available upon which immigrants may be settled. Of course, I recognise that in Western Australia, which I have the honour to represent, an abundance of land is available for settlement, and the most liberal land laws are in existence. But in Australia, as a whole, the same opportunities for the settlement of people upon the land do not exist. Whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> was speaking I interjected that he was not so loud in his protestations against this particular item on former occasions as he has been today.  His  reply was that I was insinuating that he was opposed to the present Government simply because he chanced to descant for a few moments upon this item. I had no intention of doing anything of the sort. <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> will prove that the statement which I made was perfectly accurate. Reference to pages 5846, 6348, and 6349 of the second session of this Parliament will show that he was not so vehement in his denunciation of this item upon previous occasions as he has been this afternoon. </para>

                        <para>- I do not question that statement, and I wish to assure the honorable senator that I made no insinuation that he was opposed to the present Government. But why, I ask, all the vehemence which he exhibited this afternoon? Echo answers, &#34;Why?&#34; Whilst I recognise that the sum of ,&#163;20,000 for advertising the resources of the Commonwealth, viewed from one stand-point, is too large, I admit that from another it is too small. I believe that the Commonwealth is possessed of vast resources which should be advertised. But until we pass an Act which will have the effect of bursting up the large estates in this country, it would be unwise to invite immigrants to our shores. I am glad to think that before very long such a measure will be placed upon our statute-book. </para>

                    <para>. - It would be exceedingly regrettable if the impression were allowed to get abroad that the influx of a large population to Australia would be accompanied by depression. That idea is in direct antagonism to the experience of the past century. During that time the population of Europe has doubled, and yet the average well-being of its people has increased. Honorable senators are well aware that during the past twenty-five years there has been a marked advance in the average well-being of the people of the United States, and yet, within the same period, there has been a large volume of immigration to that country. Consequently, the idea promulgated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> that an increase in our population would mean a decrease in our material well-being is not supported by experience. </para>

                    <para>. - I recognise that this is a matter which affects a very large number of people. In the first place, I desire to point out that no member of the Labour Party is opposed to desirable immigrants being permitted to enter the Commonwealth. Although Queensland has expended &#163;&#91;3,000,000 in an endeavour to attract population to her shores, its public men to-day realize that a great mistake was made when it inaugurated the system of indiscriminate immigration. No member  of the Queensland Parliament would now dare to advocate a renewal of that system. They say: &#34;We are prepared to assist immigrants to come to Queensland if  they have had a training upon the soil, and are prepared to take up land.&#34; Nobody objects to that. But it cannot be denied that there are large numbers of persons scattered throughout the Commonwealth today who are desirous of obtaining land, but who are unable to do so. Australia is certainly a wealthy country - from the stand-point of its material well-being there is none wealthier. But we must pay regard to the experience of other countries. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> has remarked that it would be a mistake to promulgate the idea that an influx of population would be accompanied by depression. Mav I point out that nobody has ever given utterance to such a foolish notion. The more people there are settled upon our country lands the greater will be the prosperity in our cities. </para>

                <para>But the fact remains that in every State of the Commonwealth there are persons who are unable to obtain land at a price which will suit their pockets. Only the other evening, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne,</inline> the ex-Minister of Agriculture in Victoria, declared that something would have to be done to promote land settlement in this State. He affirmed that it is losing population, and that there are large tracts of country in this State upon which fewer people are settled today than were settled there twenty years ago. Such a condition of things does not spell prosperity. </para>

                        <para>- We do not assert, as alleged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> that a large population necessarily means depression. But what do we find in the principal countries of Europe? In Germany, where there are fairly good imposts on land, and manufacturers have been encouraged for years, there is an enormous amount of employment offering, and emigration has dropped off to a very large extent. There was &#39;a large emigration from Germany some years ago, but it is now practically non-existent. In France, where there are also large imposts on land, a considerable proportion of the population is engaged in agricultural pursuits. The consequence is that there is not the amount of poverty in France that is found elsewhere, whilst there* is practically no emigration. But in England the state of things is quite different. The Government say that they have to find employment for 45,000 men. Millions of money are being spent at the dockyards. Only last week there was a deputation of members of the House of Commons to the  President  of the Local Government Board, and the statement was made to him that there were in England 6.600,000 of people out of employment. The Minister admitted candidly that the unemployment evil was serious. There is a considerable agitation with the object of getting land for settlement. The cry of a large number of people in England practically is that the unemployed must be chased out of the country. They say, &#34;Go to Canada or to America, or to blazes, if you like, as long as you clear out and relieve the pressure upon the labour market.&#34; If we look nearer home, we find that things are very awkward in some of the Australian States. Two years ago I was in Tasmania. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> says he is satisfied that room could be found for 25,000 adult females every year. But when I was in the State he represents I found that a large number of people were anxious to leave. The young men have been going in hundreds, either te* the Mainland or to New Zealand. I cannot see what inducement there is to bring out. adult females. I observed in the newspapers a few days ago a paragraph from. Western Australia relating to the strike in the timber industry. A large number of men from Southern Europe have gone to Western Australia. They fell out with those who employed them, and went on. strike. They did not strike in the ordinary British way, but got possession of guns, with which they were determined te* prevent other men from going to work. I notice that a member of the Western Australian Parliament said that the fault lay with the Commonwealth Government for allowing these people to enter theState. Only this week I observed that the Queensland Premier stated that a man who had been brought to this country by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company had beet* thrown on the State, because the company refused to accept any responsibility for him. The Premier admitted that the Government had to do something, from a humane point of view, but he objected to the Federal Government giving permits for such people to be brought into Australia without consultation with the State Government. When the exPrimeMinister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> approached the Premiers of the States on the subject of immigration, he said : &#34; We do not mind spending money in advertising, but you must tell us exactly how you are going to place the people when we bring them here.&#34; The State Premiers, in answer, practically said : &#34; Mind your own business,&#34; and declined to give any information as to the land they had for settlement purposes. Wherever one goes in this country at present, one finds people who say that the want of Australia is immigration. But if one says, &#34;What is your occupation?&#34; and the. reply is that the person is a carpenter or a saddler, they do not listen kindly to the suggestion that we should bring out a number of people to follow those occupations. They say, &#34; We do not want such people at all ; there is not enough work to go round at present. We want&#39; people who will enter into competition with the labourer.&#34; The labourer apparently does not take sufficient interest in such matters to protect himself. I remember that when there was  an  agitation in Queensland for the importation of kanaka labour many artisans signed petitions  in  favour of the proposal. They said that the kanakas would not affect their avocations, and -they did not seem to think that it made much difference if coloured people were brought in to compete with labourers. I  a.m  reminded of what took place in the western -part, of Queensland at the time of the big strike. Large numbers of the hotels employed Chinese cooks, and in the towns many people were getting their bread for their families from the Chinese. The union men came to the conclusion that it was hardly fair for them to be patronizing hotelkeepers and storekeepers who employed Chinese, and they carried a resolution to the effect  that  they should . cease to deal with tradesmen who did so. The result was that the hotelkeepers and storekeepers were soon almost tumbling over each other to get rid of their Chinese. They saw that there was some reason in the position taken up bv the union men. It is just &#34;the  same  in connexion with this question. People are quite willing to have immigrants brought to Australia so long as competition in their particular avocations is not increased. It is said that domestic servants should be brought out, and that there is plenty of employment for them. A few months ago I was in the back country a few hundred miles from Brisbane. At the hotel where I put up there was a young! woman who had recently been brought out from England. I  was  talking about the immigration question with the hotelkeeper. He told me that this girl had been brought out under misrepresentations. She had no idea of what the conditions in Australia were. She had been planted down in a little place, to reach which she had had to travel about 300 miles bv train and about 120 miles by coach. She was thoroughly dissatisfied, although the hotelkeeper said that she was  a.  good girl, who understood her work. &#34;The girl herself was of opinion that she had been induced to come under false pretences, and she had sent letters home to her friends warning them to have nothing to do with Australia, and pointing out how she had been treated. That is a bad advertisement for Australia. It does a great deal of harm. So long as misleading reports are circulated in the Old Country, so long shall we have such conditions  existing. Not many years ago </para>

                </continue>
                <para class="block">Queensland was doing a good deal in connexion with immigration. There were just a few persons coming out, and, in response to an agitation for female domestic servants, the representatives of Queensland in the Old Country became particularly active. Girls were brought out, and I was informed that one leading spirit in the agitation had had no less than fourteen girls in her house in twelve months. The labour was available. .A girl would be engaged at the lowest possible rate; she would stay in the house until she could find time to mix with the people and ascertain the local conditions and rates of wages, and then, becoming dissatisfied with her lot, she would ask for an increase of pay. During the time that immigrants were coming in regularly, women were to be seen at the immigration depot, whenever a ship arrived, searching for fresh servants, and always complaining that the supply was not sufficient. This sort of advertising resolves itself into a question of labour. Employers want to use the power and the credit of the State with the object of introducing a surplus of labour, upon which they may be able to draw at practically their own terms. On the other hand, there is a large number of persons who have labour to sell, and who realize what the conditions are. There are primary industries which afford employment for only a certain portion of the year. Take, for instance, the sugar industry. In the harvesting season the planters require hundreds of men to be rushed into a district. The men make fairly good money for a time, but as soon as the crop is harvested they ca.11 go where they like. That is not a matter which interests the planters, who depend upon there being a sufficient surplus of labour to compel the men to return to the district for the next harvesting season. During this session, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell has stated that the same thing takes place in South Australia. The farmers offer <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> a week to nien for harvesting operations, but the work lasts for only a month or, perhaps, five weeks, and afterwards the men can go where they like. Probably there is very little work available to them for a number of months. Honorable senators on this side have no objection to any number of persons coming into Australia, provided that on the other side of the world they are told that there is casual labour here for a portion of the year, and that there is a possibility of their being able to .get land and settle down on it. </para>
                <para class="block">That is the class of immigrants whom we require, and to whom I think no one has raised any objection. It has been said that those who are opposing this item are working in the interests of Chinamen and Japanese. Ever since I have been in Australia, the one force .which has compelled the various Parliaments to pass legislation against the importation of the Asiatic has been the Labour Party. In New South Wales they carried on an agitation for years. In Queensland they were employed for years and years in educating the public mind, until sufficient influence was brought to bear to induce the Government to ask Parliament to pass preventive legislation. Why was it done? Simply because they had had a very salutary lesson in 1878. Had it not been for the organization of the seamen on the coast, the&#34; boats would have been manned from stem to stern with Chinese, and they would have been retained until to-day. That is the sort of lesson which taught the workers that they must use their power and influence to compel the Legislatures to carry out what they believed to be the will of the majority. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, because they realized that the Chinese would eventually come into competition with themselves. Had it been merely a question of the Chinese coming into competition with the seamen, it would have been a matter of indifference to the storekeepers, but they knew the race, and, being intelligent men, they recognised that if Chinese were allowed to come in to take the work out of the hands of the labourer, it would displace the artisan, and eventually establish distributing businesses. This question must be considered as much&#34; from the point of view of the worker as from the point of view of the capitalist. In many cases, the capitalist contends that he is paying too much for his labour. I do not think that any one here will contend that the standard of living in Australia is too high. If it is not too high, then it is an act of cruelty to induce any persons to come out from the Old Country by circulating all sorts of false information, and alleging that we have a variety of resources of which they can avail themselves. What have we read in the press during the last day or two?. The Lands Department of Victoria has been inundated with inquiries from the United States from men who have been induced to write by the reports of the press correspondents with the American </para>

                <para>Fleet. In their reports they stated that Australia wanted immigrants, and especially farmers, that it was in a position to give any quantity of free land, and that the Government - I suppose that the pressmen did not discriminate between the State and the Commonwealth - would hand $10,000 to each man as he went ashore, in order to induce him to go on to the land. That sort of report is not doing any good to Australia. It induces a number of persons to come here under false pretences. </para>

                        <para>- I do not suggest that they are dull, but I know that years ago in England there was an idea abroad that persons could get land practically free, and all sorts of assistance in different parts of the world. I believe that, in many cases, the report was true, but many persons believed whatever they saw in the local newspapers, and thus were induced to come out. Afterwards they wrote to their friends, stating that they had been induced to emigrate under false pretences. Honorable senators on this side object to the circulation of false information. </para>

                        <para>- Is it hard for the Government to instruct its officials to narrate the facts concerning Australia, and then see that they are verified before they are circulated on the other side of the world ? Oftentimes, the intention is not to give the facts regarding a place, but to disseminate glowing statements which will induce persons to come out only to tell their friends at Home the exact position afterwards. In Queensland, we have had a large experience of that system. In one year we introduced 40,000 persons. </para>

                        <para>- No. As a matter of fact a very large number of those persons, although they had been brought out at the expense of the State, did not remain there very long, and penal legislation had to be enacted to . prevent assisted immigrants from leaving the State within a given time. In Victoria and New South Wales there are thousands of persons who were brought to Australia at the expense of Queensland&#39;, and who left that State practically as soon as they arrived. </para>

This is a labour question. I do not blame the employers of labour for supporting these proposals. What they want is to have a surplus of labour on which they can draw so that they may be able to obtain the labour they require at the lowest possible cost. </para>

                        <para>- They pay no more than they are compelled to pay, according to the condition of the labour market, unless the industry is one in which the workers can secure the benefit of an award by an Arbitration Court or Wages Board. Not long ago, an award was made by an Arbitration Court in Australia which affected 30,000 or 40,000 men. The rate to be paid for the shearing of many millions of sheep in Australia was raised as the result of that award by 4s. per 100. Will <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> say that the employers in the pastoral industry did not contend that they were paying fair wages to labour, when they paid no more than 15s. per hundred for the shearing of sheep? It is only because the workers in the industry, by organization, have been able to demand something like a reasonable wage, and have been able to appeal to the Arbitration Court, that the shearing rates have been raised  4s.  per hundred, and the men must get rations at cost price with carriage added, and  10  per cent. These conditions were not observed by the employers in the industry until the men compelled them to give these terms. I am free to admit that if I were an employer of labour I should probably try to secure the best labour possible at the lowest rate. Do employers pay any more for other commodities they require in carrying on their businesses ? </para>

                        <para>- They pay what they consider fair rates for the class of labour they require, and if they think they can secure better labour by giving an extra shilling per day for it, they may do so. In this matter, I do not blame the employer any more than I blame the man who has his labour to sell. The man who wishes to buy desires to do so at the cheapest rate, whilst the  man  who has something to sell wants the highest price he can get. It  is  only because the interests of employers of labour  are more  identical, and they are, generally speaking,  more  intelligent,  and  act together more readily than do the workers, that they are able to get this kind of legislation carried. If people in  America,  or  in  other parts of the world, who have their labour to sell, are made acquainted with the actual conditions existing in Australia, and it is shown that they can be absorbed here, I shall have no objection to their coming in thousands. All that we ask  is  that advertising by the Commonwealth in the Old&#39; Country, or anywhere  else,  shall be confined to a true statement of the actual conditions in Australia, so that people shall not be induced to come to this country under a false impression, and  will  not be disappointed and disgusted when they arrive. </para>

                    <para>. - The vote of &#163;1,500 for the repatriation of Pacific Islanders is intended to provide for the repatriation of any waifs and strays of that unfortunate race who were for so long the slaves of circumstances in Queensland. It is believed that this vote will be sufficient to complete the repatriation of the kanakas. With respect to the vote of  , &#163;1,000  towards the expenses of press representatives to the Congress of Chambers of Commerce, the previous Government proposed, and we consider the idea a very good one, that some little inducement should be offered to pressmen through their association in the Old Country to attend the proceedings of the Congress. </para>

                            evidently knows more about this Congress than the Minister was disposed to tell the Committee. I do not care where the Congress is to be held. I do not think it is wise that the national Parliament of Australia should subsidize influential and powerful newspapers to send representatives to report the proceedings of such a gathering. What object is to be gained ? If the information that will be obtainable at that Congress will be of any value to British newspaper proprietors, surely it is their duty to pay the expenses incidental to securing representation at it ! The proposal that the taxpayers&#39; money should be utilized to defray the personal expenses of the employes of influential British journals is an unparalleled one. If this item be agreed to, will any distinction be made regarding the class of press representatives who will be invited to Australia ?

                        <para>- I will guarantee that the request for this expenditure did not emanate from the editor of <inline font-style="italic">The Clarion,</inline> which is a socialistic journal published in London. Nor do I think that it proceeded from the <inline font-style="italic">Labour Leader,</inline> or from <inline font-style="italic">Reynolds&#39; Newspaper,</inline> notwithstanding that those journals are not nearly so strong financially as are other newspapers published in Great Britain. What good will the Commonwealth derive from the expenditure of this money ? We have been told that certain sums are available for advertising the resources of the Commonwealth. We know that printed matter in the form of booklets, circulars, and pamphlets is being circulated throughout the length and breadth of the United Kingdom, which contains probably all the information that will be forthcoming at the Congress to be held in Sydney. I hope that the good sense of the Committee will recognise that it is not our duty, as representative men, to vote &#163;1,000 of the taxpayers&#39; money to subsidize the private newspaper proprietors of Great Britain to report the commonplace proceedings of a Congress exactly similar to gatherings which have been held in various parts of Australia at different times. </para>

                        <para>- Because it is absolutely necessary to make the&#34; financial provision this year. Honorable senators will recognise that the gathering, in an Australian city, of the Chambers of Commerce of the Empire will be a unique event,&#39; and will present to us an opportunity which ought not to be lost. If that gathering should take place, a number of first-class reporters will be sent out to Australia to report, not only the proceedings of the&#39; Congress itself, but the visits which its members will pay to the. various; centres of the Commonwealth. Those reports will give us an amount of advertising that will be worth far more than &#163;1,000. I will undertake to say that no portion of the &#163;20,000 which we have just voted for advertising Australia will be productive of such good results as will the expenditure that is now proposed in connexion with the  reporting of the proceedings of the associated Chambers of Commerce of the Empire. </para>

Those who have followed the course of events in the Old Country must be aware that the Australian news which appears in the English press is of a most meagre character. Seeing that it does not please the newspaper proprietors of Great Britain to devote more attention to Australian affairs, the duty devolves upon us of compelling them to do so, even if we have to pay for the advertisement. </para>

                        <para>- I am quite prepared to do that. The Commonwealth cannot afford to commit itself to the policy of hiding its light under a bushel. By advertising our resources in the Old Country we may even succeed in inducing some British manufacturers to establish industries in our midst, and that would not be a bad thing. If we can only persuade them to engage in manufacturing enterprises here those enterprises will not only provide a further measure of employment, but will also assist in breaking up any monopolies which may exist. At any rate; if we vote this money, we shall only be acting consistently, seeing that we have already authorized the expenditure of &#163;20,000 in advertising the resources of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, I would. So far as Victoria is concerned, there is no need to advertise its resources, because under existing conditions there is not much room for further expansion. For my own part, I shall not hang back when an endeavour is being made to tell the people of Great Britain that there is room in Australia for persons with a little capital who will not be competitors in our labour market when they arrive here. I intend to vote for the item, in the belief that the proposed expenditure will be productive of good results. </para>

                        <para>- One reason that recommends it to me is that it was placed on the Estimates by the late Government, and that it was not placed there lightly. I should have thought that in having a meeting within the Commonwealth, of representatives of the Chambers of Commerce of the Empire, we would have regarded ourselves as privileged. But we cannot invite a large number of guests to our shores without incurring a considerable expenditure. The Chambers of Commerce of the States have already shown the extent of their own hospitality by providing something like . &#163;5,000 towards the expenses of the visiting delegates. New South Wales is contributing &#163;500, Victoria , &#163;500, and some of the other States, I think, are also contributing. </para>

                        <para>- The Chambers of Commerce of the States, who are to be the hosts. That is the sum which they have provided towards the expenses that will be incurred by these delegates in visiting Australia. The States, I repeat, are also contributing, and an appeal was made to the Commonwealth to follow their example. In reply, the Commonwealth stated that it desired to encourage the visit of representatives of the British press in order that we might have the benefits that would flow from their observation of our resources and of various other matters of interest to the Empire. Therefore, the late Government saw their way to ask Parliament to contribute the sum of &#163;1,000 towards the expenses of visiting press representatives. We are constantly boasting of our anxiety to make our resources known, to attract capital, and to have industries established in our midst. Now, there is no more effective means of achieving those objects than that of bringing to our shores pressmen who will be induced to talk about us, and to disseminate information regarding the possibilities of trade and commerce in this quarter of the globe. Under the circumstances, it cannot reasonably be. urged that the expenditure of &#163;1,000 for an advertisement of this kind is extravagant. In the highest and best interests of the Commonwealth we ought not to hesitate to authorize it. Why honorable senators should grumble at the expenditure of such a miserable sum in obtaining such a magnificent advertisement passes my comprehension. I hope that honorable senators will see their way to withdraw their  objection in view of the explanation that has been made, and will rather give encouragement to the Chambers of Commerce to assist in making the Congress a complete success. </para>

                    <para>. - I trust that the item under discussion will be struck out. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> cannot understand why any one should be opposed to it. The reason why I am opposed to the vote is this : I should be very glad to see the Chambers of Commerce come to Australia, but I am opposed to a subsidy because I regard the Congress as purely and simply a political body. </para>

                <para>SenatorE. J. RUSSELL.- I should like the honorable senator to mention the Chamber of Commerce that does not discuss politics. I know that nominally these bodies are concerned with trade, but they deal with politics nevertheless. I object to the Commonwealth granting a subsidy for such a purpose. Where is the Chamber of Commerce that does not directly or indirectly subsidize political parties of a particular complexion? </para>

                        <para>- It is a pity that we have not the agenda paper of the Congress before us. I have not the slightest doubt that one of the first Orders of the Day will be a motion to the effect that Australia is retarding trade between various portions of the Empire by means of its Immigration Restriction Act. Secondly, I venture to predict there will be a motion to the effect that Australia is hindering the natural development of the country on account of Arbitration Acts and Factories Acts. Let honorable senators who support this subsidy name the Chamber of Commerce in Australia that has not, not once, but a hundred times, subsidized political parties whose objects were to prevent such laws from coming into force. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend cannot name one that has not done so. Some honorable senators support the vote because they think it desirable to invite representatives of the press to Australia. I venture to say that nothing has been so injurious to Australia as the writings of so-called experts and pressmen and other globe-trotters who, having come to this country, have spent about a month here, and have then given their impressions to the world. I am reminded of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Trevor,</inline> who was here not long ago, and thought he knew all about Australia after travelling through the country with a cricket team. </para>

                        <para>- I should be sorry to believe such a statement, which, if true, would show that leading commercial men are unfitted to compete for the world&#39;s business. I have no hesitation in saying that the items on the agenda paper of the Congress will not only be of a political character, but will strongly attack the laws passed by the Commonwealth Parliament. Are we to subsidize a body of that sort? Suppose Parliament were asked to subsidize a conference of the working-class representatives of the Empire ! Would honorable senators say that trade unions are not as much interested in the development of manufactures ana trade as the members of the Chambers of Commerce are? They may not have so much capital at stake, but they have something more valuable. They have their  whole life interest, and the welfare of their women and children, at stake. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator&#39;s vote, would be as a drop of <inline font-style="italic">eau-de-cologne</inline> poured into the Yarra. I have no doubt that such a proposition would receive very little support from his party. I should be just as ready to oppose a subsidy to a trade unions&#39; congress as I am opposed to this item, because it is not the business of the Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> subsidize a body which intends to discuss political affairs. </para>

                    <para>. -I find myself in disagreement with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> in the remarks with which he  opened his address. He expressed himself as feeling surprise at the opposition made to this proposal. I should have been surprised if there had not been some opposition. But, while I recognise that opposition was quite expected and is a very healthy sign, I am surprised that there has not been more logic in the manner in which the attack has been developed. Not. very long ago, we had honorable senators opposite declaring, with all the fervour which they can work up when they think that it is not desirable to proceed too rapidly with business, that they desire that the true position of affairs in Australia should be made known in Great Britain. It is alleged that every effort made by the Commonwealth to represent Australia affairs to the Englishmen, the Scotchmen, and the Irishmen at Home has been characterized by more or less exaggeration. An opportunity is here furnished by which we can invite leading British journalists to come and see the country for themselves, and convey to their readers a fair and truthful impression of the state of affairs existing here to-day. It gives us an opportunity of circulating information about Australia which will be far more valuable than any officially-prepared document sent from this side of the world. I think I can suggest a simple test to show whether this suggestion is sound or not. Assume for a moment that a proposal were made - and Something of this kind was suggested not long ago - by which every public man in Australia would have an opportunity to visit Great Britain, and see things for himself. Would it not enable us to obtain a much clearer conception of things as they are than we could derive from the study of any amount of literature? The proposal now made is the reverse of that. It is not a proposal that we should go to England, but a proposal that the picked men of the journalistic world should be invited to come here from Great Britain and present to their readers their impressions of Australia. Would they not be likely, with their trained journalistic pens, to sketch valuable pictures for the enlightenment of our fellow countrymen on the other side of the world? </para>

                    <para>. - When an Australian visits the Old Country, one of the most surprising facts that is brought under his notice is that he can scarcely find in the newspapers anything relating to Australia. He will have plenty of items about remote and less important parts of the world, but when he wants information about the affairs of this country he will not find it in the daily newspapers. We can surely try to remedy that state of things. The proposal now made represents one way of effecting an improvement. It is objected, however, that the Chambers of Commerce are political bodies. That is assuming far too much. We are not entitled to make such an assumption. Furthermore, this vote is not for the benefit of the Chambers of Commerce, but for the purpose of inducing press representatives to come to Australia. It is not to be assumed that the politics discussed by the Chambers of Commerce will be reflected by the press representatives who will come from England. They will be men of the very highest repute in their profession, and representing leading newspapers of various shades of political thought ; their duty will be to transmit correct reports, and to describe Australia, as it is. The comparison that has been made between the globe-trotter who occasionally visits Australia and the trained journalists who will come here on the occasion referred to, does not appeal to me. <inline font-weight="bold">Major Trevor;</inline> who has been mentioned, was not, I think, a journalist. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Major Trevor</inline> is not the sort of man who would be sent out from England on an occasion of this kind. Why should honorable senators opposite be afraid to have Australian legislation discussed by the Congress of Chambers of Commerce, if there is a disposition to discuss it? What is there to be ashamed of? Why should we not encourage people to come and see. how our legislation is working? Should we not rather be disposed to invite criticism, and to induce competent observers to notice how our White Australia law, our labour protecting devices, and the other liberal legislation that has been passed by this Parliament and the States Parliaments are operating. Although the amount asked for is small, I believe that it will do a great deal of good. I trust that the item will be agreed to, believing that the expenditure of &#163;1,000 in this way would be far more valuable to Australia than &#163;20,000 spent in some other directions. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that the proposal under discussion is one of the most useful that has been brought before us. I have no doubt that impartial reports about Australia will be . furnished bv the British pressmen who are to visit the country in connexion with the Congress of Chambers of Commerce, and I do not think we could find a better way than this  of getting information spread broadcast throughout the United Kingdom. I shall illustrate the probable effect of this vote by instancing the visit of the American Fleet. In a conversation with one of the highest officials of that fleet regarding his impressions of Australia, he said quite frankly : &#34; I had no idea of the progress of Australia from a political as well as an intellectual point of view. I have seen in Australia a civilization which is superior in many respects to the highest civilization in the United States, and, in some respects, to the highest civilization in the capitals of Europe. Until I came here I had no correct impression of Australia, its advancement, and its magnificent cities. I have had some glimpses of the country. Wherever I go, I shall be a messenger pointing out  your   high civilization, your splendid democratic institutions, and the fact that Government and people seem to work together, especially for the advancement of all classes, better here than in any other place in the world that I have seen.&#34; Not one of us will have a chance of interfering with these journalists. They will be picked and impartial men. They will not enter, I presume, into the political arena, and I anticipate that the  very  glowing expressions which fell from the Admirals and officers of the American Fleet will be repeated by them when they come to see our progress and our possibilities. If they do that, and scatter the information  broadcast,  as they will, through in- *  fluential  newspapers, in the name of common sense what harm can be done to any interests in Australia ? What harm can arise to any political party ? Can the most rabid senator on the other side say that there is any probability of the slightest injury being done to party or class, to man, woman, or child, in Australia? </para>

                        <para>- I am stating my experience of Chambers of Commerce, and I defy the honorable senator to disprove the statement I have just made. When the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston</inline> inaugurated a <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> of common honesty and decency in the administration of the Customs, was there a Chamber of Commerce which did not denounce him? No. Again, who invented and circulated abroad the lies about the Six Hatters and the <inline font-style="italic">Petriana</inline> Myth? Was not every Chamber of Commerce up in arms then? Yet this Parliament is actually asked to vote &#163;I,000 to subsidize these people. </para>

                        <para>- I am prepared to grant assistance in which every one can share, but not to grant assistance to a little privileged class. The Chambers of Commerce say they are opposed to Government interference with private enterprize. Yet here they are coming to the Commonwealth cap in hand for a, subsidy of , &#163;1,000 to assist them to carry on their business. In 1901, the Chambers of Commerce were up in arms against a proposal to create a White Australia. I am reminded of that incident by the fact that one of the principal arguments used has been that we should bring out these pressmen in order that they may see the working of that policy. Do we not know that some newspapers in England denounce us day after day because we keep our doors closed against coloured labour from other portions of the British Empire? </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The Chambers of Commerce are all prepared to advocate as much Socialism as suits themselves - and so does every anti-Socialist on the other side of the chamber - but when it comes to a question of sharing the benefits of collective action with the rest of the people they decline, because it would remove those people out of their clutches, and they could not fleece them any more. That is a privilege which they want to keep to themselves. The item shall have my strenuous opposition. </para>

                    <para>.-I am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has submitted this request. If there is one officer in the Public Service of the Commonwealth who is deserving of an increase in salary it is this officer. Perhaps more of the responsible business of the Commonwealth rests upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garran</inline> than upon any other officer in the service. He has had to be guide, counsellor, and friend to every Attorney-General we have had since Federation was established. The excellence of his parliamentary drafting is recognised by every one, as is also the soundness of his views. He is a trained constitutionalist, and is thoroughly well up in the provisions of the Commonwealth Constitution. I should say that he is perhaps the most diligent and deserving public officer we have. In my opinion,  &#163;900  a year is not a large salary for one who has to perform the duties which devolve upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garran,</inline> and I trust that the proposal to increase his salary will be upheld. </para>

                        <para>- In most of the States the parliamentary sessions seldom last longer than from three to six months ; hut since Federation was established we have had this officer giving all the assistance he could to Parliament, sometimes for seventeen months at a stretch.I remind honorable senators that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garran&#39;s</inline> position is entirely different from that of the parliamentary draftsmen in the service of the States Governments. He is launched, as it were, upon a new sea of operations, and in the work he has to do he has very little precedent to guide him. I am sure that the work that has been done by this officer has been of such a character that very few members of this Committee will refuse the proposed acknowledgment of his services. </para>

                        <para>- I am not reflecting upon a previous vote, but upon an extraordinary change of opinion on the part of certain members of the Committee. I may say that it would be competent for me to move a further request in connexion with the item, and I should then be at liberty to discuss it from any point of view. It seems that a considerable amount of favoritism is to be shown to the heads of some of the public Departments. The Government submitted a proposal involving an increase of &#163;100 in the salary of the head of another Department, and from all sides in this Chamber, and especially from honorable senators opposite, we heard denunciations of the officer concerned because of his lack of ability and efficiency. Ministers contended, just as they have contended in this case, that the officer in question is most efficient, that he could be absolutely trusted, and had great capacity for the particular office which he filled. All that, however, had no effect upon the Committee. </para>

                        <para>-I can hardly understand what other motive could induce honorable senators to change their opinions as they have done. We were told that the head of the Department of External Affairs is a man of great ability, and specially fitted for the duties he is called upon to perform ; yet, when the Government asked that his salary should be increased by <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100</inline> a year, honorable senators said, &#34; No, he is not worthy of an increase. He is receiving a. sufficient salary now for the work he does.&#34; We come now to deal with another office filled by a member of the same learned profession. The Government assert that the officer who fills it possesses every qualification for the office, just as they did in the case of the first man referred to; a similar increase of salary is proposed, and honorable senators at once agree to it. They have singled out the head of one Department, and on. the ground of his incapacity have refused, by an enormous majority, to grant him an increase of salary, whilst a similar increase proposed for an officer no more highly recommended by the Government, is at once granted. If that is not favoritism then I cannot understand the vote which has just been recorded. </para>

There are only five of them, yet their travelling expenses represent about half as much as do the travelling expenses of all the members of this Parliament. I think that the Attorney-General&#39;s Department should see that the expenses of their Honours are limited, and that they are not permitted the latitude which they have hitherto enjoyed. </para>

                        <para>- It appears to me that hitherto the Justices of the High Court have aspired to travel in a way that is not in harmony with Australian ideas. In this connexion, one might almost compare them with European potentates and American millionaires. Apparently, they must be surrounded with every luxury that the heart of man can desire. I do not object to them being made comfortable while travelling, but that they should have special reservations at the expense of ordinary travellers by rail is objectionable. The excuse that is usually urged for this kind of thing is that it is essential that their Honours, should be kept apart from the general public if they are to discharge their duties impartially. But we know perfectly well that they associate very freely with a certain section of the public. Most of them attend races, some of them go to prize-fights, I suppose that they all go to dances, and generally they enjoy themselves, just as do ordinary human beings. I do not object to that. But when it comes to travelling, or to living at an hotel, they appear to set up for themselves a Holy of Holies - a sort of inner sanctuary, which nobody is permitted to enter. I think that something very much lessthan&#163;3,250 ought to be sufficient to cover their travelling expenses. This matter was threshed out very thoroughly when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> was Attorney-General, and it was then clearly shown that a good deal of extravagance had been indulged in, and that there was ample room for the exercise of a little retrenchment.

                        <para>- That is the maximum. I would point out to the honorable senator that three guineas per day is the maximum amount of the expenses which may be incurred by each Justice. Last year, their Honours were engaged in travelling upon about 150 days, and it is upon that fact that this estimate has been based. The Justices of the High Court are not permitted to draw three guineas per day from the Commonwealth, and to spend what they choose. But they have the power to spend up to that amount. Last year the sum actually expended by them was equivalent to &#163;2 18s. per day. The amount upon these Estimates also includes the expenses of their associates, and10s. per day for each of their tipstaffs. I, too, further remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> that this expenditure is due entirely to the popularity of the High Court. Whenever a legal difficulty arises in any part of Australia, there is a desire that the High Court should visit that centre for the purpose of settling it. The different States of the Commonwealth can obviate the expenditure by abstaining from dabbling so frequently in litigation. Personally, I do not think that three guineas per day is an excessive sum to allow their Honours for expenses, seeing that it has also to cover the expenses of their associates and tipstaffs. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> that if anything can be done to obviate the necessity for spending all this money it ought to be done. Probably the time will yet come when instead of the High Court being called upon to travel all over Australia, it will be established at the Seat of Government, and suitors will be compelled to prosecute their claims there. But if that plan were adopted at the present juncture, I should like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> to tell me what would be the cost to litigants? </para>

                    <para>. - When the constitution of the High Court was being considered, I recollect <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> declaring that in his opinion it was necessary that the Justices of that tribunal should be brought as close to any litigant in the Commonwealth as that litigant might desire. When he gave utterance to that opinion, honorable senators were entirely in sympathy with him. Notwithstanding the assertion which was made when we were providing the necessary machinery for the establishment of the High Court, that it would have very little to do, it cannot be denied that it is the hardest-worked tribunal in the Commonwealth. Every week it is to be found discharging its judicial functions in one State or another. It visits each State at least once a year. I know of no corresponding tribunal in any part of the world which does anything like the same amount of travelling. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has stated that when the Justices of the High Court travel by rail they enjoy special reservations in the shape of parlour cars. Having seen their Honours travelling between Melbourne and Sydney on more than one occasion, I confess that I have not observed any provision of the kind. Certainly for themselves and their officers they have had one or two reserved compartments, but not more than the number of their party demanded. </para>

                        <para>- There is not the slightest reason why a Justice of the High Court should not enjoy the privacy that is provided by a reserved compartment. If three, or even four, Justices were travelling together they would probably occupy the same compartment. There is every reason why men occupying positions such as these gentlemen do should have complete privacy if they wish. They should not be compelled to travel in a car where anybody may, within his own rights, proceed to criticise the administration of justice, or even discuss a case that is being, or has been, heard by the Court. I believe that in every State of the Commonwealth it is the custom for the Judges to have special compartments reserved for them. This is not done in the interests of the Judges themselves, but in the interests of the purity of. justice, and, indeed, of the seeming purity of its administration. As far as concerns the other remarks of the honorable senator, I point out that when the Judges of the High Court visit one of the capital cities, practically no accommodation for them is provided by the </para>

                        <para>- The Courts are not open at night, and, what is more, the Commonwealth has no control over the Court buildings. We have to depend, for accommodation, upon the. goodwill of the States to enable the High Court to sit and hear arguments. It is necessary for the Judges to engage quarters at an hotel, and, in addition to their sleeping accommodation, they must have one, two, or, perhaps, more&#39; rooms in which to .meet and consult. We have not a single building in which we can put them in any one of the capitals. Under these circumstances, the ordinary hotel bill which is paid by a private individual cannot be the measure of the expense to which a Judge of the High Court will be put. I may add that it has been a matter of admiration and wonder amongst members of the legal profession throughout Australia that the Judges of the High Court have sat day after <inline font-style="italic">duy,,</inline> sometimes for weeks at a time, hearing arguments in cases till four or half-past four in the afternoon, and the next morning, after concluding a long case, at half-past ten, have delivered most exhaustive and conclusive judgments. The Judges would not be able to do that unless they met at night. The accommodation that has to be secured for this purpose necessari.lv swells the expenditure.

                <para class="block">In submitting this proposition, I wish to make it clear that I have the highest regard for all the Commonwealth departmental heads. I have ever found them courteous, obliging, and, so far as I have been able to judge, men of great capacity. But when the Committee at an earlier stage made it clear by a large majority that they were in favour of reducing the salary of one departmental head, I took it that they were indisposed to vote for increases for the heads of other Departments. It is true that some honorable senators did challenge the ability of one executive officer. I made no comment on that gentleman&#39;s capacity. The action that I took was not based on personal grounds. I do not say that any of these officers are incompetent. On the contrary, I maintain that they are highly capable, thoroughly qualified, kindly disposed, and courteous gentlemen. But, because we have made it clear that the Committee was against an increase in one case, I maintain that we should, to be consistent, reduce the other salaries on which increases have been made. </para>

                        <para>- No, I do not. These proposed increases have the unanimous support, not merely of the late Government, but of the present Administration. It is not, however, contended that the officers in question are badly paid. They are fairly well paid. It would be manifestly unfair to single out one departmental head for a reduction. </para>

                        <para>- According to the statement of the Minister, the work done by the permanent head of the Department of External Affairs is of the highest importance to the Commonwealth. He is sometimes intrusted with difficult and intricate negotiations. If rumour be correct, he has for a long time almost run the Department. It appears to me to be unfair to knock down that officer&#39;s salary to the extent of &#163;100, and to approve of the other recommendations for increases. I, in common with other Labour members, am opposed to increasing these salaries. I think that they are fairly large for the work performed. If there is a justification for a decrease in one case, the Committee, to be consistent, should vote against proposed increases in others. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> &#39;s request will not be adopted. If there is a Department in the Public Service of the Commonwealth in which the work is multiplying rapidly, it is the Department of Home Affairs. The officer who is intrusted with the administration of such important work should receive fair consideration, and his industry should be rewarded. Besides carrying on his ordinary departmental work, he has had additional functions intrusted to him from time to time.  His  work has been swollen enormously. The office of the Public Service Commissioner, the Census and Statistics Office, the Electoral Branch, and works and buildings have been placed under the control of this Department. If we consider the vast sums of money that are spent by the Department in different directions, we shall recognise the necessity of having an officer in charge who will possess the absolute confidence of the Minister, will have the energy to carry out his duties properly, and the fidelity to act towards the Commonwealth in a manner that will be creditable to himself and beneficial to the public. </para>

                        <para>- So we have in Tasmania. If honorable senators will consider the responsibilities cast upon such an officer as this, they will realize the great savings that can be effected by a proper discharge of his duties and By due watchfulness on his part. They will see that an increase of &#163;100 in the case of an approved officer is very paltry beside those savings. Take the position of a man who is elected to this Parliament. The allowance to which he is entitled amounts to  &#163;600  a year, whether he resides within a stone&#39;s throw of Parliament House, or in the most extreme portion of the Commonwealth. He has the option - subject, of course, to what might happen at the next election - of attending to his legislative duties at such times as may best suit his own convenience. He may withdraw from attendance for a certain period in order to give undivided attention to his own affairs, or he may give practically the best part of his time to his personal affairs. Notwithstanding that those opportunities are open to every honorable member, none of us, I think, is disposed to say that the allowance is too much. On the other hand, let us take an officer who, as head of a Department, is dealing with matters of supreme importance to the Commonwealth, affecting the expenditure of millions in some instances. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; but we must recognise that the officer devotes his life to the service of the Commonwealth. He does not go into private service, nor can he enter into various fields of activity which would enable him to increase his income. When we come to consider all these circumstances, I think it will be admitted that to good officers the Commonwealth ought to be prepared to pay at least the highest amount which would be paid to men of corresponding ability and attainments in private service. I venture to say that a man who is doing similar work for a private firm would  receive a very much larger salary. I hope that the increase will be voted. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; but by other words the honorable senator gave the Committee to understand that he had recommended this officer for an increase of salary because he possessed certain qualifications. There is not one of us but has the highest respect for the officer, and thoroughly appreciates his honesty, his integrity, and his willing service. But I consider that any head of a Department is exceedingly well paid with a salary of &#163;800. If we had in the Treasury a few millions to scatter here and there, I might take the view which some honorable senators on the other side are taking, and say that it was a fitting opportunity to vote for a particular officer an honorarium for rendering extra service. </para>

                        <para>- They may be cheap at the price. But the position of Commonwealth officers is totally different. When we pay a salary of &#163;800 to an officer, we pay what may well be considered a fair and reasonable wage. I fail to appreciate the argument that if a public officer were employed in private service he would receive practically as&#39; much again as he is getting from the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- It is rather strange that there is always a number of persons ready to accept a position in the Public Service. There is really no parallel! between a public servant and a man in private employ. The latter has to contend with all the exigencies of the business in which he is engaged. But the former, so long as he is able to render good service, goes along quietly and smoothly. He has no trouble to contend with, nor has he more than the ordinary worries of a man&#39;s daily life.  His  bread and butter are assured to him. The other man, however, may be in to-day and out to-morrow. I have nothing to say against any public officer. But I hold that &#163;800 a year is sufficient remuneration for the head of a public Department. I sincerely hope that honorable senators who voted against an increase to another officer, and support an increase to this officer, will be disappointed by a vote in another place. If such is the case, I shall be very willing to recast the vote I gave on a previous occasion, if they make fish of one and flesh of another. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I venture to say that private firms are giving that salary to gentlemen who, from a business point of view, do not possess higher qualifications than those of the officer whose salary we are discussing. I do not know him personally, but I have some knowledge of the work which he has done for the Commonwealth. We, as trustees for the people, should consider this matter from a purely business standpoint. If we have an officer who, by reason of his ability, his integrity, his tact, and his organizing capacity, greatly advantages the Commonwealth, he should be remunerated adequately. Take, for instance, the visit of the American Fleet. I had the honour of being on the Northern Committee, and I venture to say, to a very large extent the success of the reception of the Fleet was due to the services rendered by  Colonel Miller.  I believe that, by the tactful economy which he practised, as well as by the exercise of his ability, he saved some thousands of pounds to the Commonwealth.. This officer had to undertake enormous responsibility in connexion with the valuation of the transferred properties, a work which was as much outside his immediate duties as that which he performed in connexion with the visit of the American Fleet. When we have such officers as Colonel Miller in the service of the Commonwealth, it is our duty to treat them, not generously, but justly, so that we may retain their services. </para>

We have a right to exercise some discrimination. If there is greater responsibility and more work attached to one office than to another, that ought to be taken into consideration. If honorable senators enter the premises of a large business firm in which there may be a dozen different departments, they will not find that the head of each is paid exactly the same salary. The private employer values the positions filled by those in his employment according to their responsibility and the work they entail. </para>

                        <para>- I hold that we have a right to exercise our own judgment in the matter. If we believe that one officer is deserving of an increase, and that another is not, we have a right to discriminate. I rather object to the lectures to which we have been treated by Senators Turley and Findley. It was suggested that if we supported an increase of salary in one case, and denied it in another, we should be altogether inconsistent. In casting my vote, I am not responsible to any member of the Committee, any more than any other honorable senator is responsible to me. My responsibility is to my constituents, and if I think that one office is worth  &#163;900  a year, and another only  &#163;800  a year, I claim the right to exercise my own judgment in the matter. </para>

I should like some explanation regarding these items. The year before last a certain amount of work of the same kind was authorized, and we were then assured that the expenditure under this heading would become less each year. Instead of that being the case, it has been increased by about &#163;1,000 in respect of these two items. </para>

                    <para>. -  The items to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> has directed attention relate to nonrecurring expenditure in that it is expenditure which is intended to cover the cost of repairs to the Vice-Regal establishments in Melbourne and Sydney. It includes such things as the erection of a brushing room and wood-house at the Governor-General&#39;s residence in Sydney. When these works have been carried out the expenditure will not recur. It also covers the cost of a new carpet, and of a gas range for the kitchen, at Government House, Melbourne. These things are necessary to keep the two residences of the Governor-General up to date, and to maintain the credit of the Commonwealth. I trust, therefore, that these amounts will be voted without further discussion. </para>

I do not know what Government House carpets cost, but certainly no carpet that I have ever possessed, has cost anything like &#163;2,000. I think that some further explanation of these items is necessary. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> has pointed out, in a previous year when we were asked to authorize expenditure upon the Vice-Regal establishments we were assured that the expenditure would be of a non-recurring character. I should like full information in respect of these items. </para>

The sheets of the projection of their respective States had been forwarded to the Governments, with a request for certain data to be shown on them. The map would probably take another two years to complete, as the work was of such a nature that to secure accuracy and uniformity only one or two men could be employed on it. </para>

                    <para>. - I intend to propose a reduction in the salary of the Secretary of this Department. The discussion which has taken place this evening has clearly demonstrated that the system of granting increases which is at present in vogue is one which should be abrogated as soon as possible. Although it may be deemed desirable to continue these officers under the control of Ministers, rather than under the control of the Public Service Commissioner, it seems to me that the latter should be vested with . the power to grade them, and to say what salary they should receive. If that plan were adopted, it is quite possible that the particular officer whose position I am now discussing would be graded at  &#163;1,200  a year. I. have but little personal acquaintance with him, but I hear only the highest accounts of his ability. I have not a word of criticism to make against him. But I should like to point out that we have here a slipshod method of carrying on public business, so far as concerns increases of salary. Either this office was underpaid before, or it is proposed to overpay it now. The work to-day is no more important than that which was performed two or three years ago. Therefore, to have a proper guide as to what should be done in this case, it is necessary to adopt some other system than the one in vogue. The system that I advocate is that the grading of these officers and the fixing of their salaries should be a responsibility laid upon the Public Service Commissioner rather than left to the sweet will of the Minister for the time being. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> made an invidious .comparison between one officer and members of Parliament. But public servants have enormous advantages as compared with members of Parliament, who also have critical and important functions committed to their charge. Public servants occupy permanent positions. &#39; They receive higher emoluments than members of Parliament do, and they have not to fight for their existence periodically. Every shilling of extra expenditure which they incur in discharging their duties is refunded to them, and quite rightly ; whereas the unfortunate member of Parliament, in addition to having a most insecure tenure, has to spend large sums of money in travelling round the country at his own expense and has to put his hand in his pockets at frequent intervals at the instance of people who have formed the false idea that he is a kind of minor millionaire. Some honorable senators have taken up the position that this method of granting increases of salary is bad in principle. I propose to give them an opportunity of emphasizing that opinion in connexion with this item. But I have absolutely no feeling with regard to the gentleman occupying the position we are dealing with. The matter should&#39; be dealt with purely as one of principle. I move - </para>

                    <para>. - I do not think that we need to bring into the discussion a comparison between what is paid to members of Parliament and to the higher officials of the Public Service. I shall not discuss that aspect of the question. The officer whose salary is under review holds one of the most responsible positions in the Public Service. If it be true &#34; that government is finance,1&#39; then the Secretary to the Treasury must necessarily be the most important officer in the service. Let honorable senators consider the magnitude of the issues that this gentleman has to deal with. During last year he had to handle &#163;14,000,000 of revenue and upward of &#163;6.000,000 of expenditure. He has continuous control under the Minister of these vast transactions. Shortly this officer will have to take a leading part in settling the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States. He will have to grapple with the States debts question, and practically provide brains to work out the problem in order to lay a scheme before the responsible Minister. If we only consider what lies before this officer during the next few years, and the serious and anxious duties that he will have to perform, we shall agree that that alone warrants a very high salary being paid to him. It does not follow that because we believe in paying officers possessed of special ability who are holding high positions good salaries, we also believe in paying inadequate salaries to those who are doing mere routine work. Neither does it follow that those who are supporting the cutting down of the higher salaries are in favour of increasing the lower ones. But I remind the Committee that there is such a thing as competition for men of ability, and if we do not pay adequate salaries we shall simply get the leavings. We shall have to put up with officers who have not been attracted by the hope of higher reward elsewhere. The Under-Secretary iti New South Wales receives a salary of  &#163;1,000  per annum, although he by no means holds such a responsible position as does this officer. </para>

                        <para>- But when we consider the magnitude of the questions with which the Secretary to the Treasury has to deal, we must recognise that the officer holding the corresponding position in New South Wales has not to perform duties nearly so important and complex. Take the Auditors-General of the various States. They are not called upon to deal with such large and difficult questions as come before the Secretary to the Commonwealth Treasury. A State Auditor-General is mainly concerned with routine expenditure and bookkeeping. In New South Wales and Victoria those officers are paid  &#163;1,000  a year. I can safely ask the Committee to retain the salary as proposed. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has attacked the officer, in this case. Indeed, he spoke in the highest terms regarding his ability. He acknowledged that the position was a most responsible one, and that the officer was thoroughly competent to discharge the duties intrusted to him. Every officer at the head of a Department of the Commonwealth has to discharge important functions. The permanent head of the Treasury has to be behind the Treasurer to advise him in connexion with financial matters. But still, it is the Minister who has to undertake the responsibility. It is said that there is great competition for men of capacity and special ability. Everyone admits that. But how many men who have been at the head of a State or Commonwealth Department, has the Minister of Defence known to throw up their positions to go and earn their living in the outside world ? I have been connected with politics for several years, but I have never known a man at the head of a Department, either State or Commonwealth, who has been prepared to leave the service because he has been offered a higher salary outside. That argument is simply a piece of special pleading. There is nothing in it, and the use of it shows that the Minister had to find a reason for retaining the high salaries proposed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has argued that the present system in relation to increasing salaries is a bad one. I agree with him. There may be a very good .officer whose manner is against him. Such a man will be likely to be kept back, not because he has not ability, but because his manner may not have been attractive to others. The Minister has compared the salary paid to the Secretary of the Treasury with the salaries paid to the Auditors-General of two of the States. But if there is one man in the service upon whom Parliament has to rely for a truthful account of the finances, it is the Auditor-General. It is his duty to speak out plainly and honestly. He is not there to ingratiate himself with the Public Service Commissioner, with Ministers, or with any one else. He can only be removed by a vote of Parliament. Within my own knowledge an Auditor-General has spoken out plainly and straightforwardly in connexion with matters where in his opinion officers and Ministers were acting beyond the law. I know that in a number of cases they have been spoken of by Ministers as officers who assumed too much, and took their responsibilities too seriously. It is not more than a month since the Auditor-General for New South Wales submitted, iri his annual report, a matter with which he thought he had a perfect right to deal. What was the result? In the Legislative Assembly, the Treasurer said : &#34; Who is this man who criticises the actions of Ministers? He knew what the opinion of the Government was, and we shall make him sit up before we are done with him.&#34; I was glad to notice that the officer stuck to his guns. Since that time the Ministry have climbed down, and are not going to attempt to do anything with him. In my opinion, there is no comparison between the two offices, because one of them is subject .to parliamentary control only, and does not get an increase except by its action. I believe that in some States a two-thirds majority is required to deal with an Auditor-General. We have nothing to say against the officer whose salary is under consideration. In Queensland the Government deal with the heads of Departments according to the same system. When one head received an increase, the other did. Taken all round, it seemed to&#34; me to be a fair position for the Minister to take up, but, of course, it had to be indorsed by Parliament. If honorable senators believe that it is a wrong system to adopt for the Commonwealth, they should vote accordingly. If it is not considered wise to put the heads of Departments under the control of the Public Service Commissioner as to their remuneration, surely to goodness some authority outside the Minister should be allowed to appraise their services, without, of course, any right to interfere with the working of their Departments. I intend to vote with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens.</inline></para>

As an old banker, I have no hesitation in saying that the Secretary to the Treasury would not get a penny too much if he were paid &#163;&#91;1,000 a year for his services. I hope that next year he will receive another increase of &#163;&#91;100. </para>

                    <para>. - When this Parliament assembled in 1901 I think it was the general opinion of members of .each House and the community generally that its sessions would be of very short duration. That expectation has not been realized. On the contrary, the sessions, by comparison with the sessions of the State Parliaments, have been inordinately long. Apart from that, we know that both here and elsewhere provision was made very early for the attendance of heads. of Departments, in order that Ministers might be kept closely in touch with everything of a departmental character which might be affected by debate. Not only have their services been availed of by Ministers, but they have been freely asked by honorable senators generally, and freely given. I believe that the departmental heads have attended through- out these lengthy sessions, on many occasions at considerable personal inconvenience, and worked many hours overtime, but I do not think that a single claim for extra remuneration has been preferred. Those circumstances could not have been thought of at the time when their salaries were being fixed. I think that honorable senators will recognise that the officers have given services which were not contemplated, both to Ministers and to members of each House. Those services have been of almost incalculable value in many instances in connexion with our discussions. I understand that no claim for a single halfpenny in respect of these extra duties has been preferred, although I believe that under the Public Service Act every officer could, if he chose, claim payment for working overtime. I hope that these facts will be remembered by honorable senators in connexion with any proposed increase. </para>

                    <para>. - I understand that this discussion is largely proceeding on the supposition that the salaries of heads of Departments should be the same. I altogether dissent from the view, that necessarily because a man is the head of a Department, the duties require the same remuneration in the one case as in the other. I dissent from the view that an individual officer, simply because he is head of a Department, is entitled to exactly the same salary as is paid to the head of another Department. It is for that reason, and not from any personal feeling, or desire to be unfair, that I have voted for one reduction and against other eductions. I understand that later on an attempt will be made to make the salaries of departmental heads uniform, restoring an increase which the Committee decided to-day should not be paid. If the effort is made, I shall have to vote in that case for a salary which. I think is too high, or in this case for a salary which I think is too low. I believe that in the present instance, the proposed increase is honestly due. So far as I can understand, there is no officer on whose behalf it might be more justly stated that he is a cheap officer than in this case, and I can make that remark with greater freedom because I do not happen to know him. The position placed before me is an awkward one. I believe that the proposed increase is honestly due, but I am confronted with the indefinite information that an attempt will be made to force me to undo the vote on another item. </para>

The honorable senator has to take the responsibility of voting on this item, just as he took the responsibility of voting to reduce a previous item. I ask honorable senators to vote for the item on its merits. I assume that they acted on that principle when they voted to reduce the salary of another officer. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> considers that the Secretary to the Treasury, is entitled to an increase in his salary, we have a right to, ask him to vote with us, and leave the matter to the judgment of the Committee. </para>

I voted for two other requests of a similar nature, but they were defeated. On this occasion, I propose to vote against the proposed reduction, because I consider that it is not fair to treat these officers differently. I propose to reverse the vote I gave previously, and if I had an opportunity of reversing the vote I gove against an increase to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt, <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> should be very pleased to do so, in order that all these officers might be treated in exactly the same way. </para>

Another four years having elapsed, the last Government came to the conclusion that it was again necessary to increase the salary paid to each <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> these officers, and strangely enough they appear also to have come to the conclusion that on their merits, these gentlemen are still equally deserving in even1 respect. They proposed an increase of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100</inline> in each case. If there is any reason why &#39;we should differentiate in the salaries paid to the heads of these Departments, should not those who held Ministerial office, and have had the best opportunities to become acquainted with the capacity of these officers, have been the first to discover that one of them was worthy of an increase of  -&#163;100,  whilst another was worthy of an increase of only  &#163;&#91;5 ? </para>

                        <para>- No, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and other honorable senators have declared that there is a difference in the capacities of these officer&#39;s which should be taken into account, and for that reason they denied the increase proposed in the case of one of them, and have supported the proposed increase in the case of the other three. It would seem that Ministers must have failed in their duty when they have not recognised that these officers differ in ability. I have come to the conclusion that there is practically no difference between them. Each of these gentlemen is the head of a public Department, is in a very comfortable position, knows that he is well paid, and will stick to his position as long as he can. </para>

I am afraid that the threat held out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> may have the effect of clouding the issue, and that because of it certain honorable senators, as has been admitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray,</inline> are likely to vote on the request now before the Committee iri a way in which they would not vote on the merits of the case. I do not  know  of any movement to ask honorable senators to reconsider the vote given in a previous case, and I intend to vote on this request as I have done previously, against the proposed increase. I may say that if I were sure that the Government proposed to recommit the previous item to which I have -referred, it  would  not affect the vote I shall give on this occasion. In the circumstances, I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> ought not to have made the statement that he did. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not care to let the request go to a vote without expressing my cordial thanks to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> for the trouble he has taken to tell me how I should vote. I said nothing in the nature of a threat ; but it seemed to me to be the honest thing to do to tell the Committee the view I took of the movement which I was informed was on foot. The fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> was ignorant of the movement need not surprise any one, as those in charge of it probably did not consider it worth while to inform the honorable senator. I felt that I was being placed in a somewhat invidious position, and I thought it honest to tell the Committee and the Government that if we were to have all reductions or no reductions, I was going for all reductions. On the other hand, if honorable senators were to be left free to vote for increases where they thought they were called for, and against them where they thought they were not called for, I indicated how I would vote in this case. How that could he interpreted as a threat, I do not know. I certainly did not intend the statement to be regarded as a threat. Our relations in discussing these Estimates have been of an extremely cordial nature. I desire that they should continue so, and it did not seem to me that the Government, in lending any countenance to the movement to which I have referred, were acting quite fairly to those who, like myself, gave an honest vote on the previous item. I asked the members of the Government whether they intended to recommit that item. </para>

I understand that last year the ex-Treasurer granted those employes who had been obliged to work very long hours owing to the late sittings of this Parliament, and the heavy work which the Tariff entailed, holidays ranging from five days to three weeks. In view of the undue strain to which these men have been subjected, I think that the Government might consider the justice of treating them in the same way at the close of the current session. </para>

                    <para>. - I understand that this Royal Commission is considering the advisableness of submitting a financial report. I am not in the confidence of that body, and, though there are several members of it within the Chamber, I do not know whether they will disclose &#34; Cabinet &#34; secrets. As to the cost of the Commission, the item shows an approximate amount. Of course, we cannot tell what a Royal Commission will cost, but if honorable members refer to the Estimates, they will find a table showing what other Commissions have cost ; and the sum set clown is considered sufficient to meet requirements. </para>

                    <para>. - I observe that an increase of salary of &#163;50 for the Commissioner of Patents is recommended.  His  previous salary was &#163;800. Having previously moved requests for reductions in respect of departmental heads, it is not my intention to move requests for further reductions. But I have risen to draw attention to the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown,</inline> an officer in the Patent Office. I believe that he has been in the office since its establishment. Latterly he has been declared to be an excess officer. It is said that because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown</inline> has expressed opinions in regard to matters affecting the office and the manner in which patents have been dealt with, he has made himself unpopular. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown,</inline> who seems to have a grievance against the Department, will receive that consideration to which his claims entitle him. I am informed, also, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown</inline> cited a number of patents which he declared to have been faulty or invalid. Will the Minister be good enough to say whether any of these patents have since been officially declared invalid or faulty? There seems to be a disposition to make <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown&#39;s</inline> lot uncomfortable. I know nothing of the circumstances personally. </para>

M. Newman, sub-collector, Adelaide, equal to six months leave. I raise no objection to that, because it is a matter of justice. The man was entitled to his long-service leave when he died. Have the Government any intention to take similar action in regard to other cases where applications for similar gratuities have been refused? Why is this case singled out? An employe named F. R. Bradwell died two months after getting his long-service leave, but the Government of the day refused the widow&#39;s application for payment in lieu of the remaining four months. Will the Minister cause that and other cases to be taken into consideration and treated in the same way as Newman&#39;s case has been? </para>

                    <para>. - There were very special circumstances in Newman&#39;s case. He had thirty years&#39; service, he worked from November, 1901, to August, 1903 many hundreds of hours overtime, and received no compensation for the extra service. He was entitled to six weeks recreation leave and six months furlough on full pay ; but owing to the stress of work, was unable to take his leave. He left a. family of seven children. The widow stated that the mental and physical strain caused by worry, anxiety, and overwork in his position in Melbourne, helped to cause his early decease. Only &#163;33 compensation was due and payable by the South Australian Government; but it was decided to grant the widow a gratuity equal to the six months furlough on full pay to which her late husband was entitled. Provision was made accordingly. My colleague the Minister of Trade and Customs states, in regard to the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bradwell,</inline> that his death occurred during 1901, when the State Public Service Act still applied to transferred officers, there being no Commonwealth Public Service Act at the time. He adds that he is unable to say why no gratuity was provided, but that whatever action was taken would be under the State law. I shall again! bring the matter under his notice, with a request that he should cause inquiries to be made. </para>

If, when the High Commissioner was appointed, the Government of the day considered that Captain Collins was not a suitable officer to act as his Secretary, his position in the Defence Department would have been filled bv some one else, and a new position would have to be created for him, or he would have to leave the service.

                        <para>- This is a matter, not of personal kindness, but of public service. An officer may be kind to me, but that is no reason I should not see that the interests of the Commonwealth are safeguarded and the Estimates passed in proper order. I was about to say that the position is exceedingly complicated, because when we asked for information with regard to this officer during the consideration of the Estimates of another Department we were told that he was employed exclusively in the Department of Defence, and that when we reached the Defence Estimates we could more properly ask for such information. We are now told that we have already discussed the duties of the officer, and should not again refer to them. I do not subscribe to that view. Captain Collins having been appointed Secretary for Defence, is either necessary for that position or is not. If he is necessary, then there has been a grave dereliction of duty on the part of the Government, who took him away from the Defence Department for three years. </para>

                        <para>- When we adjourned for a pleasant interlude I was pointing out that either Captain Collins was necessary to fill the position of Secretary for Defence, and should be brought back to fill it, or that he was unnecessary, and somebody else should be appointed to fill it. It is absolutely ridiculous to have the Secretary for Defence in London for a lengthy period doing other work, whilst all the time he is drawing the salary of that office. When this matter was being discussed on a previous item we were told that it was not the time to criticise his appointment in London or to cavil at it, and that the matter should be allowed to slide, as it had been allowed to go on for three years. I entirely disagree with that view. Captain Collins was appointed to go to London temporarily for a specific purpose, which mav have been exceedingly proper, and Parliament was informed that that purpose was to supervise the purchase &#169;f warlike stores. Nobody cavilled at that time, nor do I think that anybody was entitled to do so, because it was a very laudable and legitimate purpose. But when we find that the so-called temporary appointment has degenerated into what is practically a permanent one, it is time to offer a protest and to take such action as will clearly inform the Government of the intention of Parliament. The Defence Department costs a great deal of money every year. On these Estimates we are asked to vote in round figures &#163;750,000. It is a very serious question whether the Commonwealth is getting full value for that very large expenditure. But apart altogether from that, it is a matter of serious concern to the people to know whether proper steps are being taken to provide for their defence or not. The whole object of having a permanent head of the Department is to supervise its internal affairs,, and to see that they are properly administered. How can Captain Collins, the permanent head, supervise, when  14,000  miles away, the working and administration of this great Department, and assure us that we are getting value for. the very large expenditure in which the Commonwealth indulges? I do not want it to be understood for a moment that I am cavilling at. that large expenditure. Whilst I remain here I shall cheerfully vote a larger expenditure for defence, but at the same time I shall always be anxious to get at least reasonable value for it. We cannot have a Department properly organized whilst its permanent head, who is supposed to be so necessary for its. proper conduct, is practically permanently absent in London filling another position. Captain Collins is either necessary or unnecessary. If he is necessary then his temporary appointment should have ceased long ago. If he is not essential to the Department then he should be appointed to .the position in London, and somebody else put at its head. It is only by adopting a system of that kind that we can ever hope to have anything like proper organization in -the Department, which I believe is one of the most important Departments in the Commonwealth. It is the Department on which in the hour of danger we shall have to rely most. I do not intend to allude to the history of Captain Collins&#39; appointment in London, any further than to say that when Parliament consented to it we were informed that it would be merely of a temporary character, and that this officer had been sent Home to perform a .specific duty. When that duty was performed, Captain Collins should have been recalled. If it is contended that we are still purchasing warlike stores, and that it is necessary that Captain Collins should remain in London to supervise their purchase, he should be permanently appointed to carry out that work, and some one else should be appointed as permanent head of the Defence Department. In order to test the feeling of the Committee on this matter, I intend, at the close of my remarks, to submit a request for the reduction of the item bv <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1.</inline></para>

                        <para>- The difficulty is that if the request before the Committee be agreed to. it means the abolition of the office, and another thing is that, as half of the financial year has elapsed, half the vote has been properly expended in anticipation that it would be passed, and a serious position would be created. If it is necessary that we should have a representative of the Commonwealth in London, Parliament should be consulted in the matter. It cannot be contended that Captain Collins is being paid <inline font-style="italic">&#163;900</inline> a year as Secretary for Defence when we know that he has not been carrying out the duties of that office for a very long timepast. </para>

                        <para>- The point is that Captain Collins is paid the salary as Secretary for Defence, and he is not here to perform the duties of his office. As <inline font-weight="bold">&#39;Senator Turley</inline> suggested some time ago, I think it is extremely doubtful that Captain Collins possesses the necessary qualifications <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> effectively supervise the purchase of warlike stores. If that work is to be done properly, the officer intrusted with . it should possess qualifications which are not required in an ordinary soldier. He should&#34; be what is known as a &#34; fi remaster,&#34; and should be able to test explosives. We have no guarantee that Captain Collins possesses such qualifications. If the whole of the items in these &#39;Estimates were properly scrutinized, we might discover that the Commonwealth has to pay very considerable sums for outside assistance in London to deal with these very matters. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> has submitted a request for the omission of this item. But I do not see my way to support it. Captain Collins has done the work which he was asked to do in London for six months of the financial year, and. if the item is left out, the responsibility will be  thrown upon the Government of paying  him  for the time he has put in, and his office will then be abolished. There is a &#34;great deal in the contention that it is very questionable whether either of the officers provided for in this vote are competent to do the work necessary in the Old Country in passing warlike materials and ammunition. The Minister has informed us that -a man who is put down on the Estimates as an accountant is inspector of stores, and has gone Home to perform this work. I find it difficult to believe that a man possessing the necessary qualifications to pass warlike material would be in this Department at a salary of &#163;600 a year. We have been told &#34;that Captain Collins was sent to England because the Government were spending large sums of money in the purchase of warlike stores, and because this work had previously been done in a very perfunctory fashion. That was the ostensible reason why he was removed from his position as Secretary of the Defence Department. But I think that the &#171;real reason is sti&#39;ll in the background. The men who were previously intrusted with the task of purchasing warlike material for the -Commonwealth were paid a commission upon the amount of their purchases. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. That was the system adopted by all the States prior to Federation. Because their Agents-General were not competent to undertake this -work, they appealed to the military authorities in England, and obtained the assistance of a competent ma.n, who was paid, bv the State foc which he acted, a commission upon the amount of his purchases. But that arrangement was not regarded as satisfactory, and Captain Collins was accordingly despatched to the Old Country to see that the work was carried out in a proper manner. It has not been suggested that he himself was capable of undertaking that work.

                        <para>- I think that that is a fair question. If it be necessary to have a Secretary of the Defence Department, Captain Collins should be recalled to take up the duties for which he is paid, but if it is not necessary to have such an officer, then he should be continued in his present position. We have also been told that Captain Collins has succeeded in getting upon the track of large sums of money belonging to the Commonwealth, which were distributed over London, and that he has thus been able to effect considerable savings. It requires a more vivid imagination than I possess to suggest any explanation as to why these moneys were floating about London. Let us reverse the present position by assuming that certain sums belonging to the Commonwealth were lodged in different portions of that city, and that there was also a large amount of work&#39; to be done there in connexion with the purchase of warlike stores. What would have been &#39;said if the leading officer in the Treasury Department had been sent to London to get upon the track of all these moneys, and also to undertake the purchase of warlike material? Such a communication, I venture to say, would have been received with the utmost derision. Why? Because it is questionable whether any officer from the Treasury Department would be competent to examine warlike stores. The result would have been that Parliament would have said, &#34; This officer was sent to London ostensibly to look after matters connected with the Treasury Department.&#34; Captain Collins has been three or four years in London, presumably looking after all the Commonwealth work which has to be transacted there, while he is paid for work which is supposed to be done in Melbourne. Then we have the Acting Secretary of the Defence Department, who receives, I suppose, &#163;600 or &#163;700 a year, doing the work of a man whose salary is &#163;900; and I regard that as most unfair. If it were a temporary arrangement for a few months, not much could be said, but we expect this acting official to take the whole of the  responsibility  for an indefinite period ; and I can only regard the arrangement as sweating in one of its worst forms. If it is necessary to pay &#163;900 a year for a competent official, how can we expect the work to be done in a satisfactory manner by a man in receipt of about two-thirds of  that amount? In any of the ordinary occupations of life, if a man receiving&#163;3 per week be called away, and the next in rank, whose salary is <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> a week, be called upon to do the work, he would, if a member of a union, be considered a scab if the arrangement continued for more than a very short time. I am sure that the Senate does not desire to countenance such a state of affairs for one moment. I cannot blame the present Government, and I should be sorry to think that any Government would countenance anything such as we have been told by rumour in connexion with the matter now under discussion. I cannot support the amendment submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chat-</inline> away, but I understand that, if that amendment be defeated, as I have no doubt it will be, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> is prepared with another which will convey to the Government an intimation that some alteration is necessary, and that if there is no change by next year the Estimates will not be dealt with in the perfunctory manner which is now inevitable owing to want of time. If honorable senators realize that there is something wrong, they ought not only to say so, but to give the Government to understand that they have power under the Constitution to put an end to an arrangement which is so much to the detriment of the Department. </para>

                    <para>. - I am not disposed to vote to strike out the item, because I think that Captain Collins should be compensated for the work which he has done in London; but I intend to support a subsequent amendment to reduce the amount by as an indication of the opinion of the Committee that the present arrangement is unsatisfactory. Captain Collins seems to be a sort of Pooh-bah. He was sent to London to do certain work, the opinion being that a High Commissioner was soon to be appointed, but no appointment has been made. This officer may be the most competent in the service, yet I fail to see how he can satisfactorily fill the position of Secretary to the Defence Department while attending to duties devolving on him as representative of the Commonwealth in London, where, in addition to supervising the purchase of defence material, he has to deal with financial and other matters. If the salary is reduced by <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1,</inline> I hope that the Government will accept the amendment as a direction that a permanent appointment must be made. I have nothing to say against Captain Collins personally. </para>

Is the &#163;500 set down in the schedule an addition to the officer&#39;s pay from the Imperial Government, or in substitution for it? I know that we pay the salary of the officer sent to England. I presume that we find the Imperial officer in quarters and travelling allowances.

Both officers are on the same plane. But the Chief  Clerk  in the Post and Telegraph Department receives &#163;40 per annum less. That seems an anomaly. Is it the intention of the Government to persist in giving increases to the Chief  Clerk,  and in placing him in a much better position than the Chief  Clerk  in the Post and Telegraph Department? </para>

                    <para>. - Precautions should be taken at all the forts to prevent their examination by improper persons. The military authorities in every country very properly desire to keep the contour and exact location of their forts as much a secret as possible. Some time ago at various forts in Queensland and elsewhere it was the practice of the officers&#39; mess to have Japanese cooks and valets. The Japanese are a very aspiring military nation, and are prepared, as other nations have been, to resort to all sorts of devices and subterfuges in order to get information that may be valuable in the near or distant future. While officers are allowed to have Japanese servants in the forts, there is nothing to prevent Japan from having her emissaries there. No Japanese would think it a degradation to him to accept any menial position if it was for the benefit of his country. This is a matter that calls for serious consideration, and the Minister would be well advised to frame a strict regulation providing that only white British subjects should be allowed within the precincts of the forts on any pretext whatever. Without something of that kind, we have no guarantee that the Japanese Government, which in the dim and distant, or perhaps in the near, future may be brought into antagonism with us, will not be in possession of complete plans and information regarding our forts and their equipment. I hope this important matter will receive the serious attention of the Committee, the Minister, and the Military Board. 1 do not know whether these men are so employed in Queensland at the present time, but I know that they have been, and I believe that what is true of Queensland in this respect is also true of the other States. </para>

                    <para>. - Will the Minister of Defence inquire who was responsible &#34;for the selection of the last company of men sent to Thursday Island? When I was there I learned with regret that some eight or ten of the men were a very bad lot, that they were constantly in trouble and seemed to get beyond control. My informant, who appeared to be a reputable and leading resident of Thursday Island, said that two of them had already been sent away. I do not know whether he meant that they had been court-martialled and sent away in disgrace or whether they had simply been got rid of. I gathered from a report on Thursday Island, signed by the Resident Magistrate, that the men were a very good lot, but another resident of the island, who was a passenger on the vessel by which I was travelling, and who must have known the character of these men, confirmed the statement of my first informant. He said that they were most disorderly fellows, and that it was unpleasant for women and others to meet them in the streets since they were constantly fighting and quarrelling. They were a disgrace to the service. He also said that there were still two or three unruly men there. Thursday Island has a very warm climate, and the Minister, I think, will admit that it would be well to send there men who can be easily controlled. I hope that he will ascertain whether or not the reports made to me were exaggerated. </para>

                    <para>. - I have a few observations to offer with regard to the item relating to the clothing of cadets. In the procuring of uniforms for the cadets, a very great saving could be effected without destroying that pride which they take in their drill and discipline. In my opinion, it is nothing short of cruelty to ask them to wear hard and close-fitting uniforms, in the warmer portions of the Commonwealth, especially in the summer months. For the purpose of disciplining them, as well as giving the necessary stimulus and enthusiasm, I think that a hat and a cap, with a belt, would be quite sufficient, and in this view I have the concurrence of some military men. I mention the matter now with a view to the Minister bringing it under the notice of the Military Board. I feel that, without destroying the efficiency of the system, a very great saving could be effected by adopting my suggestion. In view of the fact that the Treasury is rather hard pressed, it is of no use to spend money on the purchase of uniforms which the lads grow out of very quickly. A hat and a cap, with a belt, would be quite sufficient to distinguish the cadets from other lads, and they would take just as much pride in their exercises as they would if clothed in a full-dress uniform. </para>

                    <para>. - Under the head of &#34; Maintenance of existing arms and equipment&#34; for Victoria, we are asked to vote an increase of &#163;5,668. I ha\e no objection to voting any reasonable expenditure &#39; in connexion with defence. In his report, Inspector-General Hoad drew attention, amongst other things, to the unsatisfactory condition of the rifles. Last year, the appropriation was &#163;9,020, which I take it was devoted largely towards straightening up the small arms of the Forces. Of that sum, only &#163;6,322 was spent, and we are now asked to vote &#163;j 2..000. Does the increased vote mean that the Department intend to see that the whole of the arms and equipment of the Forces are put in proper order ? On the other hand, I notice that there is a decrease of &#163;5,047 in the amount required for ammunition. In his report, the Inspector-General stated that in many cases there were complaints about an insufficient supply of ammunition for the Artillery. Seeing that last year, no less than &#163;10,000 was voted, and that practically ever\, penny was spent on ammunition, how is it that this year the Department can do with one-half the expenditure? Is it intended to cut down the rifle practice or the gun practice, or have the Government managed to build up a reasonable reserve of ammunition so that in the future they can do with a smaller annual expenditure than in 1907-8? It will be recollected that on one occasion, in the Old Country, a Government fell in consequence of the supply of certain ammunition being deemed by Parliament to be deficient. Is the Minister of Defence in a position to say whether, in case of an emergency, our supplies of ammunition would be sufficient for all reasonable requirements until fresh supplies could be brought into the country ? </para>

For the last two or three years, a reserve varying from that quantity up to&#39; 35,000,000 rounds has been kept on hand. The quantity used during last year was 1 s., 400,000, so that we have in reserve now twice as much as was used during that year. The Department has ordered to be delivered during the present year,  13,800,000  rounds, so that we have ordered for the present year more than we consumed during last year, and we have on hand a reserve of  33,000,000  rounds. </para>

                        <para>- No. Not only that, bi&#39;t the number of rifle clubs is increasing very fast, and the quantity of ammunition issued to the cadets, as well as our reserves, has been increased. As regards the maintenance of existing arms and equipment, not only do we ask for a larger vote for Victoria, but in nearly every State an increased vote is required. In  1907-8,  the appropriation for Queensland was <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4,535</inline> and the amount expended  ,&#163;3,135,  while this year we propose to spend  ,&#163;4,065.  Up to a few years ago, we had not the short Metford-Lee-Enfield rifle, but the long one. The long barrel has not the same wearing capacity as the short barrel, because the latter has the same number of turns in a shorter space, and therefore there is greater friction. We find that with the use of cordite the wear and tear is much greater with the short barrel than it was with the long one. We are beginning to experience the difficulty now, as the rifles are being brought into use. This year the whole of the troops are armed with the short rifle. They have been using it now for about twelve months, and it is being issued also to the rifle clubs. This accounts for the enormous increase in the maintenance vote. </para>

                        <para>- That is being done also. The honorable senator will see that in -these Estimates provision is made for more armouries. The matter referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> is one which must be dealt with, but it is a most difficult problem to deal with. The cadet uniforms have been allowed practically to develop themselves, and with some very peculiar results. The matter is riot quite so simple as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> supposes. In my blissful ignorance, I thought that it would be possible to utilize the ordinary coat, and I still think we may do so in the case of the junior cadets, if we give them physical, instead of military, drill. If we are to continue to train them as if the\ were soldiers - and that is how they have been trained in the past - the ordinary coat, being loose and open, is found to be in the way. The soldier&#39;s tunic buttons closely, and there are no tails to get in the way when he is engaged in firing or bayonet drill. It is found that the ordinary sac coat gets in the way of the  rifle. </para>

                        <para>- They could; but they have to do a great deal of training in winter, and sometimes in the rain. What I have in mind is that the junior cadets should be taught physical drill, and merely the rudiments of. military drill. I should not put a rifle into the hands of a cadet between the age of twelve and fourteen ; but I think that at each school we should have a miniature rifle range, at which the cadets should be taught elementary rifle shooting. If this course were adopted, there would be some inducement to the lads to look forward to the time when they would be given  a  uniform and rifle as senior cadets. I should give them a uniform and rifle after they left school, and teach  them  a little more advanced military drill. After they reached the age of eighteen years, I think they should be passed into the militia.. where they would undergo the full course of military training. Another difficulty has arisen in connexion with&#39; school cadets. Different schools have been permitted to select their own uniform, and we are getting  a  large number of different units of senior cadets with varying uniforms. I can mention a case which came under my notice last week. A boy going to a particular school joined the cadet corps, and became a lieutenant. He went to the expense of purchasing a uniform, and  when  he left school last week, he found that his uniform was of no use to him, as there is no senior cadet corps in the metropolitan area which he can join with that uniform. He could continue as a. supernumerary of the school which he attended, but he desires to join  a  cadet corps apart from the school. I think that the uniforms of all the senior cadets should be the same. Honorable senators can rest assured that if I can bring about any reform in the matter of cadet uniforms I shall  be  most happy to do so. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to bring up a matter under the item &#34; Compensation for injuries on duty,&#34; in the general contingencies subdivision of division  130  in the Estimates for the Queensland Military Forces. I received a letter recently from the Defence Department about the case of a. man who was injured while in the service of the Department. He was connected with one of the military bands. He was an enthusiastic bandsman, and also took an interest in rifle shooting. I believe that we should encourage men of this description, who take sufficient interest in matters of defence to give their services for very small pay and train themselves as soldiers. This man was a carpenter by trade, and was carrying out a small contract. He went to the rifle range to do some shooting, and, while there, one of the officers asked him to attend a camp which was being held at Lytton, as he was the only one in the band who could play a particular instrument. I forget what it is called, but it is a heavy brass instrument, weighing some 20 lbs. The man said that he could not afford to give the time to attend the camp. He was asked at least to put in a few days at camp, and he undertook to do so. It was explained that as he was a small man, there would be no trouble about his instrument. He would, of course, have to carry it when the band was playing, but at other times a man would be provided to carry it for him. However, he went through the camp, and as soon as he returned to his home he was obliged to take to his bed. He sent for the doctor, who examined him, but could not diagnose his complaint until one day upon visiting his patient he noticed the instrument to which I have referred. He at once asked his patient, &#34; Have you been in the habit of blowing that instrument?&#34; The reply was, &#34; Yes. I have been playing it in the military band for some time.&#34; The doctor then said, &#34;I am afraid that you will never be able to play it again. If you have been blowing it whilst you have been subjected to the strain imposed by marching, that in itself is sufficient to cause your illness.&#39;&#39; Thereupon the man waited upon the military authorities, but they declined to certify that the playing of the instrument was the cause of his illness. Later on, he made an application to the Department for compensation for the injuries which he had sustained whilst attending camp. Months elapsed, but he could obtain no satisfaction by reason of a regulation which provides that all claims for compensation for injuries must be made within two or three days of the date upon which such injuries are received. The man was unable to do any work, and as a result had to pay a few pounds to get the wooden building which he was erecting at the time he was seized with illness completed. Thus, instead of making anything out of the contract he lost money, and as he was very hard up at the time he felt it severely. I did not hear of his case till some months later. When he visited me in Brisbane he certainly was in a very bad condition. He assured me that he had indeed fallen upon evil days, seeing that he was unable to work, although he was an expert tradesman. The result was that two of his boys had to leave school and accept employment in order that the family might be maintained. I approached the Minister of Defence, and put the facts before him. He recognised that it was an extremely hard case, but pointed out that the Department had not received any certificate to the effect that the man&#39;s illness was the result of attending camp. But some time&#39; afterwards the sufferer succeeded in obtaining a letter from his doctor alleging that, in his opinion, the playing of the instrument to which I have already alluded was the cause of the  illness.  Thereupon I again waited upon the Minister of Defence, and also upon the Treasurer, and succeeded in inducing the latter to grant him  &#163;50  as compensation. That amount, in my opinion, did not represent anything like the sum to which he was entitled. I endeavoured to secure  &#163;100  for him, but did not succeed. The  &#163;50  which he was granted was wholly absorbed in liquidating the debts which had accumulated during his illness. Once more I approached the Minister, and pressed him to grant the sufferer more compensation, or to provide him with some light employment which would enable him to tide over the worst of his difficulties. As a re  sult,  he  was  granted two or three months&#39; work at the barracks, during which period he was ill for twenty days. Only the other day I received the following letter from the Minister in connexion with this case - </para>

                <para class="block">Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Sir,</inline></para>
                <para>The Minister desires me to let you know that he has looked into ex-bandsman Wakerley&#39;s case and finds that in April last he was awarded&#163;50 as compensation for injuries alleged to have been caused while on duty as a bandsman. Since then authority was given for his temporary employment for three months, but the Commandant, Queensland, states during that time he was ill twenty-one days, and that only expert assistants are required for the temporary work there is to do. The vote for temporary labour being so small, the Minister regrets that he can only see his way to authorize the employment of men who are physically fit to dp the work. </para>
                <para class="block">I cannot quarrel with the Minister for saying that, as the vote for temporary employment is so small, he wishes to get the best labour he can for the expenditure ; but it appears to me that this case does not offer any inducement to people to offer their services voluntarily to the Defence Department. Had he been in private employ, there are two or three different Acts of Parliament under which he could have secured reasonable compensation ; and even now there is no reason why the Department should not endeavour to do him justice. It cannot be said that up to the time he was induced to give up his work, and give his services as a bandsman, he was unable to make a living at his trade of carpenter ; but, since then, he has been unable to work, and there is no doubt that the Department should do everything possible to extend proper treatment to him.  It does not appear creditable that the Department should be prepared to use men only until they become ill, or receive injury while carrying out their voluntary work; and this man ought, I think, to either have some additional compensation, or be given light employment.  His  children have had to be taken from school, and sent out to assist in maintaining the family ; and those who know him bear out the story he told to me. I do not regard the <inline font-style="italic">&#163;50</inline> as reasonable compensation, considering he gave his time and the best of his ability to the service of the Commonwealth, so as to be able to take some part in the defence of his country </para>

                        <para>- He could not have been in a robust state of health, or blowing a brass instrument would .not have caused his break-down. If the Department accepted responsibility for every man who, owing to his weak state of health, collapses after taking part in certain exercises, and paid him sufficient recompense to provide for his future, thousands of pounds would be required. Of course, if Parliament pass a law to that end, I shall be glad to administer it, though I point out that it is proposed to deal with such cases in a different fashion by the provision of invalid pensions. The man must have known he was in a bad state of health when he took up his duties. </para>

                        <para>- It is evident he knew he was in ill health, because he did. not desire to play, and the doctor told, him not to perform on his instrument. It. is not as though he had met with an accident while on military duty ; and, in any case, he was paid <inline font-style="italic">&#163;50</inline> and given temporary employment, for,  1  believe, about, three months, during twenty-one days of which he was absent on sick leave. It would be impossible to bring the Forces into a state of efficiency if men who are unfit to labour for private employers had to be taken into the Government workshops. I may say that the late Minister of Defence wrote to the Commandant, Queensland, and urged that, if there was any suitable work, this man ought to be given an opportunity. The Commandant replied that he had no work for the man to do. I wrote to him, and .got the same reply. I cannot take the responsibility of pensioning the man off, although I feel that his case is a hard one. </para>

                    <para>. - If volunteers in the Defence Department are to be treated worse than they would be treated by private employers, it will not be easy to obtain recruits in the future. The Government should at least give as good wages and fair treatment as private employers, and should assist any one who is injured in its service. It is all very well to say that this man was weak and unable to work before he went to the camp ; but, as a matter of fact, he was building a house - which he could not have done had he been so weak as the Minister says - and left his work on the Saturday at 1 o&#39;clock to go to the rifle range. On two Saturdays running an officer pressed him to go, because he was the only one who could play a particular band instrument. Afterwards, when the doctor heard what he had done, he said that it was enough to have injured him, because he had had to march over ploughed ground, blowing an instrument weighing something like 20 lbs. He was able to earn his living when induced to go to the camp. Had he thought that he could not take up his work again on his return, he would not have gone. It would be unreasonable to ask  that  he be pensioned off ; but, as I  told  the &#34;Treasurer in the first instance, he has a ;good claim to compensation.  His  children bring in a  few  shillings a week, having been taken from school to earn something to keep the home together, and I asked for &#163;100 so that  he  might open  a  shop. Now, however,  he  is to be thrown aside. The Minister sa\  s  that  we  have an Act providing invalid allowances; but it is not to take effect until a proclamation issues, and  we  were told when the measure was being considered by Parliament, that that proclamation would not be issued for some time. In the meanwhile, the man may die, &#34;for all that the Defence Department will -do for him. Those who hear of this case will not think it a good advertisement for the Department, and will not be desirous -of joining the Forces.  I thought that Ministers would  deal  better with this man. The Treasurer awarded him &#163;50 compensation, and the Minister of  Defence  promised to try to fmd him employment. He recognised that it was a hard case. When I heard that the employment to the man had ceased, I went to the ex-Minister of Defence again. A crisis-  was  then pending, and  he  did not care to undertake to do anything in the matter, but advised me to see his successor. I saw <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> a few days after  he  took charge of the Department. The letter that I have since received  is  the only reply I have had. This treatment seems to  me  to be harsh and cruel ; and I  am  very sorry that a Minister in  a  Labour Government should take up a position like this in a matter almost of life -and death concerning a man who has don-: his best to  serve  the country. </para>

                        <para>- Cannot the same consideration be shown to those members  of  the Instructional Staff who have been a long time in the service? I questioned the Minister&#39;s predecessor  on  this subject, and asked whether consideration should not  be  given  to  officers over thirty-five years  of  age who had been a long time in the service, making them eligible to go up for examination, just as do juniors, with a view to promotion. That was an eminently fair request. If senior officers are to be debarred from promotion, the service is deprived of the benefit of their experience. With regard to warrant and noncommissioned officers of the Instructional Staff, I think it would be a good thing to appoint those who by long service and exhibition of capacity have shown their quality, to the position of adjutants in regiments. These points are agitating members of the Defence Force, and the case put forward seems to me to be eminently reasonable. &#39; </para>

                    <para>. - Apparently some one has supplied <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> with a portion of a new regulation conveying quite a different idea from what the whole regulation conveys. Practically the effect of the new regulation is that if an officer was promoted in South Africa from, say, the position of lieutenant to that of captain, he shall in the event of a vacancy for the position of captain in his regiment be available for promotion to that rank. Hitherto an officer who came back from South Africa was not permitted to ha.ve his rank recognised, although he had received promotion for service in the field. The new regulation therefore enables an officer who was promoted in South Africa to retain the rank to which he was promoted, by becoming an applicant for such a position in his regiment, and being appointed without undergoing further examination. With regard to .the Instructional Staff, and warrant and noncommissioned officers, it should be understood that most of these men before they got their positions were well over twenty-five years of age. There was a regulation that a man could not take a commission as lieutenant if over thirty-five years of age. That practically meant that permanent men on the Instructional Staff were debarred from advancing beyond the rank of sergeant or sergeant-major. A new regulation has increased the age from thirty-five to forty - an advance of five years, which is considerable. </para>

                    <para>Under these circumstances it was thought advisable to retire <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brand</inline> from the Public Service under section 73 of the Act on the ground of his having reached the age of 60 years. The papers were referred to the Public Service Commissioner for action and executive authority, obtained accordingly in October, 1907. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brand</inline> subsequently applied for six months&#39; leave of absence prior to&#39; retirement. This was questioned by the Commissioner on the assumption that the granting of furlough is discretionary only and dependent on merit, zeal, and general conduct (opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs as Attorney-General), and in view of the fact that but for legal technicalities <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brand</inline> would probably have been criminally prosecuted or dismissed the service. This view was concurred in by the Minister. Under these circumstances the leave applied for prior to retirement was withheld. These facts will show that the action of the Commissioner in refusing to grant the leave desired by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brand</inline> was warranted by the circumstances; that so far from the Commissioner having overriden the Board&#39;s recommendation, no board was appointed in connexion with the second series of charges which were admitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brand</inline> and that the ultimate action has been concurred in by the Postmaster-General. </para>

The papers in the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department were referred to the Public Service Commissioner, and he was advised that in the opinion of the Department leave ought to be granted this officer. I. should like to know who is the author of the statement just read, to the effect that although the Board appointed to inquire into certain charges against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brand,</inline> found that they were not sustained, he would probably have been criminally prosecuted but for certain legal technicalities. There is at the back of all this a de termination to absolutely ruin the reputation of a man who has served Australia properly for the last forty years. I have examined the papers in the Department, and have no hesitation in saying that this officer has been retired nominally on the ground of old age, but really because the Department was not satisfied with him. Not satisfied with fining him, I think it was &#163;2, for alleged neglect, the Department now withhold from him the leave to which he is entitled under the Public Service Act. I know that the present Government have little or no knowledge of the matter, and I only mentioned it casually the other day in the hope that the Postmaster-General would inquire into it. The statement that we have had quoted by the Minister is not in  accordance with the minutes on some of the documents that have been sent to the Public Service Commissioner. Although the Board which inquired into his case acquitted him of the charge preferred against him, the authorities now say, &#34; We will find a way of&#34; punishing him.&#34; I ask the Minister to investigate this matter, and to see whether there is not underlying all this a desire to get behind the decision of a legally-appointed tribunal, and to impose- upon this man a penalty that he ought not to be called upon to bear. </para>

Even if it were to make up only one mail, a payment of  2s.  per week amounts to  &#163;5 12s.  per year, and that is, I think, the average amount which a large number of these persons get. It is a very inadequate payment, for which the Commonwealth is getting the blame. I explain that the Commonwealth pays the Railway Department a lump sum, and apparently it is not interested in whether those who do its work are paid or not. Some arrangement ought to be made with the Railway Department or State Government which would compel them to pay decently. </para>

As we go round the country, we talk about the minimum wage and a.11 the advantages which are enjoyed  by  Commonwealth servants as compared with State servants,  but  at every little railway station one cry is raised of Commonwealth sweating, and inadequate payment. The persons I refer to dare not complain, because if they did, their husbands would be moved to another place, while they themselves would be deprived of their living, which, although it is a small thing, is of very great value to them- This is the only opportunity we have to bring forward these matters, but it must be patent to every one that in the time at our disposal, it is absolutely impossible to do justice to the Estimates. I do not know what I shall say to my constituents when I go back. I shall be asked why I did not bring up this matter or the other matter, and the only reply I can give will be that the Government, insisted upon rushing the Estimates through the Chamber at one sitting. Of course, I shall be asked why I permitted that to be done. </para>

                        <para>- It is from the want of necessary consideration that such things are permitted to continue. That has always been my complaint against Governments. I have held out the hope to the people that if we had a Labour Government there would be a chance of righting these things, but now that we have one, I find that exactly the same conditions prevail in regard to the Estimates, and  even  worse. There has been no session in which the Estimates have been so shamelessly rushed through the Chamber as on this occasion. Hitherto we have had more than twenty-four hours in which to deal with them. Every Labour man, not only in Australia, but in Great Britain, has made a stock grievance of the capitalist rushing through the Estimates. But here we have a Labour Government doing exactly the same thing, and in a much more aggravated form than any other Government. I am willing to come back after Christmas, and to discuss the Estimates minutely. There is a number of other complaints which I had intended to go into, but I decided that it was absolutely impossible to deal with them in the time at our disposal. I protest against this sort of treatment from any Government. We have heard a great deal about the dilapidated condition in which this Department is everywhere, and how complaints of insufficient services are coming in from all parts of the country. I desire to bring forward one matter which has been agitating Queensland.

                <para class="block">Is it not a fine state of affairs that if these people in the back country cannot find  33  per cent, of the cost they get no service at all? Why not apply that principle in large cities ? I should imagine that if consideration is to be given to any one, it ought to be given to the pioneers in the backblocks. But no. Government after Government, while affording the best facilities in the thickly populated parts, penalize those who go out and settle in the back country. The report continues - </para>

                    <para>The burden falls on the shoulders of Messrs. P. Hoskin, O&#39;Sullivan Bros., W. Munro, sen., W. Munro, jun., J. Grieve, R. Grieve, sen., and Adam Grieve, who, for their own convenience, and that of their employes, last year had to pay a similar amount. This novel method of levying further taxation on settlers who have already a fair amount to meet what with income tax, Divisional Board, Marsupial Board and other rates, was considered grossly unjust, and it was pointed out that if the Commonwealth Government can afford to spend thousands of pounds on entertaining the American fleet and distinguished visitors, it would surely not begrudge, on the principle that &#34; charity begins at home,&#34; a paltry &#34; tenner &#34; for the convenience of a class of people it professes to be most anxious to serve. On the motion  of Messrs. J. Grieve and R. Grieve, the secretary was requested to write to the  Deputy  Postmaster-General, through <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> Page, M.H.R., and to the  Deputy  Postmaster-General, through <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> M. Hunter, M.L.A., asking that the demand for further subscriptions towards the carriage of the mail in question be cancelled, and pointing out that if inquiries are made it will be found that the amount of subscriptions is nearly, if not altogether, made up by the large increase in mail matter which has come into existence since the arrangement was entered into last year. On the motion of Messrs. Hoskin and R. Grieve any further correspondence on the matter was to be left in the hands of Messrs. J. Grieve and A. Walker. 1 understood that the Post and Telegraph Department was intended to be run on the collectivist principle for the convenience of people in every part of the Commonwealth ; but according to the statement I have read, people in the back country are denied postal conveniences unless they are prepared to subscribe 33 per cent, of the cost of the services they require. That may well have been a principle laid down by previous Governments, who conducted the affairs of the nation to a greater or lesser extent on capitalistic lines; but I hope that it will not be continued by a Government whose policy is supposed to be socialistic. I trust that the Postmaster- General will review this matter. The case I have quoted is typical of a number of similar cases to which I might refer. In many places demands are made for telegraphic, telephonic, and postal facilities, and the answer given is that the Commonwealth cannot afford to comply with them. The fact, is that for the last seven year the Common wealth Government have been handing back huge sums of money to the States, and have allowed this Department to fall into a state of ruin. I should like some information from the Minister in charge of these Estimates about the allowances to officers in outlying districts for increased cost of living. I see that a sum of &#163;8,360 is put down for the purpose, and I should like to know in what parts of Queensland these allowances are paid ? </para>

                    (&#34;Western Australia- respect to the railway employes who do postal work,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline>
                    must recognise that these people are not in the employ of the Commonwealth Government. We .make no arrangements directly with them. In some parts of the Commonwealth the only people in a central position able to carry out postal work are railway officials. In such cases, the Postmaster-General asks the railway authorities if they have any objection to their employes doing a certain amount of postal work. They are not engaged in this work all their time, or anything like all their time. The Railways Commissioners, through the State Government, state the amount for which they will allow their officials to do this work for the Commonwealth, and we pay the amount asked for to the State Railway Department. The Railway Departments of the States are controlled by the States Parliaments, as our public Departments are controlled by the Federal Parliament.. It is to be presumed that  the people of Queensland, or any other State, are as well able to guard the interests of the railway employes as we are, and it is their duty to see that their railway employes are not sweated ox worked excessively long hours. The charge of sweating in these cases does not lie at the door of the Commonwealth Parliament. In the matter of the subsidy asked for, I may point out that in some scattered districts, where there is a weekly or a bi-weekly service, the residents meet and decide to ask for a more frequent service. When the request is made, the Department makes inquiries, and if it is found that the revenue is not sufficient to cover the extra cost, they tell the people that if they will make up the amount they will be given the increased facilities for which they ask.

                        <para>- In most of these cases, the request is for the extension of an existing service, but it may be that where a new service is asked for, and the expense involved is considered too great, the Department ask that a certain amount shall be paid by the local residents. The complaints in connexion with these matters are not confined to Queensland, as the practice followed in all the States is the same. In some instances the States  Governments have been asked to subsidize  services. The extra allowances referred to are paid in parts of Australia where, by reason of climatic or other conditions, the cost of living is very high. This applies particularly to the northern and western districts of Queensland, and to Western Australia, and these extra allowances arc very much appreciated by the public servants in those districts. In connexion with the question which was asked to-day, I wish to inform the Committee that the cost of connecting King Island by cable is estimated at &#163;5,81110s., and the revenue to be derived is estimated at from &#163;75 to &#163;100 per annum. </para>
