When notice is given of a question that contains expressions which are considered wrong or vague, alterations are made before it appears on the notice-paper. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie to bear that fact in mind, and so far as he can, to conform to the ruling of the Chair. </para>

                            <para>- A question should be clear and definite, and of such a character that the person to whom it is addressed may know what is meant. But in asking a question the honorable senator is not in order in using expressions which, by implication, are offensive. He must recognise that the expression he made use of first is invariably regarded as offensive, and when he used the words, "The party without a name," after he had been told" that such words should not be used, he was distinctly out of order. </para>

When walking in the gardens this morning with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane,</inline> I was approached by one of the unemployed, who asked whether something could be done to enable men to get away from Melbourne. I replied that I did not think the matter was one with which the Federal Government was concerned, but I wish to ask whether anything can be done to enable men who are unemployed to go to other parts of Australia than Victoria. My impression is that they could get work elsewhere. </para>

                (New South Wales)  [2.52].  - What is the reason for pursuing this highly unsatisfactory and unconstitutional course in dealing with Money Bills. We have reached only the middle of the month, and there should surely be no pressing necessity to comply with public obligations. If there is, the Bill should have been introduced sufficiently early to have rendered unnecessary the course the Minister now proposes to adopt. Since the Senate has been a Senate this course has been pursued every session by one Ministry after another. Members of the present Ministry are in this respect, perhaps, greater sinners than their predecessors, by reason of the fact that they are continuing the evil practice, and are practically a continuation of Ministries that have ruled, or have been permitted to rule by others, since the establishment of the Commonwealth Parliament. Time after time this course has been pursued, until, so far as this Chamber is concerned, we have lost all control over the public expenditure, because it is of little use to discuss matters when the discussion must end in a waste of time. It appears that no matter what argument may be adduced against, or what opposition given to, this practice, it is still to be continued. I suppose that I am now only uttering a useless protest, and the Senate will bow down to the higher will of somebody in another place. I suppose that we shall continue periodically to vote two months' Supply, with an occasional vapouring, such as I am giving vent to now. I recognise that it is useless unless the Senate is prepared to discharge its duty of criticising public expenditure and dealing wife it as we have a right to deal with it.

                    <para>- If exception be taken to my phrase, let me say that all protests must be useless if the Senate refrains from the exercise of its rights in dealing with the expenditure of the people's money. It is idle for us to say : "It doesn't matter. Who cares?" We are here to care, not so much for our own convenience as for the interests of the taxpayers. I once more protest against this method of periodically voting two months' Supply, and at the end of the session, when everybody is weary considering an Appropriation Bill based on Estimates dealt with elsewhere, and being told : "What is the use of saying anything about it. The money has been spent under Supply Bills to which you have already agreed." That is a very undesirable way of dealing with money wrung from the pockets of the taxpayers. If my words are no' more than a useless protest, they are at least as effective a protest as I am able to make, unless a majority of honorable senators holding somewhat similar views, are prepared to support an attitude of strong objection to the continuance of this pernicious practice. </para>

                    <para>- - I agree with every word that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has said. It is high time that some other method of dealing with the finances of the Commonwealth was initiated. The honorable senator has correctly described the procedure hitherto adopted in connexion with these matters. The voting of money - in reality, one of the most important functions the Commonwealth Parliament is called upon to perform - has degenerated into a mere farce. Money Bills are brought here, and the Standing Orders are suspended that they may be rushed through without opportunity for criticism or consideration. As a consequence, wasteful extravagance is being encouraged, and Parliament is losing whatever control it ever had over the finances. </para>

                        <para>- We have nothing to do with what this Bill is based upon. We are dealing now with the financial operations for 1908-9. This is the first Supply Bill introduced in this financial year, and, as such, offers a fitting opportunity for turning over a new leaf. At the beginning of a new year most of us frame fresh resolutions, and propose for ourselves a new plan of life. Whether we act upon those resolutions subsequently is another matter. Here we have an opportunity to discard the old system and adopt a new system. </para>

Does my honorable friend understand plain English, even when it is spoken with a Scotch accent? Why should we not deal with this Bill in exactly the same way as we deal with other matters? Take the Seat of Government Bill as an example. If the Vice-President of the Executive Council were to move the suspension of the Standing Orders to permit of that measure being rushed through without delay, would honorable senators agree to the adoption of that course ? Certainly not ! They would insist upon being afforded ample opportunity to discuss the measure. My honorable friend behind me asks if I desire to see a Black Friday? I do not know exactly what he means. Does he mean that for the Commonwealth public servants today is pay day ? </para>

The money the payment of which this Bill is intended to authorize, is due to-day, and the Government - relying upon past experience - has purposely delayed bringing the measure forward until the eleventh hour. It is now two minutes past 3 o'clock, the Government offices close at 4 o'clock, and the banks have already closed. In these circumstances, the Vice-President of the Executive Council will, no doubt, appeal to honorable senators to pass the measure without delay. </para>

I am suggesting one way in which the Government may improve their conduct. If they do so, I certainly shall entertain a very much higher opinion of them than I do at present. I oppose the suspension of the Standing Orders, and if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> presses this matter to- a division, I shall be found supporting him. </para>

There is a way, however, of marking our displeasure without hurting any innocent party. The Senate may place on record its strong disapproval of the ac-  'tion which the Government  are  now taking by reducing the total expenditure .authorized by the Bill by a nominal sum, as an intimation that this Chamber will not, as a matter of form, always agree to the suspension of the Standing Orders. The Vice-President pf the Executive Council has himself given the strongest reason why the Government should not have adopted the course of action which is now proposed. He told us that the votes embodied in the Bill were based upon the Estimates of last year. If that be so, no preparation was required in the framing of this measure, which might have been presented a fortnight ago. </para>

That measure was based upon the Estimates of last year. We did not feel justified in asking .Parliament to grant another two months' Supply based upon those Estimates until we were able to place before it the Estimates for the current financial year. The Treasurer was only able to obtain the data necessary to enable him to make his Budget statement yesterday. Hence this Bill was "delayed, and honorable senators are now in possession of the fullest information. I repeat that the amounts authorized by the Bill are based upon the Estimates for last year, and not upon any excess items which appear in the Estimates for the current financial year. </para>

It was a most unusual course to ask Parliament to grant Supply in respect of a portion of the current financial year until the Estimates had been tabled. Every parliamentarian knows that. But there were special reasons why Parliament granted three months' Supply last session on account of the services of  the present year. It would have been unfair to ask for another two months' Supply until we were able to put before honorable senators the information which was contained in the Budget, and until the Estimates for the current financial year had been tabled. </para>

What is more, if my honorable friend occupied my position, He would know that the adoption of a similar course is sometimes unavoidable. Every Government feels constrained by the exigencies of the moment to resort to this procedure almost uniformly. It is very difficult to avoid doing so. Honorable senators will be in a position on a future Supply Bill to discuss the Estimates for the current year at length, and certainly with greater advantage than they could at the present time.

                    <para>-  I rise to bring under the notice of the Senate a matter which, I think honorable senators will agree with me. should be ventilated. It may not be agreeable to the Vice-President of the Executive Council for me to enter so fully into details as  I  intend to do, but I think that the subject is worthy of all the time which may be devoted to its consideration to-day. I propose to refer to the proposed coining of (silver in Australia, the proposition which was made for the manufacture of cartridges or cartridge blanks and cases in the Mint, the treatment which that subject has received at the hands of the Government, and the report of the Committee which they appointed to deal with it. Perhaps I had better first sketch what led up to the appointment of the Committee, and its report. The question of silver coinage has been from time to time raised by members of Parliament, either by questions or by speeches ; and I understand that the Government have been compiling data. Two gentlemen who are associated with the Royal Mint in Australia- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCay,</inline> of Melbourne, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Corbet,</inline> of Perth - and who have taken a keen interest in this subject for many years, have supplied the Government with a large quantity of detailed information as to the prospects and possibilities of the local coinage of silver. In the course of their investigations it was brought home to them that this work would not be sufficient to employ the plant and the operators in the Mint for the whole of the year, and that therefore the minting of silver might be made somewhat costly. Their technical knowledge, and the result of the inquiries which they made, led them to believe that in the same building,. with some of the same machinery, and additional machinery, and with the same employes, it would be both possible and economical to manufacture the cartridge blanks and cases which are now imported. They thought that the Mint Arsenal could be run for the whole of the year, and that in that way the cartridges or blanks and cases would be supplied at a much cheaper rate than at present. During, the past year or two I have taken an interest in the question of the joint manufacture of these things. On various occasions I have asked questions, and brought information under the notice of the Minister of Defence, particularly as to the advisability of the Government pushing on with the proposal. In April,  1901, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Corbet</inline> sent to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collins,</inline> Secretary ito the Treasury, a memorandum compiled by himself and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCay</inline> relative to the local manufacture of rifle cartridges and its relation to the establishment of a Federal Mint for the coinage of silver. They pointed out that the first stage in the manufacture of the cartridge - that is the making of the blank or cup - is identical in process with the making of the blank for coining, and that certain portions of the machinery are also identical. On the  24th  February,  1906,  they submitted estimates regarding the coinage of silver, and a memorandum which they submitted regarding cartridge blanks was referred by the Treasury on the  12th  December,  1906,  to the Defence Department. On the  9th  May,  1906,  after a request from the Government, Messrs. Corbet and McCay submitted a further detailed estimate, including building, plant, working, number of operatives, wages, and all particulars for a fully equipped mint capable of turning out silver coins, cartridge blanks, and cases. In May,  1906,  the proposal came under  the notice of the Prime Minister, who referred to the scheme as being very valuable. On the  26th  June Messrs. McCay and Corbet, after being requested to do so, estimated the cost of manufacturing  10,303,000  cartridges at <inline font-style="italic">£41,381,</inline> or at the rate of <inline font-style="italic">£4</inline> 3s.  per thousand. Various memoranda were brought under the notice of the Defence Department, and on the  26th  June,  1906,  Lt.-Colonel Le Mesurier, Chief of Ordnance, furnished a short report, in which the most pregnant passage is the following - </para>

                <para class="block">Further on, he suggested that the papers should be forwarded to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hake,</inline> Chief Inspector of Explosives in Victoria. In July,  1906,  that was done, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hake</inline> submitted a report in which he criticised at some length <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Corbet's</inline> qualifications, and pointed out as an objection that the two processes - the minting of coins and the manufacture of cartridges - were regulated by two separate Acts of Parliament. To sum up the remainder of his objections, he regarded the manufacture of cartridges in the Mint as dangerous. Any one who reads his report can see that he looked at the question entirely from a chemical point of view, being chemical adviser to the Defence Department. Apparently he did not look at the question from an economical point of view, and regarded the proposal as one for the exclusive manufacture of' cartridges in the Mint rather than for the mere manufacture of cartridge cases and cups. Messrs. Corbet and McCay then submitted estimates of cost, buildings, plant, and salaries, in detail. These were forwarded to the. Defence Department, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> who was then Minister of Defence, minuted them to .the effect that, in his opinion, there was " no one in Australia competent to express an opinion upon this matter." He suggested that the documents should be forwarded to Captain Collins, in London, for the purpose of obtaining information from expert authorities. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, who was Treasurer, thereupon issued instructions that the papers should be sent to Captain Collins, and they were duly forwarded on  6th  August,  1906. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hake's</inline> report was submitted to Messrs. Corbet and McCay later in  1906.  In reply, they pointed out that their only recommendation was that the cartridge blanks should be made in the same building as the silver coins, but not that the cartridges should be filled at the same place. This disposed of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hake's</inline> only argument against their scheme. On  12th  October,  1906,  Captain Collins sent a report from London, in which he said that he was awaiting reports from the Royal Mint, and from various other authorities ; and he mentioned that he had had . conversations with the Governor of the Royal Mint, the Right Honorable W. G. ' Ellison Macartney, who disagreed with the estimates of Messrs. Corbet and McCay as to the working expenses and the profit on silver coinage, and had submitted the estimates to the Colonial Ammunition Company's directors in London, who also stated that the expenses were underestimated. The Governor of the Mint said that, while it might be inadvisable, he regarded the proposal to manufacture cartridge blanks in the Mint as perfectly feasible. Moreover, as to the similarity of the plant used, he said that the Mint were about to establish a new building in Sydney, and that an experiment might be tried there. Captain Collins wrote : </para>
                <para>As regards the proposal that a nucleus for an arsenal might be formed by a Mint, I may remark that it is obvious it would not do to have a Mint forming part of an arsenal wherein operations in regard to explosives were also carried on, but as regards the contention that <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> Mint might undertake to supply blanks for the manufacture of rifle cartridges there appears to be no doubt that such a proposal would be perfectly practicable. The machinery necessary for a Mint is remarkably similar to that required for the operation of making cartridge cases, and it would be possible to have this. For instance, say our present factory at Footscray was supplied with the blanks" from the Mint instead of importing the brass cups from England, the Mint would then roll the metal necessary for the cartridge cases and would manufacture the cups. The Governor of the Mint pointed out to me that they are about to establish a Mint at Sydney on another site, and he thought that if anything was to be done in the way of manufacturing cartridge cases the time might be opportune in the establishment of this new Mint at Sydney for the Commonwealth to arrange with the New South Wales Government and the Mint authorities for the manufacture of small-arm blanks for the requirements of the Commonwealth. </para>

Greenwood and" Batley, in their letter of 2nd November,. 1906, refer to the " similarity between the blanks from which a coin is struck and f.he blanks, from which cartridge cases and bullet envelopes are formed." Later on, they say: "The process of forming the blanks for coins and cartridges is somewhat similar."   </para>

                    <para>The Chief Superintendent of Ordnance Factories suggests that the quality of the copper- used 'is more important in the case of cartridges than o'f coins. Messrs. Greenwood and Batley say  that  the metal for cartridge making has to be of the very best, and requires the greatest technical skill in all the processes of mixing, melting, casting, rolling, and annealing. The Deputy Master of the Mint might reply that the extremely narrow limits imposed by the law in connexion with the coinage of sovereigns make the melting and rolling and annealing of gold-copper alloy an exceedingly delicate series of operations, and the success attained in the evenness of the strips is really much less remarkable in its way than anything the cartridge maker can boast of. </para>

                    <para>The remarks of the Chief Superintendent of Ordnance Factories seem to indicate that, in his opinion, Australian copper is more or less suitable for brass, but is unsuitable for cupronickel. Wallaroo (South Australia) copper ranks with the best in the world, and it is quite possible that with a slight modification it might be found suitable for cupro-nickel as well as for coins and cartridge cases. It must be noted, however, that the Chief Superintendent of Ordnance Factories does not say explicitly  that  Australian copper is unsuited tor cupro-nickel. </para>

Corbet and McCay, various estimates are submitted from different firms, and a somewhat remarkable estimate from Messrs. Greenwood and Batley, the firm to which I drew particular attention. Various people submitted estimates for a rolling mill for cartridge metal, and for a rifle cartridge factory. Messrs. Greenwood and  Batley's  quotation is £45,000; Messrs. Taylor and Challen, of  Birmingham,  the firm to whom Messrs. Corbet and McCay wrote, gave an estimate of £12,678, or less than one-third of Greenwood and  Batley's  estimate. </para>

                        <para>- I think that Messrs. Corbet and McCay reckoned on the erection of galvanized iron buildings, and not of stone buildings. Here are the estimates of the cost of plant. The Superintendent of Ordnance estimates the cost of a plant to turn out 15,000,000 cartridges at £10,450. Taylor and Challen give an estimate of ,£7.000 for a plant to turn out 12,000,000 cartridges, and Corbet and McCay estimate that £8,500 would be required for a plant to turn out 10,000,000 cartridges. In view of the varying quantities provided for. these estimates are very much alike. This is the way in which the criticism of Messrs. Greenwood and Batley is dealt with - </para>

                    <para>The  Chairman  of Greenwood and Batley is also  chairman  of King's Norton Metal Company. The King's Norton Metal Company manufacture rolled metal of all kinds. Q.F. cartridge cases and silver, bronze, and nickel coins. This  is a great part of the ultimate scheme put forward by the writers. The King's Norton Metal Company is in itself a sort of Mint-Arsenal or Arsenal-Mint. It is associated with a similar company - Greenwood and Batley, which manufactures rifle cartridges. </para>
                    <para>Greenwood and Batley state that the proposal of the writers is " That in addition to the coinage of silver and bronze, the Mint should also undertake" the manufacture of blanks for rifle cartridges, of rifle cartridges, or Q.F. cartridge cases, of shot and shell, and of rifles. This misunderstanding of the proposals made by the writers unfortunately affect almost the whole of Messrs. Greenwood and  Batley's  criticisms. It is suggested nowhere by the writers that, say, the rifle factory should be a sub-department of the Mint. " The coinage of silver and copper is a simple process when compared with the manufacture of the above raw material." Bronze and silver coinage is certainly less difficult than gold coinage. The manufacture of Q.F. cartridge cases may also be more difficult than "bronze currency. 'In the King's Norton Metal Company these two activities are closely associated. It is usual in an arsenal for differing industries to be associated. Granting that the " mixing, melting, casting, rolling, and annealing" of brass for cartridge cases requires the greatest technical skill - just such skill is required in the manufacture of gold currency, where good coins and a high percentage of output from bars is a requirement. </para>

                    <para>In reference to our conversation <inline font-style="italic">re</inline> the manufacture of discs for cartridges at the Mint, I have the honour to suggest that it would be far more practicable for my company to make the silver discs required for coinage, should the making of silver coins be adopted in this country, than for brass and cupro-nickel cups to be made at the Mint. Mere brass and nickel discs are of no use to us, as they cannot be fed into our machines; cups are made by being cut into discs and cupped at one operation. The quantity required by your Department , is very large, and the carriage from the Mint to our works would be a very serious item, and the same thing would apply to the return of scrap metal to the Mint. The quality of metal would, if not treated as exactly required for our work, cause great trouble, and probably give very unsatisfactory results. The sum of money, I understand, mentioned as being considered sufficient, would not anything like meet your requirements. Our friends, Messrs. Greenwood and Batley, have made large plants of coining machinery for nearly every country in the world, and with the use of their machines we could turn out all sizes of silver coins in any quantity required, the nature of the work being similiar to cartridge making, but it by no means follows that cartridge making could be done by people used to coining. </para>

                <para>The significant part of that letter is that, as I shall show later, the very people who condemned most strongly Messrs. Corbet and McCay's suggestion that the two operations could be performed by the same machinery, and under one management, in this letter actually themselves proposed to do the work. On the one hand they have said that it is utterly impossible to do this work at a Common- wealth Mint, and on the other hand they make the statement, " Give us an extension of our contract, and we will do the work at our factory at Footscray." I shall show that Messrs. Greenwood and Batley are really the Colonial Ammunition Company under another name.

                    <para>In these circumstances, does it appear reasonable to entrust the establishment of a nucleus arsenal and its development to Mint experts, possessing no practical Knowledge of the manufacture of warlike material ? Is it not obvious, from the point of view of common-sense, that such an establishment must, in order to succeed, be under dual control ; that is to say, the main operations under the responsible supervision of arsenal experts, who possess a special knowledge of metals, in their application to the manufacture of warlike material ? L, think that Messrs. Corbet and McCay have certainly made out a case in favour of the minting of bronze and silver coins for and within the Commonwealth, and, in spite of their apparently optimistic estimate of profit, there is, I think, no doubt that a very handsome profit would ensue, and, moreover, the scheme would employ local labour. The proposal to devote this profit to the purposes of defence does not, in my opinion, affect the question in any way, as the allocation of public funds is purely a matter of Government policy. </para>

From it, I learn that that company is merely a sport of Messrs. Greenwood and Batley - that is, it is a small subsidiary firm which has been established, apparently for Colonial purposes. The total number of shares' in the company is 4,107, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arthur</inline> Greenwood holds 252, Messrs.

                        <para>- Yes. Messrs. Greenwood and Batley practically say, that it would be better to get this work done in Australia, and they suggest that it should be undertaken by a firm such as the Colonial Ammunition Company. Messrs. Corbet and McCay submitted a proposal which was reported on bv a number of gentlemen. Their estimates were criticised, " riddled," I might say, and doubt was thrown upon them in every possible way by Messrs. Greenwood and Batley. In order to get some light upon the matter, the Minister of Defence appointed a Committee, which practically indorsed all the statements of Messrs. Greenwood and Batley. That Committee thrust aside the statement of the Governor of the London Mint that the two processes are similar, and could be, undertaken at the same works. It refused to accept the conclusions of Messrs. Corbet and McCay, both of whom ho.ld high and responsible positions in different branches of the Roy a/ Mint in Australia. But it accepted, <inline font-style="italic">in globo,</inline> the statements of Messrs. Greenwood and Batley, and recommended that the Colonial Ammunition Company should be given an extension of its lease, conditionally upon it undertaking to carry out this work. In passing, I may mention that some time ago, Messrs. Corbet and McCay received a quiet intimation that they must hot continue to supply information to the Commonwealth Government without special permission. Consequently, they have had no opportunity of replying to the statements contained in the Committee's report. I trust that the Government will not entertain any suggestion for an extension of the Colonial Ammunition Company's contract, that they will give to the Senate a promise that no extension will be granted unless the Parliament is consulted, that if the matter of silver coinage is to be held over no contract will be entered into which would render the operation here less profitable, and that, at any rate, the findings of this Committee and their condemnation of the proposal will not be taken as the last word on the subject. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not care to allow this opportunity to pass without calling attention to the all-important question of wireless telegraphy, and endeavouring to obtain some information as to the real intentions of the Government in that direction. On several occasions I have asked questions here with a view to elicit what they intended to do in connexion with the establishment of wireless telegraph stations on various portions of the Australian coast, because I recognised that for the purposes of defence and commerce a service of that kind was all-important. I thought that in their replies to my questions of the 25th March last the Government had clearly defined their position, but in view of their replies to subsequent questions I am reluctantly forced to the conclusion that they are not altogether sure as to what their intentions are. On the 25th March last I asked the Minister representing the Minister of Defence - </para>

I was actuated by a desire not so much to obtain information about that particular portion of the Continent as to find out whether or not the Government were determined to go on with their idea of installing wireless telegraph stations right round our coast.

                </quote>
                <para class="block">I shall take that answer for what it is worth. Putting all the answers together and coupling them with the statement in the press by a witness before the Postal Commission, I am under the impression that the Government do not intend to proceed with the erection and installation of wireless telegraph stations on the Australian coast. That is the information I desire to obtain if the Minister is in a position to give it to me. I understand that the Budget speech was made in another place last night, and that the Estimates of Expenditure are now before its members. Can the Minister, in accordance with his promise, tell the Senate this afternoon whether1 or not provision is made in this year's Postal Estimates for the erection and installation of the stations which have been enumerated, and if not why it is not made? Is it because sufficient money is not available, as has been stated by the witness I referred to, or is it because the Government have abandoned their intention to erect those stations? Provision is made in the Navigation Bill for ships to carry, a wireless telegraph 'equipment, but it would be fruitless to enforce a provision of that kind unless we first put our own house in order. When I interviewed the Minister of Defence a few . months ago he assured me that any station which would be deemed suitable for the purposes of commerce would be considered by himself and the Department as suitable for the purposes of defence. In my opinion this question of wireless telegraphy is indissolubly connected with the Defence Bill and the Navigation Bill. I think that the present is an opportune time for the Min-' ister to declare the intentions of the Government, and to say whether it is proposed to call for fresh tenders, as I understand that a mistake was made in connexion with the tenders which were called for. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to draw the attention of. the Government to the continued delays of the connecting steamer <inline font-style="italic">Bingera</inline> with the ports of Gladstone and Townsville. I do not suggest that the Government are entirely to blame, because I learn from a return tabled in another place that the contracting company have paid fairly heavy fines, and that repeatedly special trains have been engaged in order to keep up the connexion, between the metropolis of Brisbane and the important centres of Charters Towers and Townsville. I assume that the cost of those trains has had to be paid in default by the contracting company ; but I am not sure about that. Notwithstanding the repetition of the fines no later than last week the <inline font-style="italic">Bingera</inline> was held up. That is a very grievous inconvenience. The delays cause a great deal of trouble, and I believe that sometimes they involve a large loss. I hope that the Postmaster-General will do his utmost to remedy the matter. During the last two years the passage of this steamer has been delayed twenty-six times, which means that during one-fourth of the time communication has been interrupted between Townsville and Charters Towers and Brisbane. It is of great importance to Queensland to connect the rich northern portion, both pastoral and mineral, with the busy commercial centres in the south. If the service is kept up uninterruptedly, or, at any rate, with no less than the usual delays in large steam-ship lines, business people are very much convenience and mutual arrangements can be made with great satisfaction to their clients and the promotion of commerce. Charters Towers and Hughenden are distant from Brisbane about 1,200 or 1,400 miles, and if the connecting steamer does its work punctually it is quite possible for persons at Hughenden, Charters Towers, and Townsville, to send communications to Brisbane and receive replies to them within seven or eight days. In the days before Federation we looked upon this convenience as most valuable, lt was almost as valuable as any railway upon which we had spent millions. Indeed, the railways would lose very much business if it were not for this valuable connecting link with the steam-ship <inline font-style="italic">Bingera</inline> carrying mails and passengers very rapidly between the ports of Gladstone and Townsville. Perhaps it is the most valuable link in the whole of Queensland. Some of us have privately voiced the complaints of our constituents on the subject to the Minister. I wish to recognise the attention which the Minister and his officers have given to us. But there is certainly a big screw loose somewhere, either in the <inline font-style="italic">Bingera</inline> or in the administration of the Post and Telegraph Department. It is the duty of the Minister to see that this screw is quickly put in order, because a great deal of dissatisfaction is at present being caused, especially in those districts that are particularly entitled to consideration. The residents of Townsville and Charters Towers, and those in the north and west, have claims upon our attention. I hope that this will be the last occasion on which I shall have to draw attention to the inconvenience from which Queensland has suffered in relation to this service. Before sitting down I wish to draw attention to the question of Papua, and what we are going to do with its administration and development. What is needed is the appointment of a responsible officer to take charge of the administration. Things cannot be conducted satisfactorily so long as the appointment remains, so to speak, in the air. I do not wish to reflect upon the Government, but certainly they have little or no excuse for failing to appoint a permanent administrator. We are also entitled to know what are to be the main lines of administration, especially in regard to the lands of Papua. It appears that it is the intention of the Government to advertise the Territory all over the world. But I am astonished to find that the Government intend, to. pay some of the expenses of a lady reporter who is to go to Papua. I dare say that the lady is perfectly competent. No doubt she will discharge her duties satisfactorily. But it cannot be expected that a lady can face the exploration of Papua in such a way as to give authoritative information to the world. </para>

                        <para>- I cast no reflection upon the lady. But it seems to me to be somewhat incongruous to send to Papua a lady who probably is not so strong as some men who might be selected for this purpose. Is it' to be supposed that she will undertake exploratory work in Papua? We must, I suppose, take it that this is merely a beginning. But I regard Papua as a most valuable possession, and the sooner it is developed the better it will be for the whole Commonwealth. I shall be glad to take this appointment as the indication of the beginning of a new policy. We want, not only to have Papua advertised, but the whole of Australia vigorously advertised to the world. I shall carefully study the Estimates and Supply Bills that come before us, in the hope of seeing, not £20,000, but a far larger amount, devoted to the advertising of our resources. If ladies are needed for that work, well and good. God speed to them ! But in my opinion it will require a very vigorous class of men, thoroughly well acquainted with Australian conditions, and able to bear discomforts and hardships, to explore our unknown territories, and proclaim their potentialities to the world. </para>

                    <para>-32]. - I join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger in wondering whether the action of the Prime Minister, in engaging for work in Papua a lady who has written some very interesting matter from the tourist stand-point, is likely to do much good. The lady in question has done some admirable writing relating to island customs, and she has written .guide-books for certain of the steam-ship companies. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">But, of course, that is tourist business, and we do not want tourist business for Papua. What is wanted there is, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger has pointed out, the collection of information as to the potentialities of the Territory, and not the collection of little oddities relating to native life as observed in the coastal settlements. We want an investigation of the position , in Papua that will be useful fo persons who are willing to invest their money in developing the resources of the' country. The tourist business will never make Papua a success, will never relieve the taxpayers of Australia from the sums that, they are now contributing for the purposes of Government there. . Possibly the lady in question will undertake explorations which some strong men have attempted to make, and have failed. Many, have been stricken down (with fever. Personally, I think that it is most undesirable that any white woman should be expected to explore the savage wilderness of Papua. What is to become of the poor lady if she is taken ill ? The proposition is almost revolting to the mind of any man who has any regard for decent treatment of our womanhood. I think it deplorable that a lady should undertake an investigation of the kind. So far as relates to tourist matters no doubt a lady can make tourist comments, and take snapshot pictures along the coast line, as as well as any one. But that is a totally different matter from exploring with a view of developing the resources of the country, which could only be adequately undertaken by men having a practical knowledge of what work of this kind means. We must have men with a practical knowledge of mining, of timbers, of the soils suitable for different classes of tropical and sub-tropical cultivation. I say sub-tropical, because although Papua is well within the tropics,' I understand that there are plateaux 3,000 or 4,000 feet above sea level upon which there is magnificent grazing country, and great areas of meadow land equal in beauty to anything that is to be found in the islands across the water from which some of us come. I have a few things to say with reference to the awful muddle that still prevails in the Post and Telegraph Department. I recently found that a letter addressed to me by the  Deputy  Postmaster-General, Sydney, in typewritten characters on an official envelope, and with all the designations that  officially attach to my name - so that there could not possibly be any mistake as to my identity ; a letter addressed to the house which I built, and in which I have lived for over thirty years - was actually sent up the country to some wayside place that is not even a township, although there is a small Post-office there. That letter did not reach me for four days, although it ought to have been delivered within an hour or two. I consider that such evidence of muddle requires a little more attention than it appears to have received. I have had some correspondence with the  Deputy  Postmaster -General about it, and, of course, the mistake was regretted. Being a member of Parliament, I was not called upon to pay the fee of 2 1/2 d.  to have the matter investigated. But had the letter been addressed to a common or garden citizen, he would have had to pay  2 1/2 d.  before his grievance was inquired into. This sort of thing is happening all over the Commonwealth. The last time I was in Western Australia a letter was addressed to me on board the <inline font-style="italic">India</inline> at Fremantle. It was taken to the ship after I came ashore. I pui up at the leading hotel in Perth, which is only a few yards from the post-office. There were interviews with me in the newspapers almost daily- </para>

                        <para>- The trouble is that I have so many that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> is envious. He would like to see the number of my virtues reduced to one or two, so that I might be more on a level with himself. I wish to direct attention to what is going on at the present time in the Post and Telegraph Department. Officers who have been drawing salaries .of between £200 and ,£300 a year, on retiring on the score of age or sickness, have their places filled by boys of seventeen. This is actually happening at the present time. There is a penny wise and pound foolish business going on in the administration of the Department, which renders all hope of improvement impossible, because untrained and inexperienced lads are being appointed at a few shillings a week to do work for which hitherto hundreds of pounds a year have been paid. 1 do not wish to deal with anything which might be discussed on the motion of which I have given notice; and so I shall say no more at this stage about the Post and Telegraph Department. I should like to recall to the mind of the Minister of Home Affairs, that some months ago, he very courteously gave me a promise that he would use his Ministerial influence to secure just treatment for certain professional members of the military staff in the Defence Department. I dp not doubt that the honorable senator did all he could; but what is the position today ? I have a letter in my pocket at the present time, which shows that some of our best and most experienced soldiers, who have had excellent training in Australia, and years of capable service in South Africa to their credit, and who are amongst the smartest men in the Defence Forces, are seeking, and are being offered, employ.ment in foreign countries,  because they cannot get decent treatment in Australia. That is a crying shame. We have voted increases of salaries for officers and the promotions involved have never been made. I remember that I insisted in this Chamber that justice should be done to a certain lieutenant. Parliament voted the salary for a captain and all hands were coaxed into the belief that the officer in question would get the promotion to which he was entitled, and the increase of salary" voted by Parliament. What has been the result? The salary has never been paid, and the promotion has not been made. This undue treatment, which is the very mildest term I can use to describe it, is still continued towards some of the best professional soldiers we have. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is perfectly correct. I have seen a statement published in the press, from which "it appears that the Minister of Defence said that two months after the last Easter encampment, 2,000 men left the Forces. Why did not the Minister at the same time give the reason for their leaving ? It was simply this : Two months after the Easter training comes the end of the financial year, and these men's term of enlistment being up, they did not resign, but left. The Minister and honorable senators are aware that men cannot resign from the Forces except under monetary penalties; but they can leave at the termination of their periods of enlistment; and that is what happened in the cases referred to. It is a shame that these things should be so misrepresented. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> very properly puts it, that it is a most undesirable condition of affairs that, in order to bolster up a brand new scheme, the existing Forces of the Commonwealth upon which, if .we are to have any land defence it all, we must rely for years to come, should be discredited by "Ministerial or Governmental action. I should like particularly to direct the attention of honorable senators  to a certain provision in the Defence Act, that the enlistment and engagement of professional artillery is to be restricted to garrison artillery. There is a ' Bill under discussion somewhere in the Commonwealth, in which it is proposed to omit the word "garrison" from the section in question, thus leaving it open to the Commonwealth authorities to engage as many artillerymen under regulations as they may consider necessary. </para>

                        <para>- That is exactly what I do mean. The omission of this one word " garrison " from the section of the Act, will alter the whole intention of Parliament in respect to a professional force and a standing army. I take advantage of the present opportunity to direct attention to this. The omission of one word only is in question; but it means all the difference in the world between the citizen force about which we hear so much trumpeting, and the professional force which it is designed to establish. </para>

                        <para>- No; but to permit of the engagement and establishment of a professional force of artillery. Parliament in passing the Defence Act insisted, upon limiting the engagement of artillery to garrison artillery, men to handle the guns in the forts. The omission of the word " garrison " from the section of the Act to which I refer as now proposed', would give the Government of the day, under statutory rules, the right to engage any number of professional artillerymen they please, for any purpose connected with field, horse, or any other kind of artillery. And why? Because the scheme we read about iri the newspapers is notoriously unsuited to supply the artillery or scientific branches of the profession. I wish to take strong exception to the practice followed in issuing statutory rules. They come out every week in shoals. I have asked a question on the matter, and have, I think, been promised a return of the number of statutory rules dealing with financial matters issued by the Defence Department, and the numbers of Orders in Council made in the last two years. </para>

                        <para>- I have no doubt the honorable senator is quite correct. They are issued in a most extraordinary manner. In connexion with the position and promotion of one officer attached to the little University corps of Scouts in Sydney, there have, to my knowledge, been some six Orders in Council issued within the last six months. Apparently the Department is unable to say exactly what should be done with him. They issue a regulation about him one day, and in the following week the Governor-General, poor gentle-  man, has to set to work to issue a new Order in Council for this one officer about, whose position there is apparently more uncertainty than it is possible to believe. What I wish particularly to emphasize is that all these statutory rules, no matter by what Department or under what Act they are issued, are enforced at once "on account of urgency." We have passed a law requiring these rules and regulations to be laid on the table of Parliament thirty days before they are enforced, except in cases of urgency. Every single Order in Council is issued as a matter of urgency, and Parliament is, I was going to say, practically swindled out of the opportunity to apply its powers under the various Acts. Of what use is it for Parliament to speak of its right to insist that these regulations shall be laid on the table a month before they are enforced when these wretched words " on account of urgency " are to be found on every Order issued, and Parliament knows nothing about them until they are stale. I have one here which has just been distributed, and which is dated 8th September. It is out of date in the sense that we do not receive it until the time within which opportunity is afforded to urge objections against it has expired. This is the sort of game that is going on. Parliament is simply hoodwinked, and regarded apparently by some people in authority as a good-natured body of imbeciles who will take no trouble to differ with anything that Departmental officials may decide to do. </para>

                        <para>- I may tell <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> that as the big brother of the Ministry in this Chamber he will have some more trouble. In connexion with defence matters I would invite the attention of honorable senators to the fact that for months past the Government have been proclaiming their interest in the cadet movement. At the Military Review which took place at Flemington in connexion with the reception of the American Fleet, the cadets constituted one of the great features of an admirable display. But we now find that all the enthusiasm of the Government in the cadets has evaporated, and that they are attempting to kill the Cadet Forces just as they have endeavoured for some considerable time to destroy the Militia, and the Volunteer Forces. Honorable senators are perhaps aware that when the public- school vacation comes round at Christmas time, it is customary in New South Wales for the teachers who hold commissions, and for the elder scholars who are noncommissioned officers, to go into camp for a week's training without pay. The Government provide them with rations, " and also bear 'the cost of carting a few tents, but do nothing more. This year, however, orders have been issued to the Sydney cadets that they are not to make any arrangements in connexion with this annual camp. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. In order to take part in one of the most remarkable reviews which had been, or is likely to be, held on British soil for many years, the Ballarat cadets were obliged to walk to Melbourne. The occasion was a memorable one, because it is one of the only instance upon record in which a foreign power has been permitted to march its troops under arms, and with bayonets fixed, through the streets of a British city to take part in a parade with the local forces. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell has observed, the Ballarat cadets - notwithstanding that the Commonwealth could afford to spend over ,£30,000 upon guzzle and pictures - were obliged to walk to Melbourne because the Government could not spare sufficient money to enable' them to ride down in the train. That incident is one of the most contemptible to be found in the history of the Commonwealth. The plea that has been urged to justify the Government's action is that boys could not very well be brought together in the city. But if they cannot be trusted from their mothers' apron strings now, how can they be trusted when they will be the defenders of Australia, as they are to be under the proposals of the Government? In Committee I may have something more to say upon this matter. If honorable senators refrain upon occasions of this sort from criticising the administration of the, Government they abrogate their legislative functions and the Senate will thus become a Chamber for registering the decrees of another place. I am quite aware that with the strain imposed by long sessions and almost interminable railway travelling, there is a disposition for men to lose their fighting capacity in the Legislature. Still there are occasions when it is necessary to pull one's self together in order that we may not be charged with entirely abrogating our functions. </para>

                    <para>. - It will be within the recollection of honorable senators that yesterday I asked the Vice-President of the Executive Council a question, upon notice, relating to the delivery of dutiable articles intended for use in the tobacco industry without the payment of the Customs duties. In his reply, the honorable gentleman gave a long list of articles which had been so delivered, and concluded - </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I might further explain in connexion with the answer to the second question that, as the honorable senator is probably aware, these ingredients mean added weight to the tobacco; and, as we charge Excise on that added weight, the return to the Commonwealth is much, in excess of the amount stated, ^13,950. </para>
                <para class="block">I venture to say that no statement of a more misleading character has yet been made within the walls of this building. I wish to draw special attention to the fact that manufactured tobacco is subject to an import duty of  3s.  6d. per lb., whilst unmanufactured tobacco is dutiable at  is.  6d. per lb. Tobacco manufactured in the Commonwealth has to pay an Excise of  is.  per lb., making a total of-  2s.  6d. per lb there is thus a difference in favour of the local manufacturer of  is.  per lb. But, according to the figures quoted by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, no less than  450  tons of commodities other than tobacco have been used in the production of the locally manufactured article. Thus the tobacco which would otherwise have been used would have been required to pay Customs duty to the extent of  .£75,000.  That tobacco has been replaced by articles which ought to have yielded a revenue of  £13,950.  But even this small amount has not been collected. Section  24  of the Excise Act of  1901  reads -  </para>
                <para>Excisable goods and goods liable to duties of Customs may, in prescribed cases, and subject to the prescribed conditions, be delivered free of duty or subject to such lower duty as may be prescribed for use in the manufacture of excisable goods. </para>

Nor indeed were we aware that it was being put to that use for a long period afterwards.

The brewing industry has to pay the Customs duty upon sugar as well as the full amount of the Excise upon the beer which it produces.

                        <para>- It may not be. My own view is that many of the articles which are added to it probably have the effect of considerably improving it. But, at the present moment, I am viewing this question entirely from the stand-point of revenue. I desire to know why one industry is allowed to escape the Customs duties levied upon some of its ingredients, whilst another industry is not. A very large sum is at stake in this matter. The revenue has already sustained a loss of many thousands of pounds. The Vice-President of the Executive Council was entirely wrong when he intimated yesterday that so far from revenue having been lost, it had been gained. </para>

When the Tariff was under consideration, the protectionist element in this Parliament was very careful to provide a wide margin between the Excise duty and the Customs; duty levied upon tobacco, so as to encourage local manufacturers. By administering the Excise Act in the way that I have indicated, the margin iri favour of the tobacco manufacturers has been immensely increased. </para>

                    <para>. - Before the Bill is read a first time, I want to refer to the declared policy of the Government, part of which is to attract population. I understand that it is now spending money, and proposes to spend a good deal more, in advertising in Great Britain the resources of Australia. We all agree, I think, that, compared with our population, our resources are very extensive. Where we part company with the Government, and with the advocates of indiscriminate immigration, is at this point : We say that until certain things have been done, no profitable employment can be found for added immigrants ; and that the bringing about of those results should precede anything in the way of a general immigration policy. No doubt, when looked at generally, the spectacle of a territory comprising between three and four million square miles, and containing a population of only four millions - that is, one person to the square mile - would lead any one who did not know the facts to conclude that there was abundance of scope for a much larger population. But when we come down to facts, when we analyze the ebb and flow of population in the States, we find that in Victoria for over thirty years, population, instead of increasing, has decreased, more especially in the country districts. I have here a publication entitled <inline font-style="italic">Monopoly and Democracy,</inline> by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frank</inline> Anstey, a member of the State Parliament. He gives very detailed information in regard to the various counties. Take, for instance, the counties of Hampden, Ripon, and Grenville. The population of those counties in 187 1 was 82,100, and in 1904 71,160, showing a, decrease of 11,000 in thirty-three years. Those three are agricultural counties. </para>

                        <para>- They are agricultural, dairying, and pastoral. In 1871, they comprised 3,617 holdings, and in 1904 only 2,317 holdings, showing a decrease of 1,300. In 1871 123,609 acres were cultivated, and in 1904 122,121 acres, showing a decrease of about 1,500 acres in thirty -three years. In 187 1 the area held was 2,180,000 acres, and in 1904 2,287,000 acres. So that, although the area held had increased, the number of occupiers had diminished; the area cultivated was less, and the population had decreased by 11,000. That, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> interjects - and he ought to know something of the subject-is one of the most fertile districts in Victoria, and when one says that, it means that it is one of the most fertile districts in Australia. That exodus of population, while not so serious now as it has been in the past, is still going on. Before the Government spends money in Great Britain for the purpose of attracting more persons here, I think that its evident duty is to stop the leakage, to try to find out why persons are leaving Victoria; why for a number of years they have been leaving the various States. When the Government have discovered that reason, and stopped the leak, then will be the time to spend money in trying to induce other persons to come here. I think that it is high time that the Government gave us some indication of its policy in this regard, if it has any policy. We know that it proposes to spend money - £20,000, I believe - for the purpose of advertising Australia. But what does it intend to do with a view to stop the leakage, which I think is undoubted? Let me now take the counties of Bourke and Grant, in which Melbourne and suburbs are situated. I want to direct attention to the fact that, while the rural districts of Victoria have been losing population almost continuously, the urban areas have had their population added to repeatedly, The population of Melbourne and suburbs in 1871 was 196,000, and in 1901 466,000, showing an increase of 270,000 souls in thirty-three years. The rural districts previously alluded to had lost 11,000 persons in thirty-three years, but Melbourne and suburbs had gained 270,000 persons. When we come to the small shires surrounding Melbourne - Preston, Heidelberg, and so on - we find that their population was 16,000 in 1871, and 36,000 in 1901. The other shires in the County of Bourke - that is outside the urban shires - which comprise an area of 884,000 acres, had a population of 24,006 in 187 1, and 20,000 in 1 901, so that even within a very short distance of Melbourne, this depletion of population has been going on. Now take that part of the County of Grant which contains Geelong, Queenscliff, and Ballarat East, and which comprises an area of 11,000 acres. Its population in 1871 was 39,000, and in 1 90 1 44,000. In the shires in the County of Grant - which, with an area of 1,153,000, had a population of 34,000 in 1871, and 26,000 in 1 001 - there was a decrease of 8,000 persons. The number of holdings in the western shires in 1871 was 3,890, of which 3,254 represented 350 acres, and under; while, in 1904, it was 3,676, showing a decrease of 214. Instead of the number of holdings increasing, as one would naturally suppose, in almost every district of Victoria it has continually decreased. </para>

                        <para>- That is a strange explanation. I . should like the honorable senator to look at his own statement for half a moment. He says that the manufacturers in the towns were so busy that they were able to give employment to a large number of persons who were drawn from the country districts. . If the population in the towns increased so rapidly as he says, surely one would expect that more persons would be required in the country districts to grow food for the towns? </para>

                        <para>- It is my policy, anyhow, and I am speaking for myself. If that policy, with such an instalment of land values taxation as would have broken up the land monopoly, had been adopted, we should have had a much greater addition of population not only in the towns, but also in the country. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> is really anxious for the prosperity of Australia - his adopted country, which I am sure he loves - I ask him in all sincerity to revise his political beliefs. If the policy ' in which he believes is persisted in, adversity will continue to dog, the steps of this country. My experience of men has taught me. that if a prejudice once lodges itself in the mind of a man it is not easily dislodged, no matter how formidable an array of facts be presented to him. I am afraid that my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,,</inline> is the victim of such a prejudice. I do not intend to trouble honorable senators with more details of the population of Victoria, as the same thing applies te other States. People continually leave the country districts and pour into the towns&gt; or go to other States. Queensland happens, to be getting a large number of Victorians at present. We are very glad to have them. It is a good thing for Queensland but it is not good for Victoria or for the Commonwealth that Victorians should be driven from their own State to any other part of Australia because they cannot find land on which to settle in the State where they were born, although there are millions of acres in Victoria ready for occupation. </para>

                        <para>- I am well aware of that. Let me summarise the case as to Victoria before dealing with other States. In the six principal counties of this State there was less population in 1901 than in. 1871. Occasionally I read articles in the daily newspapers about the birth rate in France being lower than the death rate,, and as to how France is losing population. It is pointed out that the end of such a state of things is inevitable. Then, again, Ireland is pointed to as the horrible example among the nations, her population being 50 per cent, smaller to-day than it was fifty years ago. These facts are indicated as evidence of national decadence. But those who write in that strain should apply their principles nearer home. We have a much worse example of the evils of bad government and a vicious land system in Victoria; than can be found anywhere else on the globe. I challenge any man to bring before me any example of a country that has suffered more in this direction than Victoria has done. , </para>

                        <para>- The difference between Ireland and Victoria is this: Ire land is an old country. Probably, if her population were about 10,000,000 she would be able to grow enough food for them. The area of Ireland is about the same as that of Tasmania. But her population is about 4,500,000, while that of Tasmania is 178,000. So that, as compared with any portion of Australia, Ireland may be said to be densely populated. Victoria, however, is a young country. We expect the population in young countries to in- 1  crease and multiply continuously. Victoria in respect to soil and climate possesses advantages which should enable her population to grow. If it does not increase there must be something radically wrong. If the people of this country are leaving, if the flower of its youth are going away to other countries to look foi opportunities that are denied them here, undoubtedly there must be something radically wrong either with the condition of the country or with the system of government. No one can say t'Eat the soil df Victoria is bad. It is not. _ Or that the climate is unfavorable. It is not. We must look in some other direction for the evil which is producing such serious results, for the cancer which is eating into the body politic, and which, unless it is cut out, will some day have much more serious results than any we can foresee. Why are these people leaving Victoria? Every one who has turned his attention to the subject knows perfectly well that it is because of the land monopoly - because of the great areas that are held by a few men. </para>

                        <para>- The population both of Sydney and New South Wales has increased since Federation much more rapidly than was the case for a long time before; much more rapidly indeed than the population of any other portion of Australia has increased, although land monopoly is almost as rampant in New South Wales as in Victoria. I turn to the case of Tasmania. I have paid a few visits to that State. I was charmed with the beauty of the tight little island. But when I looked about me I could not help saying to myself, " What a magnificent country Tasmania would be if only it had sensible people to govern it." Tasmania is in almost the same condition as Victoria is. She has been continually losing population. Her young men and her young women go to New Zealand or to Western Australia or elsewhere. Tasmania has resources within her own borders sufficient not only to keep all her own people but to attract tens of thousands more. She has vast farming areas, an abundance of mineral resources, and water-power if properly utilized, sufficient to manufacture enough goods for the whole population of the Commonwealth and many more. Bui in Tasmania the blight of land monopoly is also doing its evil work. </para>

                <para class="block">There is no doubt that an artificial scarcity of land exists in New South Wales. There are hundreds of thousands of applicants for every little bit of good land that i; made available. That is perfectly wel) known, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> knows it very much better than I do. But for this ev of land monopoly, I am sure that New South Wales, instead of having a population of 1,500,000, would have probably double that population. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> I presume, is a property-owner in Sydney, and is directly interested in a large increase in the population of New South Wales. It would render his property very much more valuable. Instead of losing something by the imposition of a land tax he would gain a great deal. The same remark applies to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild.</inline> That honorable senator is the owner of a beautiful property in the suburbs of Sydney, which, with increased population in that State, would become very much more valuable than it is, and so much better known that the postal authorities, instead of sending the honorable senator's correspondence away up country, would have no difficulty in finding his place of residence. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> is, I believe, in the same position. These honorable senators are all keen business men, eager to turn the nimble shilling, and I would advise them to vote for a sprat in the shape of an effective land tax in the hope of catching a mackerel in the shape of largely increased land values. I need not say very much with regard to Queensland. The position there is rather a peculiar one. We have immense areas of land in that State, and we are being continually told that they comprise so many millions of acres that my mind is lost in the effort to contemplate them. It is very true that we have in Queensland a very large area of land which is still the property of the Crown, but it is also true that pressure is continually brought to bear upon the State Government to repurchase estates from private individuals, so that land may be secured on which to settle people. </para>

                        <para>- I know that honorable senators on my right are men with open minds, always ready to be convinced if sufficient facts and arguments can be brought before them. I ask them to direct their attention to New Zealand, where a sincere and serious attempt was made to deal with the question of land monopoly. In 1891, there were 32,479 holdings in New Zealand. In the same year, there were 30,626 holdings in Victoria. I ask honorable senators to pay particular attention to these figures. In 1891, there were 1,853 more holdings in New Zealand than in Victoria. In 1906, fifteen years later, when the policy of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ballance, Sir John</inline> McKenzie, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seddon,</inline> and the leading men of New Zealand, had time to operate and produce results, the number of holdings in New Zealand had increased from 32,479 to 49,000, whilst in Victoria the number had decreased from 30,626 to 27,000. So that in the fifteen years referred to, New Zealand surpassed Victoria in the number of her holdings by 21,874. That was a direct result of the policy which we ask our honorable friends here to adopt. That is what was accomplished in New Zealand, and I say that we could do a great deal more in every one of the Australian States. I do not wish to occupy the time of honorable senators very much longer, but before I sit down I wish to read a quotation from a newspaper published in New South Wales, which has some bearing upon the advertisement of the Commonwealth Government appearing in a newspaper called <inline font-style="italic">The Standard of Empire.</inline></para>

With a little judicious persuasion they may be induced to see eye to eye even with the Labour Party in this connexion. But I particularly desire to draw the attention of my honorable friend from New South Wales to an article in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> of the 6th inst. It is headed " Child Labour," " Four hours sleep per day." " The rabbiting evil." It reads- </para>

                    <para>More than one school inspector in his last annual report drew attention to the effect of the dairying industry upon school attendance, one roundly asserting that the conditions of child labour on farms practically amounted to slavery. Recognising the, serious effect upon education, and the necessity for more definite knowledge of the conditions if redress is to be obtained by legislative action, the Teachers' Association invited its country branches to report generally upon the question of child labour. These reports are now pouring in, and, although the sub-committee appointed has not yet been able to prepare a general statement, some of the reports read at a council meeting on Friday show that the matter of child labour has reached the stage that calls for immediate action. The strictures of the inspectors appear to be justified. Not only is the "dairying industry found, to be responsible for unsatisfactory attendance, regular unpunctuality, and general listlessness through sheer physical weariness, but other industries - particularly "rabbitting" - prove to have even a worse effect upon the physical, mental, and moral development of the country child. The Bathurst branch of the. Teachers' Association has forwarded a report, with a number of letters from teachers of small country schools. These state that children are engaged in dairying, rabbitting, farm work, and orchard work. Children eight and nine years old are compelled to rise at 5 a.m., milk five or six cows, and feed calves and pigs' before school. One teacher says - </para>
                    <para>The most striking case I have had is of a boy about13 years of age, who had to milk from twenty to twenty-six cows, separate the milk, and feed calves and pigs by himself. Then he would come to school, arriving there at11 a.m. generally, but sometimes when the roll was being called at 12.25. He would always ask to leave school early in the afternoon. If he had any trouble with his cows he would not come to school at all, and when he did put in an appearance he was half asleep. He usually got up at 4.30 a.m., and went to bed at 10 p.m. </para>
                    <para>This is typical of the conditions in varying districts. Another teacher reports in connexion with the rabbiting industry - </para>
                    <para>Children, regardless of age, are employed in carrying traps, setting them, and taking rabbits to the works or waiting at the roadside for the collectors. The time occupied goes into many hours out of the twenty-four hours. A start is made immediately after dinner in many cases, so that a sundown visit is made. The traps are visited again at 9 p.m. and at midnight. An early morning visit is then made at daybreak, when the rabbits are got in readiness for taking to market. In many cases when rabbits are plentiful four visits are regularly made to the traps within the twenty-four hours. The roughness of the country where traps are set makes the work very hard and tiring. As many as eight and ten pairs are carried by a boy of twelve to a certain place for taking out the entrails. The children come to school completely worn out. I have seen children fall asleep over their studies and not engage in the play with others, being content to prostrate themselves while recess is on. I have repeatedly questioned them as to the time they got up and went to bed, and four hours' sleep is more than some of them have had. One boy told me that he is too tired to disrobe, so falls on the bed and goes to sleep at 2 a.m. until roused for the morning rounds. </para>

                    <para class="block">This is not by any means an isolated case. Another teacher says the scholars come late and leave early, notes being received to the effect that if the boy is not allowed out early he will not attend at all the next week ; and he adds - "One may as well try to ride a bicycle up a hill with a log tied behind it as teach a school under such circumstances. The work itself is demoralizing in the extreme, and the great rabbit industry should not be established at such cost. In one school of about thirty boys, every boy. above the age of seven is directly engaged in rabbiting, and in some cases girls help their ' brothers. </para>

                    <para>By their association with men who use strange arguments concerning this trade, boys become imbued with the belief that it is the primary interest of the world. Rabbiting becomes his whole existence. His education, his moral training, his ambition, his everything that goes to make a good citizen, finds places after his infernal rabbiting. While I have known respect- able people engaged in catching rabbits, the person who becomes a rabbiter mostly does so from choice - the choice of an irregular, lazy_ living. I have often been prompted to call it a ." larrikin " industry. </para>

                    <para>Children from eight years, both boys and girls, must leave school early to set traps', which are visited twice before midnight. The traps are very heavy, and have to be carried .from place to place. The rabbits have to be cleaned and carried to the roadside. These children are worked very hard, and lose very much sleep, five hours being about the average time for sleep, as they must rise at 5 a.m. or earlier to go around the traps. They come to school tired and unfit for their school, which, in consequence, becomes distasteful to them. These children are self-supporting, earning from 10s. to 20s. a week, or even more; but very small children can easily earn 2s. or 3s. a day. Parents complain about the distance from school, if two miles, but we do not hear anything about the miles the children travel before and after school after cows or rabbits. Almost without exception the teachers recommend a more stringent compulsory Act with increasing fines, the extension of the 2-mile limit; the definition of what constitutes a half-day's attendance, and immediate action to follow default. </para>

                        <para>- I will tell the honorable senator. I have read an advertisement which is published under the authority of the Government, and within which the statement is .made that every child in Australia is afforded an opportunity of receiving an excellent education. That statement is quite true. The Government advances that as a reason why numbers of people in the Old Country should settle in the Commonwealth. I have brought- this matter forward because, while - so far as a large number of children are concerned - it is true that they are afforded an opportunity of receiving a good education, it is equally true that there are some children here who live under conditions such as those to which reference is made in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph.</inline> That journal, on 7th October, in a leading article headed " Child Slavery in New South Wales," says - </para>

                    <para>Never since Hood wrote the <inline font-style="italic">Song of the Shirt</inline> has there been a more pathetic revelation of white slavery than that contained in the recent reports obtained by the Teachers' Association on the over-working of children in some of the country districts of this State. The industries responsible for cruel desecration of child life therein revealed are dairying and rabbiting, in which it is shown that mere infants are often overworked by their parents in a manner calculated to shock the feelings of any normally-constituted man. That children of  8  and g years of age should be compelled to do with four hours' sleep out of twenty-four, and that education, recreation, and play should have to be sacrificed to the earning of money in a country like this, borders on the incredible. Yet evidence is produced showing that a number of children are compelled to do with that amount of rest, while the remaining twenty hours of the day are occupied mostly in hard drudgery that would tax the physical powers of an adult. Under these circumstances' it is inevitable that attendance at school should be little better than a farce. The children are allowed to snatch a few irregular hours per week for nominal attendance, during which they are too tired to pay much serious attention to school work. What could be more pathetic than that story told in our columns yesterday morning of children, who, when the short play-hour comes, throw themselves down to get a bit of a sleep which tired nature insisted upon, to be afterwards woke up and goaded through the vain formality of lessons. The very cows which some of these unfortunate children have to milk and feed have better lives. Legislation has prevented . such oppression of child life in the factory, and the time has come when it should make some effort to do the same on the farm. When this abuse of childhood is permitted the degeneration of the race is inevitable, and any industry that can only be sustained at such a cost the State would be infinitely better without. To those parents who plead that only by working their children in this inhuman fashion can they make their dairy farms or their rabbit traps pay, that should be the prompt and practical answer. To say that dairying demands such a sacrifice is, however, plain moonshine, for the great majority of dairymen treat their children as children ought to be treated and still prosper. Those who cannot do the same are the wrong men in the wrong places, and the sooner they are routed out of them the more creditable it will be to our common humanity, and the better for the future of our race. </para>

                <para>It has been proved times without number that dairying does demand such a sacrifice, that unless, in many cases, the dairyman becomes a slave, and makes slaves of his wife, his children, his man-servant, his  maid-servant, his ox, and his ass, he cannot continue the industry profitably. -Why is that? We come back to the door out of which we went a little while ago. It is because of the evil of land monopoly.

                        <para>- In any case, it ought to be altered. The chief cause' of this child-sweating, more especially in the dairying industry, is land monopoly, and the high price of land which has been caused by the artificial scarcity brought about by monopoly. Of course, my honorable friends on the right shake their heads to indicate that, in their opinion-,, the,, land monopolist is a public benefactor, and one of the elements of progress in the Commonwealth. I hold exactly the opposite opinion. I look upon the land monopolist as a public enemy, and I think that every man who is an enemy to the welfare of the State ought to be put down in some way or other. If the Government wish to attract persons from other countries they should first make Australia worthy to receive them by breaking down the land monopoly, opening up avenues of employment, and thus creating opportunities for immigrants to make a good living. If they do that, then, instead of being compelled to advertise and to spend large sums to induce persons to come here, we shall have them coming from all the ends of the earth in tens of thousands to assist us in building up a great Commonwealth in the southern seas. </para>

                    <para>.- I should not have risen but for the fact that a matter of great moment to the citizens of the Commonwealth was noted by me at a recent function. I refer to the action that has been, and is being, taken by 'the Government in extensively advertising the potentialities of the Commonwealth, and putting forward what I regard as an untrue statement of the affairs existing in the various States. What the Government is paying for the advertisements which are appearing in <inline font-style="italic">The Standard, of Empire</inline> is the subject-matter of a question of which I have given notice for tomorrow. But that it will amount to a considerable sum goes without saying. This is a newspaper which, I am informed, is rigidly conservative so far as its policy is concerned, and circulates in an atmosphere which the working class, as a rule, do not inhale. It seems to me a rather strange act for the Government to advertise in a rigid conservative newspaper which does not reach the masses and is not read by those who are invited in its advertisements to come to these States. </para>

If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> Muirhead Collins has that free hand the Senate has a right to know. If he has not that power I want to know who is providing him with the pabulum contained in the advertisements. I shall also want to know on the morrow how much per inch per issue is being paid for this class of advertising, and the main reason why, above all other newspapers, <inline font-style="italic">The Standard of Empire</inline> was selected in order to bring the resources of the Commonwealth under the notice of the people of Great Britain. </para>

                        <para>- Yesterday afternoon, within a few yards of this building, there assembled  a  large number of men who sought an interview with the leader of the Labour Party in order to move, if possible, the Commonwealth Government to give them the wherewithal to leave Victoria, because they said that work would be made available to them if they could get to New Zealand, and yet to this paragraph <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> says " Hear, hear." That is not  an  isolated case of workless men. I venture to say that in almost every large city in Victoria - Bendigo, Ballarat, Castlemaine, Mary- borough, particularly those mining centres where there is a very great depression, not to speak of other centres in the State - thousands of men are out of employment and are anxious to get work. </para>

In my opinion one of the most important questions which this Parliament has to consider is how to provide work for the workless and land for the landless, and when the Commonwealth inserts in a newspaper advertisements that are, I assert, incorrect and untruthful,  a  voice should be raised in order to point out in what direction wrong is being done to those who are in search of land here to-day, and are unable to get it, and to those who are out of employment, and are unable to get permanent work.

                        <para>- At almost every. Land Board meeting, and at almost every auction sale, in connexion with the cutting up of big estates in Victoria as well as in New South Wales, there are innumerable applicants for the available blocks. Not long ago in Victoria small areas were thrown open for selection. Those who took an interest in the question of land settlement are aware that the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> called attention to the fact that men walked as much as 25 miles, " biked " 50 miles, and " trained " nearly 200 miles to be present on the day when the land was to be made available by ballot. Not one in twenty was successful. What occurred at that time is occurring constantly in the Commonwealth. </para>

If there are lands available, why should the Government of Victoria be purchasing private) estates at high prices for settlement purposes? The result of this system is that some of those who have settled upon the repurchased estates under the Government policy have paid such prices for their holdings that a considerable period must elapse before they can secure any return for their labour. </para>

                        <para>-  I rise to order. I submit that the hour has arrived for private business to be taken. I am quite well aware that a motion was adopted this afternoon for the suspension of the Standing Orders. But I take it that it is not possible for something to be read into a resolution which is not expressed in it; and that if the honorable and learned senator who moved for the suspension of the Standing Orders this afternoon had intended to interfere with the orders of the Senate with reference to private business he would have expressed his intention in the motion that he proposed. But he did not express it. He succeeded in carrying a resolution for the suspension of the Standing Orders, and there is nothing in the Standing Orders that affects the present position. The order under which private business is dealt with at 7.45 o'clock is not to be found in the Standing Orders. Therefore the honorable and learned senator has not by his motion interfered with the direction of the Senate that fixes private business for a quarter to 8 o'clock on Thursdays. According to the practice of the House of Commons, a practice followed in the Parliament of which you and I sir were members for so many years, the orders fixing the course of business were treated always as sessional orders, were printed as such, and were embodied session by session with the Standing Orders. There were sessional orders and standing orders. I admit that the resolutions carried at the commencement of the session with regard to the order of business, the hours of meeting, and so on, are not, in the practice of the Senate, called sessional orders. But they are distinctly orders of the Senate, passed in precisely the same manner, and with exactly the same effect as our Standing Orders. They are voted upon, and become the orders of the Senate. My honorable friend, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, did not ask for the suspension of the orders that fix our business. He merely asked for the suspension of the Standing Orders affecting the rules of business, not the order of business. I wish to make that quite clear. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> moved for the suspension of the rules under which our business is conducted, but not of the orders that fix the order of our procedure in respect of a certain class of business - private business to wit. I am not quite sure that there is a phrase of our Standing Orders that refers to private business <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> the sense in which we are discussing it. The orders of the Senate are twofold'. There are standing orders that govern the machinery of the Chamber, and there are sessional orders passed at the commencement of each session, fixing the business to be transacted on certain days and at certain hours. 1 submit that the Minister in moving the motion, had he desired to get rid of private business to-night, should have taken a different course. But I make bold to say that he never expected to interfere with that business. I am sure that he will not contradict 'me when I say that he contemplated getting the Supply Bill out of the way before dinner time. </para>

                <para class="block">The words which the honorable and learned senator should have put in if he wanted to mop up the time allotted to private business, are, after Standing Orders, "and sessional orders." Then he would have covered the contingency. But he did not cover it; and I urge, with great respect, that it is the duty of the Chair not to read into a resolution what is not there. I am quite sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> will ask you to do something that he omitted to- provide for in the resolution. But I say that it is too late. It may be a matter of convenience that I should be ruled against. But there is a larger question involved than that of convenience. You sir, as a lawyer, know that it would often be very convenient for Judges to forget some of their rules of Court, and to get round corners in a slip-shod manner. But I object to the introduction of slip-shod methods into the procedure of this Senate. If my honorable friend had desired to get rid of private business, as laid down in the rules of this Chamber, passed at the commencement of the session, he should have so expressed it in his motion. He has not done so. He succeeded in carrying a motion enabling him during Government time to rush his Bill through. That I freely admit. But I deny that any motion was carried authorizing the Government to take from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> the opportunity of discussing a question of large import which stands on the notice-paper in his name. </para>

It has been acquiesced in by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> and it does not become the honorable senator at this juncture to interrupt very important and urgent public business by a technical point of order such as that which he has raised.' -It is quite clear that when we suspended the Standing Orders, as we did by a large majority, we intended that there should be a clear run given for the completion of the Supply Bill introduced contingent upon their, suspension. It was intended that nothing should interrupt its passage. On the principle that the greater includes the less, the Standing Orders having been suspended, minor orders are necessarily suspended. My contention is that having already established our practice we are now bound by it, and I am satisfied that it is. a practice which will be readily acquiesced in. </para>

                        <para>- As I have not had time to look up the matter I am unable to say whether that is so or not. Even if it were not so there might have been no private business on the paper. I take it that when we suspend the Standing Orders we must consider the purpose for which we have decided to suspend them. Undoubtedly in this case the suspension of the Standing Orders was moved in order that the Supply Bill might be proceeded with uninterruptedly, if Ministers were prepared to take it through its different stages. I am confronted with the question of how far Sessional Orders control the action of the Senate when the Standing Orders have been suspended for the express purpose of enabling particular business to be proceeded with uninterruptedly. I am not prepared to accept the position that when we have suspended the Standing Orders for the express purpose of proceeding with a Bill through its various stages without interruption, any sessional order, which I regard as a purely subordinate order, should be allowed to interfere with the manifest intention and desire of the Senate when it determined on the suspension of the Standing Orders. I should like further to remind honorable senators that no new departure is now proposed, and it may fairly be assumed that the Senate, having acted in this way on a previous occasion, laid down a line of action which was considered most convenient for the transaction of public business. Let me add a word or two in regard to <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> and the Standing Orders of the House of Commons. It is perfectly true that a number of honorable senators, including, several members of the Standing Orders Committee, were anxious that we should have resort to the practice of the House of Commons where we had laid down no practice for ourselves. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> was one of those who took up that position. </para>

                        <para>- I took that view myself ; but the majority decided otherwise, and reasons were given why it was undesirable that we should tie ourselves down to any particular practice and why we should .Ourselves lay down laws to guide us in the conduct of our business in future. It was pointed out that this would give the  President  and honorable senators the fullest opportunity to take advantage of any convenient practice which might prevail in the House of Commons, in the United States Congress, in the Parliament of the Dominion of Canada, or' in any other Legislature. The Standing Orders of the House of Commons were expressly excluded in order that we might lay down our own course of procedure. I think that in this matter a course of procedure has been laid down for which abundant and substantial reasons have been given. I have therefore no alternative but to rule that the point of order has not been sustained, and that the consideration of the Supply Bill may be proceeded with. </para>

                        <para>- I was pointing out, prior to the adjournment for dinner, that in consequence of the loss of population by Victoria that State had to content itself with one member less in the House of Representatives after the last elections. I was endeavouring to show that that loss of representation in this Parliament was largely due to the system of land monopoly which obtains in Victoria. </para>

                <para>In Victoria that sort of thing has been in progress for a considerable period. It is quite three decades since <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Graham</inline> Berry introduced into the Victorian Parliament a Bill, the object of which was to burst up large estates. But instead of the measure accomplishing that object, the estates have consistently become larger, with the result that from year to year the rural population has diminished. Official documents show that in 1891, when a census was taken in this State, there were 69,021 persons of Victorian birth resident in New Zealand and other States, whilst at the last census, which was taken in 1901, there were 136,638 Victorians resident in those countries. </para>

                        <para>- The fiscal policy has nothing whatever to do with this matter. To-day every State of the Union enjoys the same measure of protection. If a protective policy is a bad thing - as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> would have us believe - it is remarkable that since that policy has been uniformly adopted throughout Australia, the population of New South Wales has rapidly increased, while that of Victoria has remained almost stationary. I repeat that innumerable difficulties confront those who desire to become permanent settlers in this State. Y"et to-day the Commonwealth Government are telling the people of the Old Country that if they want work, and are possessed of energy and perseverance, they need only come to Australia. They are being assured  that work will be provided for them here as well as opportunities to obtain homes of 'their own. </para>

                        <para>- No. But I say that large areas should not be utilized for grazing purposes when they might be successfully cultivated, thus ' maintaining a large army in the ordinary comforts of life. That there is a dearth of land available for settlement in New South Wales is abundantly evidenced by the applications  received  at every Land Board meeting. In that State tenants are securing land which was formerly used for grazing purposes, upon the share system, the worst form of sweating of which I can conceive. </para>

                        <para>- One case was recently brought under my notice, in which the owner of certain land in Victoria, who had been using it for grazing purposes, thereby deriving an income from it of not more than <inline font-style="italic">£50</inline> per annum, leased it upon the share system to an energetic man, who set to work and cultivated it. The crop raised by the tenant realized .£750, and of that amount he was compelled to hand over one-third to the land-owner. This swearing is mainly responsible for the employment of child labour in connexion with the dairying industry. This afternoon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> quoted extensively from the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> with a view of showing that a number of country school teachers in New South Wales have found it almost impossible to impart any education to their pupils, because of the excessive drudgery to which they are subjected by their parents who are engaged in that industry. That is not typical of New South Wales only. It exists in Victoria, too. </para>

                    <para>The hours the children have to work are very long, and the work, for them, is very heavy and monotonous. A lot of milk is produced in the Western District with the assistance of child labour. Some of these children have to take their places in the milking sheds when very young. Very little recreation for them. Up in the morning at daylight to get the cows in, and assist to milk. Then to school. After school hours the cows have to be brought home and milked again, it frequently being dark before the milking is completed. Supper follows; then a rush through with the home lessons, and to bed. Such is the routine, year in and year out, of the children of the tenant farmers who provide free labour partly for the support of their struggling parents, but mainly to nd c to the wealth of the already wealthy landlords." </para>

                <para>The Government gives liberal financial assistance towards the improving of properties. Farmers may be granted £1,500 worth of land, agricultural labourers £200 worth, and workmen £100 worth, the payment being on very easy terms. The Government assists <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> for <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> UP to <inline font-style="italic">£5^</inline> towards fencing and building. Advances are made on easy terms up to <inline font-style="italic">£2^0,</inline> repayable in twenty years, for the purpose of "building and effecting improvements on the land.

                <para>I am inclined to think that if any of the persons who read that advertisement in this conservative organ come to Australia in the full anticipation of getting work  and being  assisted in getting upon the land in the direction indicated by the Government of Victoria, they will be very sadly disappointed. I think that it is the duty of a Federal representative to point out that the statements contained in these advertisements are incorrect and misleading. If the Victorian Government desire to, increase the population of Victoria they only need to offer to the native-born some of the facilities which are promised to persons abroad, and the former would very gladly make their way to any part of the State where such opportunities were offered. During the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> one or two honorable senators opposite said that the policy of the Labour Party is to prevent the population of Australia being increased by the introduction of desirable immigrants. </para>

                        <para>- I am not here to be cross-examined as to what are desirable immigrants. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker's</inline> views and mine are in contradistinction, I am sure he would be the first to say that undesirable immigrants should not come to Australia under present conditions, so far as the land policies of the States are concerned. I urge that the advertisement inserted by the Commonwealth in <inline font-style="italic">The Standard of Empire</inline> should be withdrawn. If it is not withdrawn, it ought to be remodelled, and the plain, unvarnished truth should be told to the people of Great Britain as to the conditions of industrial life in Australia, and the possibilities of land settlement. I have entered my protest, in the hope that attention having been called to the matter, this misleading advertisement will not be continued, and I trust that the Government will take the first opportunity of pointing out the true facts to the people of Great Britain. </para>

                    <para>. - I have listened with a considerable amount of interest to the debate on the first reading of this Bill, and especially to the observations which fell from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> with regard to the question of coinage in Australia, and the manufacture of cartridge blanks in connexion with any works which may be started for coinage purposes. I am sure that the honorable senator would not expect a Minister, after listening to what has been said on the subject, to speak with anything like free-  dom; but I may say, for myself, that much of what the honorable senator said was new to me, and certainly opened up a field for investigation and consideration that must necessarily be entered upon before any course of a committal character can be followed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has referred to the subject of wireless telegraphy. There has been a rote on the Estimates for last year and the previous year of £10,000 in connexion with this subject. The honorable senator seems to be somewhat impatient, because the Government have not taken steps to establish wireless telegraphy installations in different parts of the Commonwealth. I have to assure him that the Postmaster-General's Department has not been regardless of its responsibilities and duties in this matter. </para>

                    Wireless telegraphy is a matter as to which remarkable developments are taking place. The Government has been .approached from time to time by different bodies from different parts of the world, offering to establish some particular form of wireless telegraphy as being the best that  could be adopted. There is a considerable amount of competition among rival concerns, each of which offers to the Government its own system as the best. There is sufficient evidence at the disposal of the Government for them to know that they might easily adopt a system of wireless telegraphy which at the present time might be unsurpassed, but which in six or twelve months would be practically out of date. 4

                        <para>- I certainly do not say that; but it is desirable that the Government should be most careful before committing itself to any particular course. We all know from the history of the States that telegraphic and cablegraphic developments were entered upon by them in the past, which they regretted for years afterwards. Though there is no express pro-' vision on the Estimates for the current year, as there was in previous years, nevertheless my colleague, the Treasurer, informed another place last evening that it is his intention during the present year, more especially if the revenue receipts warrant it, to grant from time to time out of his advance such sums as may be required by the Postmaster-General for this or kindred purposes. Of course, such sums when advanced will subsequently appear as items in a Bill which will be submitted to Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I am not in a position to inform honorable senators of the exact position with regard to those tenders, but if the honorable senator will  give notice of a question I shall be only too happy to consult the Postmaster-General, who I am sure will furnish him with all the information that he desires. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger has referred to a subject that I can understand is an active case of annoyance and inconvenience to the people of Queensland. He has pointed out that the mail steamer <inline font-style="italic">Bingera,</inline> which connects Gladstone, the northern termination of the southern railway system of that State, with Townsville, and the northern, ports, has frequently been running late. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger mentioned the matter to me yesterday, and I had already brought it under the notice of the Postmaster-General. Inquiries are being made into the subject. As the honorable senator has mentioned the subject again, and has stated that the steamer has been late twenty-six times in two years, necessitating the employment of special trains and putting business people who depend upon this means of communication to considerable inconvenience, I have not the slightest doubt that" steps will be taken to give notice to the contractors that the conditions of their contract, so far as speed and time are concerned, will have to be rigidly observed in future. I shall take another opportunity of dealing with one or two matters that were referred to; but as to what Senators Findley and Stewart have said regarding the advertisement of the Commonwealth in <inline font-style="italic">The Standard of Empire, I</inline> wish to point out that my honorable friends are, I think, under a misconception. The Commonwealth Government has for some time past been advertising the resources and productiveness of this country with a view of attracting suitable immigrants from Great .Britain. We have adopted several methods of advertising - by the circulation of year-books, and the publication of special pamphlets, like a little publication known as the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth of Australia - its Resources and Production:</inline> We have also advertised in the . newspapers. <inline font-style="italic">The Standard of Emfire</inline> has been singled out for attack and opprobrium on account of its political proclivities. The Government, in selecting <inline font-style="italic">The Standard of Empire</inline> as the medium of advertisement, had no regard to the political principles that it advocates. That journal was selected because it marks a new departure in British journalism. It is a newspaper having for its particular mission the publication of news from the outlying portions of the British Empire to a greater extent than is the case with any journal that has hitherto been published in Great Britain. </para>

                        <para>- It is not a, question of subsidy in this case. It is true that <inline font-style="italic">The Standard of Empire</inline> does not publish our advertisements for nothing. But there is no other newspaper in the United Kingdom which for such a small, outlay will give us such a return in the way of advertisement. The whole sum per annum that we are paying for the advertisement we get in <inline font-style="italic">The Standard of Empire</inline> is, I am informed, less than was paid for one single advertisement in a single issue by a State Government in an English daily newspaper. I am not in a position to mention the amount at the present moment, but notice of a question has been given on the subject, and when that question is answered to-morrow I have no doubt that all the information that the Vice-President of the Executive Council can give will be furnished. </para>

                <para class="block">I may inform honorable senators, as my honorable colleague, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, has already intimated, that what is asked for here is based upon the Estimates for last year. We are asking for two months' Supply, and the total amount required is £727,749. Of this amount, £717,749 is required for the ordinary votes of the year, and £10,000 for what are known as refunds of revenue. This is an item which appears in every Estimates, and, as honorable senators may remember, it is intended to provide a sum from which the Treasurer may repay to certain administrations or Departments moneys which are properly due to them, but which have been collected by others. I may give as an instance the administration of the Pacific Cable Board and the administration of the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company. When a message is sent, the cost of the whole message is paid into a Commonwealth post-office, and a certain amount has afterwards to be paid to the cable company, because we have collected their portion of the cost as well as our own. Honorable senators are .aware that the same thing arises in connexion with adjustments between money -order offices and the post-offices. In many instances, postal notes are issued which do not exactly meet the requirements of the persons .to whom they are issued, and the required amount is made up by the purchase of a few stamps. The revenue derived from the sale of the stamps belongs to the Post and Telegraph Department, and one Department is entitled to the money, though another gets credit for it. This is a Supply Bill for two months. The last was dealt with by the Senate in June, and covered three months of the present financial year. In that Supply Bill, there was included a large amount of £200,000 for the Treasurer's Advance Account. The ordinary votes were for £1,172,635, -and that, with the Treasurer's Advance and refunds of revenue, made a total passed in the three months' Supply Bill, under which we have been working until now, of £1,412,625. The total amount asked for in this Bill is, as I have said, £727,749. In stating that this Bill is based upon last year's Estimates, I wish honorable senators to understand that it contains no provision which will in any way commit Parliament to any increase in the salaries of officers other than the ordinary annual statutory increments on salaries of less than -£i6o a year. </para>

The only increases of salary anticipated by this Bill are the ordinary annual statutory increments due to officers in receipt of not more than £160 a year. There are two or three verbal alterations in the Bill to which I invite the attention of honorable senators. These are consequent upon the fact that we have altered the title given to some of the items.

                <para class="block">Honorable senators will remember that in the Estimates for the last year or two there appeared a vote of £500 or a little more for the " Australian Men of Letters Fund." In pursuance of a recommendation of the Committee appointed to advise upon applications made for payments out of that fund, it has been decided to adopt the title " Commonwealth Literary Fund." A similar alteration will be found on page 7 of the Bill. Honorable senators will find under Department of Home Affairs, the following - </para>

                <para class="block">In that case we actually provided more in the last Supply Bill than we required, and we are now asking Parliament to give us £200 instead of £350. Another change will be noticed at page 10 of the Bill. Under the heading " New South Wales Naval Forces " there is the following - </para>

                <para class="block">It will be seen that we previously separated the two branches of Permanent Force and Naval Militia, and it is now proposed to combine the items under the heading " Permanent Staff and Militia." And we ask for a vote of £2,290 instead of the vote of . £1,310 asked for in the last Supply Bill. I do not think that there is anything else in the Bill which calls for special attention, or which honorable senators would expect me to bring under their notice. </para>

                    <para>- It is included, in the votes for the External Affairs Department in precisely the same division and subdivision in this Bill as on the Estimates in Chief. If the honorable senator will refer to page 17 of the Estimates in Chief he will find under the heading " Miscellaneous," External Affairs Department, the item " Advertising resources of the Commonwealth, £20,000." The honorable senator is probably aware that in a Supply Bill it is impossible on each occasion to set out in absolute detail ever)' one of the items as they appear in the Estimates. When a Supply Bill is under consideration honorable senators would always do well to have by them a copy of the Estimates, as they would then be in a' position to relate any particular item in the Supply Bill to its particular division in the Estimates, and to see there, in more extensive detail, what is covered by a particular vote. </para>

                    <para>. - I have noticed in the schedule for the Postmaster-General's Department that the amount paid in salaries in South Australia is very much less than the amount paid in Western Australia, where there is a smaller population. I find that the salaries set down for South Australia in this Department amount to £23,011, and in Western Australia to £28,200. I have been led to refer to the matter because of a paragraph which I noticed in one of the Adelaide newspapers last week, and which it occurred to me might explain the reason why these salaries are so much lower in South Australia. I quote the following from the <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide Advertiser</inline> of 9th October - </para>

                    <para>STOCKWELL TELEGRAPH OFFICE</para>
                    <para>STOCKWELL, October 6.- Complaints are rife at the delay and inconvenience to business people caused by the substitution of the telephone for the telegraph service. If the telephone were on the trunk line matters would be all right, but as it is all messages have to be telephoned to Nuriootpa whence they are telegraphed to their destination, and <inline font-style="italic">vice versa.</inline> In only two or three cases is this plan not observed. The local people are allowed to speak by telephone to Angaston, Nuriootpa, and Tanunda. No notice to that effect is exhibited, but one learns from experience. Such is the efficiency of the service that a message sent to. Kapunda,11 miles distant, by road, or 17 miles by wire, if sent between 2 and 3 p.m., gets there at 10 a.m. next day, or a message from Tanunda sent  between  i and 2 p.m. gets here the next day at 10 a.m., and the distance by road is 8 miles. Two years ago this was a telegraph office, employing a regular Commonwealth officer at over £100, and the revenue paid the officer's salary. In addition to that the Savings Bank agency is stronger than those at most of the surrounding townships. The postmistress is also registrar of births, deaths, and marriages, Commonwealth electoral officer, stamp agent, money order officer, has parcels post, &amp;c, and has to deliver telephone and" telegraph messages in the town. For this the magnificent salary of ^40 is paid. It is that new kind of office, instituted in recent years, and termed a contract office. Altogether it is a state of things that the people away from the conveniences of cities have a right to complain about. </para>

                <para class="block">I wish the Minister, if possible, to find out whether this practice of sweating and inducing people to do all this work for the beggarly pittance of £40 a year is a common thing in South Australia, and whether it is because of that practice the salaries voted for the Department in South Australia are so much less than those voted for Western Australia. About twelve months ago, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chapman</inline> was Postmaster-General, he said that he was working with the object of making the salaries paid to those in charge of contract post-offices uniform, and at least equal to the Commonwealth minimum salary of £110 per annum. Perhaps the Minister will be able to learn from his colleague the Postmaster-General whether the kind of thing referred to in -the paragraph I have quoted prevails to any great extent in South Australia or other States, and if it does whether it is not considered necessary that some attempt should be made to put a stop to it. </para>

I wish to direct the honorable senator's attention to the fact that from the Estimates for the Department of External Affairs it appears that the Secretary of that Department is to have his salary increased1 by £100 a year. What I wish to know is this : If we pass the vote of £708 set down in this Bill for salaries, for the administrative division of the Department of External Affairs, shall we commit ourselves to the increase of salary of the Secretary of the Department ? </para>

South Australia is £148,504, whereas the amount payable in Western Australia is only £97,552. In other words, £50,000 more per annum is being expended in salaries in South Australia than is being spent in Western Australia </para>

                        <para>- I am sure that honorable senators will permit me to say a few words By way of personal explanation. In reply to the charge that I am a strong supporter of land monopoly, I merely wish to say that years ngo I drew and introduced into the New South Wales Parliament a Bill to enable leaseholders, whose leases had twenty years and upwards to run, to acquire the fee-simple of their holdings. That is a. sufficient refutation of the charge which has been levelled against me. There are one or two items on page 4 of the Estimates to which I desire to direct attention. For instance, there is the vote in connexion with the Commonwealth Men of Letters Fund. Last' year we voted ,£500 under this heading, but so far none of that money has been expended. Yet, as a matter of urgency, we are now asked to authorize the expenditure of a further amount under that heading. I also desire to enter my protest against the cruelty which is practised by the Post and Telegraph Department, in advertising publicly for applicants to fill positions which' they have not the remotest chance of securing. My remarks in this connexion have special reference to contract or non-official post-offices. The practice is for the Department to invite applicants from worthy citizens who are kept upon tenter-hooks until the authorities are able to discover some overgrown telegraph boy who is coaxed to accept the position. These citizens are then told that the application of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. So-and-So,</inline> ex-telegraph messenger, has been accepted. In one case which I have in mind applications were to be lodged by the 1st July last. Several persons applied for the position, amongst them a worthy individual who had over and over again been promised such an appointment bv successive Postmasters-General. , <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Austin</inline> Chapman had promised him such an appointment in writing, and so had <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ewing</inline> when the last-named filled the position of Acting Postmaster-General. The last I heard of this matter was- that the appointment of a non-official postmaster at Ulladulla, on the south coast of New South Wales, had been deferred for the present. Apparently that place will have to do without a postmaster until the Department can make up its mind - if it is burdened with such an encumbrance - as to who is to receive an appointment which is worth about <inline font-style="italic">£7%</inline> per annum. This system of inducing citizens to apply for positions which they have no chance of securing has been continued for years. The gentleman to whom I have alluded is well known in Sydney. He has been systematically humbugged by the Department. He holds credentials from the general manager of the Australian Mutual Provident Society, for which institution he has done a good deal of accountancy work. I am astonished at the temerity of the Department in asking for money at the hands of Parliament. Apparently it has become perfectly case-hardened in its incapacity. There are other matters to which I intended to refer, but at this hour I will refrain from doing so. </para>

                    <para>. - Some time ago, I put to the  President  a question with regard to the position of Usher of the Black Rod. I did not then get the information that I wanted ; but the  President  gave me the distinctly comforting assurance that when certain appointments were made public, I would no doubt be perfectly satisfied with them, which was very good so far as it went. But, on looking at the Estimates for the current year, I find that no change has been made. The late Usher of the Black 'Rod has been appointed Assistant  Clerk,  and another gentleman has been placed in the former position. The old system is to be continued. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. In any case, I am not particularly troubling about an increase in the salaries, if such has taken place. What I did want then, and what I want now is, to abolish what I believe to be a- useless office. I think that in a case of this kind, the Government ought to be responsible, seeing that the country has to pay the piper. What are the duties of this officer? I see him occasionally attired in a very handsome uniform. When the Governor-General -happens along, this officer performs the duty of usher, that is to say, he heralds the approach of  'His Excellency.  He sits in the chamber while discussions are proceeding ; but I do not see that he is required here. I do not observe that he ever takes any particular part in the business of the chamber. Another reason, I believe, for the existence of such an official is, that in the case of any senators becoming unruly, or offending against the Standing Orders, or being suspended or expelled, the Usher of the Black Rod does duty as a policeman by taking the offending senator, so to speak, into custody, and escorting him outside the chamber. Really, the idea of any one occupying a position of that kind in this chamber is absolutely ludicrous. You might as well place a policeman in charge of a flock of sheep in case they might become disorderly, as have any one taking care of an assembly of decent, respectable, quiet, peace preserving gentlemen such as we have here. I think that the Government might very well have adopted the suggestion I offered a little time ago, that was, to appoint the previous Usher of the Black </para>

When I was there, there were some unruly gentlemen about, and there might possibly have been need to resort to the services of the Serjeant-at-Arms. </para>

But as I said, he also acted as Assistant Clerk, and there were seventy-two members in the chamber, that is exactly double the number that we have here.

                        <para>-Colonel GOULD (New South Wales)  [9.31].  - To my mind, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has given a number of reasons why the position of Usher of the Black Rod should be retained. The honorable senator asked what were the duties of the officer, and then proceeded to' tell us some of those duties. He remarked that the Usher is not required for the purpose of conducting honorable senators outside the chamber, as they are like a flock of sheep. But I would remind him that even a flock of sheep require a shepherd to look after them, or sheep dogs to take care of them. I should be very sorry indeed to liken honorable senators to a flock of sheep. The Usher of the Black Rod has to perform certain duties, which I admit are principally of a ceremonial character. He also used invariably to see that when we had divisions none of the sheep strayed through the gates. But be that as it' may. If honorable senators will 'look at the Estimates, they will notice that this gentleman is designated as  Clerk  of Select Committees, which conveys a distinct idea of certain duties, Usher of the Black Rod, with duties which, as I have said, are principally of a ceremonial character, Secretary to the Joint House Committee, and Controller of the Refreshment Rooms, In addition to performing those specific duties, his services when he has any time to spare are utilized by the  Clerk  in the clerical work of the Department. I was very anxious to see if a rearrangement might be made by means of which we could dispense with one of. our officers; but,  on  making inquiries, I found that it was quite impossible to reduce the staff of the Senate. The gentleman who has been appointed to this composite position has a large number of duties to perform, and, whether he performs the duties of Usher or not, his services will still be required. Probably honorable senators have noticed that recently he has not been spending the whole of his time in the chamber as he did previously. He has his work to do during the day. lt is true that he remains at night time, but he also' has work to look after then in connexion with his office. I can assure honorable senators that any change in the designation will mate no change so far as the necessity of retaining the number of our present officers is concerned. If the  Clerk  Assistant were also charged with the duties of Usher of the Black Rod, it would still be necessary for the other gentleman to remain in the position which he occupies, drawing the salary which is allotted thereto. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is always of an economical turn of mind, I would point out to him that, instead of these two gentlemen taking the positions at the salaries of their predecessors, they received on their promotion an increase in salary, and can only reach the maximum provided on the Estimates by increments on the recommendation of the  President.  Hitherto we have been in the habit of voting a salary of -£50 to the secretary of the Joint House Committee, but that is no longer submitted, because the one salary covers all the duties. </para>

                        <para>. - The  President  has twitted me with having stated some of the duties of the Usher of the Black Rod. I notice that in the Estimates he is designated as  Clerk  of Select Committees. . Probably that is regarded by the  President  as Jas chief employment. If that is so, I should like to know how many Select Committees were appointed last year,, and how much work was done by that officer during that period. I find that £100 was voted last year towards the expenses of Select Committees, but not one farthing of it was spent. I conclude from that fact that no Select Committees were appointed. That disposes, at least to a certain extent, of one position. The  President  admitted that the duties of this officer in connexion with the Black Rod are mainly ceremonial'. Of course, we all knew that, and, being a democratic people, I think that our desire is to do away as much as possible with useless ceremony - above everything with ceremony which involves, an expenditure of money. I do not believe in that kind of ceremony, so I adhere to my original idea, that the payment of this sum of .£475 is, to put it mildly, a piece of extravagance. Then the  President  said that an allowance of .£50 a year was made formerly to the secretary of the Joint House Committee. That places a distinct value on that position. The position of secretary of the Joint House Committee is valued at <inline font-style="italic">£50</inline> per annum. At what amount does the  President  value the position of  Clerk  of Select Committees - an office in connexion with which, I believe, no work at all was done last year? Perhaps we may also be informed as to how much the work done by the Usher of the Black Rod is worth. There are only two or three occasions during the year in which he appears in full costume and takes part in certain ceremonials. It would be most interesting to have some idea of the monetary value placed upon the work done in these various capacities. </para>

                        <para>- If they are not duties performed as  Clerk  of Select Committees, Usher of the Black Rod, and Secretary of the Joint House Committee, what are they ? The  President  has also told us that the officer assists in doing certain clerical work.  No doubt that is so; but for the character of the work done - some of which is absolutely useless - the payment is too high. The position of Usher of the Black Rod is one for which we have no earthly use whatever. It is a superfluity, a sinecure pure and simple, and ought to be abolished. </para>

                        <para>-  I think that this is a very unfortunate time to raise such a point in view of the very long session we passed through a very short time ago and the heavy duties performed. </para>

                        <para>- What heavy duties? They were just about as heavy as the duties performed by the honorable senator himself last session, when he was not here at all. I shall be glad to hear some explanation with regard to the matters which I have mentioned. </para>

                    <para>. - The  President  has pointed out the duties performed by the officer to whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has been referring. 1 think that my honorable friend will remember that apart from the duties that devolve upon him as Usher of the Black Rod,  Clerk  of the Joint House Committee, and  Clerk  of Select Committees, he has a great deal of work to do in the management of the affairs of Parliament. We have obligations to the State Government of Victoria, who are the owners of this building - obligations in connexion with its proper maintenance, and the maintenance of the grounds surrounding it. In order that that work shall be effectively and properly done, it is necessary for records to be kept and accounts paid. The whole of these accounts are dealt with by the officer in question. It is work that does not appear on the surface, and is not associated with the officer's title; but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> can, I feel sure, satisfy himself any day by seeing the officer at work in one or two of the many capacities in which he is called upon to act, as to what his duties are. I hope that the honorable senator, having expressed himself' as he has done, will be satisfied. </para>
