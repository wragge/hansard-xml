                        <para>- The present message from the other House deals with, I think, practically one-half of the Tariff. I do not think that it is desirable to ask the Senate to meet for the purpose of dealing with the few items which the other House has dealt with in the meantime. In other words, it would mean asking the Senate to meet in order to do two or three hours&#39; work at the most. I suggest that we should await the completion of the consideration of our requests by the other Chamber. </para>

The vessel then left Wallaroo, and proceeded to Adelaide. The ship&#39;s agents there were asked for an undertaking to pay the hospital expenses, but declined to give it. The master of the ship was then asked for a bond. He communicated with the Russian Consul-General, who agreed to be responsible for the hospital expenses.

                    <para>. - Before referring specifically to the item tea, I wish to refer to a question which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> put to me yesterday&#39;, as to whether I could . furnish information as to how the revenue was affected by the alteration in the Tariff requested by the Senate. I can now supply some figures upon that subject. There were sixty-six requests for increases of duty that were accepted right out. As regard sixteen requests for increases of duty, they represent duty to the amount of &#163;45,000 per annum. I also mentioned that twenty-three requests related to decreases. The number should have been twenty-four. The effect of those decreases is estimated to result in a loss of revenue of &#163;155,000 per annum. Of course, these figures relate only to the requests of the Senate dealt with in the present message. In regard to the item, tea, it will be remembered that as the Tariff came up from the House of Representatives the form of paragraph  a  was as follows -  &#34; In packets not exceeding 20 lbs. in weight, 1d.&#34; </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">The Senate made a request in regard to the weight of the packages, that the 20 lbs. limit should be reduced to 5 lbs. Another place has seen fit to make the amendment so requested. I intend to move that the request be not pressed. The object which we had in view in fixing the packages that were to pay duty at 20 lbs. was to encourage the local industries of packing, tinning, and printing in connexion with packet tea. The effect of the alteration made by the Senate would be to destroy that industry - or at all events to discourage it. The result, if the amendment requested by the Senate were made, would be that tea would be brought in in packets of, say, 6 lbs., or some other quantity greater than 5 lbs. There is no reason why we should discourage an Australian industry which has been well established. I move - </para>

                    <para>. - I ask the Committee to remember why it dissented from the proposal as it came from another place. It was then pointed out that the ordinary custom of the trade meant that, if we passed this item as it appeared in the schedule, the settlers in the country districts would be penalized, whilst it would make no difference to those in the towns, and that to that extent it became something in the nature of a class tax. The ordinary town householder goes to his grocer and gets tea in&#189;-lb. or1-lb. packets, made up by the grocer or his assistants. </para>

                        <para>- I proposed previously to strike it out altogether. I do not move that now, because the Committee then decided to make the size of the packet 5 lbs. We must either stand by the request or recede from it, or offer a compromise. The reason the Committee made the request was that otherwise the tax would fall as a special impost upon country customers - that particular class that every one in Australia professes to desire to assist and encourage. We ought to press the request, but if honorable senators think 5 lbs. is too low, there is still a big difference between that and the 20 lbs. proposed by the other place. I think 5 lbs. is quite large enough, and shall not move for a compromise, but if any one differs from me, the road is open to him to move to meet another place half way. I ask the Committee to be slow to impose a duty which will fall specially upon country people, and have no influence upon those living in much better and more favorable circumstances in the environs of the towns. </para>

                        <para>. - We had a very lengthy discussion on this item when it was last before the Committee, and ultimately it was decided to leave out the words, &#34; viz. : -women&#39;s and children&#39;s dress goods.&#34; The effect of that was to enlarge the scope of the item, and to include men&#39;s dress goods not weighing over 5 ozs. per square yard in the woollen piece goods dutiable at 15 and 10 per cent. Honorable members in another place think that would be throwing open the gate too widely, because there are factories, and particularly one in Parramatta, in which this class of goods, weighing 5 oz. and under per square yard, are manufactured. They agreed to the special treatment of women&#39;s - and children&#39;s dress goods of these materials, and they suggest a very important modification, including in this paragraph of the item, women&#39;s and children&#39;s dress flannels. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia) &#91;3.9&#93;. - This is the most singular kind of compromise I ever heard of. The Vice-President of the Executive Council says that another place has met the wishes of the Senate, and has carried them out by adding to the item &#34; women&#39;s and children&#39;s dress flannels.&#34; That is certainly offering something, but it is not in the direction desired by the Senate. I think that it was on the motion of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline>
                    that we requested the House of Representatives to leave out the words &#34; women&#39;s and children&#39;s dress goods.&#34; The basis of his proposal for the exemption of these goods from the higher duties was not that they were used by women and children, but that they did not weigh over 5 oz. per square yard. I do not see myself - and I think that was the feeling of the Committee at the time - that there is any particular reason to fix that rate simply because those who are to wear these articles, not exceeding in weight 5 ozs. to the square yard, should be women and children.

                        <para>- Nothing of the kind. My honorable- friend is attributing to the Committee a degree of stupidity which I am astonished <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> find emanating from him. The Committee requested the omission of the words &#34;women&#39;s and children&#39;s dress goods,&#34; so that if material of this character not weighing over 5 ozs. to the square yard came in the one rate of duty should be chargeable. That was in the direction of simplicity. To my mind it is not very material one &#34;way or the other. I wish to point out the comicality of this great concession which is offered to the Senate. The proposition is to retain the words which we requested to be struck out - &#34; women&#39;s and children&#39;s dress goods &#34; - and to add the words &#34; including women&#39;s and children&#39;s dress flannels.&#34; If it is put to us that we are not to insist upon our request because of the liberal concession offered by the other House, that is no reason at all, and the Minister might just as well have asked us not to press the request without giving a reason of any kind. </para>

                    <para>. - No doubt it will be generally remembered &#39; that the duties on cottons were reduced to  5  per cent, and free. This item relates particularly to flannelettes, and the Committee thought it desirable that they should be placed on the same basis as cottons, and I confess that I take the same view. While it is quite open to argument that the use of flannelettes should be discouraged, that will not be done by the imposition of duties such as  10  and  5  per cent. If the original proposal of the Government to impose duties of  25  and  20  per cent. - that is, to give an effective protection - had been accepted, I could have quite understood it, but in the circumstances, I cannot see my way to ask the Committee to go back upon its decision,, and I hope that I shall not be opposing the wish of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> when I move - </para>

                    <para>. - This item was one which the Senate regarded as being of- a purely revenue character. It is not likely that: duties of  20  and  15  percent. would lead to the establishment of local industries, inasmuch as duties of  40  and  50  per cent, in other cases are considered essential to protect  industries already established. It mav be said that we want the revenue; but if it should be found that the revenue is required for Commonwealth purposes, Parliament can be appealed to to make pro vision. With a revenue from Customs and Excise jumping up to the neighbourhood of &#163;1  2,000,000  this year, we are not called upon to impose duties of  20  and  15  per cent, upon articles which at present, and for some time to come, will be imported. </para>

I am opposed to the raising of revenue by such means as this ; and, therefore, i am opposed to the Minister&#39;s motion. It is quite true that the Government may need revenue, but there are other legitimate ways of raising it which, in my opinion, are preferable to this method of Customs taxation, which not only takes the revenue out of the pockets of the taxpayers, but compels them to pay interest and profit on their taxes.

The greater part of the &#39; importations are in respect of floorcloths and linoleums.&#34; Our imports from the United Kingdom amount in value to &#163;304,060, and from other countries to &#163;15,000.

The item must not be regarded as purely revenue producing, though it has a revenue aspect at present. It is, at the  &#39;Same  time, of a protective character. </para>

As practically all the imports come from Great Britain, the&#34; operative part of the item is the  15  per cent, duty. I may add that the adoption of our request would mean a. loss of revenue of about  . &#163;18.000  per annum. </para>

                    <para>. - In spite of the statement of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, I say that this is purely a revenue item. In no sense can it be said that these articles are made in Australia. The sewing on of a little bit of fringe or &#34; frill,&#34; as one honorable senator put it, may be done in Australia, but surely the Committee will not call the sewing of a tassel on to a blind&#34; made elsewhere an industry entitled to a protection of  &#39;25  per cent. It is absurd: to discuss the item from a protectionist stand-point, because no honest sane protectionist can contend that that is an industry. The Committee on a previous occasion decided emphatically that this was merely a revenue duty, and on that ground I ask honorable, senators to join in defeating the motion. </para>

Specimens of those made in Australia were exhibited in the Chamber. The Committee carried a request to make the item free. I have reason to know that a number of honorable senators were absent on a deputation, and unable to be here in time to deal with the matter, and I am certain that the vote then taken did not represent the desire or intention of the Senate. It is well known that these classes- of gloves are made here. Driving gloves, for&#39; instance, are made of a material called cape, which, is subject to a duty of something like 20 per cent. That material is imported, and cut up, and made into gloves- - </para>

                    <para>. - When the item was last before us, there was some doubt as to whether these kinds of gloves were made in Australia, but after the matter had been dealt with, definite information was secured that they were actually being made at two or three places in the Commonwealth. &#39; I made that statement at the time, but I had not sufficient evidence to satisfy honorable senators, and my word was doubted. The report of Mr.&#39; Harrison Ord, the Chief Inspector of Factories for. Victoria, was quoted against me. It was argued that as no factory appeared under the heading of &#34; Gloves,&#34; the articles were not made here. It was . explained afterwards that cloves sue being made in connexion with other leather articles, and that, consequentlv, the factories did not appear in the register as glove factories. There are, at least, three different factories in Melbourne, where they are made. Specimens were brought into this building, and exhibited in the Queen&#39;s Hall. </para>

I assumed that the honorable senator, following his usual course, moved a motion to the effect that we should not press our request. Now that I recollect the circumstances, reference to them will hardly help the honorable member- He commenced his remarks when he rose in a way which clearly indicated his intention to move that we should not insist on our request. </para>

Since then further light has been thrown on the question, and we find that almost all the gloves required in Australia which come under paragraph  a  are manufactured here. In view of that information, it has been finally decided by both Houses that those gloves worn in industrial occupations by people of the working class shall be subject to duties of 30 and 20 per cent. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> now desires that I should consent to an unfair discrimination, compelling the poorer people to pay these high duties, and, at the same time, permitting the&#39; richer people to escape scot free. I am not taking any of the medicine prescribed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> on this occasion, and I hope that the Committee is not taking any either. </para>

Undoubtedly, the articles should be made free if there were no prospect of making them in Australia. If we can make one quality of gloves, surely we can make the other. I intend to -persist with my amendment, and I hope that the Committee will assist me to remove this injurious differentiation with which, if made, we could be fairly taxed bv the people. </para>

                    <para>- On a former occasion I voted in favour of duties of 30 and 20 per cent. On a certain kind of gloves, which were, to my satisfaction, being made in different parts ot Australia. It is a matter of indifference to me whether they are worn by the poor or by the rich. It is sufficient for me to know (hat they are being made locally. I voted for the free admission of other kinds of gloves, whether worn by the rich or by the poor, because they were not made in Australia. Everybody who is in favour of protectionist principles has argued that to impose an excessively high duty on an article which is not being made in Australia is unfair. </para>

                        <para>- Because., at that time, he was under the impression that housemaids&#39;, driving, and gardening gloves were not being made in Australia; but immediately after the vote was taken on that item, we had produced within the precincts of this building samples showing that the local manufactures were of a very superior kind. I have no feeling other than a desire to do what I conceive to be right. I have no evidence that any kinds of gloves other than the ones which have been made dutiable are being manufactured here. It has been asserted that certain kinds are being manufactured. I have made inquiries, but I cannot find out definitely that they are being manufactured in any part of Australia. Is it right, then, to tax such gloves to the extent of 30 and 20 per cent. ? For a considerable period in Victoria-there was a very high protectionist duty on gloves. </para>

                        <para>- I can hardly swallow that. I do not think that any influence would have been sufficiently powerful to prevent the honorable senator, if he were convinced that gloves could be made here, from getting a duty imposed. I have no recollection of his ever having made an effort in that direction. I am inclined to vote in the same way as I did on a previous occasion. There is no industry in connexion with the glove business. I do not want to give a vote which might be hurtful to any industry already established or likely to be established. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> can show me that there is a likelihood of a glove industry being established under the proposed duty in any part of Australia, I should hesitate a long time before voting in opposition to the request. </para>

                    <para>. - I am quite sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> spoke this afternoon under a considerable misapprehension. The gloves which he voted to have made duty free, on the ground that they were worn by the working classes, are mostly bought by the employers for the use of &#39;their employes. The duty is paid more by the employers than by the employes, and very little indeed by the working classes. With regard to the ordinary gloves, there is &#39; no doubt that when employes are in the streets they must wear imported gloves. This is, therefore, a tax on the masses,- especially the women, because it must be borne in mind that the men very seldom wear gloves. Honorable senators would do well to recollect that gloves are mainly imported for&#39; the use of women. The duty which it is now sought to remit is levied solely upon them. </para>

                    <para>. - The argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> if correct, would be sound. If gloves could not be made in Australia, it would be unwise and improper to levy a duty upon them ; but it is quite obvious that they can be made. There was a time when kid boots were not made to any extent in Australia, and it was declared that we could not make the finer kinds of boots which our women desired in order that they might look, as we hope they always will, tastefully and well dressed. It was contended that they must get imported boots, but, in spite of that, we levied a duty, and now it is admitted that in Australia women can get boots equal, price for price, to any boots made in any part of the world. The imposition of the duty enabled our manufacturers to produce the finer lines. It is now declared that our women will be taxed by the imposition of this duty upon gloves : but I have no hesitation in saying that they will be found employment by its imposition. It will be mainly women who will be employed .in the industry, because it is a light delicate kind of employment. Therefore, if we are to consider the women, it will be wise to impose. a duty on an article which they use, and which, at present, .has to be imported. </para>

I believe in a protective duty in this case, because gloves can be and are being made in Australia. By encouraging their manufacture, we shall afford employment for many women. Even though I voted in a contrary direction last time, with the knowledge that I now possess, I shall not hesitate to change my vote. But I voted conscientiously then, and shall do the same, again. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to set <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> right in a matter concerning which he made an extremely emphatic declaration. 1 never hope to set him wholly right, but if I can set him right to some little extent I shall feel that I have not lived my political life in vain. Speaking with all the assertion&#34; of a great high priest of protection, the honorable senator asserted that there never was a duty on gloves in Victoria. The statement was not made with any hesitancy, but in an absolutely &#34; cocksure &#34; fashion, to adopt a word suggested to me by an honorable senator sitting near me. I venture to say that those who listened must have - felt that even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> would not have made the statement with such confidence unless he was absolutely sure of his ground. But I find on referring to the Victorian Customs and Excise Act, No. 1401, that in this State there was a duty of 20 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- The Act . from which I am quoting is dated 1895. Whether, at that time, Victoria had the estimable value of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator, Trenwith&#39;s</inline> services in the Legislature, I do not know. But this Act shows that there was great force in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley&#39;s</inline> statement that a duty was in force for some time in Victoria, but failed to produce any glove manufacturing here. Evidently, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> was on sound ground when, speaking as a protectionist, he argued that a dutv should not bc put upon this article. There was no local industry, nor any prospect of one being brought into existence under the Victorian duty. </para>

Now he says that some gloves are made here, but though some are not, there is no reason why they should not be. He is well aware that this will simply be a high revenue duty. He is pro-, posing a duty of 20 per. cent, against Great Britain. That is exactly the duty that prevailed in Victoria. </para>

                        <para>- There is a large importation of gloves from Great Britain, and on those imports the honorable senator is proposing exactly the same duty as obtained in Victoria, although he denounced the Victorian duty as a revenue tax. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> gave as one justification for his change of front that, having decided to put an impost upon the gloves worn by the poorer people, he was not going to allow the richer class to escape scot free. I was glad to hear, that statement. I wish to say in reply that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> is actually voting to put a duty on the poorer people. By voting to put what he now admits to be a tax on the wealthier class, the honor-&#39; able senator equalizes the tax on the poorer people. He says with regard to the poorer classes of gloves, upon which the dutv is being imposed, that it will not be a tax. But if so. why this equalizing dutv againSt those gloves which are not made here? </para>

                    <para>- - The misrepresentation of me by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> requires exposure. He says that what is proposed according to my admission is a tax upon the gloves of the poorer people. I did not say that it is a tax at all. What I did say was that we should impose a duty upon those gloves for the purpose of insuring that they shall be manufactured in Australia. In the same way as the duties imposed on boots have not increased the prices of boots, but have lowered prices, so that the people of Australia are more cheaply shod than are the people of any other country in the world, as a result of the protective policy of the country - just in the same way this duty will be no fax upon the people, because the gloves that they wear will be made in the country, and sold as cheaply as they can be sold in any part of the world. In addition to that, we shall be finding many of our people a means of livelihood in making gloves. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that what are called kid gloves of the coarser kind are made in Melbourne and Sydney. As a matter of fact, no so-called kid glove is. made of kid. The finer qualities are made from rat skins. It has been proved that amongst the native fauna of Australia there are creatures which are practically a pest, the skins of which can be used to make gloves of the very finest quality. There is an opening for an industry which wil.l be Australian from root to branch. We shall not only do the manufacturing here, but will have an opportunity of developing what is now a waste product into a high-priced material, and supplying our own people with such necessary articles as gloves. As Parliament has now decided that the coarser classes of gloves shall bear a duty, in order to encourage their manufacture in the Commonwealth, I hope that the same dutv will be imposed on the finer qualities, in order to encourage their manufacture here also. I do not aspire to see Australia manufacturing only the poorer or coarser qualities of goods. I hope we shall produce all qualities, and show the world that we can supply ourselves from our own factories with articles of the finest character. I believe that that result can be achieved by an effective protection. I shall vote to make the item free rather than for the paltry duties of  15  and  10  per cent, originally passed bv another place. They would be purely revenue duties, and, if I were to vote for them, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> might have an excuse for twitting me with inconsistency. Mv motion is for higher duties. If that is negatived, I shall vote against the revenue duties which were first submitted to us. </para>

That idea was fully concurred in as a prim ciple by another place, but they have sought to provide for guns or rifles, ordered, and perhaps on the water, which were not proofed or marked. They therefore inserted the words given in their modification. After full consideration of that provision by the Department, we find that it is impracticable to add it to the item, because we have no proof house&#39; for proofing arms in Australia; and it. would take till long after the  1st  October next to secure the necessary appliances for the purpose of proofing. There are practically two proofs in connexion with arms. One is the test or proof of the barrel after it is constructed by the manufacturer, and the other is applied when the barrel is attached to the action.

                    <para>. - I anticipate that the Minister&#39;s &#39;remarks will commend themselves to the- Committee, but since I brought the requested amendment before this Chamber, I have learnt that some of the best - certainly the best at a moderate price - of the commercial weapons imported to Australia come from America. I may instance those from the Winchester and Remington companies. I understand that there is no official test mark with regard to their barrels. They test them themselves, and that was the reason why I interjected just now to ask if the Department would regard the mark of the manufacturers as an &#34; approved test mark.&#34; Of course, the Department would always be at liberty&#39; to determine whether the manufacturers&#39; reputation was in itself some guarantee of their mark. I understand that the cheap and inferior guns against which we desire to guard come largely from Belgium, a country which has an official test mark, whereas our best guns are obtained from America, where there is  no official test mark. I do not want to shut out the excellent American gun so largely used by our settlers merely because of the obvious necessity of shutting out those cheap continental guns. However, the Minister&#39;s assurance that the Department will regard the test mark of a manufacturing company, of the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of which it is assured, as an approved test mark, sets my mind at rest. </para>

After full consideration in this Chamber, in view of the fact that the manufacture of sheet lead and lead piping is a recognised and important Australian industry, and, as such, is entitled to at least moderate protection, this Committee decided to request the House of Representatives to impose a duty of 20s. per ton.

                    <para>. - I wish only to repeat a statement made when we previously discussed this item, and not denied, that one of the reasons why it is desirable to put these articles on the free list is that, owing to the action of the Broken Hill companies, those using this commodity in Australia are heavily penalized. The Broken Hill companies, for some reason best known to themselves, decline to sell lead to any one in Australia at a less price than they can realize in London. They make no deduction to purchasers in Australia of the cost of sending the article to the Old Country. It was because we thought this extremely unfair that I and other honorable senators voted to make the item free, and that no effort was made here to impose a higher duty than 20s. per ton. I ask honorable senators to again consider the matter, and to say whether, in view of the evident attempt on the part of a big corporation to take advantage of their unique position to treat Australian consumers unfairly, there is any justification for the imposition of this duty? If we make the item free, those who require sheet lead and lead piping in Australia will be free to purchase from abroad without having to pay any duty, or from the Broken Hill companies if they are willing to do what is fair. By imposing the duty, we shall say to every man who requires the articles . that he must pay <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> per ton more for it if he purchases from people abroad, and, to that extent, we shall force him to deal with the Broken Hill companies, who, I say, are taking an unfair advantage of the local consumer. </para>

                    <para>. - There would be a great deal of force in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has said if the statements were practically true, or if it. were to continue to be true for ever. Every one must acknowledge that, although the Broken Hill Proprietary Company are at the present time great producers of lead, they are not going to control the production of lead in Australia for ever. If they are so short-sighted, illiberal, and unjust to the manufacturers who require these materials in . Australia, the laws of Australia, when properly framed and administered, should bring such a monopoly to its bearings. On the other hand, admitting  that everything that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has stated is actually true, and that the position he describes will , never be altered, would it not be better to have our lead manufactured here, even though it should be a monopoly, than to have to depend on a monopoly established outside of Australia? There are several manufacturers of sheet lead and lead piping in Melbourne and in other parts of Australia, and, although they have to some extent to put up with- the disadvantages referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> it is hoped that in the near future we shall be able to overcome the existing difficulty; and we should be prepared to give some assistance to men who have spent almost a life-time, and  a very large portion of their fortune, in establishing an industry of this description in Australia. I hope that, for the reasons I have stated, the Committee will press the request. The lead is taken from Australian soil, and manufactured by Australians, and the industry is just as much an Australian industry as is the woollen industry. </para>

                        <para>- It has to be taken to England and brought back from England. If there is no freight on lead to London, it follows that people purchasing it here do not pay any more for it than if they purchased it in London, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> is, therefore, left on the horns of a dilemma. In any case, the makers of lead piping and sheet lead do not need the protection proposed. They are masters of the situation without any duty, and to impose one would be a work of supererogation. </para>

Honorable senators must recognise that the manufacture of cutlery is not likely to be started with the duty of 15 per cent., which the Minister is asking us to inflict upon British imports. I only rose because I thought that the item might pass without its true character having been made known to honorable senators. It is a pure, unabashed revenue item. For that reason I . propose to keep the duty as low as possible. </para>

I think that the Committee will be quite justified in adhering to its decision and so allowing the articles to come in free. I hope that even the Minister will see that that course is necessary. It cannot be urged on any ground that it is a protectionist duty. It is purely a revenue duty. </para>

                    (New South Wales) &#91;5.19&#93;.  -I  recognise that the Vice-President of the Executive Council has a kind of divided duty here. He has an obligation to his colleagues in the Ministry, but he should occasionally feel an obligation to the Senate. It is of very little use for a Minister to be here for the purpose of insisting upon Ministerial action contrary to the wish of the majority of the Chamber. I hope that my honorable friend will . recognise, as we all must do,- that he has a divided allegiance; we must respect the difficulties of his position, but we do hope, I imagine, that he will sometimes at least see that the balance of evidence is in favour of the Senate, rather than always in favour of the Ministry. It is very little that he &#39;has been willing the Senate should have as the result of its previous decisions. He has shown a very ample sense of obligation to his Ministerial colleagues. I hope that in this instance; and in some future ones at least, he will, by his action, recognise some sense of obligation to this Chamber, that it may not be too frequently placed in the position of simply playing second fiddle to another place.

The obligation is thrown upon the Department . of admit ting high-speed engines, which are to be coupled to generators or pumps. The Department desires, therefore, to protect it-  self, and to carry out the wish of Parliament, by making sure that these high-speed engines are imported only for coupling to pumps of generators. The Department must not be placed in the position of being told by an importer, &#34; Oh, this engine is going to be coupled to a generator, and therefore must come in free.&#34; The Department wants to be satisfied. </para>

                    <para>. -  The object of the alteration of wording suggested in the message from the House of Representatives is to make clearer the terms of our request, and our intention. The term &#34; high pressure,&#34; used in connexion with &#39; &#39; blowers for smelting pur- poses,&#34; was very misleading and indefinite, and as it was considered the intention was to apply to all rotary blowers for smelting purposes, the request was altered accordingly. It was pointed out that high-pressure blowers for melting purposes in foundries would not come under this item, and as there would be practically no difference between them and any of those for smelting purposes, it was clear that the intention of the Senate&#39;s request was to apply to rotary blowers. The object- of inserting the word &#39; &#39;&#39; patent &#34; before &#39; 1 portable hoists &#34; was in order to preserve the intention of the original item as passed by the House of Representatives, and to secure proper protection to the local manufacturers of other than small patent hoists.

                    <para>- - This is one of the items in which the Senate ought to uphold its original position. The Senate considered that the item should be free, whilst the House of Representatives thought that there should be a duty of  s  per cent, under the general Tariff making the item- free in regard to goods from the United Kingdom. But a number of these machines are not manufactured in Great Britain at all. If it is desirable to allow them to come in free, it does not matter very much where they come from. They are a necessary aid to carrying on wealth production in our own country. The duty would be purely a revenue tax, and ought not to be imposed for the reasons which I have mentioned. I am opposed to revenue taxes generally, and especially on machinery. </para>

We can signify in this way our preference for goods from Great Britain which amongst European countries pays the highest wages to artisans. The British people. are our own kinsfolk, and this will, be an expression of our appreciation of them. We shall say by this means, &#34; If we must import something we prefer to import from a country which complies to a great extent with the economic doctrines in which we believe.&#34; Therefore, I urge upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> and those who think with him, the adoption of the preferential policy, which in this instance seems to be sound, patriotic, and economically wise. We do not profess to give Great Britain a preference over our own productions, but we do desire to give to her preference against the rest of the world. </para>

The intention is in this case - as in a large number of other cases - to carry out a preference policy. &#39; But let honorable senators turn to item 160, wherein some of the same kinds of machines are mentioned.  In that case we have made the duty 5 per cent, under the general Tariff and free in regard to the United Kingdom. No alteration was proposed there. Why should we make a distinction by charging 5 per cent, on one class of machinery, and making another class free, when both classes are made in and imported from the United Kingdom, and imported also from other parts of the world? We should be consistent, and continue the preference that we have already adopted in the item immediately preceding that before us. </para>

He says he is in favour of .imposing a duty of 5 per cent, against Germany, and of giving the United Kingdom a preference of 5 per cent., because Germany does not pay as high wages as the United Kingdom does. If it is a matter of wages, those paid in the United States, which do business in these articles, are infinitely higher than those paid in the United Kingdom. The honorable senator therefore charges Germany 5 per cent., because it pays low wages, grants free-trade with England, because England pays higher, wages, and&#39; when he comes to the country which pays the highest wages of all, reverts again to the policy of imposing a duty. What becomes of his argument that we should&#34; recognise the wages conditions under which goods are manufactured? The whole thing reeks with inaccuracies and follies.. </para>
                <para class="block">If honorable members would study the matter of preferential duties, they would be sick and sorry of the whole affair. These proposals for preference are of no value to the United Kingdom, but are rather calculated to cause the United Kingdom a great deal of trouble. Australia is more dependent on foreign countries for the sale of her commodities than upon the United Kingdom. </para>

                    <para>. - I shall take up the same attitude as on previous items, and vote for pressing our request. The so-called . preference on this item is a mere sham or bogus preference, because it is a matter of common knowledge that scarcely any - I believe I should be justified in saying none - of this ware is manufactured in England, and that it is practically all manufactured on the Continent of Europe. It is impossible to obtain official figures to verify that statement, because, as the Minister said, the imports are included under &#34; Manufactures of Metal.&#34; But I have had to buy aluminium ware, and have never yet seen any ot it branded as having been made in England. </para>

                        <para>- I shall be glad if the people of England do impose protective duties, but it is utter absurdity for us to talk about protecting the people of Great Britain if they will not protect themselves. I notice that on certain items some honorable senators who repudiate protection for Australian industries have been quite prepared to give this bogus protection to Great Britain. This duty on articles of everyday household use is essentially a revenue one. It cannot be said to be a preferential duty, because these articles are not made in the United Kingdom. If honorable senators take a common-sense view of the matter they will adhere to their former decision. </para>

                        <para>. - I hope that my protectionist friends will recognise that a very important protectionist principle is involved in this case. The original proposal of the Government was that rock-boring machines n.e.i. should be dutiable at 25 and 20 per cent. The Committee, in dealing with the matter previously, decided, under a misapprehension, to request the House of Representatives to admit these machines duty free. The misapprehension under which honorable senators laboured was that they believed these rock-boring machines applied to mining, and were of the same class of machinery as rotary and percussive rock drills. As a matter of fact, these machines have no special application to mining at all. I hope that honorable senators will realize that to make this item free would be to strike a serious blow at an Australian industry. I urge upon honorable senators who take a special interest in the mining industry that the House of Representatives has already accepted a request from the Senate to admit rotary and percussive rock-drills at a duty of 5 per cent, under the general Tariff, and free if imported from the United Kingdom. That is a very important concession to the mining industry. This item covers only a particular class of machinery, such as diamond drills and artesian-boring machines, and in the circumstances I move - </para>

Water is, perhaps, the one essential factor required for the development of Australia, and the Minister submits an extremely poor argument in support of duties of  25  and  20  per cent, on this item when he says that it covers only machinery required for artesian boring.

                        <para>- I do not represent a factory in a back lane. I speak on behalf of Australia. If coal-cutting machinery should be admitted duty free, rock-drilling machinery required &#39; by the miner, and also by the man on the soil, should certainly be admitted free. This rock-boring machinery is required for mining development, and for the supply of water to dry country. I suppose that scarcely a year goes round in which, a large portion of the Commonwealth is not stricken for want of water. I claim that no embargo should&#39; be placed upon machinery necessary for the development of our great pastoral interior or our mineral wealth. The use of coal-cutting machines, which we have decided should be admitted free, might have some tendency to restrict the demand for labour, but the use of the machinery we are dealing with in this item would be likely to very largely increase the opportunities for employment. I hope that the Committee will stand firm on this item. Honorable senators do not represent localities, but the whole of the Commonwealth of Australia; and I sincerely hope that the Committee will insist upon making this item free. </para>

                        <para>- When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> moved to make the item free, no one appeared to be so strongly opposed to the request as to feel it to be his duty to call for a division. The Minister&#39;s explanation is that the Committee decided, in dealing with a previous item, to request the House of Representatives to make coal-cutting machines free, and he accepted the decision in that case as an intimation that it would be useless to call for a division on the request made in connexion with this item. If that be so, it is the strongest possible argument that could be advanced against disturbing the Tariff as it now stands. The Committee decided to place machinery required for cutting coal, and machinery required for cutting rock in order to find water, on the same footing, and I hope they will not now disturb that arrangement. </para>

                    <para>. - So far as Australian industries are concerned, this is a very important item. The Senate requested that the horse-power should be reduced from 500 to 10, in order to limit the protection to practically 10 horse-power dynamo electric machines, and, of course, if its request- were adopted, the larger ones would become free under a succeeding item. I appeal to my honorable friends in the corner to remember what has been done in the interests of the mining industry. </para>

                        <para>- We have made these particular engines apply not only to generators, but also to pumps. In addition to that we have made the -duty on rotary blowers 5 per cent, and free. All that has been done specifically in the interests of the mining industry. Therefore, I hope that my honorable friends will not accuse the Parliament of having neglected its interests. If the protection were limited to machines of 10 horse-power as the Senate requested, it would place the local manufacturers in a most serious position. This class of machine is held in large stocks by the importers, because of its low value. The local manufacturer! has no reasonable hope of competing against the importations. On a previous occasion, some doubt did exist in the minds of my honorable friends as to whether  dynamo-electric machines of 500 horse-; power were made here. As a matter ot fact, electrical motors are made in the Commonwealth, and have been supplied to well-known mines and institutions. The Mount Lyell mine lias been supplied with one 200 horse-power, one 90 horse-power, and two 50 horse-power motors; Jumbunna with one 120 kilowatts - a kilowatt is 1 1/3 horse-power ; Cock&#39;s Pioneer, with one 300 kilowatts, and four 90 horse-power ; Walhalla, with one 200 horse-power, one 90 horse-power, and three . 45 horse-power ; Foy and Gibson, with one 75 kilowatts;, the Proprietary Mine with one 20 horsepower; and Block 10 Mine with one 45 horse-power, one 30 horse-power, and one 20 horse-power. These records of the output -of our own industry can easily be verified. The large mines and firms I have named would not purchase a locally-made electric motor unless it was effective. From time to time, one company has repeated its orders for the locally-made article. I know that my honorable friends from Western Australia are protectionists on principle, and are anxious to do justice to local manufacturers. I have furnished them with evidence which cannot be disputed, and I ask them to consider why our own men should suffer by the abolition of the duty, as requested by the Senate? I hope that they will see fit to support the item in its original form. I move - </para>

In spite of what the Minister has said, I venture to say that he has not made out a case for asking the Committee to reverse its decision concerning this item. It is quite possible that some of these smaller machines may be made here.

                        <para>- That, I believe, was the initial and only effort to make an engine of that sort. I 3b not desire to open up debate or to decry local manufacturers. Not merely have we a big mining enterprise spreading itself throughout Australia, but that enterprise is confronted to-day with a tremendous slump in values. I suppose that during, last year the value of minerals has dropped by from 30 to 50 per cent. As a result of that fall, even in my own State, some well-established and well-equipped mines at Broken Hill have practically ceased to operate. Therefore we ought tn go slowly in framing this Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- Those established mines have been forced to close down, and neither the locally-made article nor the imported one is of any good to a mine when it is not able to make a profit. If established mines have to cease operations, it requires no argument to show that, as regards new ventures, every additional pound of expenditure must have a deterrent influence upon those who are invited to invest their capital in that way. For that reason I trust that the Committee will at once reject the proposal of the Minister and adhere to its original decision in favour of the ten horse-power standard. </para>

I intend to adopt the same attitude on this occasion partly for reasons advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> Any one who knows anything about mining must recognise that throughout the Commonwealth the industry is down below its normal condition. It is indeed in a very precarious state. It is practically struggling for existence. A large percentage of the mining in Australia to-day is dependent upon the treatment of low-grade ores. I venture to say that if we do anything that will render impossible operations in mines that are working upon low-grade ores we shall do a very serious injury. There are very few high-grade mines in Australia now, and every one of these few is in a position/ to purchase engines which are to be made duty free. It has been decided that 500 horsepower engines shall be free. The Great Boulder in Western Australia, the Great Cobar mine in New South Wales, and the Ivanhoe mine all have motors upon their properties of a higher power than those for which free admission is provided in this Tariff. But their competitors are handicapped by having to pay duties. </para>

                        <para>- The mining industry of Australia is far from being in the condition of paying those high dividends that were the rule a few years ago. Nowadays it takes the greatest economy and the exercise of the soundest wisdom to keep the industry moving. It would be most unwise to do anything to hamper the treatment of low-grade ores. In the low-grade mines in Australia there are twenty miners at work for every one employed in the high-grade and easily payable mines. If we consider on the one hand the interests of those who are engaged iri manufacturing machinery, and on the other the large number employed in the mining industry, it must be admitted that those engaged in the manufacture of machinery have had a very fair deal in the construction of this Tariff. We can now afford to give some consideration to the mining industry. I agree that there is a great deal of difference between 500 horse-power, the limit proposed by the House of Representatives, and 10 horsepower, as requested by the Senate. I am not prepared to say that I will not support a slight increase beyond 10 horse-power. But if there is to be a question! between 500 horse-power and 10, I shall vote for the 10. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> has rendered very good service in drawing attention to the somewhat strained condition in which the mining industry is being conducted at the present time. I do not think that there are any large mines in Australia that are being worked with big profits. On the other hand. it is obvious to all of us who know anything about the industry that there are many mines that are being worked with a minimum of profit. There are some in which even a minimum cannot be obtained. It is as well to point out that certain articles are included in this item that are subject to duties of 20 per cent. Such for instance are static transformers, induction coils for all purposes, and electric fans. I am not sufficiently acquainted with mining to enable Trie to. say to what extent those machines are used in mines, but at all events they are connected with mining. No attempt has been made to remove them from the 20 per cent. list. For my own part, I should prefer to remove even 10 horsepower engines from the operation of. the duty. I do not see why the whole of the mining industry of Australia should be bailed up and made to stand and deliver to a certain favoured section of machinery manufacturers. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to point out the&#39; inequality that exists in the Tariff even from the start. There is&#39; a proposal in the next item that all machines over the capacity of 500 horse-power should bear a duty of 12 J per cent. That is a clear and distinct advantage to companies which employ larger machines as against struggling companies which machines of smaller capacity would suit. The main question, however, is the effect which the passing of the duties as sent from another place would have upon the prospects of mining throughout the Commonwealth. I believe it would have a most injurious effect. In the newer mining centres one cannot fail to notice the increasing degree to which electricity is applied in every department of mining. We should ask ourselves very seriously whether in our present stage of development electrical machines can be produced in Australia at a price which will keep the mining industry going, even at its present rate of development. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crocker,</inline> a gentleman whom I know very  well, stated in evidence before the Tariff Commission, that a machine made in Melbourne would cost over <inline font-style="italic">&#163;70,</inline> as against ,&#163;27 for which he could land a machine of the same  capacity  made abroad. That is the statement of a man who knows his business from A to Z. It may be thought that I am inconsistent in opposing the higher duty, &#34; but I am  really endeavouring to provide more employment than has been given in the past. The imposition of a  20  per cent, duty will mean wiping out of existence some of those struggling mining propositions that are now, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> said, travelling on a very narrow margin. In Western Australia a. number of mines, some employing  400  to  500  men, have not paid a cent in dividends for the last seven or eight years. Their managers are at their wits end for some means of cutting down expenses, and keeping them afloat. To increase the duty would simply be to give a direct instruction to those managers to close the mines down for a long time. Even with a  20  per cent, duty it will take year&#39;s to start the industry of manufacturing these machines on a basis that will meet the needs of those mines in the same way as they can be met by machinery from abroad. It may take possibly fifteen or twenty years, but certainly the industry cannot be established in Australia on that scale inside ten years. I am not satisfied to throw the mining industry of Australia into a stagnant condition in the meantime. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> that an alteration.,&#39; but a very small one, might be made in the capacity as stated in the item. At all the mines at present employing electricity on a large scale, there are a number of motors, ranging in capacity from  40  to  70  or  80  horse-power, scattered about the surface. They are of the common type used in mines, and I presume are similar to those referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crocker.</inline> A difference of,&#163;43 in the price of a  70  horse-power motor is altogether out of the question. In the interests of the mining industry, which  is the parent of many others., we have every warrant for pressing our request. Mining in almost every State is not in the same flourishing condition as it was . in earlier days. Probably only in Western Australia does the possibility still exist of finding new and rich fields, so that the prospects of the industry are practically entirely confined to working low-grade propositions that under past conditions were found unpayable. To increase the duty will be to add a further burden to mining, and place another obstacle in the way of working those low-grade propositions. I ask the Committee to press the request in the interests of those seeking employment. Although we might agree to raise the capacity very slightly, we shall be well advised, on this occasion at any rate, in adhering to our decision to give cheap electrical power to the mining industry of Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - I may fairly twit <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> with inconsistency.  -His  remarks regarding the &#39;mining industry might well have been applied . to other industries regarding which he used entirely different arguments. If it is true, as he urged on those occasions, that duties lower prices, he should be a most strenuous supporter of those now proposed by the Government. I recognise only too well the position of Australian mining, and I am pleased that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson,</inline> who have a practical knowledge of that occupation, have gone so thoroughly into the question. The industry is now in a very acute position. Every detail of expenditure will have to be scrutinized most closely if many of the mines are to be kept open. We know what the results will be if they are closed down. Not only have minerals&#39; fallen in price, in many cases to half their original  value, but in South America and other parts of the world they are being produced at a cost from  25  to  30  per cent, below&#39; the cost of mining in Australia. We. as practical men, must consider the serious effect of any increase of expenditure, not only on the continuation of existing mines, but on the prospect of developing new. ones. We ought, in a question of this magnitude, to rise superior to any fiscal question, and deal with it from a practical business stand-point, having regard, not only to the interests of shareholders, but much more to the interests of those employed in mines. It will be nothing short of a calamity if we do not seek to insure in every possible way the continuance of the mining industry, which is so essential to the prosperity of Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - The Committee, in dealing with this item when it was last under consideration, decided to request the House of Representatives to make the duties 25 and 20 per cent., because it was recognised that the real work consisted in the assembling of parts here. What the Committee sought to achieve was that the local industry, which employs a great number of men, should be maintained. If completed gas meters were admitted at duty of 5 per cent. under the general Tariff, and free if imported from the United Kingdom, the local industry for the assembling of gas meter parts would be extinguished. I move - </para>

                <para>That the request as to duty be not pressed provided the paragraph is amended to read as follows :  - &#34; Gas Meter parts not fitted together or joined in any way.&#34; </para>
                <para class="block">If that course were adopted, whilst the parts would be admitted free, completed gas meters would be liable to duties of 25 and 20 per cent. under item 162,paragraph b. If the Senate&#39;s request is submitted in the form which I have suggested, it is likely that another place will see its way to accept it, and so maintain the local industry for the assembling of gas meter parts. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not feel inclined to support the motion. I recognise that compromise is necessary in the framing of a Tariff, but  &#91; think the Vice-President of the Executive Council in this matter proposes to go too far. When the item was previously before the Committee, I submitted a request for an increase of the duty under the general Tariff from 5 per cent. to 25 per cent., and for the imposition of a duty of 20 per cent. on imports from the United Kingdom, which it was proposed should be admitted free. I remind honorable senators that the object was to remove a very glaring anomaly in connexion with gas meters. Under item 170 water meters were dutiable at25 and 20per cent., while under item 172 brassware and gunmetal were dutiable at 30 and 25 per cent. I claim that gas meters are in exactly the same category as water meters, brassware, and gunmetal. There can be no separation or differentiation. If it is possible to make water meters in Australia, it is also possible to make gas meters. As a matter of fact, we are doing so, and the Minister now admits that he has proof to that effect. On a former occasion, it was stated that gas meters were not being made here. I replied that in at least two States they were being made, and to-night I have additional proof, and it is that a firm in South Melbourne has recently accepted a very extensive order. It is now proposed to admit the parts free, and&#39; to levy a duty on the complete article. I may be wrong, but I think that if adopted it would defeat the object we have in view. If any honorable senator can satisfy me that there is no anomaly in allowing the differential duties to remain on water meters, brassware, and gunmetal, I am prepared to give way. </para>

According to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> proposed to multiply the duty by five times, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> joined with those who sat on this side to try to defeat it.

Not only did lie do that, but he abstained from offering any of those forceful arguments which, somehow or other, he has managed to furbish up for this occasion.&#39; If his present proposal is carried, into what item will gas meters fall ? </para>

                    <para>.- I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> will not vote in the direction which he indicated. I feel just as strongly as he does on this item. I know that this is an established industry, and that if it received the protection which we sought to secure by our request, it would become a much more substantial one than it is. Unless we are prepared  to  modify our request the probability is  that  the industry, small as it is just now,  wil!  be very seriously affected. If gas meters are permitted to come in at 5 per cent,  and  free, it will have a very disastrous  effect  upon the workmen of every State. </para>

                        <para>- In Victoria there are factories where meters are being  made. In  addition to- that, a number of men  are;  employed by the Metropolitan Gas  Company  on no other work than the assembling of imported parts of meters. If we permit the parts to come in free, and place a  duty  on the complete meter, the workers will  be  much better circumstanced than would  be  the case if we pressed our request, because the probability is that the one would  meet  with the same fate as did the other.  I  well remember that the Government  gave  as a reason for voting against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> &#39;s motion that a compact had  been  arrived at in another place in respect  of  these duties. Probably it was arrived  at  because it had been pointed out that  electric  meters were subject to a lower  scale  of duty than gas meters. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> stood by the compact, but the motion  was  carried against the Government. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that  no  protectionist will vote in opposition to  the  modified request submitted by the Minister, because to allow gas meters to come in  at  5 per cent, and free would throw .  a large number  of men out of employment in  every  State. I have received a petition from  men  engaged in the industry in Victoria,  and*  letters from the Secretary of the New  South  Wales Amalgamated Tinsmiths,  Sheet  and Iron Workers and Meter Makers,  urging  the members of the Labour Party  to  do all that they possibly can to get the  duty  as originally carried here agreed to.  But,  knowing that it is almost impossible to  get  our request carried elsewhere, I am  prepared  to accept that&#39; which is the next  best  thing. To place a duty on the completed meter, and to allow the parts to come in free, will not displace many, if any  men,   because the assembling gives employment to a considerable number of men. The  slot  meter industry will not, I think, be handicapped by this modified request: I hope  that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> in the interest  of  those who are particularly affected, will not vote in that direction, considering that his vote may be the means of defeating the modified request. </para>

                    <para>. - I draw attention to the fact that private telephones are used to an immense extent throughout the pastoral districts. Only the other day I was reading a statement in a newspaper . published in Central Queensland, which gave a list of a great number of private telephones used on the sheep stations in that part of the country. I should say that the wire used in connexion with these private telephones must run to thousands of miles. -While the Government get their telephones and appliances in free, it is unlikely that they will be manufactured locally. I see no reason why appliances which are so absolutely necessary in places where industries are spread over vast areas should be taxed. This is a revenue duty pure and simple. </para>

                    (New South Wales)  &#91;8.49&#93;.-  In another place, when a proposition similar to that before us was under consideration, a certain Ministry issued a printed document in which they showed that they intended to agree to a certain request. But when the matter had been properly manipulated they dropped their original proposition, and moved for a duty. I hope that nothing of that kind has occurred in this instance. But I believe that it has occurred, and I  very much regret it. I believe that the particular- &#34; not made&#34; entry in the schedule before us was the result of such a. trick as I have indicated - a dastardly trick.

This is purely a revenue duty. It is an odd thing for a man who all through his political life has held other, political opinions to be arguing in favour of the reduction of a duty because it is not protective, but it only shows the horrible environment in&#39; which one may find himself. I put it to honorable senators who are believers in protection, that there is no protection in a duty on telephones. The instruments are all the subjects of patents, and cannot be made in the Commonwealth. To agree to the Minister&#39;s proposition simply means burdening industries with a perfectly useless impost. </para>

He did move it, but now he says that the Government have heard that steel sleepers are about to be made at Lithgow. When a division was taken with regard to the duty on rails, it was pointed out that they also were going to be made at Lithgow. If so, why take steel sleepers, which are practically part of the same industry, out of this item, and put them into another item at double the duty? Even assuming that every statement made with regard to the manufacture of rails and steel sleepers at Lithgow is correct, there is no reason why we should treat steel sleepers differently from steel rails. The Minister has not shown any essential difference between the two. If he can explain the difference, I am perfectly open to conviction ; but it was agreed to include steel sleepers in this item, because it was recognised that they had been left out by ah oversight on the part of the Government. That mistake was rectified without a division. Unless the Government can show why the two things should be separated, I shall vote for pressing the request. </para>

                        <para>. - There is a . difference between steel sleepers and steel rails. The New South Wales Government gives enormous contracts to the Lithgow ironworks for rails. The generous aid of the State Government in that direction may be regarded to some extent as a bounty to the industry ; but the Government use wooden sleepers with those rails. If they used steel sleepers, there would be no reason for the distinction, but as wooden sleepers are used, there is but a limited market for steel sleepers. </para>

                    <para>- I am in favour of the higher duty on steel sleepers. As one of the representatives of Queensland, a State largely interested in the supply of steel sleepers, I consider that an increase of that duty is best even from the Queensland point of view. A  duty to be of any use to an infant industry must be effective. Otherwise, it is merely a revenue duty. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> pointed out, steel sleepers are used to an enormous extent in the sugar&#39; industry. Those engaged in that industry in Queensland have received a fairly generous measure of protection from this Parliament, and should not grudge an equally generous measure of protection to other industries. </para>

Even from, the point of view of the sugar-growers of Queensland, who are by far the largest users of steel sleepers; in the Commonwealth, it is wise to impose an effective, and not a mere revenue duty on those articles. </para>

                        <para>- If I had my way, I would put an effective duty on rails also. The Vice-President of the Executive Council gave a very good reason for the distinction, because the New South Wales Government are largely assisting the iron industry in that State by giving contracts for rails, but cannot give contracts for steel sleepers, as they do not use them. If the manufacture of steel sleepers is to be carried on successfully side by side with the manufacture of steel rails, it will be .necessary for this Parliament to give increased protection on sleepers.- The sugar-growers of Queensland may have to approach this Parliament in the future with a request for increased protection, and they will make a poor show if it is proved that they sought to have all the things that they use subjected to low duties, while demanding high duties on their own products. If the increased duty is imposed, the users of steel sleepers may for a little while have to pay an increased price for them, but when the industry is established, they will probably get them at a cheaper rate than is possible at present. </para>

                    <para>. - -According to the proposal of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, steel rails are to be dutiable at 15 per cent., while steel sleepers will be taxed at 25 per cent. How can that extraordinary anomaly be justified ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has stated that the sugar industry will be principally affected by the duty on steel sleepers,  but the railway from Normanton to Croydon could not have been built without them. In the Northern Territory they are used for the railway from Palmerston to Pine Creek. Owing to the climate or the white ants, or both, wooden sleepers cannot be used in those parts. A large portion of North Queensland will have to be developed by the use of steel sleepers. They will be needed for the opening up of our mineral resources in and around the Gulf, which are now beginning to be developed. They are just as essential to the opening up of Northern Queensland and of the Northern Territory as are steel rails in other parts ot Australia. Why, then, do the Government make this extraordinarily anomalous distinction ? It is another illustration of the fact that honorable senators opposite . look at matters from the provincial view-point of Victoria or South Australia, and are not sufficiently conversant with the difficulties and actual requirements of a large portion of tropical and sub-tropical Australia. If a duty of 15 per cent, on steel rails is suk.cient to satisfy the Lithgow industry, the inference is irresistible that 15 per cent, is a quite sufficient duty on steel sleepers, which are necessary for the development not only of the sugar, but of the mining industry of Queensland and the Northern Territory. I do not think that this proposal would have been presented to the Committee if honorable senators opposite thoroughly understood the difficulties in the way of the development of . Northern Queensland and the Northern Territory. </para>

                        <para>-I therefore suggest that we should take the only true and proper course to obtain cheap railway material, and that is to abolish the duties altogether. From the North of Queensland to the South of Tasmania, and from New South Wales to Western Australia, the railways already constructed are great, and those yet to be built will be still greater. It is very desirable that we should be able to construct our railways at as low a cost as&#39; possible. I find from the Customs returns that duty to the extent of &#163;40,000 or &#163;50,000 was paid in the year 1906 on imports of these steel goods. No member of the Committee can fail to recognise that the admission of all the articles included in this item duty free would tend to cheapen the construction of railways, nor can any honorable senator contradict my statement that cheap railways are desirable in the interests of every industry carried on in. the Commonwealth. I do not care whether it be the mining, pastoral, manufacturing, dairying or farming industry, all will be benefited by the cheap construction of railways. </para>

                    (New South Wales) &#91;9.20&#93;. - A good deal has been said about the necessity for steel sleepers in Queensland. There is another part of Australia which has not been mentioned, but which is fairly large. I know that I did not see very much of it in the course of three weeks. I think it is known as Western Australia. If any member of the Committee will go there, and look about him, as I did, he will discover that even in connexion with the 18-inch or 2 -feet gauge tramways connecting jetties, many of which  are over a mile in length, with the neighbouring ports, steel sleepers are used because of the ravages of the white ant in that State. I mention Western Australia because I think that State has been somewhat overlooked in this discussion. Steel sleepers are required there quite, as much as in Queensland, and are used there as largely.

Owing to the ravages of white ants it is found necessary in some parts of the Commonwealth to renew wooden sleepers almost every month. In referring to the tramways used in connexion with the sugar industry, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> omitted to mention that two duties must be collected on railway material imported for that industry. The sleepers and rails are imported joined together, and, as a consequence, the Customs authorities would have to collect two different duties on the one article. </para>

                        <para>- I am not referring to the Croydon line, but to tramways used on sugar plantations. There must be at least 1,000 miles of these portable tramways in use in Northern Queensland. We should deal with this question from the point of view of the interests of the Commonwealth as a whole. I know that in Victoria and Tasmania wooden sleepers will last for years, whereas in North Queensland - and no one knows the fact better than does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> - wooden sleepers cannot be protected from the ravages of white ants. This greatly increases the cost of maintenance of railways laid on wooden sleepers in that part of the Commonwealth. The Queensland Government are extending railway  construction in that portion of the State, and if honorable senators insist upon imposing twice as high a duty on steel sleepers as on. steel rails it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the object is to penalize a particular part of the Commonwealth. I do not see why we should penalize the other States simply to suit an industry in New South Wales. There are thousands of people making a living in the . primary industries in Queensland who will be penalized bv the imposition of this duty. All through the consideration- of this Tariff it has. teen a case of grab on the part of a State which has been chiefly interested in an item ; it has been a game of grab all round, and in every instance the far distant States have been left out in the cold. . We were not sent here to foster an industry in any State at the expense of the State that we were returned to represent. I do not think that that is our duty. 1 was sent here to see that the State which returned <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> got a fair deal. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot understand how honorable senators can support the imposition of a duty on steel sleepers, because it is a tax on a primary industry. It will seriously affect one of the largest primary industries that we have in Queensland, and one which we all hope will grow. At the present time hundreds of men are out of &#34;work, and if the sugar industry is blocked, it will prevent those men from getting employment as the mining industry is failing to a large extent. There is a number of men who have made a small sum in mining, and&#39; who are investing it in sugar land. Although those men are trying to open up the country, yet it is deliberately proposed to increase the duties on steel sleepers from 15 and 10 to 25 and 20 per cent. The only argument held out is that as the Governments of various countries are able to use wooden sleepers, we must impose a duty in order to assist the Lithgow iron -works to make steel sleepers. I cannot see why honorable senators on the other side should vote to penalize a great industry. If the proposition affected their own States, they would not listen to it for a moment. I hold that belief very strongly, because throughout the consideration of the Tariff, the desire has been to bolster up the industries of one or. two States. I have no hope of inducing the Committee to adhere to its request. I understand that the numbers are already up, and that the Government will carry their point. </para>

He pointed out that he is in favour of the same duty being levied on steel sleepers as on steel rails. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> pointed out a very good reason why a higher duty ought to be put on steel sleepers. It is a reason which appeals to me, at any rate, and I cannot understand how any honorable senator can favour a duty which is merely a revenue duty, and will not encourage the establishment of the industry. Every one knows that, no matter how extensive the use of steel sleepers may be, there is only a sufficient quantity used to keep one decently-equipped factory going to supply the demand. If we allow foreign sleepers to be dumped in Australia, any local factory will be wiped out of existence, because there will not be enough work to keep it employed. If we intend to have a duty, by all means let us have an effective one. and that is one of the reasons why I shall vote for a higher duty. With regard to its effect on a primary industry in Queensland - one which I and other representatives Of the State sitting on this side are as deeply interested in as is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers,</inline> and which, with all respect to him, we have done quite as much to foster and help, because if he had had his way it would have been a black-labour industry to-day, and would not have received a farthing of protection- </para>

There was not a single Labour man or protectionist in this Parliament who did not freely vote that protection to it. But what has been the attitude of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> since he came here? He has voted freetrade for every other State and the highest possible protection for any industry in Queensland. Yet he has the effrontery to come here and charge the representatives of other States with being engaged in a game of grab. As a matter of fact, even on scientific glassware, because there was one firm engaged in the industry in Brisbane, he voted the highest protection. </para>

We are sent here to legislate, not for one State, but for all Australia. While looking after and safeguarding the interests of our own State, our primary view should be to protect and foster every industry throughout the Commonwealth. That is the surest method by which Ave can advance the interests of the State we represent. The more industries we create, and the more employment we give, the more people there will be in Australia to consume our sugar. As we are almost within measurable distance of having overtaken the consumption, it behoves us to look round and to see that&#39; we do everything possible to increase profitable employment, so that Australia may carry a much larger population, and be in a position to consume a larger quantity of sugar. </para>

                    (Victoria) &#91;9.40I. - As a Victorian I have never felt myself to be limited to looking after the interests of that State. I was elected to legislate for Australia. That spirit has actuated every vote that I have given, and will control my vote on this occasion.. I believe that the duty which we are now discussing will lead to the development of an important industry. Although the steel industry happens to be located in New South Wales, it will benefit people in the remotest parts of the Commonwealth. When
                    <inline font-weight="bold">&#39;Senator Pulsford</inline>
                    made a remark to the effect that we ought to make railway building cheap, I cheered him. America has had a duty on steel rails and other forms of steel production for very many years. Since the duties were imposed the American people have obtained steel products made in America cheaper than was the case before the duties were imposed.

                        <para>- I have read this extract to show that while the Americans were obtaining steel rails from abroad, and while they had no duty in their own country, they paid high prices. But the imposition of a duty led to the production of steel rails locally, gave employment to their own people, and brought about low prices. That is why I cheered <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> when he said that we want to make railway building cheap. I agree with him. Nothing is so important to the people of this or any other country as that their means of interchange should be many and easily accessible. Especially is that the case in this country where we have no great rivers. To make railways cheap, the appurtenances should be obtainable as cheaply as possible. The way to get them cheaply is to secure that they shall be made locally. I contend that the effect of this duty will be to promote local production, and a reduction in price. We cannot be blocked when we want to build a railway because of war in any part of the world. We can make at Lithgow, or elsewhere, steel sleepers and rails cheaper than they can be obtained from abroad, although they may be made elsewhere by ill-paid labour. All experience teaches us that. We are not thinking oi&#34; Victoria or New South Wales, but of Australia, when we determine that the greatest possible facilities for making steel rails arid steel sleepers shall be afforded in our own country. </para>

We inserted a duty on locks, contingent on its being accompanied by the declaration that the duty should be inoperative until both Houses of Parliament, by a joint address, had affirmed that the time had arrived to make lock-making a protected industry. The other House have accepted the higher duties, but have struck out. the words postponing its operation. But if these words be struck out we &#34;ought to go back to the Tariff as it stood before our request was made&#39;, when the duty was 5 per cent, under the general Tariff, and locks from the United Kingdom were free. Otherwise, the assent of the Senate will have been obtained to this proposal under politically false pretences. </para>

                <para class="block">That will give another place the choice of the higher duties plus the proclamation, or the lower duties without the proclamation. Although some excellent samples of locks were shown here, they were of a limited range. They did not represent  one per cent, of the kind of locks used in Australia. They were padlocks of a very high class of workmanship, but not the locks that every householder requires at : some time or other. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> himself frankly stated that although he spoke on behalf of the Tasmanian lock-maker, he did not venture to ask for the immediate imposition of a duty. All he asked was the assurance that if the industry gave some promise of developing into the great business of lock-making, Parliament would extend protection to it.I ask the Committee to hesitate before it penalizes almost every individual in the community for an industry which it was admitted at the time had not shown any great development, and was not likely to develop for some time to come in certain branches. </para>

                        <para>- The . honorable senator himself has been very consistent in voting for proposals of that kind. The alternative is to place a high duty upon the thousand and one varieties of locks used in Australia., merely because one man in Tasmania happens to be making- one or two special kinds. Our previous request was absolutely fair to every one. It held the balance evenly between all those who use locks and the one man who felt inclined to enter into the industry It gave him an assurance that as soon as he could start the industry, Parliament would give him protection, but that, in the meantime, Parliament declined to tax every householder and every builder and contractor in the community on the off-chance that the industry might be developed. </para>

By some means, these items became separated, and on the last occasion, I invited the Committee to bring the duties on the two into line. That was done. This industry is essentially an Australian industry.

                        <para>- That may be true, if the honorable senator means that they are used by the same industry or by the same people. But they are quite distinct. Many droppers are used in connexion with wooden fences, subdividing the various panels. A standard or pillar is quite different. It takes the place of the post, and is inserted in the ground. It is a much heavier, more substantial, and more costly article. Many eloquent arguments were addressed to the Committee by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> and others when it was proposed to put a duty on something which touched the great primary industry of &#39; mining. Here is a duty which touches the equally, and I venture to say more, important primary industries of farming and grazing.. In every State, with the exception, perhaps, of Tasmania, there are areas of country in which the use of wooden standards is out of the question ; and where it is necessary, &#39;as the land is opened up and settled, to use iron standards instead of the ordinary wooden posts. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly. I appeal to honorable senators who have consistently voted for the reduction of duties on mining appliances, in the belief that the duties would increase their price, to extend the same consideration to the small farmer or settler, or it may be the big one, who is doing his best to utilize the waste lands of Australia, and is entitled to every possible encouragement. . This consideration will be extended if there is any sincerity at all in the cry of those who ask for close settlement. </para>

                    <para>.- Honorable senators will recollect that when this item was dealt with previously there was some doubt as to the particular class of wheel that was made here. I promised that before the item was again considered in the House of Representatives further inquiry would be made. We requested an amendment increasing the size of steel and steel-rimmed wheels from 18 to 30 inches diameter in the tread. The result of the inquiry is embodied in the modification of our request made in another place, and that modification &#39; was unanimously approved of there. The item covers steel and steel-rimmed wheels, and the House of Representatives, in dealing with the Senate&#39;s request, did not accept it in the form suggested, but have suggested that it should be put in this form - </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> will not press his amendment, because if we allow the item to go with the modification proposed by the House of Representatives we shall accomplish all that we desired when we dealt with the matter previously. Our endeavour was to make steel and steel rimmed wheels up to 30 inches diameter in the tread bear a fairly protective duty, because we knew that they were being made in the Commonwealth. We accomplished that desire. When our request was dealt with in another place, our action was confirmed by making wheels over 30 inches diameter in the tread, which it was ascertained are not made in Australia, dutiable at 5 per cent. under the general Tariff, and free if imported from the United Kingdom. A further modification was made in connexion with steel rimmed wheels. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens&#39;</inline> amendment is carried, the whole thing will again be left open, and when the request is returned to the House of Representatives honorable members might be in a different temper, and as a result we might lose the protection we have secured on wheels up to 30 inches diameter in the tread. Evens the most bitter opponents of any preference ought, I think, be satisfied with what has been done. I hope that the honorable senator will withdraw his amendment. </para>

Surely there would be enough business to go on with on that day. I did not like what has been done; but, as the example has been set, we might as well continue the mischief until the end.
