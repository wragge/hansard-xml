                            that there was an absolute want of ammunition waggons for the field artillery.

                        <para>- I do not think that there is any contradiction between the statements. It is simply a misunderstanding as to exactly what is referred to. What originated this discussion was a statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly</inline> that in Australia there was not a single battery of artillery supplied with ammunition waggons. The Honorary Minister in another place said that there were no ammunition waggons for the infantry. In referring to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly's</inline> statement, I said that it was incorrect that a number of the field batteries had been supplied with ' these waggons, that under a local contract the waggons were still being supplied, but that I was not in a position to say whether there would be sufficient to supply the whole of the field artillery when that contract expired. The position is that a firm in Melbourne obtained from the Department a contract to supply field artillery ammunition waggons. It has already furnished a sufficient number to supply some of the batteries. As I did not know that this inquiry was to be made to-day I am not in a position to say how many batteries it has supplied, nor am I able to say whether the contract is sufficient to supply the whole of the field batteries ; but I do know that it is for a considerable number. The statement that there are no ammunition waggons for the infantry is perfectly correct. There are no ammunition waggons, nor is there in existence any contract to supply them. </para>

I know a case where a man who had expected to land a machine for about £200, suddenly found that it would cost him about £230. I desire to know whether the Minister will consult with his colleague to see whether it is not possible, before removing tools of trade from one list to the other, to give a little notice of the intention, so that importers may be prepared ? </para>

                        <para>It is the rule to remove from the Exempt List any Machine Tools which we may find are commercially manufactured in Australia. Whilst it is desired to avoid any case of individual hardship when this action is taken, it is difficult to arrange for any definite notice, since the lapse of time may be availed of to defeat the purpose we have in view. A similar difficulty arises in the case of all Tariff alterations which, perhaps, may be to the disadvantage at times of the individual, hut are, nevertheless for the general benefit of our industries. </para>

                            <para>- Arising out of that reply, it is very natural for one to ask how bounties have been paid at all in small sums, seeing that the Act prescribes a minimum of  5  tons, and that the smallest payment should be  £20?  TheMinister has quoted a payment of10s.  3d.  in one case. In view of the considerable sums which have been paid, is it not evident to him that this variation of the conditions could not take place without a great deal of inconvenience to the firms concerned ? </para>

This document was laid upon the table in the House of Representatives last night, and it was there ordered to be printed. Consequently, it is not necessary to make a similar order in the Senate. I may add that the document was not received by me until late last night, when it was impossible for honorable senators to use it. </para>

The reference in the message to  a.  ruling by the  President  of the Senate alludes to a ruling given by me from the chair in October,  1907,  when a question arose as to the powers  of  the Senate. </para>

                <para class="block">At this late period  of  the session it is not desirable that a long speech should be made in submitting this Bill for the consideration  of  the Senate. It has been for a long time suspected by members in both Houses  of  the Federal Parliament, and by citizens in every part  of  Australia, that evasions  of  the Immigration Restriction Act have taken place. It is with a view to still further prevent the influx  of  undesirable immigrants that it has been deemed necessary that this Bill should be introduced. Honorable senators are aware that up to the present time  39  stowaways have been discovered,  20 of  whom were  on  board one vessel, the <inline font-style="italic">Eastern.</inline> But in the opinion  of  a great many people, those  39  are but a small  proportion of  the Chinese stowaways who have made their way into Australia.  In  a question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft</inline> this morning, allusion was made to statistics, showing that in Western Australia alone, if the figures can be verified, over  400  persons who might rightly be deemed to be prohibited immigrants have come into Australia. As there are similar facilities for stowaways to enter other parts of the Commonwealth, we may form an idea of the numbers of these people who make their way into this country in an improper manner. The legislation already enacted  by  Parliament has been effective in many directions, but, after considerable experience, it has been found that evasions have occurred. Of course, if a prohibited immigrant is found on board a ship, and it can be proved he was brought here, the captain can be fined. But the punishment already specified is not deemed sufficient to deter shipmasters and others from conniving at the introduction of prohibited immigrants under the guise of stowaways. This Bill is a very short measure, amending the existing Act. It comprises three clauses. As in the case of many other pieces of legislation, the effective part is the last clause. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator would probably hang the man before he committed the murder. But that is beside the question. If we consider the number of stowaways who have been discovered, particularly on the <inline font-style="italic">Eastern,</inline> we must admit that this amendment of the law is necessary. It must be acknowledged that a number of men could not be hidden in a vessel, and supplied with food and water for four weeks, without the connivance of some one on board. We must come to the conclusion that the officers or some one else on the vessel have been aware of the presence of these stowaways. Under the existing Act, the master of a vessel is liable to a certain penalty if stowaways, when they are landed, are found to be prohibited immigrants. But we require some more effective provision, and in this Bill the master, owner, agent, and even the charterer of die vessel are made equally responsible for the introduction of prohibited immigrants as stowaways. It has been quite an easy matter for a prohibited immigrant, having the means, to make an arrangement with a master of a vessel to cover all the risks he would run; but under this Bill all the persons connected with the vessel, to whom I have just referred, are made' responsible, and could be punished if a stowaway were found on board. This, and the penalty provided, must lead to very much greater care on the part of all concerned to prevent the introduction of prohibited immigrants as stowaways. Very wild things have been suggested in this connexion. It has been said, for instance, that if a stowaway were discovered on a vessel, the master might be so cruel and unprincipled that, rather than run the risk of landing him, he would throw him overboard  j  would maroon him on some island, where he would very likely die for lack of food and water, or would fumigate his vessel in such a way that every living thing in the holds would be suffocated. 'But honorable senators will see that under this Bill the master is given an opportunity to protect himself against the consequences of carrying stowaways ; because, if any are discovered, the master may relieve himself of liability to the heavy penalties imposed under the Bill if, when he gets into Australian waters, he communicates at once with the officer whose duty it is to prevent the landing of prohibited immigrants. Machinery is, of course, required to give effect to the provisions to which T have referred, and it is provided in this Bill in a very simple manner. Power is given to the Government officer to search and to detain a vessel, and penalties are to be imposed upon the master or any one connected with a ship who attempts the removal of the vessel without authority. The proposed new section  9D  contains a definition of a stowaway. The provisions of this Bill, if adopted, will enable the policy of the Commonwealth in the restriction of undesirable immigrants to be carried .out more effectively than has been possible in the past. I admit that amendments might be suggested which would make the Bill even more effective than it is to prevent the traffic in stowaways, which it is clear has been carried on ; but I hope that no attempt will be made to overload it by the introduction of amendments which might endanger its passage through Parliament at this late stage of the session. </para>

                    <para>. - I anticipate that this measure will have a smooth, and, I trust, a rapid, passage through the Senate. It is merely complementary to what is the accepted policy of the Commonwealth. We have, if I may use a simile, erected a fence around Australia for the purpose of keeping out undesirable aliens. It has been discovered that there are one or two gaps in the fence, and it is the purpose of this Bill to stop up those gaps. I have every reason to believe that undesirable immigrants are finding their way into Australia despite the existing law, and that being the case, I desire to do nothing more than express my entire approval of what is sought to be done by this Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> judging by an interjection which he made, appears to believe that its provisions are scarcely drastic enough. But I take it that the Customs authorities, who have had the administration of the existing law, must have gained experience, the result of which is presumably represented in this Bill. I suppose very few honorable senators are able to say exactly what provisions are required to give complete effect to the principles of the Alien Immigration Restriction Act, but those intrusted with its administration have decided that the provisions of this Bill offer a, guarantee of success sufficient to justify Parliament in passing it. If later on it is found that there are still one or two gaps in the fence, I have not the slightest doubt that whatever Government is in power, they will feel it incumbent upon them to submit a measure asking for further power. This Bill is intended to put an end to what I am afraid has developed into something like a traffic. I took the trouble to make inquiries from mercantile and shipping people, and I found they were not at all disposed to deny the existence of the traffic in stowaways. </para>

                        <para>- I put it in that way because, although it might have been expected that shipping people having relations with the eastern trade would discount the statements made in this connexion, I found that on the contrary they led me to believe that a traffic of some magnitude does exist. That being the case, it seems to me desirable that we should pass the:&gt; measure at once rather than wait for the introduction of what might be a more effective measure next session. lt is possible that the proposed new section  9D  will require some little attention in Committee, but, with that exception, I am prepared to assist in the passage of the Bill in its present form. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not intend to oppose the passing of this Bill. Circumstances which, have recently occurred have made it imperative that the Government should give close attention to the question, and should seek to amend the existing law. Yesterday I stated that no less than four years ago L had received from what I believed to be an unimpeachable source information that a traffic in stowaways was going on, and that it was comparatively easy for Chinese and Japanese to find their way into this country. That information was communicated to the Department of External Affairs. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> said that the information was sent to the wrong Department, but the fact remains that official attention was called to the matter, and the statement made to me appears to have been confirmed by what has since been brought to light. We require some information from the Government as to the inquiries which were made after the disclosure of which I have referred. We ought to know whether any steps were taken by way of inquiries in Chinese ports to ascertain whether a traffic in stowaways was going on. That is where the business begins. The Vice-President of the Executive Council in replying to the debate on the second reading of this Bill, might say whether the Department has received any information on the subject from Chinese ports, and especially from Hong Kong, Kowlung, and Shanghai, which may be said to be the head-quarters of this traffic. There are conflicting statements on the subject, and some persons who are competent to pass an opinion say that we have no reason to be alarmed, in view of the supervision exercised in the Chinese ports and at this end. But it is peculiar that thirty-six stowaways should come here in a vessel under the extraordinary circumstances which have been mentioned, and that I should have been assured in more than one quarter in Queensland that an illicit traffic in stowaways has been going on, and that means are at the disposal of a certain class of persons in that State, if they desire to take advantage of them, to secure all the Asiatic or Chinese labour they require. I feel that we are being asked to pass this Bill with insufficient information, and I think that if it were not for the imminent danger of the traffic with which it is intended to deal,, the Senate would scarcely pass such a measure without further assurances. If the Government have not in the past made inquiries at Chinese ports, they must be blamed <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> some extent for the alleged failure or partial failure of the Immigration Restriction Act. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that it would, because I look upon the Bill as likely to be about as much use as a fly-blister on a wooden leg. The whole of its provisions are to be found in the Immigration Restriction Act. In that Act the words " a person " . are used, whereas in the present Bill the term " a stowaway " is employed, notwithstanding that a " stowaway " is a " person." In my opinion, the leakage which undoubtedly exists is. due to the fact that because the Customs Department derives no revenue from the discovery of stowaways it exercises practically no supervision in this direction. In regard to the importation of opium, the same remark is applicable. Because Parliament has imposed a-prohibition upon opium, the Department is indifferent as to whether or not that drug is introduced. Had a heavy duty been levied upon it, the Department would have taken up an entirely different attitude. I might further point out that under the Tariff a duty is imposed upon timber. But the Customs authorities declare that it is so small that it does not pay them to exercise supervision over the landing of timber cargoes, and consequently they accept the consignee's statements regarding them. As a result. large discrepancies have been disclosed </para>

                        <para>- It was merely a clerical error in South Australia which resulted in the Department being defrauded of£60,000. Had we imposed a poll tax upon every undesirable immigrant entering the Commonwealth, the Customs officers would have been very careful to collect it. But at present we practically hand over to them the policing ot  8,000  miles of our coast-line, notwithstanding that there is no revenue collected from undesirable aliens entering the Commonwealth. The Department of External Affairs has no officer under its direct supervision whom it can employ for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of the Immigration Restriction Act. As a result, that duty devolves upon the Customs authorities, who virtually say, " What is the use of our undertaking the administration of the Act when there is no revenue to be derived from it?" </para>

                    <para>. - This Government, and every other Government, will be compelled to carry out the law. Whatever views we may entertain upon the subject of the exclusion of undesirable aliens, I think that we all desire to see the law effectively administered. At the same time, I am bound to express my regret that a measure dealing with interests so grave as those dealt with in this Bill should have been brought forward in the dying hours of the session. I contend that it ought not to have been submitted until the shipping companies, and all interested in the matter, had been afforded an opportunity of expressing their views upon it. Certain of its provisions I regard as very drastic. I am not quite sure that under existing legislation, the Government do not possess the power to proceed much further than they have hitherto done. Under the Immigration Restriction Act of  1901  they are empowered to frame regulations under which I apprehend they could have succeeded in remedying the evil which now appears to exist, though, to my mind, it is extremely probable that it has been grossly exaggerated. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> stated that thirty-nine stowaways had recently been discovered upon certain vessels. Can the Minister inform me over how long a period those discoveries have extended? It is alleged that there has been an increase of  400  in the number of Chinese in Western Australia. But that statement has not been authenticated. Honorable senators must recognise that when we attempt to deal with shipping we are touching upon questions of international law. The great majority of the vessels which visit our ports are of British or foreign origin. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators  win  see that it is really a very serious matter for the Government to ask Parliament to enact that any officer may detain a vessel in any port. I thought that, perhaps, in the Customs Act the term " any officer " might be limited to an officer having written authority in connexion with his work ; but I find that it is not. In this Bill there is this wide provision, that any officer of the Customs may detain any vessel ; it may be a Peninsular and Oriental boat, or an Orient boat, or a vessel from China. Any one officer of the Customs who might be informed, rightly or wrongly, of the presence of a stowaway, might interfere with the movements of a mail boat. Is not that carrying things a little too far? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is mistaken. A ship which is going from one port to another in the Commonwealth can be dealt with in any port, without being detained; but in this Bill the Government are taking power to detain a vessel, which I say is not reasonable. It may involve the Commonwealth in trouble with other countries. I am not at all sure that the British Government, or its representative, might not feel that the Bill is one which should be referred to the Colonial Office, before it can be dealt with finally. </para>

                    <para>. - The situation is so serious that we are quite justified in dealing with a Bill of this kind, even in the eleventh hour of the session. I am not very familiar with the north-east coast of Australia, although I have been as far as Cape York; but I am sufficiently familiar with the north-west coast to know that the means of getting into the Commonwealth are so easy that we must amend the law if we desire to exclude undesirable Asiatics. Many of the people living at the small ports on the north-west coast, more particularly at Broome, are interested in the pearling industry. Having lived in India for a considerable number of years, and imbibed the opinions of men living in Oriental countries, they seem to entertain a supreme contempt for any white man who has to earn his living by means of heavy or laborious work. They think that the white man should be " boss " of the coloured man, and consequently they look upon Asiatic immigration quite differently from the average Australian. They own a very large fleet of vessels operating all over the pearling grounds, and I think that if they could assist an influx of Asiatics, they would not be at all backward in doing so. The feeling amongst these Anglo-Indians at Broome is so strong that they can scarcely tolerate a white working man. With that sentiment prevailing at the ports, where there is the greatest probability of Asiatics landing, we need a much stricter law than we have. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I agree with a great deal of what the honorable senator said.  When he and I were in Western Australia there was brought under the notice of the Navigation Commission at Fremantle an instance of the evasion of the law by the line of steamers plying between Fremantle and Singapore. The same ideas regarding Asiatics prevail at Fremantle as at Broome, as a large trade is carried on from each port with Singapore. The persons who are engaged in that trade do not see any harm in assisting the introduction of Asiatics. Unless we amend our law and see that it is administered strictly, we might as well have no law. I suggest to the Government that if an officer were placed on board an incoming foreign vessel at her first port of call on the north-west coast - Derby; or Broome - and kept on board until he was leaving her last port of call in Australia, he would have an opportunity to get familiar with everything which was going on.  1  think that it would be found to be a most effectual way of checking the Asiatics who are now coming in from Singapore. </para>

                        <para>- That is an absolute necessity. A good rummage of the vessel is an admirable method ; but if what we hear as to the amount of stench and filth in which an Asiatic can live, be true, perhaps the strongest fumigation might not be found to be adequate. We are asked to believe that twenty of the Chinese who were attempted to be smuggled in the other day bv the <inline font-style="italic">Eastern</inline> had lived in a little hole for about ten days. How they were able to exist there I cannot explain. </para>

                        <para>- No; it is not quite fair. Unless we have a much stricter law, -the Chinese cannot be controlle'd. Up to the present time it has apparently been the opinion of honorable senators on the other side that it has only been in the interests of coloured labour that this kind of legislation has been passed. But in Western Australia events have recently transpired which put a somewhat different complexion on the matter. Take the districts where the fire timber for the gold-fields is obtained. That industry is pretty much in the hands of a peculiar foreign element, and it is quite evident that many of them, although they are Europeans, are very undesirable persons to have in this country. Recently we had the greatest possible difficulty in getting them to comply with our industrial laws. They set every law at defiance. </para>

                        <para>- No. But I think that time will prove them to be even more dangerous to us than Chinese. The employers and the Government had to appeal to the labour unions to help them to maintain order and carry on the industries of the country. I mention that incident to show that it is not only the workers who will benefit from the exclusion of undesirable people. If our ideals of civilization are to be maintained, we must be very careful as regards Europeans as well as Asiatics who wish to enter Australia. I feel quite sure that none of us desires to see a big importation of undesirable persons and a foreign colony established in Australia such as we have heard of in the United States, where a state of chaos and anarchy often prevails. In Western Australia we had a taste of this sort of thing recently, and therefore I contend it is time that we amended our Immigration Restriction Act in a radical way. I regard this measure as only a temporary one, but at this stage of the session we could not possibly deal comprehensively with this important question in all its aspects. I regard the present measure as one which is necessary, and it can, at any rate, be dealt with in the time at our disposal. </para>

                    <para>. - The policy of this country being to maintain a White Australia, and particularly to keep out undesirable immigrants, it is quite right and proper that the law on the subject should be improved and made effective. I believe that this Bill, if passed, will result in a scare. At the same time it will do no harm, and it will enable us to more effectually enforce what we have been insisting upon. It gives power to detain ships for one reason and another, and imposes severe penalties. It is necessary that some such provision as proposed new section  od  should be included. It is very difficult for Europeans to recognise one Chinaman from another, they are so much alike. The Customs officers are often extremely puzzled to know whether a particular Chinaman is identical with one who has been previously in the country or not. Chinamen on board ships mix with the crew, and it is extremely difficult for ships' officers to know whether one of them is a stowaway or a member of the crew. Consequently, it would be unjust to make a captain responsible for every person aboard his ship. The stowaways who have come to Australia have been helped, not by the officers of ships, but by the crews. ' The Chinese help each other. Therefore, I think that the provision to which I have referred affords a safeguard enabling justice to be done, and the law to be carried out without injury to innocent persons. </para>

                        <para>- It is quite possible. The stowaways could easily come out of their hiding places two or three at a time, and mix with the Chinese members of the crew, without being noticed. We know how ingenious sailors are in finding hiding places aboard ship. They help one Another. Some time ago some men were found in the air shoots of a vessel only 2 feet square. </para>

                    <para>. - I shall support this Bill, and in doing so am simply following a course which I have pursued for many years past in connexion with such matters as the unauthorized immigration of coloured aliens. The suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> that the Bill would not do any particular harm conveys also the contrary idea that it will not do much good. But I point out the attitude of the Senate towards the Bill. At the present time those who are accused of being the advocates of black labour in every shape and form are in attendance and keeping a House for the Government, whilst there is a beggarly array of empty benches opposite in the places usually occupied by those enthusiastic patriots who are always proclaiming that they are the fervent champions of white labour as against black. In no hostile sense, I direct the attention of the Government to the fact that the real question at issue is not going to be settled by means of this Bill. When I was last up in the north, I made inquiries amongst officers in connexion with the steamers trading with Manilla and Singapore. I learnt that up to about 1904 there was a constant stream of junks, feluccas, and other such vessels passing between the northern part of Australia, east of Port Darwin, and the Malay Archipelago. In 1904, or thereabouts, consequent upon the attention directed to the danger by those supposed to desire the introduction of coloured labour to Queensland, the Government arranged that a certain amount of patrol work should be done with regard to such vessels. When I was in the Northern Territory last year, I found that, from the date mentioned, this constant intercourse between the Malay Archipelago and Australia had ceased to be directed to the cast of Port Darwin, and was now carried west of Port Darwin. An officer told me that only a few weeks before, coming across from Manilla, he saw quite a large number of these feluccas making for the north-west portion of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I am not saying that it is not well to stop a small leak, but I believe the matter under consideration to be comparatively unimportant. I warn the Government that they must not sit down on their haunches, as Commonwealth Governments have done for years past, refusing to listen to those who have warned them, and saying that the importation of coloured aliens does not and cannot happen ; that the blacks in the north of Australia are so savage that they would keep out the Chinese, and all that sort of nonsense. The Government should remember that there is an immense danger of coloured aliens entering Australia at points where we imagine that they would not think for a single moment of coming in. I will give the Senate an interesting little bit of history affecting this subject. In the early part of 1904 the managers of a number of the sugar mills in Queensland were circularised by a firm which proposed to place at their disposal 5,000 Chinese coolies for the purpose of working in the mills. Certain conditions were stated, which I need not mention. I stated this fact in Townsville in 1904. Notwithstanding the Immigration Restriction Act, our other laws, and the temper of Australia, this firm actually offered to supply 5,000 Chinese coolies. Do honorable senators believe that a firm of financial standing would make such an offer unless it was satisfied that it could carry out any contract that it made? </para>

                        <para>- It was not a Brisbane or a Melbourne firm, but it was a firm in Australia. I do not know whether the firm was acting as agent for some one else, but the fact remains that this offer was made. It may surprise honorable senators opposite to learn that not one of the people connected with the sugar industry, although they are supposed to be ardent advocates of black labour, accepted the offer. They refused it point blank. If they had accepted it, this firm would either have had to produce the  5,000  Chinese coolies or would have been involved in heavy penalties sufficient to ruin it. I give this illustration to show that there is good ground for my belief that there is a mode of getting these Asiatics into Australia. I have not discovered what that mode is, but since  1904  nothing has been done to prevent Asiatics from coming in. A Bill of this sort deals with a paltry feature of the situation, but does not meet the whole case. We should adopt the measure, but I warn the Government that they must not sit down and think that they have settled the whole question. It is of no use saying to Australia, "We have passed a Bill to stop the Chinese influx," when there is a serious danger of these people coming over in some way or other that we do not at present understand. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope the honorable senator will not persist with his motion. Every opportunity has been given for the consideration of the Bill, and it has been clearly stated that at this stage of the session it is unwise, and would serve no useful purpose, to load the Bill with amendments, which would involve its return to another place for further consideration there. It has been pointed out also that if the Department is to be given any advantage under the proposed legislation., the sooner the Bill becomes law the better. </para>

                    <para>. - The first opportunity I had of seeing the Bill was when I entered the chamber this morning. The amendment B desire to move in clause  3  is not of great importance, but it would remedy an omission in the drafting of the measure. The proposed new section  9d  makes a reference to a "bonâ <inline font-style="italic">fide</inline> passenger." A <inline font-style="italic">bonâ fide</inline> passenger has not been defined, and might cover a person working his passage. I wish to introduce the wor ds " whose name appears on the passenger list." That would provide an absolute safeguard. The Customs officer might find on a ship half-a-dozen Chinamen whose names would not appear on the passenger list or on the articles as members of the crew, and the master might say that he was carrying them as a favour and that they were not passengers or members of the crew. </para>

On going on board a vessel he would say, " There are so many on your passenger list and so many on your crew list." He would count them off and would find a surplus.

                        <para>- If the Act is properly administered. What would happen if these men were landed at Broome instead of at Fremantle. I have it on the authority of a shipmaster trading to Broome that he blew his whistle in that port for four hours before any official came on board. Honorable senators must see the opportunities which would be afforded to prohibited immigrants to get ashore in such circumstances. The administration of the law in remote ports is very lax. The Customs Department say that it does not pay to appoint an officer in some of those ports, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> was quite right when he said that, in order to carry out effectively the provisions of the Immigration Restriction Act, we should require a coastguard service. </para>

                        <para>- In my opinion, if there were no reference to passengers in the proposed section it would not matter, since it is made abundantly clear that whew a vessel approaches Australia the master must tell the authorities what people are on board, and if they are disclosed by one list, or by three, the object of the provision is served. If, in addition to the number disclosed, any one was subsequently found on board the vessel, the master would be liable in respect to that person. That being so, I do not think that the amendment which the honorable senator suggests would have the slightest effect, and if agreed to. it would involve the return of the Bill to another place for further consideration. I should like to take advantage of this opportunity to correct an error into which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> and others have fallen, in the assertion that all the provisions of this Bill are incorporated in the Immigration Restriction Act. The proof that that is not so, is that under this Bill it would have been possible to fine the captain of the <inline font-style="italic">Eastern</inline> in respect to every one of the stowaways on board his vessel. As the law stands, the very fact that they were discovered by the authorities before they could effect a landing, secured the captain from any penalty. Honorable senators will see that if they had been landed without their presence on the vessel being known, no penalty would have attached to the captain, as under the present law a fine could not be imposed unless it was shown that a stowaway had effected a landing, and got away. Under this Bill the captain of a vessel would be liable in respect of any persons found on board whose names were not included in the list  given to the authorities. That is not provided for under the existing law, and it is because the object of this Bill is to remedy what I think is an open invitation to unscrupulous captains to create an illicit traffic that I am glad it is being passed. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. Any one who is acquainted with the smuggling trade knows the dodges that can be resorted to to evade the law. If the master of a vessel finds that he is likely to get off scot free he will put men on any list and will land them. But if he is discovered he will put them on one list or another. If he puts them on the crew list he must take them away again, or he will be liable to a penalty of£100 under the Immigration Restriction Act. Honorable senators may say that it will not matter if the men are not landed. But the master might take the risk of discovery. If, for instance, the discovery had not been made in the case of the <inline font-style="italic">Eastern</inline> the twenty stowaways might have been landed. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. What is the position under the Customs Act? In Sydney it is the practice to allow consignees to make declarations regarding the nature of their goods when they desire to clear, before the actual arrival of these goods. If their invoices be passed without question they are all right. But if the Customs authorities in checking those invoices, discover a mistake, they are afforded a chance of remedying it. In exactly the same way, the master of  a  vessel under this Bill will have a chance of remedying the evil that he has been doing. </para>

Under this Bill, it will be necessary for the Customs Department to secure the services of competent jerquers, in order to insure that cargo which has been removed in the search for stowaways may be replaced in such a way that the seaworthiness of a vessel shall not be endangered. </para>

                    <para>. - I must thank honorable senators for the assistance which they have rendered the Government in passing this Bill so rapidly. In reply to the remarks of Senators Pulsford and Guthrie, I wish to say that every care will be exercised in the replacement of cargo, with a view to insuring the safety of vessels. It will be noted that under its provisions "officer" means an officer appointed under the Act, or a Customs House officer, or a police constable of a State." It is manifest, therefore, that there will be no haphazard method of inspection adopted by reason of the employment of boys. </para>

                    <para>My reason for asking honorable senators to deal with the report of the Standing Orders Committee at this juncture is that some amendments will have to be effected in our Standing Orders before the expiration of the present Parliament. The report has already been in the hands of honorable senators for  a  considerable time, and the alterations which it recommends have been the subject of careful consideration by the Standing Orders Committee. Those alterations involve no matters of principle, and I think that the present occasion affords us a good opportunity to fill in time whilst we are waiting for the return of the Appropriation Bill from the other Chamber. If they are passed, the necessary alterations in our Standing Orders can be made during the recess, so that they may come into operation next session. </para>

                            <para>- Apart from the important proposals of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> which I admit at once are worthy of the fullest possible consideration, as indeed is any proposal which would tend to conserve the time of the Senate, the amendments recommended in the Standing Orders are consequent on the Constitution Alteration (Senate Elections) Act, under which the regular term of a senator is to begin from the  1st  July instead of from the  1st  January. A large number of our standing orders were made strictly applicable to a regular term starting from the latter date, that is, standing orders with regard to the election of officers arid the taking and subscribing of oaths by newly elected senators. Owing to the alteration of the Constitution, it has become necessary to alter those rules. I am quite prepared to go on with the consideration of this business, but, of course, that is a matter entirely in the hands of the Committee. I know that the Minister desires to proceed, and it is advisable that the proposals should be dealt with as early as possible. </para>

At the same time I realize that we have to consider the wishes of honorable senators on the subject. Personally, if the Minister has no objection, I am willing that this business should be allowed to stand over until next session.

                        could be regarded as being strictly relevant to the proposals submitted by the Standing Orders Committee. Again, if we reported progress, and the Order of the Day were called on again, a difficulty would arise, because any instruction to a Committee must be given on the first occasion when the' Order of the Day is called.

                <para>In submitting this motion, I should like to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> and other honorable senators were in error yesterday when they said that the Secretary to the External Affairs Department had received an increment of salary since his appointment to his present position. I am informed that he has received no increment, and I am at a loss to understand how honorable senators could have been led into the error to which I have referred. With respect to the statements which were made regarding the entrance of Asiatic aliens into the northern portion of Queensland, we have reports from the police authorities of those districts dealing with the subject, and extracts from a memorandum referring to an interview with the officer in question when he was in London. At a convenient opportunity I shall ask my honorable colleague to read these reports. We have had a fight upon this question in the Senate, and sent a request to another place. They have not considered it advisable to comply with our request, and, seeing that increases to other officers holding similar positions were granted by the Senate, I suggest that we should be acting a generous part if we agreed now to put the Secretary of the External Affairs Department on the same plane as those other officers. </para>

                        <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> cavils at the word " dispute" I shall call it a difference of opinion, and, in view of the fact that there is a general desire to close the session, I am not prepared to press that difference of opinion any further. Those who oppose the proposed increase of salary to the Secretary of the External Affairs Department stated that they were not satisfied with the method by which we were asked to proceed. A general opinion was expressed that some more satisfactory method of determining the emoluments to be paid to individual officers should be devised, and the debate which has taken place will not be wasted if those charged with the responsibility of considering these matters try to lay down a plan by which in future salaries will be fixed not as the result of accidental votes in Parliament, or Ministerial predilection, but upon, business-like lines, and after due consideration of the services each officer is expected to render to the Commonwealth. In the circumstances, I propose to support the motion submitted by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. </para>

                    <para>. - The attitude assumed by the leader of the Opposition appears to me to be extraordinary. Either the vote which the honorable senator gave yesterday was right and should be persisted in, or it was wrong. The honorable senator has given us no reason to believe that he considered yesterday, or even to-day, that the vote he gave was wrong. I fail, therefore, to see why he should now propose to do the crab action, and slide away backwards from the opinion which he emphasized by his vote yesterday. </para>

                        <para>- So far as honorable senators opposite are concerned it is probable that it was thought sufficient to have a quiet chat with the leader of the Opposition, and that out of loyalty they would be guided by any action he might take. I certainly do not intend to eat the leek in this matter. I hold the same opinion today that I held yesterday, and I propose to give effect to it. I ask why honorable senators who are now in such a violent hurry to run away from the action which they took yesterday, did not exert their influence to induce another place to cave in ? The whole system under which these increases are proposed is, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has admitted, absolutely wrong. I emphasized that view yesterday, and pointed out that while it might be desirable to have these officers under the direct control of the Ministers responsible for the various Departments, there should be no difficulty whatever in the way or getting the Public Service Commissioner to grade them and fix their salaries. When we have Ministers responsible for bringing down increases of salaries, we find that whether an officer really deserves an increase or not, if one Minister proposes an increase for the secretary of his Department, every  other Minister, with a view to standing well with his chief officer, tries to get an increase of salary for him also. That is entirely subversive of the interests of the taxpayer, many of whom have to endure great hardships, and to submit to heavy taxation in order that these handsome emoluments may be paid to public officers. Whilst we have this cool proposal to grant an increase of <inline font-style="italic">£100</inline> a year to a gentleman who is already receiving ,£800 a year, every Government of the Commonwealth, so far, has displayed no alacrity whatever to increase the emoluments of the. poorly paid civil servants. It has been said that that is  entirely  beyond the control of Ministers, and is a matter for the Public Service Commissioner. But in the various Departments temporary hands are frequently employed. I have in my mind a case in which applications have been invited for a temporary hand to fill the responsible position of storeman in a Customs Bond, and in which- notwithstanding that the standard wage paid foi ordinary labourers in that particular district, as is evidenced by the amount that is paid by the municipal authorities and by the Harbor Board, is 9s. per day - the Department are offering only 7s. per day. Yet we can afford to grant increases of <inline font-style="italic">£100</inline> to officials who are already highly paid. I do not think that we should be continually "greasing the fat pig." If any officers in the service are deserving of generous treatment, it is those unfortunates who are temporarily employed by the Departments, and who are in receipt of only 7s. per day. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has asked us to be generous on this occasion. But he has asked us to be generous, not at our own expense, but at the expense of the general taxpayer, and that is a very cheap sort of generosity. The officer whose salary is now under consideration has been in receipt of £800 for several years, and I believe that in the early days of Federation he had quite as much to do as he has now. Eight hundred pounds is a very handsome salary, and that is the net amount which he receives. If he has to incur any expenditure in the discharge of his duties that expenditure is defrayed by the Commonwealth. Yet this Chamber has, apparently, so little regard to its own dignity that it is prepared to back down and eat the leek upon every occasion. </para>

When I am convinced that I am acting wrongly, I shall foe prepared to retrace my steps, but not before. I have been asked whether I cannot see my way to alter my vote of yesterday, in view of the fact that other departmental heads have been granted increases of salary, whilst the Secretary of the Department of External Affairs has not. Now we have either to acknowledge that we did wrong- </para>

Now, simply because we' desire to close the session, and to get away to our homes, we are asked to back down at the bidding of another place. I refuse to do so. We have certain privileges which we must maintain. The dignity of the Senate and its almost unanimous decision should receive some consideration at the hands of members of the other Chamber. I shall be one to vindicate, by my vote, the conclusion at which a large majority of the Committee arrived yesterday. </para>

                        <para>- I was quite willing to vote to reduce the salaries of all the departmental heads by £100. But when the Committee decided to sacrifice only one officer, and to hold all the departmental heads up as emblems of merit,I felt compelled to reconsider my decision. It was only yesterday that it was discovered that the heads of other Departments are worth so much more than is the Secretary of the Department of External Affairs. I decline to subscribe to that dictum, and for that reason I intend to support the proposed increase. </para>

Certainly, a most invidious distinction has been made so far as the Secretary of this Department is concerned. I have had a little experience of that officer, and although it has been  contended that his manner is rather brusque, I do not think that that should be regarded as a shortcoming. </para>

                        <para>- I have heard the statement made in this Chamber. It sometimes happens that members of Parliament ring this officer up on the telephone, and receive perhaps a short or off-handed answer. But we must not forget that in speaking over the telephone we ourselves are not always able to suppress our own feelings any more than is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt. As regards the administration of the Immigration Restriction Act, I have come in personal contact with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunt.</inline> When it was a question of dealing with a Chinaman who had got into Western Australia under false pretences, he administered the law with a rigidity which reflected credit upon him. When an endeavour was made to twist the Act there, this officer, who has been described here in various ways, for instance as a person who is not filling the office competently, stood rigidly by the law, and visited the Chinaman with the punishment he deserved. I hold that on this occasion the Senate is not asked to back down. </para>

                        <para>- I am striving lo address myself to the main reason which has been urged for opposing the motion, namely, that if it is negatived we shall not back down, and in that way, of course, we shall conserve the dignity of the Senate. If there is no sweet reasonableness shown at times, the Houses will be at perpetual war or the Senate will be supreme. What will be the result? The members of the other House will suddenly discover that they have some backbone and some dignity to conserve. If that condition of things were allowed to come about, it would lead to nothing but chaos. I do not intend to provoke a position of that kind, especially in view of the fact that in dealing with the Tariff the Senate was allowed to have very much of its own way. Whilst I recognise a desire on the part of the other House to extend that degree of reasonable consideration to the Senate which is its due, I do not intend, because a requested amendment is not made, to retaliate by saying that the latter must be supreme. </para>

                    <para>. - When this matter was before the Committee yesterday, I gave certain reasons why I intended to vote in favour of maintaining the salary of this officer at £8oo instead of raising it to .£900. Nothing that has been said since has convinced me that those reasons were not perfectly sound. I based my decision, as well as my speech, on clear grounds. I did not discuss the question of whether other officers were worth a salary of ^900 or not. I discussed certain action taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt, and asked whether it was. such that we should show our approval of it by increasing his salary, or show our distaste for it by leaving the salary at the old figure. The Minister of Defence has read to us extracts from a statement by this officer, which purports - -and I use that word in its real sense - to be a reply to what I said last night. The extracts are an absolute admission of the truth of what I said in connexion with the interviewing of this officer in London. The Vice-President of the Executive Council appealed' to us to pass the increased salary because the officer knew how to hold his tongue. I pointed out that I had evidence - which is now practically admitted to be true - to show that he did not. </para>

                        <para>- That part is true, I have not the slightest doubt. But the other part - that the Commonwealth will not encourage tropical agriculture, because it means slave labour - is not true. This is a matter of vital importance. It involves a question of policy regarding, not only Queensland, but the whole of tropical Australia. It plays right into the hands of the Immigration Bureau in London, or the Imperial Government Bureau - which - ought to be ashamed of itself - which said that white men could not go to the north of Australia, and live there. Whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunt</inline> did it on purpose, or whether he did it by mistake, he put for ward a statement which plays right into the hands of people at Home, and which is bound to seriously interrupt and prevent the introduction of permanent white settlers in the north. </para>

As regards whether certain policemen knew that some Chinamen did or did not enter the far northern ports, all those matters are beside the question at issue. It is admitted by the Government that the question of the authorized inspection of coloured aliens is still receiving their attention, and is still a subject of inquiry. </para>

When the matter was brought before the Department previously, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunt</inline> assured others, and also assured me, that I was barking up the wrong tree, and was not correct, as such things had not been done. But two years afterwards, when that point is put before the Chamber, we find that while he denied it to a member of Parliament, who went to his office in an official capacity, he now puts forward a statement to the effect that some policeman in Queensland says that it is not true. It may be another case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Samuel</inline> Mauger and his sergeant. </para>

                    <para>. - I propose to reverse my vote. Although I did not speak on this Question yesterday, I desire to explain why I voted then in one way and propose to vote to-day in another direction. Whenever an Appropriation Bill had been submitted, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has been ever ready, if not to decrease a salary, to prevent any officer from securing an increase. I have always declared here that I would oppose any attempt to decrease the remuneration of any officer. I have also stated that I would oppose any unwarrantable increase in the salaries of highly paid officers. Here was a ca&amp;c of an officer against whom certain charges were whispered, and for the first time today we get them openly made bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway.</inline> It was proposed that the officer should receive an increase of <inline font-style="italic">£100.</inline> I know nothing of his duties. I have met him twice, and then only for a few minutes, during four years. To me he was most courteous, and what he was asked to do, he did. I voted against his salary being increased on the principle that I knew nothing of his position. I had no warrant to say that he deserved an increase of  £100.  Next came an increase for the Parliamentary Draftsman. The efficient way in which he does his work is obvious to any honorable senator, and so I voted for an increase to him. Then came the case of the Secretary to the Home Affairs Department. Who does not know the extra work which  he  was called upon to perform last year, and which he will be called upon to perform for some years to come ? Perhaps he may be relieved when the Federation is working more smoothly. But certainly in thu early years of the Union, this Department needed at its head a man who was capable of performing a vast amount of very important work. I voted for an increase to him. Our request to reduce the salary of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunt</inline> was sent to the other House. The Minister under whom that officer serves is a member of that Chamber. Obviously, its members come more in touch with the External Affairs Department, and with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunt,</inline> than we do. In the other House, I have a number of colleagues who are as anxious for economical and proper administration as I am. With a better knowledge of this matter than I have, they decided that the request of the Senate should not be entertained. I am prepared to be guided by their better knowledge. </para>

The honorable senator, however, is himself not far behind when there is any "stonewalling" t6 be done, especially against the Labour Government. I have sufficiently stated my reasons for changing ray vote. I commenced to vote against increases because I thought that I had warrant for doing so. But in view of the fact that the other House has thought fit not to accede to our request, and that the reductions proposed" in the other salaries were riot agreed to. I shall reverse my vote. </para>

                    <para>. - I shall repeat the vote which I gave last night. I shall do so without imputing motives or weak or false reasons to any other honorable senator who may choose to reverse his vote. We are all entitled to act on second thoughts. But it has been made abundantly clear by what was said yesterday and again to-day, that there has been great weakness in the administration of the Department of External Affairs, in reference to a question which is of vital importance to Australia. It is evident from the criticism that has been directed at the Government from their present supporters, that there had been laxity in administration. The Department of External Affairs was warned in the strongest way that, notwithstanding the efforts professed to be made to keep out alien immigrants, they were entering Australia. That warning was disregarded. The information that I received with regard to the influx of Chinese was explained in detail. It should have been evident to the Department that a stringent scrutiny was necessary. But nothing was done. The Department neglected its duty. The ex-Prime Minister, who was in charge of the Department, could not be expected to attend to all the details personally. It was the duty of the Secretary to bring the facts under the notice of his chief. Yet I find that on a vital point the Secretary neglected the strongest warnings as though they were not more substantial than the breath in which they were uttered. In view of the quarter from which the warnings came it was the duty of this official to give them 'grave consideration. If he did not see fit to take action on his own account, he should have informed the Prime Minister that he had weighed the reasons and considered that there was nothing substantial in the allegations. If the Prime Minister had stated to Parliament that he was of opinion that the statements had no basis, we might have exonerated the Secretary. But nothing of the kind was done. There has recently been strong corroboration of the assertions made by some of us two years ago. The laxity in the administration of the Department on a vital matter of policy is evident ; and, holding this view, I shall persist in my vote for the reduction of the Secretary's salary. </para>

                    <para>. - I trust that I may be permitted to say a word or two with regard to the question under consideration, without being charged with "stone-walling," because the business is under the control of a Labour Government. I am under the impression that I was sent to the Senate to express what I believed to be the opinions of those who elected me. Whether I sit behind a Labour Government or a Conservative Government, or any other Government. I shall not sit like a dumb dog at the instigation of others, who choose to charge me with " stonewalling." So long as I am a member of this Parliament, honorable senators may depend upon it that if I believe it to be mv duty to express my views in connexion with any matter, I shall do so to the best of my ability. I did not speak upon this question yesterday, but I commenced the consideration of the Estimates with a well-defined policy. When I first examined them, I saw that increases of salary to the heads of four Departments were proposed. I said to myself, " Well, I do not think that any of these officers are entitled to the increase." I considered that the officers were fairly well paid at£800 a year. Therefore I determined to vote against the increases. I did so. But I did not pick out one particular salary. I took up a definite line of policy, and as the reductions were proposed, I voted steadily in favour of the requests to that effect. The Committee decided on a reduction in one case, but not in, the other three cases.  1  thereupon expressed a view which seemed, and still seems to me, to be eminently reasonable. I stated that I declined to be a party to victimizing one particular officer, whilst allowing others to get their increases, That is the position which I maintain. I decline to single out one individual, either because he may have a brusque manner when I go into his office for information, or for any other reason. I know very little about the Secretary for External Affairs. I have seen him about twice since I have been a member of this Parliament. But because, perhaps, he does not kow-tow to me sufficiently when I go to see him on a matter of public business, I am not going to record a vote in opposition to the increase of his salary. It is the right thing, from my point of view, to record a vote on personal grounds. I believe in dealing fairly with matters of this description. I have contended all along that the system is wrong under which these increases of salary to permanent Heads are recommended to Parliament, not by the Public Service Commissioner, but by the Minister. But. as I have already said, I decline to show any partiality or favoritism, and when a vote is taken, I am prepared to extend the same consideration to the head of this Department as has been given to others. </para>

                    <para>.- As several honorable senators have given their reasons for reversing the vote given yesterday, I desire to say that I intend to do the same. It was my determination to vote against all the increases to the heads of Departments. . I felt, in common with others, that under present circumstances, in view of the heavy financial responsibilities of the Commonwealth in various directions, and because a considerable army of men in the Public Service are not receiving increased remuneration, the proposed increases to the heads of the four Departments were not justifiable. We began with a motion requesting the House of Representatives to reduce <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt's salary from£900 to£800. Those of us who were anxious for judicious economy received such support from the Opposition, and in an indirect way so much encouragement, that we felt we were on absolutely safe ground, and that no invidious distinctions would be made in the treatment of departmental heads. But to our intense surprise the honorable senators who voted with us for the reduction of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt's salary, voted for the increases proposed to the other officers. </para>

I know of nothing which has occurred since yesterday to induce me to alter my opinion. Honorable members in another place have declined to comply with our request, and the fact that it is possible that by debating the question we shall delay the close of the session for an hour or two does not weigh with me, because, as I have said, my reason for the vote which I gave yesterday is that I believe that for the duties which have to be performed by the Secretary to the External Affairs Department, the salary of£800, attached to the office in the past, is ample remuneration. </para>

                    <para>. - Before the third' reading of the Bill is passed, I wish to refer to a matter which I think merits attention, and that is the fact that we have been asked to pass the Estimates without having the Auditor-General's report in our possession. A curious coincidence occurred this morning. Immediately the Committee of the Senate had dealt with the Estimates, the report of the Auditor-General for the year was tabled. There may be an excellent explanation for the delay, and also for the coincidence. But, as one who has been a considerable time in politics, and who has noticed the frequency with which these convenient coincidences occur, I am inclined to be a little suspicious. We cannot properly review Commonwealth expenditure without the report of the Auditor-General. The Government are supposed not to have anything to do with the Auditor-General. He is an officer of Parliament, entirely independent of the Government, and we have a right to look to him for a careful scrutiny and review of the finances. In every State Parliament of which I know anything honorable members decline to lose their grip of the Estimates until the report of the Auditor-General has been in their hands for a sufficiently long time to enable them -to understand that officer's review of the public finances. I have never known an occasion upon which the Senate has not insisted upon having before it the report of the Auditor-General before the Appropriation Bill was finally passed. The principle involved in that procedure is an excellent one. It is quite true that the Auditor-General cannot be expected to present his report to Parliament until the current year is pretty well advanced, for the reason that he cannot begin to review the accounts of the previous financial year until after the 30th June. But Parliament has a right to expect that his report shall be before it not later than 1st November. If his report be not then available, honorable senators are denied the opportunity of discussing the whole of the financial business of the Commonwealth. There is another matter to which I desire to refer, namely, the almost indecent wa V in which the Senate is expected to swallow the Estimates every year. </para>

I regret to say that both inside and outside the Senate, honorable senators have been accused in the most unwarrantable fashion of having " stone-walled " the Estimates. But what are the real facts. We were obliged to deal with the whole of the Budget upon the motion for the first reading of the Appropriation Bill, in one sitting, whereas the other Chamber occupied week after week in discussing the same matter. We were also compelled to pass the Estimates during the course of another sitting. Those who talk about " stone- wal ling " must be absolutely ignorant of the meaning of the term if they imagine for a moment that even the remotest effort was made in that direction. </para>

                        <para>- Then why does the leader of the Opposition indulge in interjections for the purpose of drawing me off the track? It is unreasonable to ask the Senate to swallow the Estimates year after year, as we have been asked to swallow them by every Government which has hitherto held office. The only representative of the Government in this Chamber who endeavoured to provide the Senate with a fair opportunity for dealing with the Estimates was <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Josiah</inline> Symon, who filled the office of Attorney-General in the Reid Administration. How can it be urged with any semblance of truth that the present year's Estimates were " stone-walled," seeing that the general discussion upon them was completed in the course of one sitting, and that they were passed through Committee during the next sitting? It is a fact that last night hundreds of thousands of pounds were voted without a single word of discussion. I resent the imputation that honorable senators have been guilty of " stonewalling." We have been told that we should have remained silent. Why ? Because that course would have suited some honorable senators opposite, and some supporters on the Government side who, like a lot of frightened rabbits, want to scurry off to their homes - that is to say, into recess.  But those who desire to look after the interests of the country in a serious  manner do not entertain a similar view. They fail to see any necessity for Parliament proroguing ten or fifteen days prior to Christmas. If there is work to be done Parliament should be prepared to sit the whole of the year if necessary. I repeat that it is unfair to ask the Senate to swallow the Estimates without consideration, and that the best interests of the country will inevitably suffer unless some alteration in the present practice be effected. </para>

It appears to me that honorable senators have entirely lost sight of the reason why they were elected to this Parliament and of what they are paid for doing. We were elected to take a co-ordinate part in the legislation of the country, and we are at least expected to subject to fair examination any proposals which may be submitted by the Government - especially proposals in regard to our finances. There are thirty-six members of this Chamber, and seventy-five members of the House of Representatives. I do not know exactly how long the latter Chamber took to deal with the Estimates, but I think I am within the mark in saying that the discussion there dragged itself over several weeks. Honorable members chewed away at the administration of the various Departments until everybody was growing disgusted. </para>

They would not have relaxed their grip upon them but for the imperious necessity which they suddenly discovered that they should scoot off to their abodes. I think that honorable senators are not only faithless to the people who elected them, but that they are abrogating their functions if they deliberately accept the Estimates thrust upon them- </para>

                        <para>- Two days ago we entered upon a discussion of the Budget which was concluded in one sitting. On the next day of sitting, we commenced our labours  at 10.30  a.m., and were coolly informed that we were expected to pass ;£6, 000,000 of Estimates before that sitting terminated. When I entered State politics, that was an expedient which was common to all the dishonest and corrupt capitalistic Governments with which I came into contact. Being a bit of a reformer, I set out with the idea of cleaning the Augean stable. But now that I find, not a corrupt capitalist, but the honest, upright labour man in power- </para>

                        <para>- Unfortunately, the same conditions prevail. If the party which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> so capably represents had been in power, and if it had desired to rush the Estimates through in the way that they have been rushed through, I should have been found searching those Estimates from top to bottom with a view to discovering what job they were attempting to conceal. Even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> went to the length of telling me that if his party had criticised the Estimates of the Government in the way that I criticised them, their conduct would have been considered infamous. In reply, I wish to say that I was elected to this Parliament to criticise the Estimates of every party. The Labour man who sits at the back of .a Labour Government and .fails to exercise the powers of scrutiny with which he has been endowed by the Almighty, degenerates from a reformer into a common party hack. When the hour arrives that I feel I am only a party hack, I shall be glad to be consigned to the political " knacker's yard." When I feel that I am not free . to examine the finances, and everything in connexion with the policy of a Government, then the time will have arrived for me to quit politics. I feel that it will be useless to continue this discussion. My honorable friends on the right are anxious to get away to Sydney. It does not matter to them whether the finances of the Commonwealth are stated rightly or wrongly, whether the expenditure is insufficient or excessive. A number of other honorable senators are in exactly the same position. If honorable senators had been prepared to remain, I was quite willing to stay here to discuss the Estimates fully and properly. Unfortunately, on the present occasion, an opportunity to do that has not been given. I suppose that next year we shall find ourselves in a similar position, and that a few years later the people will discover that the Senate is a useless excrescence on the body politic, and must be wiped out. Before I sit down I wish to refer to an answer which the Minister of Defence gave to me to-day, and for which, of course, he is not responsible. I asked - </para>

                    <para>Is it the case that at the Brisbane General Post Office several men start work on three days weekly at 5.30 or 5.45 a.m., and do not finish till 9.45 p.m., being on duty for between 15 and 16 hours? " No," was the reply. I am as sure as I am standing here that the statement made in the question is correct, and that the answer is inaccurate. To use a very mild term, the reply is evasive. It is on a par with a great number of the answers given by the heads of Departments. If the Administration is to be conducted on fair and efficient lines, then those officers must be straightened up. I invite the Minister to make inquiries, and if he does, he will find that what I say about the reply is correct. I regret exceedingly that the time at our disposal is so limited that it is impossible to go into a great number of other matters which I should have liked to refer to. </para>

I asked whether, before the session closed, the Government would tell us definitely if the Post and Telegraph Department is prepared to make the strongest recommendation to the Public Service Commissioner, with a view to granting leave of absence, as provided in the Public Service Act, to Thomas Brand, late post-master at Mackay, in Queensland. </para>

But of late years, the practice has grown up of postponing the consideration of the Estimates as long. as possible, and then rushing them through. I agree with much of what has been said by those who have protested against that practice. I trust that what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has said will bear fruit. It is only right to admit that this year there have been exceptional circumstances which have caused the consideration of the Estimates to be delayed. Therefore it is riot fair to put on any one the blame for their late submission to the Senate. I trust, however, that in future they will be sent up early, and that the money will be voted before it is spent. </para>

                    <para>- - I desire briefly to acknowledge the very kindly terms in which the Vice-President of the Executive Council has wished us good-bye on breaking up for our holidays. I am sure that since the recent change of Government took place things have moved with a rather pleasant smoothness in the Senate. We have had lately a spectacle which has relieved our proceedings of their ordinary monotony. For instance, it has been a little out of the beaten track, and, perhaps, to that extent welcome, that the Opposition, for some reason or other, has, apparently, abandoned its benches and ranged itself on the side which is usually occupied by Government supporters, whilst on the other hand, the Government, for reasons best known to themselves, have evidently asked' their friends to take up a position on our benches. I am sure that we all wish the Government a very pleasant time indeed in the recess which they are about to enter, and which I imagine they welcome as cordially as we do. I hope that during that period they will be able to recuperate mentally and physically, and meet us here strong in both body and mind for such; fate as the gods may have in store for them. </para>

                    <para>- - f join with my honorable friend and leader in his kindly wishes for the Government. I desire to mention a few points which I should like them to consider during the recess. From a statement made this morning, I gather that the intention is to bring in a Bill sooner or later for the appointment of a High Commissioner. I hope that when it is brought in it will provide for a salary of  ^5,000  a year, be- cause it will be useless to send Home a representative if he is not placed in a position to maintain his office properly. I hope that during the recess the Governmentwill endeavour to look carefully into the matter of the consolidation of the State debts. It has been hanging fire for nearly eight years, and I am very disappointed that, prior to this time, some more definite action has been taken. I hope that, should unfortunately, a vacancy occur in the Ministerial party, they will not hesitate to see that a member of the Senate is selected to fill it. I think it will be admitted that since the present Government took office we on this side have endeavoured to rise above party. Our motto has been - " Country above party." It has been a great pleasure to me to see the two Ministers on the Treasury bench. I recognise that ever since this Parliament assembled, nearly eight years ago, they have rendered good service, and that if two members of the Labour Party are to be on that bench, they are the two whose claim should be preferred. </para>

                    <para>In this case the officer was charged under the provisions of the Public Service Act with disgraceful and improper conduct disclosed in a series of seven offences. The decisions arrived at by the Board were of such a peculiar nature that they evoked considerable comment at the time. The offences were of a palpable kind, and the Crown Solicitor, on having the case referred to him, advised that if the charge had not been inquired into by a Board he would have advised that a prosecution would have been Justified. The Department, finding it could not prosecute him, was so dissatisfied with this officer that it asked for his retirement, and this was effected. The Crown Solicitor stated that among other things the Board held :  - </para>

                    <para>But for the legal technicality mentioned by the Crown Solicitor, the officer would probably have been either prosecuted criminally or dismissed the service, and it was not considered that under such circumstances he was entitled to the privilege of six months' leave of absence on full pay, which is reserved for the diligent and well-conducted officer. Furlough is not mandatory, and cannot be claimed by an officer, no matter what his conduct may be. It is permissive and is only granted where the merit is zeal, and general conduct of the officer warrant it. Faithful and meritorious service is always recognised by the grant of this privilege, but in this case, the whole of the facts and the officer's general service were against the granting of any such privilege. </para>

If the Board was improperly constituted well and good. Let the constitution of such Boards in future be altered, in order to prevent mistakes of this kind occurring. Here was a man who was tried before what was practically a jury, and acquitted; but then somebody turns round and, like one of the Judges in Victoria some time ago, says to the jury that they have done their work in an improper manner. What is the position as between the Public Service Commissioner and the Department and this officer? I defy the Minister in charge of the Department to state publicly the reasons for the treatment that this man has received. </para>

So long as the Board was properly appointed under the Public Service Act, and performed its duties in a proper manner, its conclusion ought to be respected. What is there that gives the Crown Solicitor the right to review the findings of the Board? If it can be shown that the Commissioner had' the right to do what he has done, well and good. All that I say is that this man was acquitted by the Board which tried him, and that the Commissioner has gone behind the finding, and penalized the officer, in my opinion absolutely illegally. </para>

The members of the Opposition, in dealing with them, have acted upon the principle that no matter who may be in occupation of the Treasury bench, there are times when the King's Government must be carried on. We have adopted that view in our treatment of the Government, and I think that the country will commend us for doing so. I join with my leader in expressing the hope that the Government and their supporters will have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, and that we shall all meet again at the beginning of next session. May I add that I think the whole public of Australia wish that we shall meet again soon. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir ROBERT</inline>
                    BEST (Victoria) [4.14]. - I was somewhat amused at the heated remarks which fell from
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline>
                    in connexion with the case of a Queensland public servant. Incidentally, I had heard of the case before. I knew that it was stated that a serious miscarriage of justice had taken place. But as to the details, I knew nothing until I heard the mast striking statement read by the Minister of Defence in reply by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway.</inline>
                    Such serious statements cannot be overlooked by any honorable senator. I am aware that under the Public Service Act a certain Board had to be appointed. The Board was appointed. Who the members of the Board were, I am not aware. I simply know that a statutory Board had to be appointed. But surely such statements as these could not be ignored. Honorable senators know what the question asked by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline>
                    was. All I wish to say is that if the evidence discloses such serious offences that the Crown Solicitor deems it his duty to point out that but for some technical reason they would have involved a criminal prosecution, the Public Service Commissioner had a sufficient Justification for acting in the way he did. I do not pretend to any further personal knowledge of the case.

Exception is taken to the finding of the Board, and for what reasons they, came to their conclusion I cannot pretend to say. Surely the Public Service Commissioner was justified in coming to an honest conclusion that, by reason of the evidence in the case, he was not warranted in granting the concession.
