                    <para>The Joint Select Committee ' appointed to inquire and report on matters of privilege, have the honour to submit a Second Progress Report. </para>
                    <para>Your Committee, having recommended that, the proposed new procedure should not be retrospective, have taken preliminary steps to inquire into some recent allegations published reflecting on Parliament. Their attention has been directed to a statement published by a Sydney newspaper containing charges of political corruption against unnamed members of Parliament. It would be dishonouring to Parliament if such charges were allowed to remain unproved, unwithdrawn, and the maligners unpunished. Your Committee regret to find that in the existing state of the law, they are unable to prosecute  their inquiries in an effective and complete manner. There is no statutory law in- force authorising Select Committees to summon - and secure the attendance of witnesses before them, and above all -there is no law requiring, and if, necessary, compelling, witnesses before Select Committees to be sworn and to answer questions relevant to the issues involved. It is true that the Standing Orders provide that Select Committees may summon witnesses, but they do not enable such Committees to take evidence on oath, nor do they provide any punitive measures in case of disobedience to the summons, or refusal to be sworn, or to give evidence. </para>
                    <para>Your Committee do not think it would be wise to proceed further with an investigation in which they would be powerless to deal with witnesses who may refuse either to prove or withdraw scandalous charges made by them against' Parliament, or to give the names of their informants. If the Parliamentary Witnesses Bill at present before the House of Representatives be passed into law with some slight amendments, Select Committees would be armed with effective authority to take evidence on oath, and to recommend the prosecution of recalcitrant witnesses. </para>

                        <para>In lodging objections, the officers are merely carrying out the duty imposed upon them by the law. They obtain all their information from official sources, and the Divisional Returning Officer, in practice only, issues notifications of objection on the ground that the persons concerned have permanently left the division. All Divisional Returning Officers have been directed to enclose a form of claim when issuing a notification of determination of objection in order that the person concerned may re-enrol -without difficulty for the division to which he has removed. If by any mischance a person is improperly objected to - and this occurs very rarely - it is only necessary for him to inform the Divisional Returning Officer or Registrar of the fact in order to prevent the removal of his name from the roll. </para>

Would it be possible for the Minister, because of that admission, and the peculiar circumstance leading up to it, to ascertain approximately the number of notices of objection that have not reached the persons objected to, and that are perhaps lying at the dead-letter office? Apparently a lot of work is being done without- any result to the people or the Department. </para>

It was also considered to be in the fairway of all shipping passing through the strait, and I pressed upon the then Government the advisableness, in the interests not merely of Tasmania, but of that shipping, of having the rock located." It was only discovered by a steamer passing from Eden to Launceston unexpectedly bumping upon it. </para>

This matter was previously referred to Kingscote, who reported that he heard no call from Cape Borda till 3 p.m., and when Cape Borda sent the memo, he said nothing about any previous call. We have been trying to get further report from both Kingscote and Cape Borda, but since your wire of 21st idem we have been unable speak Kingscote, except, for a few seconds occasionally, owing to cable becoming more defective, consequently have been unable to obtain further information.

                    <para>I have first of all to say that it is owing to the absence of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> in the North that it has fallen' to me to take up the matter standing in his name on the business-paper. I ask honorable senators to consider first of all the reference indicating what it was that the Joint Committee had to consider and report upon. They will probably have observed that in many newspapers statements have appeared to the effect that an effort is being made by Parliament through this Joint Committee to confer upon members of this Parliament privileges or immunities which they have not possessed in the past. I take as a typical illustration of that form of criticism this statement which appeared in a leading article of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> of 3rd April last- </para>

                    <para class="block">That is typical of the criticism levelled by a number  of newspapers at the report which has been before honorable senators for some time past. As a matter of fact, the reference with which the report is headed shows that the Committee was asked to do two things. First of all, to report not as to what privileges we have, or whether we should have more or fewer privileges than we are entitled to" claim at the present time, but as to the procedure in dealing with, and the power to punish persons charged with any interference with the privileges of members of either House. Secondly, the Joint Committee were asked to report upon any recent allegations reflecting upon Parliament or any of the members thereof. It was clearly the duty of the Committee to ascertain the nature of the existing procedure in such cases. That could only be discovered by a reference to the procedure of the House of Commons, because, under the Constitution, until by Act of Parliament, we declare them ourselves, our powers and privileges at the present time are those of the House of Commons, as established mainly by precedent. We found that if a person is considered by either House of Parliament to have committed a breach of privilege, he can be summoned to the bar of the House concerned, and ordered to be imprisoned, but he cannot be imprisoned for any term extending beyond the close of the current session. In the circumstances, if, to-day, the Senate called an offender to the bar of this Chamber and ordered him to be imprisoned, no matter how heinous his offence, he would have to be released, probably, in the course of three or four days. A difficulty arises in the case of the Commonwealth Parliament which does not' arise in the case of the House of Commons. The House of Commons can commit a prisoner to Newgate, or to one of the common gaols of the country, or it can order him to be confined in a room in Parliament House. The evidence of various legal experts who were examined by" the Joint' Select Committee indicates that it is very doubtful whether we have any power under the Constitution  to compel any State gaoler to take over, and hold in custody, a prisoner committed to a gaol by either House of this Parliament. On the other hand, it appears to be perfectly clear from the evidence submitted that if we passed a law making breaches of the privileges of Parliament an offence, State gaolers and police would, under the Constitution, be obliged to carry out that law. We are in a worse position in this matter than is the House of Commons, because, as a matter of fact, I believe that all we could do with an offender would be to shut him up in one of the rooms of the building in which we are assembled, and we could only keep him there while Parliament was sitting. Another point elicited by the evidence submitted to the Committee was that it was practically impossible to fine an offender. If we could do so, even without keeping him in custody, we might .have an effective mode of punishment. I believe that the last occasion on which the House of Commons inflicted a fine in such a case dates as far back as 1660. Generally, the opinion of the witnesses before the Committee was that we have at present no power to fine ; but that there is nothing to prevent our taking that power by passing an Act dealing with the matter. The evidence , shows that, so far as the present procedure is concerned, this Parliament is  practically  powerless to deal with breaches of privilege. It was stated in one of the newspaper comments made in connexion with the matter, that the haling of an offender before the bar of either House amounts to little more than a farce, and that statement will be generally agreed to. It- was the business of the Committee to consider what procedure might be adopted to meet the difficulties of the case. It was strongly felt by the members of the Committee that the time had passed when any House of Parliament should continue to be judge and' jury in its own' case. It was felt that Parliament is no longer entitled to place itself in a position of so much authority as to claim to be able to hale an offender before it, and try, and sentence him for an offence against itself. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot agree with the honorable senator; even if Parliament could chop an offender's head off, I do not think it should do so for an offence against itself. The Committee considered that if the dignity of Parliament, and its good name and reputation for fair play, were to be maintained, the best course to adopt would be to intrust the trial of such cases to a regular judicial tribunal. It was also felt that in the case of the Federal Parliament no better tribunal could be suggested than a judge of the Supreme tribunal of Australia, namely, the High Court. It will be found that the only action Parliament need take is to pass a resolution" in the form of an instruction to the Attorney-General, who, acting upon the  resolu  tion, would prosecute ari offender before the High Court. It was felt that that would be a prompt, and, at the same time, a dignified way of dealing with breaches of the privileges of this Parliament, and I feel that, even though they should differ' as to details, honorable  senators  will approve of the general principle underlying that recommendation. It may possibly be justifiable to make a slight reference again to the criticisms in some newspapers on the first report'/ The main criticism has been that by this new procedure Parliament is likely to take something which it did not have before, that is to take the power to protect, itself from criticism. The Committee is not asking Parliament to take anything which it did not have before, and what is more, <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> criticism can no more be interfered with if these reports are adopted than' if can be at the present time. There is a distinct difference between criticism and- libel or slander. Criticism is, an expression of opinion based on certain facts. One may or may not agree with a criticism, but to call a man a bigamist or a burglar is not to criticise him. It is a slander on him. unless it is true. On the other hand, a libel or a slander is a statement of matter of fact, and not - a statement of a person's opinion. To say that' a member of Parliament has been, bribed is a statement of fact. It is. not a criticism of a member, and consequently I hold that the Committee in putting forward a method of procedure to deal with persons who make statements or alleged statements of fact which are not true, but which are slanders, and are calculated to lower the dignity of Parliament, and to degrade it in the eyes of the country at large, .is not hampering criticism. It is a perfectly fair and legitimate proposal that persons who slander Parliament or commit other offences should be made responsible in exactly' the same way as a person who slanders another person is responsible. It may  also be noted that in criticising the first report  of  the Committee, the press have taken up rather a curious attitude. I am a newspaper man; in fact, I have been so engaged nearly all my life, and it seems to me a . curious thing that newspapers should  give  the advice to public men, " Never mind what the newspapers say." If they are going to preach the doctrine that public men are not to pay any attention to  criticisms  and statements in the press, then why do they make them? Why should newspapers criticise or attack members of Parliament? </para>

                            <para>- Why should newspapers attack the policy of members of Parliament if they do not expect them to take any notice? It is all very well for them to say that members of Parliament are thin-skinned. The Committee is proposing a feasible procedure by which each House can deal with what have been recognised as offences practically ever since parliamentary government came into existence. It may be said, indeed it is suggested, that the Committee is proposing something new. On that point it may be worth while to draw, attention to the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gavan</inline> Duffy, clerk of the other House. On page 10 of the report, he says - </para>

                        <para>So long as forty years ago, the Queensland Constitution Act set forth in detail the powers of the Parliament. It could punish summarily for certain contempts, and for disobedience to its order ; for not attending when summoned : and for assaulting and obstructing ils officers: and for this purpose the House could direct the Attorney-General to prosecute before the Supreme Court any person charged. </para>

I am not sure that that power has been exercised in New South Wales, but it has been exercised in Victoria. In the case of Queensland, the offences are set out in detail, and constables and others are directed to assist in the execution of the orders of the House, and the gaoler to imprison offenders. I am giving these particulars in reply to the question whether it would bf possible for the Commonwealth Parliament to delegate its powers to Courts of Law. </para>

As regards our second report, I have only to say that it points out that our present mode of procedure is worthless) and the Committee has found that without the power to compel witnesses to answer questions, it is impossible to proceed further with the second part of the inquiry. </para>

There is no statutory law in force authorizing Select Committees to summon and secure the attendance of witnesses before them, and above all, there is no law requiring, and, if necessary, compelling witnesses before Select Committees to be sworn and answer questions relevant to the  issues  involved. It is true that the Standing Orders provide that Select Committees may summon witnesses, but they do not enable such Committees to take evidence on oath, nor do they provide any punitive measures in case of disobedience to the summons or refusal to be sworn or to give evidence. </para>

                            <para>- If we make a statement, it ought to be correct. In the present case, certain statements were made by a newspaper. The Committee had the power to summon the men responsible to attend their meetings; but did not exercise that power, . and give as a reason that they had not the power to summon witnesses. That is where the mistake seems to be made, unless <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blackmore</inline> and the late  President  were wrong ; and I do not' think that they were. The Committee may not have had the power to deal with the witnesses if they refused, to come or were recalcitrant, but we- are not justified in  assuming that they would refuse to come. </para>

But as it was referred to the Committee the Committee should have made some effort to summon these witnesses, and give them an opportunity of substantiating the statement which contained slanders on certain members. If then the Committee had found that they were in a difficulty, they could have reported to the House, and it would have been for the House to say whether it would arm itself with further powers to deal with the matter. </para>

                        <para>- - The criticism directed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to the report seems to have been answered by interjections in the course of his speech. He affirms, ' and no one will deny, that the Committee could have proceeded with regard to the specific charges, by reason that it had. all the powers, privileges, and immunities of a Select Committee of the 'House of Commons. Theoretically that is perfectly true; but, as I interjected, the very reason for the appointment of the Committee was that it was felt that the . powers, privileges, and procedure of the House of Commons had become obsolete, and were unfitted and insufficient for our purposes. </para>

                            <para>- Not only are they regarded here as out-of-date and obsolete, but the Commonwealth labours under certain disabilities from which the Imperial Parliament is free, one of them being the fact that we have no control over the gaolers and other officers of the States. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> quoted a section of the Constitution which appeared to give us that power, but that section calls upon every officer of a State to discharge his duty where any offence against our laws is concerned. We have not yet. passed a law dealing with this matter. That seems to be a material point. Even admitting for the sake of argument - which I do not - that the Committee could have gone further than they did, was it not wise to go slowly, and as we are liable to have our motives misinterpreted, to pick our steps warily, and be perfectly certain of our ground and machinery, rather than do anything to make Parliament the laughing-stock of Australia ? </para>

                    <para class="block">That section speaks distinctly of Commonwealth laws. I shall not give a definite opinion, because I do not feel qualified to do so. I simply suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that the road was full of pitfalls, and in the circumstances the Committee played a wise part in offering Parliament certain recommendations which are really an invitation to Parliament to provide machinery by which it will be possible to' deal with these, cases in the future without the slightest hesitancy or doubt as to"" the position in which we stand. In common with other honorable senators, I have had my attention drawn to the misapprehension that exists outside as to what is really contemplated by the procedure that we are now asked to adopt. One would assume from newspaper criticisms that there is an attempt to clothe individual members with privileges and immunities which they do not enjoy to-day. It has been affirmed that we are seeking here to relieve ourselves of the responsibility which an ordinary citizen has to shoulder. There is no justification for that statement. There has never been any attempt here to throw a cloak over individual members. If an individual member is libelled or slandered, nothing proposed by the Committee will take from him the obligation of defending his own character. He stands in exactly the same position as the ordinary citizen in the street. If I am libelled . to-morrow, the procedure recommended by the Committee will not help me. It will rest with me to take my own case into the ordinary law courts, and either prove it or suffer the consequences. </para>

                            <para>- What is proposed is that where general libels are uttered against Parliament as a whole, as in the case already referred to, machinery which does not exist at present should be provided by which Parliament, in its corporate capacity, can vindicate its. own honour in the eyes of the people. There are only two ways in which that can be done. One is by Parliament being the prosecutor and Judge in its own case. It is affirmed, curiously enough, by some of our newspaper critics, that we have ample powers now, and ought to put them into effect. I wonder who would be. the first to denounce Parliament if we attempted to call one of our journalistic critics here, and hale him to gaol ! Is there enough ink in all the printing offices in Australia to express the indignation which would be showered on us if we did? </para>

                            <para>- If we condemned the pressman who said that, or 'the journal that published it, the retort of the press would be: "Fancy a Parliament accused of corruption being the judge of whether it is corrupt or not !" The whole thing is absurd. Apart from that, it departs from what we always recognise as the underlying principle of British justice, that a man shall not be a Judge in his own case. That is why this Chamber has deemed it expedient to depute to a Committee the task of devising some machinery outside Parliament itself, which, when imputations of that kind are cast on Parliament as a whole, will hold the. scales of justice true " and equal, and determine whether or not those critics are justified in what they have said, or whether a wrong ha.- been done to Parliament as a public institution. There is the further point that if any person in criticising Parliament exceeds the bounds of legitimate comment, and ventures into the arena of slander, he has an ample and better opportunity, before a trained Judge, of demonstrating his case, by going before a public court, than he would have if he were brought up here. Therefore, those who are merely acting in the public interest', have no cause of complaint in this matter. There is no attempt to curtail public criticism, and if any such attempt were made, the first institution in the country to rise up and protest, would  be this Parliament itself. There is no body that has more to gain from proper public criticism of its own proceedings, than Parliament itself. One of the complaints that we have to-day, is that not sufficient publicity is given to the proceedings of Parliament. It is not the fact that publicity is given to our proceedings of which we have to complain, but that some journals seem to regard Parliament as a body against which to make unwarranted statements. Just as no individual is called upon to submit to such attacks, so no Parliament is called upon to do so. It has been said that if Parliament consults its own dignity, it' need not be troubled about such criticisms. The public journals that take that view have no reason to fear any legislation passed by any Australian Parliament, so long as they confine themselves to fair and honest criticism. The procedure recommended by this Committee would only operate in regard to those journals which devote themselves to libel, slander, and gross personalities, and which pander to the grosser tastes of portions of the community. I venture to say that, although the whole of the details of this report may not commend themselves to the Senate, it is one which, in substance, can be heartily supported ; and, I think, that in saying so, I am expressing the views of . the great .majority of honorable senators. </para>

Whilst some of the newspapers have snarled rather bitterly about our recommendations, and have endeavoured to show that our object was simply to muzzle public criticism, I think that it will be obvious that those who have taken that line of argument have merely endeavoured to divert public attention from the real facts of the case. When the report is carefully read, it will be seen that it not only deals with matters of libel, but that it is sufficiently comprehensive to deal with all the most important offences relating to the powers, privileges, and immunities of Parliament. Therefore, the attempt made by the Committee is much wider in its scope than some of the newspapers would lead the public to think. In paragraph 6 of their recommendations, the Committee say - </para>

It would not be in accord with British fair play and justice to pass an Act to-day, and under it to punish a man for something that he did six months before the law came into existence. That is the reason why we consider that it would be unjust to make the new law retrospective. I have much pleasure in supporting the adoption of the report. </para>

                <para class="block">The question of old-age pensions has been a prominent one in politics in the Commonwealth ever since its establishment. Fortunately! in the two larger States, provision for the payment of old-age pensions has been in existence for some time. I venture to say that honorable senators will concur with honorable members elsewhere in esteeming it a privilege to be given the opportunity to take part in the enactment of so commendable a measure. As a matter of fact, I know of no measure introduced into the Commonwealth Parliament which has, or will receive, in a greater degree, the commendation, not only of members of this Parliament, but of the people of the Commonwealth. The desire and design of this Bill is to recognise the right of a section of our citizens to a contribution in old age, or earlier if they should have the misfortune to become invalids. Many of the persons whom it will benefit are amongst the worthiest of our old colonists, men who have grappled with the difficulties of early, settlement, and have led a strenuous life in the service of the country, which entitles them to the most generous consideration at our hands. It is not necessary, in the circumstances, that I should enlarge on the merits of this Bill. I desire at the outset to acknowledge the splendid services rendered in this matter by the Royal Commission appointed to consider and make representations in connexion with old-age pensions, in the very excellent report they have furnished. Fortunately, the Senate was represented on that Commission by my honorable friends, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce, Senator Gray,</inline> and ex-Senator Styles. The various recommendations made by the Commission will, I am sure, be of value to honorable senators, in the consideration of this measure, which is largely, if not completely, founded upon those recommendations. It is true that the Commission had the great advantage of the legislation of the two larger States in considering the question, and doubtless the valuable experience of the operation of the States' measures referred to greatly aided the Commission in their inquiry. The Bill before the Senate seeks to deal, not only with the payment of old-age pensions, but also with the payment of pensions to invalids under certain conditions which are set out. I need only refer to the fundamental features of the Bill, as many of the clauses are in the nature of machinery, to give it effect. The main provisions with respect to old-age pensions are set out in Part III. It is there provided - in clause 15 - that every person who has attained the age of sixty-five years, or who, being permanently incapacitated for work; has attained the age of sixty years, shall, whilst in Australia be qualified to receive an old-age pension. It is further provided in the same clause, that by proclamation it will be competent for the Governor-General, . so far as women are concerned, to declare that the age at which they shall be qualified to receive an old-age pension shall be sixty years, and from and after such proclamation, the preceding provision is to be read as regards women as if the word " sixty " were substituted for the words "sixty -five." Then it is provided in clause 16 that certain persons shall be specially disqualified. These include aliens, naturalized subjects of the King who have not been naturalized for the period of three years next preceding the date of their pension claims, and also Asiatics, except those born in Australia- </para>

                        <para>- There are many. Aboriginal natives of Australia, Africa, the islands of the Pacific, or New Zealand, are also disqualified, but no woman having married one of these persons is, in consequence only of such marriage, to be disqualified from receiving a pension. Then there are certain- necessary conditions set forth to qualify a person for an old-age pension. It is provided .that no person shall receive an old-age pension unless he is residing in Australia on the date when h=; makes his claim, and has, on that date, so resided continuously for at least twenty-five years, and is of good character. Clause 18 defines what continuous residence means, and provides for the emergency of occasional short absences from the Commonwealth. Then no person is to be entitled to a pension unless the net capital value of his accumulated property within or out of Australia does not exceed ^310. </para>

                <para class="block">Invalid pensions are dealt with in Part I W of the Bill, which is only to be brought into operation by proclamation. The conditions on which such pensions may be granted are set forth in clause 20, in which it is provided that every person above the age of sixteen years, who is permanently incapacitated from work by reason of an accident, or by reason of his being an invalid, and who is not receiving an old-age pension shall, whilst in Australia, be Qualified to receive an invalid pension. Certain persons are disqualified from receiving an invalid pension, and they are aliens, Asiatics, except those born in Australia, or aboriginal natives of Australia, Africa, the islands of  the  Pacific, or New Zealand, but no woman having married one of these disqualified persons is, in consequence only of such marriage, to be disqualified from receiving an invalid pension. Necessary conditions entitling a person to the receipt of an invalid pension are set forth in clause 22. The invalid must be residing in Australia when he makes his claim to the pension, and must have resided in Australia continuously, within the meaning of clause 18, for at least five years. . It is provided in clause 23 that the amount of an invalid pension shall in every case be determined annually by the Commissioner or  Deputy  Commissioner, having regard to any income or property possessed by the applicant. I venture to say that both as regards old-age and invalid pensions, the provisions of this Bill are not only reasonable, but generous. Honorable senators have before them a comparative table of provisions of the Commonwealth Old-age Pensions Bill, and certain States Acts, together with the recommendations of the Royal Commission relating to rate of pensions, reductions, &amp;c, and the only matters it contains to which I need specially refer are the provisions with respect to age or ill-health, and, later on, as to the limit of the pensions. The Royal Commission's recommendation was the attainment of the age of sixty-five years, or sixty where the applicant was permanently incapacitated for work. The Commonwealth Bill provides for an old-age pension on the attainment of the age of sixty-five years, or sixty years where the applicant is permanently incapacitated for work, and as to women, the Governor-General is empowered to reduce the qualifying age to sixty years. Under the New South .Wales Act, the age qualification is the attainment of the age of sixty-five years, or sixty years in cases of inability of claimant from physical unfitness to earn his own living. Under the Victorian Act, the qualification is the attainment of the age of sixty-five years, or permanent ill-health caused by having been engaged in mining or any prescribed dangerous or unhealthy occupation. Under the Queensland measure, which is to come into operation this year, the qualification is the attainment of sixty-five years, and, under the New Zealand Act, the qualification is also the attainment of sixty-five years. The provisions with respect to the limit of both invalid and old-age pensions are set forth in Part V. of the Bill. In clause 24, it is provided that the amount of a pension shall, in each case, be at such a rate as, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the Commissioner, or  Deputy  Commissioner, who determines the pension claim, deems reasonable and sufficient, but shall not exceed the rate of £26 per annum in any event, nor is it to be at such a rate as would make the pensioner's income, together with the pension, exceed £52 per annum. Where the pensioner has accumulated property, the amount of a pension is to be subject to certain deductions. Where the pensioner has accumulated property, the amount of a pension is to be subject to the following deductions- </para>

                <para>In clause 26 provision is made for the computation of income. The Royal Commission recommended a pension of £26 per annum, and the Bill adopts that sum. In New South Wales £26 per annum is allowed where both husband and wife are entitled to pensions, but where they are living apart, pursuant to any decree or deed of separation, the allowance is fixed at £19 ios. each. In Victoria the pension is £26 per annum, in Queensland £26 per annum, and in New Zealand £18 per annum. As regards the various deductions that are to be made, that . is rather too elaborate ' a story, but those who are interested will find full particulars set forth in the table which has been presented. The administration of the measure is dealt with in Part II. The scheme is that there shall be a Commissioner of Pensions for the whole of the Commonwealth, and a Deputy Commissioner of -Pensions for each State. The Commonwealth will be divided into districts. To each district will be assigned a registrar, and, working in conjunction with the other officers to whom I have referred, there will be a magistrate assisting in the administration of the law. The term " magistrate " includes a police stipendiary or special magistrate of the Commonwealth or of a State. The procedure is set forth in clause 27 and following clauses. Clause 27 reads - </para>

                <para class="block">The registrar is to be at liberty to call upon persons to furnish him with the necessary information to enable him to make his report. Upon the completion of the investigation, the onus is to be thrown upon the registrar of reporting fully to the magistrate. That is to say, he will receive the claim, investigate it fully, and make out a report, and that, together with the claim, will be forwarded to the magistrate, and the claimant notified that it will be considered on a particular day. Clause 29 provides that, where the magistrate is satisfied that, by reason of physical disability, or other sufficient cause, the claimant is unable to attend, he may dispense with his attendance. The magistrate's duty is to continue further investigation, and, if he should deem the claim fair and equitable, he will have the power to recommend the claim, as made, or as modified by the result of his investigations, or if he should think fit, postpone the claim for further evidence, or recommend its rejection. It is provided in sub-clause 2 of clause 31 - </para>

It will be forwarded' by the registrar to the  Deputy  Commissioner, whose duty it will be, except in certain cases, to determine the application, and after he is duly satisfied, to issue a pension certificate, iri proper form, when the claimant will be entitled to his pension. There is provision for the re-hearing of a claim in certain circumstances, and ' also a provision that persons entitled to State pensions may be held to be qualified to come under this measure without much trouble.

I may explain, are to be made fortnightly, and, possibly, the Post Office, or other convenient Commonwealth, or, perhaps, State office, by arrangement, will be utilized for that purpose. As for the number of persons likely to be provided for, we derived considerable assistance from the experience of New South Wales and Victoria. In his valuable work, the <inline font-style="italic">Official Y ear-Book,</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> gives some data which will aid us in coming to a decision. On page 913, he deals with the number of persons in receipt of old-age pensions in New South Wales and Victoria. In 1901-2 there were 13,975 pensioners in New South Wales, and 14,570 in Victoria, making a total of 28,527. In 1906-7, there were 21,465 pensioners in New South Wales, and 10,832 in Victoria, making a total of 32,297. Approximately, it has been estimated that the number who will avail themselves of the old-age provision, will be about 67,000. From the same book, we learn that the number of persons, sixty-five years of age and upwards, is about 168,000. And more than that, we are told' that those who avail themselves of pensions, having regard to the experience of New South Wales, represent about 4 per cent, of the total population of the State, or, in this case, the Commonwealth. It is by that means -that we arrive, -roughly, at the estimate that the number of old-age pensioners, under this measure, will be about 67,000. In dealing with this matter, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> says - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>It will be seen that during the past three years the number of pensions has remained practically constant at about 32,000, the number in New South Wales having increased during that period by 560, while the number in Victoria decreased by 777. At the census of 31st March, 1901, the number of persons in New South Wales aged 65 years and upwards represented 3.44 per cent, of the total population of that State, while in Victoria the corresponding percentage was 5-52- </para>
                    <para>Assuming these percentages to hold good for 30th June, 1907, the number of persons in these two States aged sixty-five and upwards may be stated approximately as - New South Wales, 53,400 ; Victoria 68,300. On this basis the number of persons in receipt of old-age pensions in New South Wales on 30th June, 1907, represented 40 per cent, of the total number in the State on that date aged sixty-five years and upwards, while in Victoria the corresponding percentage was 16. It is probable that the numbers  aged  sixty-five and upwards given above are somewhat underestimated, especially in the case «f New South Wales, and that in consequence the percentage in receipt of pension is slightly overstated. The error involved is, however, probably not large. </para>

                <para class="block">The estimate is therefore something like 68,000 old-age pensioners likely to take advantage of this provision. </para>

                        <para>- That is only a rough estimate of the minimum that must be provided for; it may be more. It is contemplated that, by the resources which will be created 'under . the Surplus Revenue Act - of course this is only a rough calculation - provision will have been made for that amount by the 1st July, 1909. That would, of course, contribute substantially towards, if not completely pay, the amount that would be required for old-age pensions between the 1st July, 1909, when the Act begins to operate, and the 30th June, r9io. Of course after that date half of a financial year would elapse before 31st December, 1910, when the Braddon section would expire, and greater elasticity at all events would be afforded to the Federal Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I have done nothing of the kind. By clause  15  the Governor-General in Council may by proclamation declare that the age at which women shall be qualified to receive an old-age pension shall be sixty years, and from and after such proclamation the last preceding provision shall, as regards women, be read as if the word " sixty " were substituted for the word " sixty-five." Honorable senators will notice that that comes into operation by proclamation. It is estimated that the number of women in the Commonwealth between sixty and sixty-five is about  40,000,  and of those the number likely to require pensions will be about  16,000.  When the proclamation issues, it will be necessary that provision should have been made for an increase of something like  16,000  pensioners, and an estimated increased yearly cost of between  £250,000  and  £300,000. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that these are mere matters of conjecture, and the honorable senator is just as much at liberty to make. an estimate as I am. We do not propose to bring that provision into operation until we find that we have the means available for such a desirable object, and we must be prepared to find at least some amount between  £250,000  and £300,000 when the proclamation issues. Invalid pensions are provided for in Part IV., which also comes into operation upon proclamation. I believe  New South Wales has a similar provision regarding invalid pensions, which cost that State something like  £60,000  per annum. It is estimated that it will cost the Commonwealth about  £200,000  per annum to bring that portion of the Bill info operation, but, as in the. former case, before the proclamation issued, the Government of the day would have been well assured that the money was available in the Treasury for the purpose. Then comes the question of the cost of administration. The figures as to the States of New South Wales and Victoria will be found on page  914  of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs'</inline><inline font-style="italic">Year-book.</inline> In  1901-2  the cost of administration in New South Wales was  £17,258,  and in Victoria  £2,799,  °r a total of  £20,057.  In  1906-7  the cost in New South Wales was  £20,949,  and in Victoria  £1,746, a  total .of  £22,695. </para>

I' congratulate the Vice-President of the Executive Council that time and circumstances have contrived that to his hands should fall the task of introducing it. I feel, as other honorable senators will, a certain amount of gratification that I should be enabled by voice and vote to assist in placing it  on  the statute-book. It is a Bill we all welcome and to which every member has looked forward for a considerable time.

                        <para>- Smooth and rapid, as the honorable senator says, with that keen eye for the recess which always marks him. Having held out this cordial, welcome to the Bill, I trust that in pointing out a few drawbacks in it, I shall do so with no other desire than to make it a more workable instrument to accomplish the end that we all have, in view. I shall take this opportunity of indicating what appear to be its weak points in order that we may be able to dispose of them the more rapidly when we reach them in Committee. I say with a great deal of regret that we are really taking a plunge in regard to this Bill, because the financial foundation for it is simply non-existent. . So far as I understand- the financial position we are undertaking to provide an amount which at the lowest estimate is £1,500,000 per annum, and which, in my opinion, will approach more nearly to £2,000,000 when the scheme is in full operation. We are undertaking to pay that from the 1st July next year, wthout, so far as any one has been able to show me yet, having anything like that sum either in hand or likely to be received. According to the figures placed before the Senate yesterday, the amount of surplus revenue for last year would be roughly £730,000. We arrive at that in this way. There is £470,000 to <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> retained under the Surplus Revenue Bill and £260,000 of surplus revenue which has been paid to the States, making a total surplus revenue of £730,000. From that amount has to be deducted an appropriation for naval purposes of £250,000, leaving the surplus for the present financial year, £480,000 in all, available for old-age pensions. It may be suggested that the surplus is going to be more next year. But, on the contrary, the Federal Treasurer has been emphatic in declaring that the revenue will decrease and the expenditure will mount up. That is only a reasonable conclusion. </para>

                        <para>- I am pointing out that as we are putting this Bill upon the statute-book, and are undertaking to pledge the honour of Parliament to provide these pensions at a certain time, it is not an unreasonable thing that honorable senators, who next year will have to face the responsibility of finding the money, should bear in mind the responsibility which they are accepting for themselves and Parliament generally. There is, I say, £470,000 of surplus available for the whole of this year after providing for the naval payments. That would be assuming that we retained the £260,000. Next year we may expect a smaller sum than that. I do not propose to show why, because it must be obvious to honorable senators that the probabilities are strongly in favour of the surplus revenue being less next year. </para>

                        <para>- I think it is probable, and in any case it is reasonable to assume that £250,000 will be required for other purposes. We need not shut our eyes to the facts. It would not lighten our task a bit to close our eyes to what is ahead of us. I am speaking simply as a friend ot this Bill, and for that reason I think honorable senators will see that it is advisable that we should face the position and ascertain exactly what we have to do in order to meet our responsibilities by the time when' we have to take action. We can in this way make up our minds as to what is the best method of raising the necessary revenue. I have stated that £470,000 is the maximum surplus for this year. Allowing for a shrinkage next year, it seems to me that we shall have in hand in July next year for the purposes of this scheme less than £1,500,000. </para>

                        <para>- Then we ought to put the authority in the Bill. This Bill, is put forward with the honest intention that pensions shall be payable from the 1st July of next year. I go back to the figures again, and, to make good my position, let me say that' we have no reason for thinking that the surplus next year, and the year after, will be larger than the surplus of this year. But I will take it that the surplus will be what it has been this year. If you add to the amount of surplus for the next two years the £222,000 available this year, you will, I say, still not have enough to meet old-age pension payments for the one year in which the pensions will be in operation before the expiration of the Braddon section. If that be so, I see no escape from the conclusion that the responsibility is upon us, and upon the Government and the Parliament - upon every one who supports this Bill - to realize clearly that in assenting to its provisions we pledge ourselves to make financial provision to meet the obligations that will arise under it. This is the point that I am leading up to : that honorable senators will, in voting for this Bill, be required, sooner or later, to make special financial provision to meet the claims which will arise under it. I will now proceed to point out what I regard as a serious and fundamental blot on the whole Bill. </para>

                        <para>- I am certainly not going to offer a financial policy to the Government. But, so far as my honorable friend and his party are concerned, we all know that they have their financial proposals already framed. I come, as I have said, to what is really the serious and fundamental blot on the Bill ; and that is that, instead of the Bill being, as its title indicates, a measure for old-age pensions, it is really' an endowment of poverty. The great blot upon this Bill is that it <inline font-style="italic">attempts</inline> to discriminate between 'classes of the community, and that it is going to make the payment of old-age pensions a sign and stigma of impoverishment. </para>

                        <para>- I have raised no alarm as to the finding of ,£1,500,000. I have simply pointed to the responsibilities that we are assuming. If my honorable friend considers that a senator is discharging his duties properly by taking a Bill and accepting it without looking into its details, I beg to differ from him. I am showing that my main objection to the Bill, as it is framed, is that it attempts to set up a difference between one individual in Australia and another. If there has been one party in Australia which has set itself up as being determined to pull down any differences that may divide one section of the community from another, and which has resolved that all classes, and men and women alike, shall stand upon an equal plane before the law, it is the Labour Party. I ask them, then, after having attempted to pull down these objectionable differences, not to endeavour to set them up in another way. Whereas the difference in the past has been in favour of the better-off classes, it is now sought to make a difference in the opposite direction. </para>

                        <para>- That is perfectly true; but the fact that such has been the case all along does not make it right. The Labour Party, a few years ago, would have ridiculed that argument. The mere fact that what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> describes has been the case so far is no reason why we should stick to it. It has frequently been said by those who have asked for pensions for the aged poor that the poor man in the street is as much entitled to his pension as is the Judge- upon the Bench. I reverse the proposition, and say that the Judge upon the Bench is just as much entitled iu his pension, if there is to be an old-age pension, as is the man in the street. There does not seem to be any escape from this argument : If there is to be a pension for old age, payable at the age of sixty-five - and, sir, I am rapidly getting to that stage when I resent sixty-live being regarded as an old age - I say that it ought to be paid irrespective of the worldly possessions of the claimant. On the other hand, if there is to be a charitable dole to the least fortunate members of the community, it is not entitled to be called an old-age <inline font-style="italic">pension.</inline></para>

                        <para>- This is another evidence of the fact that honorable senators opposite are not prepared to concede even common honesty to those who differ from them. If we are not prepared to find the money exactly in the way  they  desire, we are declared to be absolutely unsound, and to be cast into outer political darkness. Thank goodness, there are the electors to stand between us and that fate. I have preferred my chief objection to the Bill. My next objection - and this is all I shall have to say on the measure - is that in regard to the provisions with respect to the reduction of the qualifying age for women and for the' payment of invalid pensions, the operation of the measure is to be subject to proclamation which, of course, means to the action of the Minister. I dissent altogether from that proposition. If, for financial reasons, the Government are unable to bring these provisions into immediate operation, they should' be brought into operation later, not as a result of the action of the Minister, but as the result of a joint address from both Houses of this Parliament. I have previously referred to the unfortunate habit into which we are drifting, of leaving important action to Ministerial discretion; but I know of no proposal of this kind likely to be attended with more, anxious consequences than the proposition embodied in this Bill. I am not making these references personal; but let us assume that without any regard to the financial requirements of the next Parliament, the Minister, in order perhaps to improve his position before the electors, issues the proclamation referred to on the eve of a parliamentary election. I say that it is not desirable that such power should be placed in the hands of any ' Minister. The necessary machinery is provided for in the Bill, and when it is shown that the finances of the country are in such a position as to justify this further extension of the pension principle, there should be no difficulty in inducing Parliament to sanction that extension. In that way, Parliament would keep within its own control its proper legislative duty, instead of handing its legitimate functions over to some  one  who, for the time being, might be beyond the power of Parliament. I trust that in regard to the operation of the provisions for the reduction of the pensions age in the case of women, and for the payment of invalid pensions, honorable senators will assist me to retain the power to make these provisions operative in the hands of Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I have to repeat that it is a matter for some regret that honorable senators opposite should be so en'amoured of this measure, as apparently to be prepared to take it as it is without looking into details. A neglect of the machinery proposed to give it effect does not in any way affirm their attachment to the principle of old-age pensions. Nor does it indicate lukewarmness with respect to the principle that honorable senators on this side should express a desire to make the measure more perfect. My object in addressing honorable senators has been to point out what appears to me to be defects which I think can be remedied, without in any way jeopardizing . the Bill or delaying its passage for a single hour. I trust that when we get into Committee honorable senators will be prepared to assist in improving the Bill as far as possible. </para>

                    <para>. - I am very "glad that I am a member of a Parliament that is prepared to pass such provisions as are contained in the Bill now before the Senate. But, in common with many members in another place, as well as in this Chamber, I -am not so entirely . enamoured of this measure as to imagine for one moment that it is the best that those in health, strength, and the vigour of life can do for those who are in their declining years. There is no such idea running in the minds of honorable senators on this side. "But we feel that it is possible to obtain something of a very liberal character and are determined' not to lose the opportunity to do so.' Many honorable senators have been long enough in Parliament to have become wary, and they are always wary of the suggestions, the efforts, and of the amendments of those who have opposed for so long the enactment of a measure of. this description. The leader. of the -Opposition was rather  amusing  this afternoon. He commenced, like a Jonah, he carried on like a Jeremiah, then he went into ecstasies like a David ; but I do not believe that he had any intention of winding up like a Judas Iscariot. I do not believe that he would do so. </para>

                        <para>- But immediately he concluded his elaboration, of that point the honorable senator went on to inform the Senate that the measure proposed was not half liberal or costly enough, and that the Government were not proposing to do in the interests of the aged people of Australia half as much as they ought to do. He said that instead of spending £1,500,000 for this purpose we should spend £2,000,000. That is the impression which the honorable senator's speech made upon a simple individual like myself, and it is how the speech would strike most people in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I shall deal with that a little later on. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> should not be impatient. Honorable senators will recognise that I have fairly interpreted the honorable senator's remarks. Now, with respect to the limitations of the Bill. Does any honorable senator suggest for a moment that the members of the Labour Party entirely approve of those limitations. Not one that I know does, but there is not one who is not aware that it is a very risky business to attempt to deal with them or to follow any member of the Opposition who would make such an attempt. Our past experience shows that action of this kind has been taken for the purpose of defeating measures of this description, to which members of the Labour Party have given very serious consideration, and on which they have placed a very high value. </para>

                        <para>- I was present in another place when a similar attempt' was made there - whether honestly or not I do not know - and if it had been successful, the probability is that the Bill would have been dropped. That attempt failed, and I hope that if a similar attempt is made here it also will fail. The leader of the Opposition stated that this- is not a party measure, and I hope that no member of the Senate will regard it in that light. If the members of the Labour Party so regarded it, they would press for the enactment of all that they desire in the form of an old-age pensions scheme. The leader of the Opposition indicated that the provisions with respect to the reduction of the pensions age in the case of women and the payment of invalid pensions should not be put in force until . we were sure that there were funds enough in the Treasury to meet the necessary expenditure. I hope that no consideration of that kind will be allowed to influence the Government, but that they will issue the proclamation provided for whenever they think the time is opportune, and that these people ought to be relieved, and will consider the advisableness of raising the necessary funds to give effect to these provisions. Now, with respect to the raising of the necessary revenue, I wish to say why my suspicions have been aroused on this occasion. </para>

                        <para>- I am more acquainted with everything that mv honorable friends would not do. I have just stated, and earnest advocates of the provisions of this Bill believe, that, so far as direct taxation as a means of raising the necessary funds to pay these pensions, is concerned, "it can't be did" under, existing circumstances, as a Yankee would say. What about the other direction ? We know that from honorable senators on the other side of the House taxation with a protective incidence would receive very little support. On one occasion, the Government introduced a Bill that had for its  object  the imposition of special taxation, of which three-fourths would not have to be handed over to the States. It was clearly stated at that time that one of its purposes was to assist in the payment of old-age pensions. There were other purposes. </para>

                        <para>- That is so self-evident that it is hardly necessary to mention it. The honorable senator would never support the nationalization of the tobacco industry, or the sugar industry, or the shipping industry, or anything else which would increase the prosperity of Australia, and give the Government additional funds. Honorable senators on that side have given their support to nothing which would increase the revenue. The leader of the Opposition is not satisfied with the sum which is involved in this Bill, but wants it increased by one-fourth. After what I have said, I think that it must be very clear that I, with other members of the Labour Party, have every reason to bc suspicious of the great anxiety of the honorable senator and those associated with him to carry a measure which would involve a larger expenditure than is proposed. The members of the. Labour Party have made up their minds to carry the Bill', as nearly as possible in its present form, so that they shall run no chance, either by delay or by amendment, of losing that which they have sought for for so many years,, and which at last they are about to obtain. </para>

                    <para>- I refer to Western Australia. I ask honorable senators to bear in mind that the adoption of old-age pensions throughout Australia has largely been in the absence of the Labour Party, as indicated by their presence here to-day ; of that there can be no doubt. That,' I think, should put a bit of a stopper to the boastful remarks which have been made this afternoon. I desire to refer to the financial aspect of the measure. I have no occasion to say anything in support of the principle of old-age pensions. It had my support in New South Wales.; it has my support here. But, I submit that in the case of a measure which involves so great an expenditure, the financial aspect ought to have had a better and fuller elucidation, than it received to-day from the Minister. I venture to say that the expenditure thereunder will not be covered by , £2,000,000 per annum. </para>

                        <para>- I am now commenting upon the remarks made by the Minister, who gave us to believe that the payments under the Bill would be in the neighbourhood of £1,500,000. I think that he told us afterwards that the expenditure on invalid pensions would amount to probably £200,000, and that the reduction in the age of women would mean an additional expenditure of from £250,000 to £300,000. But from my calculations, I have, put down the expenditure at considerably over £300,000 - nearer £400,000. If we take the minimum of £1,500,000 for old-age pensions, as mentioned by the Minister, £300,000 on account of the reduction in the age of women, and £200,000 for invalid pensions, we have a total expenditure of £2,000,000. I wish to draw attention to the fact that census by census the percentage of persons of sixty-five years of age and upwards, has been rising very materially. In 1861, it was 1 per cent. ; in 1871, 1.74 per cent.; in 1881, 2.44 per cent. ; in 1891, 2.90per cent., and in 1901, 4 per cent. In England the percentage of such persons is 4.67. And probably the next census, or that of 192 1,will disclose that in Australia, where better health conditions prevail, the percentage is at least 5 per cent. These figures, which look so small, mean a very large increase in the amount which has to be found by the Commonwealth. I think that it would have been right for the Minister to have referred somewhat to the amount which will be debited to the various States. I imagine that the Bill will entail an expenditure of between £66,000 and £75,000 on the little State of Tasmania. </para>

                    <para>Excluding Queensland, where the information was not ascertained, the number of naturalized foreigners in the Commonwealth at the census of 1901 was 10,910, distributed as follows :  - New South Wales, 3,265 males, 354 females; Victoria, 3,304 males, 1,262 females; South Australia, 1,360 males, 545. females; Western Australia, 576 males, 101 females; Tasmania; 119 males, 24 females. In New Zealand the number of naturalized persons was 4.672. It is probable, however, that the above numbers are understated. Germans have availed themselves most largely of the privileges of naturalization, having taken out about one-half of the certificates granted. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">Consequently, of a total of 10,000 aliens naturalized here in 1901, more than half were Germans, and all other nationalities are covered by the remaining 5,000. Under the Naturalization Act passed by this Parliament, naturalization was refused to Asiatics. In those circumstances it is undesirable to pass that paragraph, which will save the Commonwealth practically no money, while it will be another means of casting an insult on the people of Asia. I do not know quite what to say with regard to the aboriginals. I believe most of them are already cared for in some way or other. If so, they might be excepted from this Bill, but I ask honorable senators to consider before we reach 'the clause to which I have referred whether it would not be entirely fair and reasonable to omit the word " Asiatics," on the ground of its offensiveness to the great nations of Asia. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to congratulate the Vice-President of the Executive Council on the sympathetic manner in which he introduced the Bill, and to express my agreement with him that members of this Parliament who are in a. position to vote for it ought to feel grateful for such a privilege. This moment is certainly the proudest in the short period during which I have been in public life in 'Australia', because I am in a position to-day, by my vote, to help to give effect to a promise, that has long been given to the old people of Australia, of some consideration at our  hands. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> regards it as possible that the money proposed to be allocated for the payment of old-age pensions will not be sufficient. I do not believe that in a year or two from now £1,500,000 will be enough to pay old-age and invalid pensions. But if the contingency arises that we cannot pay all the claimants from the Consolidated Revenue with our present . means of taxation, I shall welcome it, because we shall then be in a position to insist upon another method of taxation - a method which is repulsive to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> and others who think with him. Instead of paying old-age pensions or anything of that kind from money derived through Customs and Excise duties, we ought to provide for them by a direct system of taxation. If what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> predicts does happen, the time will be opportune to impose that most necessary of all taxes - a tax on the unimproved value of land. I welcome this Bill, and will support it generally, because it is certainly a step in advance when compared with similar measures now in force in New South Wales, Victoria, and New Zealand. I venture to say. that it is the most advanced piece of legislation in the world. </para>

                        <para>- The Vice-President of the Executive Council when introducing the Bill referred honorable senators to a comparative statement issued under the authority of the Royal Commission on old-age pensions appointed by the Commonwealth Parliament. According to that statement, the maximum payment to old-age pensioners in New Zealand is £18 per annum. That is wrong. It was so under the original Act of 1898, but the maximum was raised to £26 per annum by an amending Act passed, I think, in 1905. Consequently that portion of the statement was misleading. </para>

                        <para>- I have no intention to contravene the Standing Orders, or to reflect upon the votes of honorable members of either House. Whilst I support the Bill generally, I think we might go further. I believe in giving a pension to all citizens irrespective of their position in the community. Every man, if he has been a good citizen, has done something to make things better than he found them. That being so, under a really good old-age pensions system every citizen ought to be entitled to claim a pension. By that means the stigma of. pauperism or charity which to-day applies to - a claim for a pension would be removed. I am glad to know that this Bill will practically remove that sigma. Under the system that has obtained in the past, even in New South Wales and Victoria, a claimant for a pension has been considered somewhat in the light of a pauper. I am glad to know that when this Bill becomes law the citizen who claims a pension will no longer be looked upon as one who is seeking a charity dole, but will be regarded as one who makes a rightful claim to something which, by his own energy and industry, he has helped to earn. . </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that is correct. I am glad that the Bill has been received so favorably. I should like to see a universal system of old-age pensions, but I recognise that our first duty is to our indigent poor. There are thousands of poor people in Australia to-day who will welcome the Bill and be glad to know that a long-standing promise is at last to be fulfilled. As bearing out my statement that this is the most advanced piece of legislation in the world, I point to that portion of it which provides for invalid pensions. People over sixteen years of age who have resided in the Commonwealth for five years, and who through illness or accident are permanently incapacitated from following their employment, are to be . entitled to receive a pension. What does this mean to a number of homes throughout the Commonwealth? It means that many people who, in consequence of disease and misfortune have been unable to contribute to the support of their families, will be assisted, and those responsible for the maintenance and support of the aged will be better able to bear their burdens.' I do not consider that, a pension of 10s. per week is ample. I should like to see it considerably increased. .Had this measure been introduced at an earlier stage of the session, I should have been prepared in Committee to move amendments. But I do' not want to do anything to endanger the passage of the Bill at this stage. For one thing, I think that the age limit of sixty-five is too high, particularly when we consider the climatic conditions under which many of our people have to work in comparison with those in other parts of the world. </para>

                        <para>- The Victorian Act specifies a residential qualification of twenty years, and I should like to see the Bill before us amended so as to enable any person who has resided twenty years in Australia to receive a pension. There is one part of the Bill which is not favorable to the White Australia policy. It does not disqualify a woman  who has married an Asiatic. The desire underlying the White Australia policy is to keep the white race inviolate ; and any white woman who marries, or lives with, a Chinaman, or an Afghan, or Japanese, ought not to share the benefits of this Bill. We must also remember that in this vast continent, there aTe great differences in the cost, of living. A sum of ros. per week may be sufficient in Melbourne, but would be equivalent to no more than 5s. per week in some parts of Western Australia and Queensland. In that respect, the Bill is faulty. Provision might have been made to ' allow for ' the vast difference in the cost of living in parts of some States. The Federal Government itself has set an example in granting an al.lowance to Federal officers in parts of Western Australia. I may point out that the number of people over sixty-five years of age in Western Australia is the lowest in any State. The highest number of people over that ape in any State are resident in Victoria. I have pointed out one or two features in respect to which the Bill might be amended. But while I have indicated these defects, I am by no means desirous of moving amendments which would have the effect qf blocking the passage of the Bill. Had it come before us at' an earlier stage of the session, I might have been inclined to submit amendments. Under present circumstances, 'I shall support the second reading, and shall endeavour to afford facilities for the rapid passage of the Bill through  Committee.  I cannot sit down without again expressing my sense of pleasure at having the privilege to be a member of .this Parliament, and of voting for a measure which will bring comfort and assistance to a large number of people who deserve well of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I have said that I intend to support this Bill, and I do so with the utmost sincerity. It ought' not to be necessary to say so. It should be deemed offensive for a man to have to proclaim his sincerity in supporting such a piece of legislation. I recognise, however, that so far as my own State is concerned, I am assuming a serious responsibility. It was estimated some three years ago, when the Royal Commission upon this question took evidence in Tasmania, by the Statistician of that State, that the cost of an old-age pensions scheme to Tasmania would be something like £65,000 per annum. That is a serious amount for a State, which, as the result of Federation - and I am not speaking in disparagement of Federation - was placed in serious financial difficulties from the very- first year when we imposed a uniform Customs' Tariff. In that year we had to endeavour to .finance .the State, in face of an ' actual loss of something like £170,000 from Customs and Excise, and of other losses making up a total of £[200,000 - practically one-fifth of which was revenue of which we were deprived ' ' in one act." That system of loss has been going on in a lesser degree ever since. Lately, as the result of the imposition of the new Tariff, a larger amount of revenue has' been received, and Tasmania had some reason to hope that the deficiency consequent upon. Federation was going to be wiped out. Although the Bill is going to cost Tasmania from £[65,000 to ,£70,000 a year- </para>

                        <para>- As a rule I do not object to interjections ; but on this occasion the interjections have been of a spiteful nature, and have been made with the endeavour to establish the insincerity of honorable senators on this side who support the Bill. I strongly resent my character for sincerity being impugned, although it does not depend upon the opinion of men like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. I am aware that this Bill is going to cost Tasmania between ,£60,000 and .£70,000 per annum, but still I am also aware that it is not proposed to take that money away from Tasmania. It will be spent within the borders of the State. I am also glad to recognise that the institution of this system will be a recognition of the debt which we owe to the aged and infirm. There is, however, another aspect of the question. I know that, at any rate so far as certain goods are concerned, some of the Customs duties which we have imposed with the object of bringing about increased protection will have the result of levying heavy taxation upon poor people. I have given reasons for that view before. Consequently, this £[70,000, or a large proportion of it, will simply be a restitution to those people of the increased taxation which we have placed upon them this year. There is one other remark  which I have to make about the Bill itself. That is that in voting for the second reading I throw upon the Government the responsibility - which would ordinarily be shared by every member of Parliament - for the scheme of the measure. The Bill was practically forced through one House of the Legislature yesterday, and apparently it is to be put- through the Senate to-day ; I hope so, at any rate. </para>

                        <para>- We know that; and it would be very strange indeed if the experience gained by the States had not been utilized by the draftsman in preparing this Bill. But at the same time it goes without saying that honorable senators have not had., a fair opportunity of thinking out the details. It is a Bill in connexion with which extensive and expensive machinery will be necessary. I am glad to hear that it is proposed to make use of the ordinary services of the Commonwealth in carrying out the measure. There is another responsibility which belongs to the Government and to the party supporting them, who, as I said honestly and sincerely last night, are more deserving of credit for the introduction of this measure than are the Government. The responsibility I refer to is that of financing the proposed scheme. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> dealt with the matter very fully this afternoon. Whatever motives may be attributed to those who have felt called upon to point out the dangers of our financial position, the fact remains that in this measure we are really being asked to authorize an annual expenditure of from £[1,500,000 to £[2,000,000 without doing that which any business man would recognise as a solemn obligation1 in such a case, namely, making the necessary provision for the anticipated expenditure. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not think that I should have risen to speak upon this Bill if it were not for the fact that I desire to put myself right with a number of my constituents. At the last Federal elections I expressed the opinion that the States Governments should retain control of the management of old-age pensions. I think that it is right to say why 1 have changed my mind and intend to support this measure. First of all, I wish to say that since my entry into Federal politics I have been more and more impressed with the view, and I have given expression to it more than once, that the contract entered into between the States and the Commonwealth is one that should be carried out in every detail. I believe that the Commonwealth should carry out the duties assigned to it under the Constitution at the earliest possible moment, whilst the States should continue to exercise the powers which were not handed over to the Commonwealth". Although a couple of years ago I expressed the opinion that the States Governments were well fitted, because of their superior local knowledge, to look after the payment of old-age pensions, I must now admit that I have been compelled to alter my opinion, and, seeing that the establishment of old-age pensions is a duty cast upon the Commonwealth Parliament, I believe it should be carried out at the earliest possible moment. Coming to the measure itself, I must say, first of all, that I am not much exercised in mind on the question of financing the proposed scheme. Yesterday I objected to a certain measure, because I believed that for certain reasons it was not sound, quite irrespective of its association with old-age pensions. I think 1 made that clear. Now that we are dealing with the question of old-age pensions, I consider that the financing of a scheme should not be a matter of serious difficulty if the Federal Government pro pose to continue for. any length of time to do what they have said they intend to do. I believe that sooner or later  they  will be forced to do what has been found to be inevitable by Governments in other countries, and if they go to the money market to borrow the money required for the construction of works of a permanent character, there is no reason why they should not be able out of the ordinary revenue of the Commonwealth to meet the expenditure required for old-age pensions, and for a great many other Commonwealth undertakings. I am aware that some honorable senators do not like the idea of constructing public works with borrowed money, but in my opinion the adoption of that course is inevitable if the Government intend to finance an effective old-age pensions scheme by relying upon the ordinary revenue. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator has started again. The Bill before us deals with old-age pensions, and I propose to confine myself to that subject. I propose practically to repeat what I said on this .subject at a meeting which T addressed in Queensland. In my opinion, the whole scheme of old-age pensions proposed is crude, and is by no means worthy of a people so far advanced in civilization, at this stage in the world's progress. Dealing with the question of assisting, .not the ordinary poor, but the aged poor, I would say that it is possible to go to almost any country in Europe, and find a very much better system than that which is proposed in this Bill. The reason for the payment of old-age pensions is not that a man has reached the age of sixty or sixty-five years, and should, therefore, be given a pension of 10s. per week, but that those who have failed in the battle of life, and have reached a stage when they can no longer continue the fight with any reasonable prospect of success, shall be informed that they are pensioned off, just as those who are living in Chelsea Hospital and such institutions are pensioned off. But what do we do here? W.e turn to an old man or an old woman who has failed in the battle of life, not necessarily -through his or her own fault, but who has reached a stage when it is no longer possible to contend with the younger and, it may be, the brighter members of the community, and we say, " Here is a pension of 10s. a week. Go, now, and try to make a living with people who may be possessed of  brighter intellects and have the advantage of youth on their side." </para>

                        <para>- This subject is not new to me. It is one in which I have taken a very great deal of interest, although I have hot spoken in public upon it in years past. It seems to me that, although it is certainly proposed in this Bill to do something, we are not going to do a very great deal. In Austria it is found possible to provide aged people with bright homes, that are practically their own, and with food, or the means to obtain food for themselves. They are also practically provided with servants to look after them. I speak now of the decent aged poor, and not of criminal loafers - of the poor who can claim as a right, and not as a charity, to obtain assistance from the State - and the total cost of the system in Austria is is. 5 1/2d. per head per day, which is practically the same as 10s. for a week of seven days. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that the cost of living in Austria is less than in Australia, but honorable senators will agree that the Austrian system is one which is worth considering. I have read the recommendations of the Royal Commission, but have not studied their report, which may possible give very good reasons why some such system as I have described should not be adopted in the Commonwealth. </para>

There they have an asylum for the aged poor on- one island, a leper station opposite on another island not far away, and a gaol on a third island at no great distance from the other two, and to get to Dunwich the poor have to make a journey of a long distance by water. </para>

                            seems to think that nobody in this world who is not a member of his own political party has any right to claim to be charitable, or to have any feelings of sympathy, but I venture to say that there are many who do not agree with the honorable senator politically, and myself among the number, who are just as genuine students of measures calculated to improve the conditions of the aged poor as the honorable senator or any member of the party to which he belongs. I have referred tq the conditions under - which the bar racks system is carried out in Queensland.

The effect of the system ' adopted in Queensland is that the aged poor are treated almost as pariahs of society in being made to feel that they are separated from the rest of the community. </para>

                        <para>- No, it is not. If the honorable senator studied1 the question more carefully he would know that in many places on the Continent cottage homes have been established where aged poor people can live in the midst of their fellow, citizens, and are troubled with very little official supervision. I am not, of course, prepared with a cut-and-dried scheme to deal with the matter, and though I am willing to accept this Bill as a step in the right direction, I say that if we wish to deal with the question satisfactorily we must do so scientifically, and with a greater regard to the real requirements of the old people than to" the adoption of a scheme which will be the least expensive to those who have no need of pensions. ; </para>

                        <para>- I admit anything of that kind that the honorable senator may be pleased to say. Although I cannot' find it within the four corners of the Constitution, I feel that it is equally a national duty of the Commonwealth Par1liament to deal with the difficulties of infant life. I believe that in the case of people at the two extremes of human' life, infancy and old age, the State should interfere. As we cannot have such a system as I think we ought to have, in view of our advance in civilization, we must take what is" offered, and I can only hope that this measure will not be held to represent the <inline font-style="italic">Ultima Thule</inline> of our aspirations in the direction of making provision for the aged poor. That seems to me to be the danger that is before us. At present two of the States have old-age pension systems in operation, and in a third it is hoped that old-age pensions will be provided in a very short time. But none of these States appear to me to go to the root of the thing, and try to deal with the question on a scientific principle, realizing what the people themselves want. </para>

He reminds me of Wordsworth's philosopher who "peeps and botanizes on his mother's grave." What we ought to consider is that the old people do not want merely bare money. One of the things which the old folks tottering to their graves require is companionship and sympathy. If we put them on a distant island, or in barracks in a place like a penal settlement, will they get all the sympathy or companionship they require? </para>

                        <para>- While I cannot support a barrack system as applied to old-age pensions, I believe that we could do very much better for the old folks if we adopted some system by which we could enable them to enjoy the same companionship as they previously had, and helped them - possibly at no extra cost - to a far greater extent and in a material fashion by means of cottage homes than we shall do by simply paying out a little hard cash. Let us make them an allowance and supply them with a home, as in Austria, if you like, at a low rent. All I wish to say at this stage is that, while I support the measure, I hope that the people and statesmen of Australia will make it their business to go further into this question. Do not let us be content to follow upon the dead lines which have been followed in English-speaking countries, and in that respect I believe that English-speaking countries are far and away behind foreign countries. Let us not adhere to the old plan of thinking that as soon as we have chucked our half-sovereign to the poor old man or poor old woman we have done all that is required of us. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not propose to occupy the time of the Senate for more than a few minutes. I felt when this Bill was introduced that it would be put through very quickly, for the reason that there was practically no opposition, at any rate to its principle. While I congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> upon the very humane and comprehensive view which he has expressed, I submit that the consideration of various schemes' is neither before us at the present time nor is it desirable. Therefore, I urge that the principle should be affirmed at once so that we may get into Committee, and, unless there is some very grave reason for making an alteration, pass the Bill quickly and get done with our work. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to compliment the Government upon having introduced a measure which has been anxiously awaited throughout Australia. I also compliment them upon the fact that they have at least a fair wind and a good passage ahead of them with the Bill. It is not often that honorable senators on both sides of the Chamber are found to be bosom friends on a measure. But that is so in this instance. The reason why I desire to speak is because while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> was addressing the Senate I interjected that the system obtaining at Dunwich was practically similar to that which obtains under the poor laws in all parts of the world. He was expressing to us his sympathy with the aged and the poor, and stating how at Dunwich they separated the men from the women in their declining years, practically kennelling them like so many dogs in bits of reserves that are usually unfit for almost any kind of cattle, much less human beings. I only desired to Suggest to him that what he was describing in regard to Dunwich is obtaining in almost every, part of the 'world which has poor laws on which old people, after having worn out their' physical energy, have to depend. It is became of our close observation of that disgraceful system that we are anxious to erase it from the annals of Australian history. We want .to enable our aged people to spend the remainder of their days in something like comfort and happiness. I am just as anxious as is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> that in the future we should even go so far - and I hope that we will - as to make comfortable homes for our old people and do something for them such as I have seen in other parts of the world. I admit that they are established under charitable conditions. </para>

Of course, these cases are few and far between- a mere handful in the midst of teeming millions. I am quite prepared at any future time to assist any project with that object in. view. The barrack' system is repulsive. Indeed, the very phrase makes 'me feel very wroth. I have observed its operation, and, therefore. I hail with pleasure this Bill, which I think, ought to be allowed to pass as it stands. Whatever may be our opinions as to future, developments and as to future .necessities, in the name of humanity and the interests of. the people of Australia . let us pass the Bill as it stands, and then we shall have laid, down, the foundation of .a system such as has yet not been equalled in any part of the world. </para>

                        <para>- One of the mottos on the floor of the vestibule is " Where no counsel is, the people fall." We are asked to pass the Bill without discussion ; but I think that we . ought to take counsel on the subject. It cannot be said that I am opposed to old-age pensions, because I advocated them here four and ar half years ago, but coupled with the condition that the wage-earner should contribute to his own support. A little time ago I took exception to the observation that this Bill is the most advanced in the world. If it is the most advanced Bill certainly it is not the most perfect. I contend that to give an allowance of 10s. a week to old people, and to leave them to starve in the street is not proper charity. The reason why I question the perfectness of the Bill is that in Belgium I have seen in very good situations in towns large numbers of cottages where the aged ' poor are living with a small allowance from the municipality and the Government, and often from their own old employers. They live rent free, and have the companionship of their ' fellows, and the women are able to sit at the cottage doors and make lace or do something else towards their support, even though they may be over sixty-five years of age. I should like to see a system of that sort established in Australia, It is too late this year to take any step in that direction; but at some future time we ought to effect some improvement in this legislation. The principle of the German Imperial law of 1891 ought to be adopted. It is called the " Stick " law, and is very easily carried out. The worker who contributes a farthing or 1 1/2d. per week, according to his1 wage, presents his card at a Post Office and is given a stamp which he affixes to. it. As. soon as the card contains a sufficient number, of payments he is given another- card, and so on. </para>

                        <para>- That is not so in Germany in regard to this law, which is a little different from the other laws there. A good many of them have been passed to help the poor. The result is that when people become .indigent by old age, or through accident, they often have a large sum to fall back upon for their  own sustenance. When a person contributes towards his pension, it is very different from a system under which money is given simply as a charity. If you make the worker contribute you encourage thrift, but if a pension is given at a certain age you encourage no thrift, and that, to my mind, is one of the greatest blots on the Bill. It is a good Bill in many ways ; its object is good, but I do not think that it is the best measure of the kind in the world. It may be said that the worker in Germany can live very much cheaper than he can here, but it must not be forgotten that meat and bread are much dearer there than here, and there is more room for economy here than there is in Germany or Belgium. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to compliment the Government on the measure they have introduced. If any proof were needed of the advantages of the cordial understanding that exists between the Government and the Labour Party, this Bill would furnish it. The work of the session is about to be crowned by the passage of this admirable measure. I have no doubt that, later on, we may have an opportunity to improve upon the Bill, some of the drawbacks of which have been pointed out by members of the Opposition. When that opportunity comes, the members of the Government and the Labour Party will cordially assist those honorable senators  in that good work. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> taunted those members of the Labour Party in this Chamber who come from Western Australia with the fact that there is no old-age pensions system in existence in that State.. f would remind the honorable senator that we, in this Parliament, have no power u&gt; legislate for Western Australia. If we had, nothing would give us greater pleasure than to bring our State into line with New South Wales.  But, had the party to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> belongs had their way, New South Wales might have been just as far back as Western Australia is at present. We cannot forget the fact that, notwithstanding that the Labour Party in New South Wales supported the free-trade, or Reid, party in State politics for many rears, no move was made by the latter party towards securing the great principle of old-age pensions, and it was not until <inline font-weight="bold">Sir -William</inline> Lyne formed a Government that a measure was passed by the New </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">South Wales Parliament, with the support of the Labour Party. I am glad to know that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne is now identified in Federal politics with this admirable measure, and, together with his old supporters, is helping to put it on the statute-book of Australia. In view of the tone of many of the remarks made by certain honorable senators this afternoon in favour of this principle - sentiments that, so far as I know, came from them to-day for the first time - I have to ask myself who has been placing obstacles in the way of its passage up to the present? If I remember right, all the obstacles in the way of the Federal Parliament legislating in this direction were raised by members of the -Opposition. It was they who declared that we could not possibly raise enough revenue from the Customs to pay old-age pensions. It was they .who " rang the changes " on the argument that we should be compelled to raise £6,000,000  in order to get the million and a-half necessary to finance a pensions system. We were also told by members of the Opposition, both on election platforms and in this chamber, that the Federal Parliament had no power to impose direct taxation. You yourself, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> were amongst those who held that we had not that power. Consequently, when I heard members of the Opposition announcing that they had always been in favour of old-age pensions, I began to think that it must have been the Labour Party, and not the Opposition, that had been making difficulties. Later on the necessity will be forced upon us of finding sufficient money to pay the pensions. I do not agree with the Government estimate. They are making it too low. A comprehensive measure of this kind, granting pensions to a much larger number of people than any measure now in  force in Australia, will require a great deal more money to finance it. That, of course, will not prevent those of us who are with the principle heart and soul from supporting the Bill now. There are numbers of sources from which we can get sufficient money if we care to take the necessary steps. There are ample means of taxation, open to us. Suggestions have been made showing how the money can be found by means of taxation, or by the nationalization of certain industries and the utilization of the profits. As short speeches are the order of the day, I shall- not occupy longer time, although I felt that it was necessary to explain our position: So far as concerns the amendments suggested by members of the Opposition, I, for one, once we ' have affirmed the principle and made sure of this instalment by placing the Bill upon the statute-book, will be only too ready to ' assist those honorable senators to improve a measure which they regard as so imperfect. I hope that they will not forget the statements they have made to-day,, but will act up to them when they get the opportunity. The party with which I am connected will be only too glad to give them every assistance. </para>

                    <para>. - It was not my intention to occupy time in debating this question, but I crave the indulgence of the Senate to express my pleasure at having the opportunity, in my . first session in this Parliament, to assist in passing so grand and glorious a measure for Australia. Knowing the many years of hard fighting that have been put in in order to obtain the enactment of the principle of old-age pensions, I must express my surprise and pleasure at the unanimous feeling that exists in this Chamber, and, I understand, in another place. Knowing the difficulties .that have had to be overcome, a new member like myself cannot but wonder who has really been keeping the " principle back. The members of the Opposition would seem to be even greater champions of the Bill than any one who has . spoken on this side. The leader of the Opposition even went so far as to advocate universal pensions, which I heartily believe in.  1  hope that when we are in a stronger financial position the leader of the Opposition will take an early opportunity of trying to put his views into practice. If lie does he will find very few 00 this side of the chamber who will not support him up to the hilt. I am also particularly pleased, as a Victorian, to know "that we shall at last have removed the blot which exists upon the old-age pensions legislation of this State, in the matter of dragging the relatives of those who are aged and poor into Court to show cause why they should not contribute . to their support. I have no sympathy with those who can, but will not, support their aged parents, but nevertheless I cannot conceive of any independent-minded old man or woman taking info Court an unworthy son or daughter for such a purpose, and I should, think that the bread obtained by such means would choke the old people who ate it.  1  hope that we shall not only make this the most liberal piece of legislation in the world, but that it' will serve as a pattern to other countries. I trust that the Bill will be carried without amendment, not because I am not desirous of liberalizing it in many respects, but because I believe that it is a step in the right direction, and goes a long way upon the road that we desire to travel; I hope that at an early date we shall have a better opportunity of liberalizing it. </para>

I remember the time when we were advocating old-age pensions .some years ' ago, and were denounced in the Tory press of Australia from one end of the continent to .the other for advocating such a measure. We were told that we should destroy the provident habits of the people and kill all thrift. Our policy was used as an argument in favour of that holy old lie that we wished to destroy the marriage tie, and to subvert family life. Such arguments were repeated <inline font-style="italic">ad nauseam.</inline> But now our efforts are going to be crowned by the passing of a splendid measure of this kind. That, I say, is a matter for sincere congratulation. I am extremely pleased that honorable senators and people outside who were formerly so strenuously opposed to old-age pensions have at last declared themselves in favour of this Bill. But - while in no way doubting their sincerity or throwing any slight upon it - I must, at the same time, take leave to remark that although the persons to whom I refer are supporters of this Bill, they showed none of that anxiety which people who were favorable to it' ought to have displayed in finding ways and means for financing the scheme. No later than yesterday, in this chamber, when" we were striving our utmost to pass a measure by which alone the inauguration of 'Commonwealth old-age pensions was possible, we experienced strenuous opposition from honorable senators opposite, who, with one honorable exception, voted against it. </para>

                        <para>- I arn not discussing it, sir, nor do I propose to allude to it any further. There is not, and cannot be, any comparison whatever between the beneficent utility of a Commonwealth Old-age Pensions Act and a similar Act passed by a State. Even if. old-age pensions had been universal in the States - and as we know such measures existed in only some of the States - a liberal measure of this kind would have been necessary to cover numerous cases in Australia. We have  in this country a number of people who are, I claim, amongst the best citizens Australia possesses. They are the pioneers of settlement and of industrial activity. They are the men who take their lives in their hands, and go up and down the country with their swags on their backs prospecting in- the most Outlandish wilds in the remotest parts of the continent. They are the people who have opened up' this country, and have enabled others to step in and enjoy the fruits of their work. Owing to the very exigencies of their calling, those, who have gone about' looking for gold and for opportunities of developing new resources, have been absolutely unable to participate in any scheme of old-age pensions hitherto, because the States in their Acts very properly included a provision that the recipient of a pension must have been- a resident for a certain number of years. Consequently those men who were constantly travelling about the country, and opening up its resources for the exploitation of those who came after them, were not sufficiently .long in any one State to establish a claim for an old-age pension. ' Thus many of our best and worthiest citizens were entirely debarred from participating in the benefit's of such legislation. Therefore, it was essential that the Commonwealth should inaugurate ah old-age pensions scheme which would embrace every part of Australia, and under which the only qualification would be residence in some portion of the Commonwealth for a certain period of time. The Federal Labour Party, of which I have the honour to be a member, laid it down as -one of the foremost planks of its plat form that we should establish a Commonwealth old-age pensions- scheme at the earliest possible date. We have kept that ideal in front of us all the time. We have struggled and striven to attain it. We have frequently been met only by abuse. But I .am proud and pleased that our advocacy has at last borne fruit, and that we now have a Federal Old-age Pensions Bill before us. It was predicted that such a measure would lead to all sorts of evils. But we recognised that it was essential to the well-being of the Commonwealth that such a scheme should be established. I am pleased to accept this Bill as a very fair instalment of what we re- - quired and demanded. I believe that it goes quite as far as in the present state of our finances we are able to. go. .It goes quite as far as anybody could have expected six months ago. Though I am free to confess that the Bill does not quite meet the ideal of . the Labour Party, or some other public men outside that party, it is nevertheless a valuable instalment. I am of opinion that in order to remove the very suspicion of a taint of charity from an old-age pensions scheme, it should be universal, and .that the pensions should be paid to rich and poor alike. Such a scheme would result in no hardship to any one. The rich man would contribute as well as the poor man, and though more money would be paid, the people would get it back in the shape of old-age pensions. But I recognise that we could not inaugurate such -a scheme until the expiration of the Braddon section, without resorting to drastic new taxation. I. am pleased and proud that the 'Government have brought forward this measure. It accomplishes as much of our desires as we could expect in the present financial condition of the Commonwealth. For that reason, I heartily support .the second reading of the Bill, and shall assist in its passage in the speediest possible fashion. </para>

                    <para>.- 1 am pleased indeed that this measure contains a clause enabling old-age pensions to be paid to all those who have been in Australia a certain number of years, no matter to what State they may belong. I was always an advocate of that principle in the States, although I recognised that it could not be applied to a purely State scheme. A man may have been ten years in Queensland, and forty years alternatively in New South Wales and Victoria. But he might not be entitled to an old-  age pension under any State law, through not having resided continuously for the necessary period in any one State. That is the class of cases that I desire to meet, and I am pleased indeed to see that this Bill accomplishes that end. I was pleased when the State of Queensland fell into line with two other States of the Commonwealth in adopting an old-age pensions scheme under which 10s. per week was paid. We had a scheme in Queensland before, for providing for the aged poor, but it was a very bad one. It was simply a charity scheme, and the amount paid was only 5s. per week. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, I am afraid that the raising of the money will lead to some difficulties, unless the Government have a scheme in their minds. I have made a calculation on my own account, and, as far as I can see, the Commonwealth will be nearly £500,000 short in 1909, including the money required for old-age pensions. I suppose that the Government have some plan in view, which they will propound later on, for making up the necessary amount. If it is a reasonable scheme, I shall support it. The payment of old-age pensions by the Commonwealth will entail a great relief this year to those States which are at present paying old-age pensions. But, at the same time, the measure will be very hard indeed on one or two States. As this is a Commonwealth question, I am entitled to refer to a State of which I know something. I allude to Tasmania. There is a very large percentage of old people in that State. It is one of the oldest settled States in Australia. Many of the young men, unfortunately, leave, and come over to the mainland. </para>

                        <para>- I quite agree with the honorable senator, and have told the Tasmanian people so. But that is not the question now. The Bill will be hard on Tasmania, because a large proportion of the 180,000 people in that State are old men and women. They will participate under the scheme ; and if Tasmania has to pay her full share, it will cost a very large amount of money. Probably Tasmania will have to pay more proportionately than any other State. I do not know how it will work out - whether the expense will be borne per head of the population, or whether Tasmania will have to pay for her own old-age pensions. </para>

                        <para>- Not necessarily; but, if so, it will be a great relief to Tasmania. I believe that the Bill will be passed unanimously. No matter what some people may have thought in the past, I believe that every one in the Commonwealth now acknowledges that the States should do something to assist the aged and infirm. There is a large number of men in the Cloncurry district in Queensland, who at various times have been engaged in mining for gold all over Australia. They have never worked for wages, but have tried to better their condition by following up alluvial diggings. The proposed old-age pensions will be a great boon to those men. Some people may be in a position to make a claim under the Queensland Act for a pension of 10s. a week, but very many will be entitled to claim such a pension from the Commonwealth under this Bill, and we. know how far men accustomed to look after themselves in the bush can make 10s. a week go. I hope that the measure will be administered in a fairly liberal spirit. Many of our old people are very independent, and if they are expected, as I believe they are in some of the States, to beg for a pension, they will prefer to starve. I see no reason why the various local authorities should not be in a position to bring deserving cases under the notice of the officials appointed to administer this measure, and I repeat that I hope it will be administered in a liberal and humane spirit. </para>

                    <para>. -I  do not know that I should have risen to speak on the Bill at all, had not members of the Labour Party been twitted with a desire to induce honorable senators opposite to say something in opposition to the measure, and with a desire to establish insincerity on their part. It would be a very strange thing for men who have been working for twenty years in advancing a particular movement, and who have succeeded in ! popularizing it to such an extent as to make it acceptable to-day to all parties in the Federal Parliament, to characterize those who came to their assistance as insincere. I do not say that honorable senators opposite are insincere to-day. I believe that they are just as sincere in support of this measure now as the party to which they belong were in their opposition to the principle for so many years. There is no harm in saying that they have been converted. We only ask that they shall acknowledge that they have been wrong in the past, that they have made mistakes, and that the work of the Labour Party in connexion with this movement has been so effective that they are now willing to fall into line and support the establishment of old-age pensions. Members of the Labour Party are not likely to describe honorable senators opposite as being insincere. They have come more immediately into contact with the evil results of the charitable systems which have been in existence in the past than have the members of other political parties. Under the charitable system in force in Queensland in the past it was left purely to the discretion of a Minister, on the report of a police officer, to say whether any person should get a charitable allowance or not. I have known cases where children have been prepared, if the charitable allowance were given, to assist aged parents and keep them under the same roof as themselves and their grandchildren, and because the Government have refused to make -the paltry grant of 5s. per week, which is the highest amount that could be given as a charitable allowance under the system, the aged people have been torn away from the homes which their children were ready to provide for them, and taken to the benevolent asylum at Dunwich. I am glad to say that the system under which that kind of thing occurred has been abolished, and that aged people, in the circumstances I have described, will after the 1st July be entitled to receive an old-age pension in Queensland. But it was a knowledge of cases such as I have described that impelled the members of the Labour Party throughout Australia to carry on the agitation to convince not only the people outside, but members of political parties opposed to them in Parliament, that something should be done to relieve the necessities of the aged poor. I do not believe that the leader of the Opposition intended to do what I think he has done. It seemed to me that the honorable senator desired to brand the money which aged people will be entitled to claim under this Bill as a charitable dole. </para>

He admitted that the poorest man in the community should be just as much entitled to a pension as the man in the highest position in the land, and agreed that under this Bill, whether an aged man had been a member of a fighting force or of a judicial bench, he would be equally entitled to apply for a pension. </para>

I do not believe that there is any charity connected with this proposal, and I am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> should have given me the impression- that in his opinion there is. The honorable senator described the proposal as an " endowment of poverty." It seems to me that for the honorable senator to brand a pension under this Bill with a name like that- </para>

                        <para>- It is not an endowment of poverty. Any old person who may be kept by his children has a right under this Bill to claim a pension, and it cannot be  contended  that the condition of such a person is one of absolute poverty. Under this Bill a man has a right to say, " I have put in thirty or forty years in this country doing my best to develop it and to make it a better place for other people to live in, and, although I happen to be living with members of my own family; I see no reason why I should not come to the State and claim the pension provided for me." Will <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> say that because we cannot at the present time afford to give a pension to wealthy persons who need no pensions we should not therefore provide a pension for the man who does? </para>

                        <para>- I am only too glad that the honorable senator is able to. assure me that for a number of years he has been advocating the principle of old-age pensions. I was pointing out that I regret that any member of the Senate should endeavour to create the impression in the public mind that this is a charitable dole that is proposed to be served out to the aged poor. It seems to me that the Bill provides for something more than that. I can understand that under the Victorian system, where people are brought before a Police Court  and asked to give evidence as to their circumstances, and to say why they are unable to maintain aged relatives, the pension granted should be characterized as a charitable dole. I can understand the charitable allowance which was given in Queensland in certain circumstances being regarded as a charitable dole, for the simple reason that the Government, by paying 5s. per week to old people, induced them to remain out of the benevolent asylum in order to save something like1s. 8d. per head per week. The Government there said we find it cheaper to give you 5s. per week if you remain outside of the benevolent asylum than to pay 6s. 8d. per week for your keep in the asylum. That was an allowance which might well be regarded as a charitable dole, and it was refused by a large number of people in Queensland, who would have no objection to make an application for a pension of 10s. per week under this Bill. If we are unable to provide a pension for every aged person whether he needs it or not that is no reason why we should not provide for one of those who do need it. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator might just as well contend that I should walk down the streets naked because I am not in a position to pay £6 6s. for a suit of clothes, and that I should not get that suit until I had <inline font-style="italic">£6</inline> 6s. to spend. If I had not the <inline font-style="italic">£6</inline> 6s. I should get a suit for 30s., and make the best of it until I could afford to purchase  a  more expensive one. In the same way, we are prepared to accept this Bill as an instalment of what we hope will develop into something better by-and-by. </para>

It is nonsense for honorable senators to taunt us with trying to prove that they were not honest and straightforward in their support of the Bill. We are only glad to see that the party to which they belong has been converted to the principle and to welcome the support which they are giving to the Bill because it extends some assistance to a large number of people in Australia. </para>

                    (Western Australia)  deserving of congratulations for their action in bringing forward this measure- even at this late period of the session and in this year of the Commonwealth's existence. Any one who is conversant with the way in which old persons are treated in those States where there is no scheme of old-age pensions at present must admit that they are subjected to a lot of indignity which this measure will entirely remove. In those States men, simply because they have grown old, are thrown into public institutions and forced to wear a garb which very closely resembles that of a convict.

                    <para>- Yes, in Victoria. Recently a few men were sent to gaol simply because they had grown old. That is not creditable to a new country which is possessed of great material wealth, and which, above all, is boastful of its liberality, progressiveness and humanitarianism. I desire to correct a false impression which appears to be in the mind of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> He said that the representatives of Western Australia were satisfied to pass this Bill in order to obtain a portion of New South Wales revenue to pay old-age pensions in their own State.  That is not correct in any sense. Western Australia is the only' State in a position to pay - with a lot to spare - all the old-age pensions that will be payable within its borders. I am sure that the honorable senator was not conscious of his unfairness when he said that it is not in a position to pay its old-age pensions. </para>

                        <para>- I dare say that he will. First of all, .we acknowledge that this debt is due by the citizens of Western Australia, and it is not correct to say that it is waiting on the border-line of any State in the hope of picking up a surplus from that State with which to pay old-age pensions. It is in a position to pay out of its one-fourth share all the old-age pensions that will be payable within its borders. A statement was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> evidently for the purpose of placing the Labour Party in an unfair position, and not giving them due credit for keeping this humane "measure prominently before the public. ' He mentioned that Western Australia, which had a full representation of Labour members here, did not yet pay old-age pensions. He should remember that, according to the latest determinations, it has the lowest percentage of persons of 65 years of age and over - that is, 1.8. </para>

                        <para>- I mention that fact to show that though Western Australia has sent a full complement of Labour representatives to the Senate, there was not the same intense need for instituting old-age pensions there as existed in the State which he represents. There were 100 per cent, more people entitled to a pension in New South Wales, and apparently its public men, influenced by that fact, and also, I presume, by the presence and the support of the Labour Party, passed an Old-age Pensions Bill. It will be well for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> to remember that if the six Labour representatives of Western Australia had" not been on this floor yesterday, we should not have had an Old-age Pensions Bill to-da.y. A few words more, sir, and I shall have finished, because there is no need to discuss a measure which appears to be received with universal favour. </para>

                        <para>- The object of this Bill is to give the people of the Commonwealth old-age pensions. But the crucial time has passed, and those honorable senators who failed to share in the effort to provide the . necessary funds cannot go before the people and say that they gave or assisted to give them. Yesterday, when the question of providing ways and means for old-age pensions in July, 1909, was before the Chamber, the Opposition, with one solitary exception, voted against the measure introduced by the Government. </para>

I wish to refer to what I consider two blots on the measure. In the first place, it does not deal with the case of a son (or a daughter') who is in opulent circumstances, but is so heartless as not to support his parents. I believe that it would be only natural justice to compel a son or a daughter, if in reasonable circumstances, to support the parents. </para>

                        <para>- The moral law which compels a parent to support his offspring, and which I hope will last as long as civilization, should, with equal logic, be applied to compel the offspring to support the aged parent, when he is no longer able to support himself, provided, of course, that the children are in sufficiently comfortable circumstances to be able to give that help. That is a blot on the measure, and one which I should like to see removed. </para>

                        <para>- The other point I wish to refer to is the inequality of the pension. I had intended to move in that direction, but certainly not in such a way; as to jeopardize the passking of the Bill. I should have liked to see in the Bill a provision which would render a pension of equal purchasing power in all parts of the Commonwealth. It should be remembered that varied conditions obtain throughout this immense continent. In some parts the conditions of life are such that the purchasing power of half-a-sovereign is 20 per cent less than if is in congested areas of population. While we are striving to mete out a measure of even-handed justice to the aged poor, at the same time we should keep in mind the need of giving a pension which would have an equal purchasing power, and be capable of render-' ing equal assistance in every part of this large continent. </para>

That is the one feature of the Bill that does not specially commend itself to me, but, .taking it all in all, I have much pleasure in giving it my hearty support as the first instalment of a reform that will bring sunshine and happiness into the lives of those old men and women whose claims to consideration have unfortunately, been too long neglected. </para>

                    <para>. - I am glad to see that there is really no opposition to the Bill. I am not going to give the Government so much credit as some honorable members have, because if we had not flogged or prodded them on, we should not have had this Bill before us to-night. I, as a Labour member, and one of the  floggers,  take some credit, with others, for having kept' the matter before the Government during the whole of the session. It gives me great pleasure f) be a member of the Senate when such an important Bill is to be unanimously carried. It reminds me of the year 1894 when I became a member of the Legislative Council of South Australia. The question at that time was the granting of the franchise to the women of the State. I had the satisfaction of being there, and, had I not been, the Bill would not have been passed, because the numbers, without me, were equal. When I was first elected to Parliament, I did not belong to the Labour Party. It is only some three years or so since I joined them. When I was a candidate for the Legislative Council, I dropped across a. platform of the National League, and another issued by the Labour Party. On the Labour platform, f found old-age pensions and adult suffrage "for the House of Assembly, and I made my selection'. Since  then, I have had an uphill fight in South Australia in reference to those democratic principles, because a great  many people then thought that if the women of South Australia were given the' franchise; the children- would be neglected, and everything would go wrong. That lias not proved to be the case. At the general election, when 1 was a candidate for the Senate, the principle df old-age pensions was one of the issues. I am proud to congratulate my  colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon,</inline> on having broken away from the tenets of the party which generally supports him. When 1 was a candidate, the National League sent out a circular of which I happened to get a copy, asking for financial assistance and support for their candidate, and setting forth their object as the defeat of the socialistic movement in favour of old-age pensions, and some other measures. That is God's truth, and I presume that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> knows it. I was a little afraid last night that he was not going to be so liberal as he has proved to be to-day. I rejoice that a great number of people in  South Australia have' changed their opinions on the subject, for not only does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> advocate the principle of old-age pensions, but my other colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> advocated it, and, in fact, found it necessary to do so to get where Le is to-day. The honorable senator was not such a strong anti-Socialist. He advocated old-age pensions not only for . men, but also for women; and even went so far as to say he would give a bonus to those who .had the most' children, thereby going beyond our grand and noble Constitution. I congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> on going so far as he. did to-day. He is a gentleman whose ability I admire very much, but when he laid himself out so nicely to show that we have not the money at present to pay old-age pensions, that there would be some difficulty in getting it, and that the members of the Labour Party did not believe in the Bill as it stood, but wanted to make it more general - and so we do - I thought. I could see  His  object. He laid out his net so nicely that he thought we would fall into it, and be caught. He said that the Government, who are likely to be responsible for administering this measure - unless the honorable senator is in power then himself, and I would not mind seeing him there some day - would not have enough money to finance it, and yet .he wanted to extend its scope a great deal. But, as a reader of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> debates for some years back, I know his opinions, and I began to think that his object was to drive us and the Government into a corner, so that the Bill would practically break down of its own weight. But it is a grand measure, and I am proud to think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> - whose position in politics is often very difficult to define, except when he is denouncing the Labour Party- have shown themselves to-day to be on the side of humanity, with .other honorable senators who sit opposite. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to congratulate the Government on bringing in this Bill. I do not think there was a single candidate at the last two Federal elections who did not express himself in favour of old-age pensions. It is a pity that this measure was not allowed to pass without the ungracious and unkindly remarks that have been made here to-night, because we are all at one on the question. I do not know that it is a case of sudden conversion with any honorable senator, because there are men here who do not think with the Labour Party, but who have advocated the principle for many long years. At first, it was not a labour question at all. It was a plank in the platform of the Liberal Party of Victoria. I desire to congratulate the Vice-President of the Executive Council because of his connexion with the passing of the Victorian Old-age Pensions Act in 1899 - the first Act of the kind passed in Australia. There was one in existence then in New Zealand, and the honorable senator was deputed by the Liberal Government of Victoria of that day to go to New Zealand to make inquiries into its working. On his report, a Bill was introduced into the Victorian Parliament by the Government of which he was a member, and passed into law. I am glad that he is here to-night to present this Bill to the Senate, and so to assist in the endeavour to solve what has been one of the world's problems. The question of financial needs has been overdone-. . There are already three States paying old-age pensions, and I suppose that 70 or 80 per cent, of those who will receive pensions in Australia are receiving them now. It is merely a question of transferring the control from one body to another; so that the problem of finance need not trouble us very greatly. The money will be found. The States that are now paying pensions will be relieved of that expenditure, and it would have been only a year or two before the other States would have been compelled to adopt an old-age pensions system on their own account. Not only will this Bill commend itself to Australia, but its passage will put Australia before the world as. having a humanitarian Legislature which is endeavouring to solve a question that has in the past been one of the world's puzzles. </para>

                    <para>. - I should not have troubled to speak on the second reading of this measure, but for some most unnecessary remarks made by my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell. On the first political platform that I ever stood, I advocated the principle of old-age pensions, and I have been a consistent supporter of it from that time. As a Minister in South Australia, I had control of the Destitute Asylum, and nothing gave me greater pain than the. knowledge of the system whereby we had, in a sense, to treat some of our old people. It was a grief to me to see a man and a woman, who had lived together for forty or fifty years and become unable to support themselves, being taken into an institution where they were separated from one another. </para>

                        <para>- Whether there was one case or many the system was bad. Neither did I like the idea of putting a uniform on the old people so as to distinguish them as inmates of a benevolent institution. They were thus branded in a most objectionable way. I have always felt that when a man or woman has lived in the country for a number of years, doing their best honestly as citizens' and bringing up their families, they have a certain claim on the rest of the community for services rendered. For that reason I have always advocated some relief of this kind. I cannot understand some of the things that are being continually dragged into debates of this kind by certain honorable senators. </para>

I think that that is a power that ought to be retained in the hands of Parliament. The matter is one which has come up in relation to other measures quite foreign to old-age pensions, and it involves a distinct principle in itself. On so important a matter Parliament itself should determine. I move - </para>

                    <para>- - I do not think that the amendment is necessary.: Did the finances of the Commonwealth justify us, we should not have inserted this qualification of age in the case of women, but should have fixed it at sixty years. I submit that it is not desirable that we should have to seek the ratification of Parliament as to whether we can at any time afford to make the intended concession. That is a matter for the responsible Government of the day. If any Government chose to take the responsibility of saying that it is desirable that the concession should be made, they could only do so with the  full knowledge of being able to provide the necessary funds. When the proclamation was issued the change would be permanent. The Government is responsible to Parliament. No Government would be so unmindful of its responsibilities as to launch a concession of the kind unless it was prepared to take the responsibility financially. I must apologize for the insertion of a modification of the kind in the present Bill, but I do not want to make the rectification of that modification more difficult by requiring a vote of both Houses of Parliament. </para>

                    <para>. - As the clause is worded it tends to limit the power of Parliament. We do not know what might take place before a proclamation was issued under the clause. We do not know what object Ministers might have in issuing the proclamation at a particular time. It might be issued a few days after Parliament was prorogued, and when we should be powerless to express an opinion. The Minister estimates that to make the pension payable to women of sixty years of age would involve an extra expenditure of from £250,000 to £300,000. For my own part I think that from . £300,000 to £400,000 would be required. I see no objection to retaining the power in the hands of Parliament, but I can see very great objection to leaving it in the hands of. the Government. </para>

                        <para>- There are very few Indians in Australia who are British subjects, and there are very few Asiatics who have become naturalized. When I referred to this matter on the second reading, it was suggested that there is a considerable number in Victoria. I have looked up the last Victorian census, and I find that the total number of Chinese in that State who were naturalized at that time  was 72; comprising 67 males and 5 females. This was the total number of all ages, and' probably not more than four or five would be over sixty-five years of age. It may be admitted that the number of naturalized Asiatics in the Commonwealth is entirely a negligible quantity. At the last census the total number in Queensland was 8,000, and the number above the age of sixty only 540. There is no record of the number naturalized, but it is evident that they must .be very few. We have also to remember that the number of Chinese and other Asiatics in Australia is steadily diminishing. According to the returns, the number of coloured persons who left Australia during the three years 1904, 1905, and 1906 was 16,184. The number arriving in those years was 10,091, showing an excess of departures over arrivals of 6,093, and included in this number is a. total of 2,209 Chinese. </para>

                        <para>- One or two might not have been recorded, but we cannot base our legislation on such a contingency. The figures clearly show that the number of Chinese in Australia is steadily decreasing. I direct attention to the fact that under the naturalization law of the Commonwealth, Asiatics cannot be naturalized. I have here a table giving the list of naturalizations during 1904, 1905, and 1906/ and there is not one Asiatic in the list. I regard the words which .1 propose to leave out as mere surplusage. If they are left out, it is possible that a very few of these persons may become entitled to old-age pensions, but the number is so very small that it is quite unnecessary that, in order to disqualify them, we should go' tq the extreme of using terms in this Bill which we know by experience are offensive to a race like the Japanese. I ask honorable senators in the circumstances to remove what is merely a blot on an otherwise very gracious measure. </para>

                    <para>. - I point out at the outset that this Bill deals with a matter of domestic and internal concern. We must make its terms as precise as we can because upon it, to some extent, we must base our financial arrangements. The honorable senator has said that he desires that the words to which he has referred should be left out, because they are covered by the word " Aliens " in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a.</inline> As a matter of fact, that is not so, and if the words "Asiatics (except those born in Australia) " were left out, the probability is that it would be found' that many Chinamen in Australia were born in Hong Kong. We should be faced with the difficulty of proving whether a Chinaman was born in Hong Kong or in Canton. I take exception to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford's</inline> statement that the words to which he objects are offensive to a friendly race, namely, the Japanese. The suggestion is most unreasonable in view of the fact that in the clause in which they are used, we propose also to disqualify aboriginal natives of Australia, Africa, the islands of the Pacific, and of the neighbouring Dominion of New Zealand. In the circumstances, I think it would be unwise for the Committee to accept the amendment. This question was discussed very fully elsewhere, and the clause was practically recommitted for the purpose of putting it. in its present form, . which was regarded as a compromise; Under these circumstances, I submit that the words should be allowed to remain. </para>

                    <para>) [9.26]. - I quite agree with the Vice-President of the Executive Council -that this is a matter of purely domestic legislation. At the same time,. I think that it would have been much better if it had- been provided in an earlier clause that any person who was a natural -born or naturalized subject should be entitled to a pension, rather than to say that certain persons should not be entitled to a pension. However, we have, passed the clause,- and I think that the clause before the Committee might be amended" in such a way as to show quite clearly that it is not intended to apply to natural-born or naturalized subjects. Of course, I quite agree that aliens are not entitled tq participate in a matter of this kind, but I do not think it is wise to enact that the people of a certain country, merely because they belong thereto,, shall not be entitled to. receive a pension. No matter where he was born, an alien, when he is naturalized, becomes a subject, just as a natural-born individual is a subject, of .the Crown. If we have granted to a Chinaman a certificate of naturalization and made him a citizen of the -Commonwealth, is it not perfectly fair and just that he should have the same rights and. benefits as a natural-born subject is entitled to? The very object of naturalization is to enable a man to acquire the fights of a natural-born subject. . A man can choose  what country or nation he will belong to. Of course, a man is born into a nation, but under the comity of nations he may, if he sees fit, change his allegiance from one country to another. Once we give a certificate of naturalization to a German or a Chinaman, or a Japanese, it is only a matter of reason and justice that he should get what is then impliedly promised to him - all the rights, whatever they may be, which are given to a natural-born subject. Before a man or a woman can be entitled to any benefit under this Bill, he or she is required to have resided in Australia for twenty-five years. Frequently I have listened to debates on this question, and heard it put very forcibly that every man is entitled to his old-age pension if his circumstances are such that otherwise he cannot afford to provide for himself. He is. entitled to that assistance if he has been a resident of the country for a given number of years, and has thereby helped to promote its prosperity. If it is put on that broad basis it becomes very immaterial where a man was born, so long as he has resided in Australia for twenty-five years, and, of course, has obtained a certificate of naturalization. </para>

                <para>The points I wish to make are : first, that when we naturalize a man we promise him the rights of a natural-born citizen ; secondly, that it is entirely within the power of a country to say whether a man shall be naturalized or not. That is a way in which any country can protect itself absolutely. Naturalization does not depend upon the whim or the discretion of an individual. It rests entirely with the Governor-General, acting with the advice of the Executive Council. </para>

In the first place, the word's which he desires to omit are, as he admitted, to a very large extent covered by the word " aliens " in the first sub-clause. Consequently, the worst which can be said "is that it is a matter of surplusage, or, in other words, that it is saying twice what might be said in one line. </para>

Certain aliens have been deported, and I hope that the time will come soon when other aliens of the class that Australia has decided are undesirable, will also be sent to the countries from which they came. I cannot see my way to support an amendment which will have the effect, so far as I can see, of encouraging some of these very people to stay here, so as to get a benefit which they would not obtain in their own countries. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that honorable senators are not quite seized of the fact that these words were very nearly eliminated from the clause in another place last night.. It was only by a majority of, I think, two,, that they were retained. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> is a little mistaken in the ground which he takes with regard to them. I hold that the more earnestly we devote ourselves- to the principle of what is called a White Australia, the more we ought to associate with it every possible courtesy towards the races affected by that policy, and not to take advantage of the first opportunity that offers to do anything which they regarded as offensive. That that view is taken of legislation of this character is undoubted. It was for that reason, and no other, that I proposed the amendment. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> has recognised, the term is surplusage, because all these people are already included in the term "aliens." I cannot see any object in duplicating the exclusion, and, in doing so, causing annoyance to those with whom we ought to try to be on friendly terms. </para>

That does not seem to be honest. We had the opportunity to discriminate whom we would admit to citizen rights and whom we would refuse. We could not compel them to become naturalized, but having granted them naturalization papers, we now turn round and tell them that we did not mean what we then promised. The total number of naturalized Asiatics in Australia is insignificant, and the number entitled to the pension is smaller still. There can be no accession to their numbers, because under our law we decline to naturalize any more of them. The bargain we made when we naturalized some Asiatics may have been a bad one, but as we have made it we ought to carry it out for the sake of the good name of Australia. </para>

Under the Naturalization Act of 1903 we recognised certificates of letters of naturalization given by the States. Now we are asked lo say that those persons shall not be deemed to be entirely naturalized, and to withhold from them the benefits that we give to our own people. That seems a very selfish policy. There are only a few persons concerned ; but there is a good principle involved, and I hope we shall uphold it. </para>

                    (Queensland) [9;43J- I have never believed in the principle of naturalizing Asiatic aliens. We are now making a new departure by giving old-age pensions to- our 'own people, and I do not see that we are bound by what was done in the past to include them. We are not taking anything away from them at all. We are simply refusing to give them something which they had no right to expect at the time they were naturalized. Since then we have refused to naturalize any more of them. We have adopted a White Australia policy which it took years to bring into force. A naturalized Chinaman is not allowed on a mining field, so that this proposal is not a new departure.

                    <para>- - I had intended to move on this clause an amendment similar to that which the Committee have already defeated, in order to make this portion of the Bill come into operation, not upon a proclamation issued at the instance of the Government, but upon a Joint Address by both Houses. Whilst I still hold that that should be done, 1 am not oblivious to the fact that the Committee were strongly against me on the previous amendment, and bearing in mind that_ we are approaching the end of the session, whilst I place on record my view that the principle of the clause is wrong, I do not propose to occupy time by taking another division.' </para>

Under this clause a naturalized subject of the King who has not' been naturalized for three years will be able to claim an invalid pension. This clause and clause 16 should be in conformity, because the cases are on all-fours. Otherwise, we shall run the risk of having people who have been naturalized for only one or two years thrown upon our hands to keep. There is no reason why we should give such a person if he becomes sick an invalid pension under better conditions than if he is over the age of sixty-five, If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> moves an amendment to bring the two clauses into line I shall feel inclined to support him. </para>

                    <para>. - There is a difference between the . two clauses. If a man has been resident in the Commonwealth for twenty-five years, it is reasonable to provide that he should have been naturalized for at least three years before he can draw a pension. But in the case of invalid pensions the applicant must be above the age of sixteen and permanently incapacitated for work by accident, or by reason of being an invalid, and must not be receiving an old-age pension. There is a further provision that the accident which has* incapacitated him must have happened in Australia. A person must be resident at least two years iri Australia to enable him to get naturalization papers. There is also the question of youth to which I previously referred. I do not think, therefore, that the same conditions should be made applicable in this case as in the previous one. </para>

                        <para>- I am not referring particularly to women who. marry Germans, although it is exceedingly desirable that any German who comes to this country, should be naturalized, so that his wife may, retain the privileges of Australian citizenship. But I am referring particularly to  women who marry Chinamen, Japanese, or other Asiatics. I object to their being placed in a position to claim pensions under this Bill. I will tell the <inline font-style="italic">Corn.mittee</inline> why. It would encourage Asiatics to induce white women to marry them. That' is contrary to the spirit of the White Australia policy. Our policy is to discourage Asiatics in every way. By inserting this clause we "shall further postpone the day when we shall have a complete White Australia. The object that I have in view might be met by making sub-clause 2 read - </para>

                    <para>. - I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> not to persist in his amendment. The law is that a woman who marries an alien thereby becomes an alien also. We are following the legislation of the States in this respect. What probably would happen if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> amendment were agreed to would be that, in some cases at all events, the formality of marriage would be dispensed with. But, apart from that, we should err on the side of generosity. A woman who marries an Asiatic is, after all, a British subject, and if she has chosen to permit her affections to wander, she will probably find that she has made a mistake. It is not desirable that we should penalize her under this Bill. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that sub-clause 2 of this clause ought to be left out Clause 17 provides that no person shall get a pension whose property exceeds in value £310. The Government might very well be content with that. Under this clause a person, instead of getting £26 a year, or 10s. per week, would get a great deal less. I hold the opinion that no reduction should be made where the pensioner possesses property under the value of £310. We have heard a good deal about the necessity for encouraging thrift, but this proposal, which apparently is supported by a number of honorable senators, actually discourages thrift. We must not  shut our eyes to the facts, and honorable senators are aware that there are in Australia tens of thousands of men who own the cottages in which they live. It is very desirable that our people should be encouraged to make homes of their own. Instead of being penalized for doing so, as  this Bill proposes, they should be rewarded, because it will not be denied that men who have secured homes of their own have given evidence of good citizenship. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of sub-clause 2 provides that the amount of the pension shall be subject to a reduction of £[i for every complete £[io by which the net capital value of the property exceeds £[100 when it includes a home in which the pensioner permanently resides, and which produces no income. Let us take the case of a man who owns a cottage and land worth <inline font-style="italic">£200.</inline> Such a man would lose £[10 a year of the pension. That is to say he would, tinder this Bill, be called upon to pay £[10 a year for the privilege of living in his own house. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. I do not wish to repeat all the old arguments about the man who denies himself and saves money to secure a home of his own, but honorable senators know that there is a large number of people in Australia who by energy and thrift have built up little  homes for themselves. They know also that there are other people who, whether they have been able to earn enough money for the purpose or not, have not done so. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> says is that the man who has saved, up and secured a little home for himself, should be placed in exactly the same position as the man who has not done so. </para>

                        <para>- Because, unfortunately for them, they would not possess a house. I repeat that what the Bill does is to penalize the man who has provided himself with a home, and to say that he shall be placed in exactly the same position as the mail who has not done so.  What inducement is that to a man to deny himself and save money to obtain a home of his own? There is another aspect of the question which should appeal to honorable senators. ' We all know that 10s. per week is not enough to support any one in comfort unless he lives in a tent in the bush, where he need pay nothing for water or fuel, and can live in the most primitive fashion. But if a man has a little house of his own and 10s. a week, he can live in comparative comfort in many parts of Australia. Of course, I am sorry for the man who has not a house of his own ; but we cannot afford to do anything more for him at present. </para>

Apparently, honorable senators' skulls are so dense and so hard that the hammer of argument in such feeble hands as mine cannot penetrate them. I gather from the interjections which have been made that I should probably not get any support for the amendment I have suggested, and, therefore, I shall abandon it. </para>

                    <para>. - I fancy that a word has slipped into this clause inadvertently. Honorable senators will notice that sub-clause 2 provides that the registrar may bring persons before him and submit questions to them to enable him to present a report to the magistrate as to the circumstances or financial transactions of any claimant or pensioner " or of any relatives of a claimant or pensioner." It appears to me that as the Bill throws no obligation upon relatives this clause has possibly been taken from an Act which did. It is not at all desirable that we should empower the registrar to call upon the relatives of a pensioner or a claimant for a pension, seeing that we in no way put a claim upon them. They are quite outside the transaction ; the Bill does not recognise them, and I do not see what we have to do with the transactions of the relatives of a claimant. If the relatives were called upon to answer questions it would be different, but this clause empowers the registrar to inquire into transactions with the relatives of a claimant. I ask the Minister to agree to the omission of the words. </para>

But why should the registrar question the relative of a claimant as to the relative's circumstances? Suppose, for instance, that a man put in a claim for a pension, the registrar would immediately call his brother, who has had nothing to do with him for years, and examine him, not about the claimant's position or transactions, but about his own position or transactions. </para>

                        <para>- The Bill exempts relatives from any obligation in respect of a claimant. But under this clause, when a man of sixty-five years of age makes a claim for a pension the registrar will simply call his son and ask, not "What has your father been doing? " but " What are your own circumstances and transactions?'.' It means that the registrar will make a confidential report as to the circumstances or financial transactions of a relative of a claimant or pensioner. There can be no need to inquire into the circumstances of a relative, but of course he should be put into the witness-box and asked about the transactions and circumstances of the claimant. In spite of the Minister's assurance I feel certain that this provision has crept into the Bill by a double inadvertence. It crept into the New South Wales Act inadvertently by copying from an Act which did make the relatives of a claimant liable. There is no single senator who will say that it is necessary or desirable to question the relatives of a claimant as to his own personal transactions. </para>

                        <para>- It may appear harmless just now, but as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> pointed out it was inadvertently placed in the New South Wales Act, and probably this is a copy of the provision in that Act. We have heard a good deal about harmless provisions. If it is a harmless provision why was it inserted? Very likely <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> will give great power <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> a registrar, and we do not know how far he may exercise it. </para>

                        <para>- It will certainly be used to influence the magistrate. It will he secret evidence. It is not desirable to put an applicant on his trial. It seems to me that this provision will introduce the curse of the Victorian system, under which inquiries are made by all sorts <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> busy-bodies. If any objection is to be lodged against an applicant, surely it can be heard in a Court! If it is found that a man has no right to apply for a pension, surely there is no need to bring secret evidence against such a character. I do not think that there is any necessity for secrecy.. If a man wrongly applies for a pension he ought to be exposed. If all sorts of people are to be applied to for confidential reports it will mean handing over the administration of the provision to clergymen and other influential men in each district, as is done under the Victorian Act. </para>

                    <para>. - It is obvious that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has not grasped the meaning of the clause. The Bill provides that no inmate of an asylum shall be entitled to a pension, but it presupposes that he may desire to get out and go on the pension list. It, therefore, says to him, " If you are qualified by reason of age whilst still an inmate of the asylum, put in your application. It will be dealt with, and if it is approved of you will be entitled to your pension when you leave the institution, but we will not give it to you while you are there for fear the asylum authorities might take it from you. The moment you leave, however, we will give you a month's pension to start' with in your new life." That is a piece of special generosity; If we were to adopt the New Zealand system the unfortunate man when leaving the asylum would have hardly anything to begin with. Under this Bill he is assured of  £2  - one month's pension - to start his new home on. </para>
