                    <para class="block">Since our last meeting the cable has brought the sorrowful news of the death of the first Marquis of Linlithgow, better known in our midst as Lord Hopetoun, and I think it fitting that the Senate should record its regret at this unfortunate event. It has caused me the greater grief, because, as one of his Ministers when he was Governor of Victoria, I was brought officially and privately into close connexion with him, and had especial opportunities of learning his genuine worth as a man. But it is as first Governor-General of Australia that the Parliament of the Commonwealth cannot fail to recognise the untimeliness of his death. Most of us remember to have seen him sitting in the chair which you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> now occupy. We call to mind the dignity with which he discharged his office, the full constitutional&#39; knowledge which guided and aided him in the realization of its duties, and the charming personality whereby he established such cordial relations with his Ministers. It was as -a. man that he endeared himself to the people of the whole of Australia. By his&#39; ability, his tact, his charity, his gentleness, and his manliness, he gained a firm position in the hearts of the people, and entitled himself to their most genuine regard. In his death Australia has lost a good friend, and the Empire one of its best and greatest citizens. We all deplore the fact&#39; that so promising a . career was so early brought to a close, but can only pay our tribute to his memory by placing on record our appreciation of his worth. </para>

                        <para>. - The motion which the Vice-President of the Executive Council has submitted, and the. extremely appropriate words in which he commended it to our consideration, will, I am sure, have the support of every honorable senator. As he said, it is only fitting that this branch of the Parliament of the Commonwealth should place on record its sense of the loss sustained by the death of one so intimately associated with the inauguration of Federation. The motion which we are about to pass is but a small tribute to the merits of the deceased statesman compared with  that represented by the profound feeling of sorrow which permeated the community when the news of his death was first received. As Lord Hopetoun he, in a peculiar degree, won the esteem and confidence  of the people of Australia. The regard in which he was held was not confined to the people of Victoria, with whom he was particularly associated during his first term of office in this part of the world. It is a singular testimony to his official capacity, his genial disposition, and&#39; his personal charm that, when his term as Governor of Victoria ended, the citizens of a sister State claimed an opportunity to do him honour. I do not think that the Senate could more truly represent the feeling of the people of Australia, or more faithfully give expression to their views, than by placing, by a -motion of this kind, a small tribute on the grave of one who was a faithful servant of the Empire, a  loyal  and genuine, friend to Australia, and, above all, a kind and courteous gentleman. I second the motion. </para>

I had not, like my honorable friend, the opportunity of ministerial service under that distinguished nobleman and statesman, but-, while he was Governor of Victoria, and, later, and more intimately, while he was Governor-General of Australia, I enjoyed his personal friend ship, and I know that what has been said about the regard in which his great powers and his great services caused him to be held falls short of the esteem created by his personal worth. When in England last year I met the Marquis again, and what has been said regarding his friendship for Australia leads me to add that the Commonwealth had no more sincere friend or devoted helper throughout the whole realm of the Empire. The deceased Marquis, referring to the time he spent in this country, spoke to me of Australia as a &#39; lover might speak of his mistress.

First of all, I think that I mentioned that the Government intended introducing a Bill on the subject, and, secondly, that I was unaware of the exact date when it would be introduced. In response to a question by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> as to whether the Agricultural Departments of the States were to be consulted upon the subject, I stated that the Federal Government intended to carry out their own policy. I did observe that the words to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> refers were quoted against! me, but, as a matter of fact, I did not make use of them. That this. Government is determined to establish a Federal Agricultural Bureau I have already intimated to the Senate, and concerning that determination, we do not find it necessary to consult the States Governments in any way. But in determining the scope of the operations of the bureau, we shall be only too pleased to seek the co-operation and cordial assistance of the States Agricultural Departments. In this connexion we shall, of course, be -pleased to learn that the States Governments are prepared to help in the achievement of this very important object. </para>

I have told him that the Government intend to start an agricultural bureau, but that the cooperation of the States Governments will be sought in deciding the scope of its operations. We hope the States Governments will be prepared to afford us every facility and help in achieving the same great end which they have themselves had in view in &#34;th&#39;e establishment of the States Agricultural Departments. It is, of course, the desire of this Government to work with the States Governments in all things. </para>

Consequently I am not in a position to reply fully to. the honorable senator at the present moment. I shall make inquiries with regard to the matter during the course of the afternoon. I have no doubt steps are being taken to remedy what has been complained of, and, if not, I shall submit the honorable senator&#39;s question to the Department as a representation that such steps should be taken. </para>

These two men were transferred to the work on application, and on the certificate of the Public Service Commissioner, 13th January, 1008. </para>
                    <para>Both passed a practical test in the work last September. At this test several applicants were rejected because they were not good enough as workmen. These two men are performing their work satisfactorily. </para>

                (New South Wales) &#91;2.55&#93;. - I beg to move that the House of Representatives be requested to make the duty id. per pound, a rate which I understand would be fully 40 per cent, upon the value of the goods that may come in under this heading. A duty of 2d. would certainly be 80 per cent, on a great deal of the goods imported. I take it that no one desires to place so intolerable a burden upon some of the secondary industries of Australia. Glue and gelatine are both very largely used in connexion with Australian manufactures; and while 1d. per lb. may be &#34; only,&#34; upon some classes of glue, 80 per cent. - if any honorable senator thinks that the word &#34;only&#34; reasonably applies to such a duty - it will be less upon some of the better qualities. As far as I have
                <inline font-style="italic">been</inline>
                able to investigate the matter since we last  met, it appears to me that a duty of id. per lb. will average somewhere about 25 or 30 per cent. on both glue and gelatine as imported. I understand that the difficulties that arose as to the Minister&#39;s proposal last week were finally adjusted by an agreement to place both glue and gelatine under one heading. A duty of id. would amount to materially more than the duty hitherto collected upon . glue. We discussed the subject at considerable length last week, and I do not wish to traverse the ground again. I should like to hear the Minister&#39;s views, and then come to a division. Necessarily glue is used in a great many of our industries. Gelatine is likewise  used very largely. I take it that there is no wish on the part of honorable senators to burden needlessly the industries of Australia by placing too heavy a tax upon the articles required for carrying them on. It was pointed out last week, bv others as well as by myself, that the quality of glue made in Australia is immeasurably superior-  r101 to the glue made on the Continent of Europe, and is practically analogous to the best qualities of glue made in the Old Country. I believe that to be a fact. As a great many classes of glue come into the country, I take it that the duty which I propose is a reasonable compromise in the interests of the revenue, and of certain of our industries.

                        <para>- No, it was thought that they were very heavy duties to impose on gelatine. Duties of  2d.  and ijd. per lb. were, therefore, imposed on gelatine of all kinds, and it was considered that those rates were a material reduction upon the. pre-existing duties. What we now propose to do for the purpose of simplification of administration is to subject glue and gelatine to the same rates of duty, as it is extremely difficult, in some instances, to distinguish between sheet glue and sheet gelatine. The specific duty of  2d.  per lb., under the general Tariff, and of rid. per lb. in respect of imports from the &#34;United Kingdom, will not be higher in regard to the average importations of glue than are the present duties of 30 per cent, and 25 per cent. It may be that  2d.&#39;  per lb. will be a very heavy duty, so far as an exceedingly cheap class of glue is concerned, but that is not the position with regard to the average importations. In dealing with this question it is . unreasonable to argue from a basis which adopts, as the standard of importation, importations of the lowest quality and value. Taking the general average of the quality and value of these importations we say that the duties now proposed are reasonable. They are not equivalent to an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty of 80 per cent, or 60 per cent., and the re-arrangement will simplify the administration and be advantageous to both importers and Customs officials. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot say offhand, but I am given to understand that in respect of the average imports they do not exceed the existing duties of 30 per cent, and 25 per cent. I recognise, how ever, that a duty of even 1&#189;d. per lb. would work out at a very high <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate in respect of cheap inferior glue. In .1903 we imported into Australia 379,621 lbs. of gelatine valued at .&#163;19,559. I am unable, to give for that year the separate importations from the United Kingdom and from other countries. In 1904. we imported&#39; 352,109 lbs. valued at &#163;15,594, and in- 1905 we imported 417,982 lbs., of which- 1 76, 735 lbs. came from the United Kingdom and 241,247 from other countries, . the value of the total importations for the year being &#163;T9:3l7- In 1906 we imported almost the same quantity - a total of 407,040 Iba, of which 157,229 lbs. came from the United Kingdom and 249,811 from foreign countries, the total value being &#163;18,873. I have here the returns in respect of importations of glue and gelatine under the old Tariff heading &#34; n.e.i.&#34; during the years 1903-6. The returns for&#39; 1903-4 do not distinguish between imports from- the United Kingdom and those of foreign countries, but- I am in a position to give the figures under both headings in respect of 1905 and 1906. In 1903 the value of our importations of glue and gelatine n.e.i. was &#163;17,408; 1904, &#163;18,251; 190.S, &#163;21,592 ; 1906. &#163;28,766. In 1905 we imported from the United Kingdom &#163;12,890 worth, whilst our imports from other countries were of a value of &#163;9,002. In 1906 our imports from the United Kingdom were valued at &#163;&#39;3...387, whilst those coming from foreign countries- were valued at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;,15,319.</inline> All these figures go to show that manufacturers of glue and gelatine in foreign countries have been improving their position in our Australian market, whilst those of the United Kingdom have either remained stationary or have been falling back. I hope that honorable senators will see the advisableness of including glue and gelatine in the one item and of imposing upon them a fixed duty. </para>

                <para class="block">The Minister of Home Affairs, having reeled off a long list of&#39; figures that it was impossible for honorable senators to follow, I wish to invite his attention to a few simple facts. In the first place I would point out that at the port of shipment the values of European glue of low quality range from&#163;15 to&#163;20 per ton. It is manifest, therefore, that upon glue valued at ; &#163;i7  10s.  per ton, a duty ofd. per lb. would represent, within the smallest fraction, an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate of  60  per cent. The value of the English-made glue ranges from about&#163;35 to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;40</inline> per ton. In other words, it is practically worth double the amount charged for the bone-made glue of continental Europe. Upon the best quality of glue imported, the duty which I have proposed represents an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate of  30  per cent. Surely we do not wish to burden our home industries by levying, a. higher impost than  30  per cent, upon such a common necessary as glue. A duty of  60  per cent, upon the low-classed article and of  30  per cent, upon glue of the best, quality ought to satisfy the demands of all who desire the success of both our primary and secondary industries. </para>

                        <para>- The statement of the Minister clears the air somewhat. In effect, he says,. &#34; If you will sanction the exorbitant duty that we desire to levy, we shall make it apply also to gelatine, but if you do not, we will continue a want of uniformity which is distressing to the trade, and which is generally deprecated.&#34; I hold in my hand a statement which is unsigned, but which appears to have emanated from some person engaged in the manufacture of glue.  His  contention in favour of imposing a uniform, duty upon glue and gelatine is irresistible. I am astonished that the Minister of Home Affairs should decline to accede to a very desirable proposal on the part of the manufacturers themselves, unless the Committee agree to the higher rate of duty which he has proposed.

                <para>Apparently, the writer is the largest manufacturer of glue in Victoria, because he very strongly sets out reasons why a protective duty should be imposed/ Of course, I look upon the duty proposed by the Minister as entirely a protective duty. Therefore, the only question that we have to consider is - &#39; &#39; What ought protectionists, looking at the matter with a fair mind, to regard ;as a reasonable rate ? &#39; &#39; Of course I should like to see glue placed upon the free list, because it is a necessary article to a number of our most important trades, and if we wish to keep down the cost of the manufactured goods, we ought to keep down the cost of the materials necessary to their production. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has erred,&#39; it is in liberality. He ought to be astonished at his own moderation. No one is more astonished than I am, because the rate on glue under the old Tariff was  20  per cent., under which there was an- importation, half of which in value came from the United Kingdom. Everybody says that the article from the United Kingdom is 6f the very highest quality. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend is always giving us points. His statement shows that we want no more protection. If we can produce an article of quality, in the necessary quantities, and with a profit to the local manufacturers, under a  20  per cent, duty, why should we increase the duty to  30  or  40  per cent., as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> is desirous of doing in his anxiety to be quite fair to the protectionist view?  His  proposal according to his figures is equal to  60  per cent, on the Continental article, and  30  per cent, on importations  from the United Kingdom. Under the old  20  per cent, duty the industry was established, and there&#39; seems to be no reason why we should fix a higher rate. We ought, in this matter, to consider the views of other industries in which glue is used as to what is a fair protection. Glue is used largely in printing. I have here a printed statement, containing a most interesting analysis of certain duties affecting their particular business, from the South Australian Master Printers&#39; and Allied Trades&#39; Association.

                        <para>- I do not profess to have a technical knowledge of all these industries, but I accept the statement I have quoted as coming from a most respectable association. I am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has not moved for a greater reduction, but no one, having regard to all these considerations, can possibly hesitate to assent to his proposal. The protectionist manufacturer from whose circular I have already quoted wants a specific duty on glue and gelatine, advocating either  2d.  per lb., with Jd. preference, or even i&#163;d. per lb. on the foreign importation, and id. on the importation from Great Britain. Therefore, that manufacturer is himself willing to take duties of i&#163;d. and id. per lb. In face of those statements, there cannot - with&#39; great respect to the views put from the Ministerial side - be any serious objection to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild&#39;s</inline> proposal. It is, from my point of view, too high, but it is  50  per cent, less than what the Government suggest, and if I can persuade the Minister of Home Affairs to give way, I shall be glad. If he yields, I shall have succeeded in producing a fair compromise. That is all it can be called, for it is not by any means the lowest duty that we might expect on an article used so extensively in other industries. </para>

But I have seen instances of furniture that would not bear its own weight because of the low character of the glue used in it. I have seen furniture being carried home by one part, and another part of it dropping away, because bone glue or other deleterious matter from the Continent of Europe had been used in if. </para>

                        <para>- I am talking now of the character of the glue. Some of it is so bad that if possible we ought to exclude it altogether. It is not disputed that the high-class glue from the United Kingdom is manufactured in the same way and from the same kinds of material as is the Australian glue - from tanners and curriers&#39; fleshings, and hide pieces, which make the purest and best kind of glue and gelatine. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> says that the duty he proposes is only 30 per cent, . on the British article. I am inclined to think that it is not 30 per cent, on the average ; but if his calculation is correct, I see no reason why we should not preserve what is essentially an Australian industry, the raw material of which we produce in abundance - an industry which in its prosecution would lead to the conversion into a commercial product of what otherwise would be entirely wasted. Fleshings and hide pieces are the refuse, if I may so express it, of the tanner; but&#39; by encouraging their manufacture into glue and gelatine we create a substantial asset for the people of Australia, keeping the raw material in the country, and attaining the desired end of affording employment. It is extremely important that we should provide raw material reliable for the purpose for which it is destined, so thai; there may be substantial and useful results. </para>

                    <para>. - I could &#39;not quite follow the figures of the Minister of Home Affairs, but they would appear to show that in this connexion Great Britain is going back. According to the statistics of imports for 1906, I find, however, that the value of the imports of glue, gelatine, and cements, n.e.i., from the&#39; United Kingdom in . 1906 was &#163;19,011, as compared with a value of &#163;9,000 from other countries. I may further point out that the Minister, in speaking of gelatine being the. same as glue, did not tell us what isinglass is. </para>

                    <para>. - I intend to support the request proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild.</inline> It is very difficult for the Customs or any other authorities to fix the value of low-grade glue, and, therefore, there is a temptation on the part of importers to give valuations that are not. altogether correct. Under the circumstances, I think that a fixed duty is justified, but, at the same time, I cannot agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> when he contends that low-grade glues should not be imported. If we take upon ourselves to fix a standard of that kind in regard to all importations, we shall find ourselves on very dangerous ground. So long as people know the imported . article is what it pretends to be, and it contains no injurious ingredients, it ought to be left to the purchaser to choose the quality he desires, the price being regulated accordingly. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to correct a wrong impression on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane.</inline> When I quoted the figures as to United Kingdom imports, I said that I could only speak as to the years 1905-6, and pointed out that in the latter year the value of glue and gelatine, n.e.i., imported, was &#163;28,766, of which , &#163;13,387 came from the &#39; United Kingdom, and &#163;15,379 from foreign countries. In the previous year the total importation under this head was &#163;21,592, of which &#163;12,590 worth came from the United Kingdom, and &#163;9,000 worth from foreign countries. These figures would seem to show that in our market for this article Great Britain is going back, while other countries are coming forward. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> said he was unable to follow my figures, and quoted statistic* showing that in 1906 the importations oi glue, gelatine, and cement were valued at  &#163;19,011 from the United Kingdom, and, as there was a total importation of  &#163;28,766, this left  only &#163;9,000 worth from other countries. Those figures are perfectly correct so . far as they go ; but had the honorable senator looked at the next two columns,, he would have found there set forth the country of origin of the imports. The total importation from the United Kingdom was valued at &#163;19,011, but of that only &#163;13,387 worth was produced in the United Kingdom, and those were the figures to which T referred. Out of the &#163;19,000 odd worth, <inline font-style="italic">-&#163;1</inline> 3,000 odd worth was produced in the United Kingdom, while &#163;6,000 worth was produced in other countries, and came to Australia through the United Kingdom. It will be seen, therefore, . that the honorable senator is under a mistaken impression. </para>

                    <para>. - I am now in favour of an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty, for the reason that one can hardly tell the difference between the articles. We have agreed to item 91, under which isinglass in sheets , is admitted free, and isinglass, n.e.i., at a duty of 15 per cent. According to a definition in the&#39; <inline font-style="italic">Century Dictionary,</inline> which I have just consulted, isinglass is &#34;the purest commercial form of gelatine.&#34; It is proposed to admit good gelatine free, and to levy a duty of 30 per cent, on what is called very inferior gelatine, but which may not be inferior gelatine at all. I think that there is an incongruity in doing that. I hope that the Minister will agree to treat glue in the same way as isinglass. </para>

                        <para>- I am quoting from the evidence which was. given before the Tariff Commission, and I take it that it is reliable. One of the reasons why we are asked to impose a stiff duty, and, I believe, to prefer a specific duty, is the difficulty in distinguishing between low-grade glue and usable gelatine. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> addressed himself to that argument. I think that instead of carrying his argument home, all he did was to show that Customs officers had admitted goods which were nothing less than fraudulent. I find that the price of locally-made gelatine  - and it was not of. a first-class character either - ran from <inline font-style="italic">675 1</inline> to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;9&#176;</inline> )er t ton. The price of imported high-class gelatine ran from &#163;125 to &#163;130 per ton; it was imported in half sheets, and, I suppose, used in making the higher class of confectionery. As the prices of glue and gelatine vary so much, I think that it would be difficult to refute the argument in favour of an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty. The low-class glues, if suitable for cheap furniture or other work, will pay a correspondingly low duty, and the other grades will pay a correspondingly high duty. As a very good glue is placed on the market at a very reasonable price, an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty will probably have the effect of excluding low-class glues, and will, I think, be for the benefit of the trade and the consumer. The Sydney Chamber of Commerce, which  includes  both protectionists and free-traders, and may be considered to have gone into the matter carefully and to represent a moderate view, have strongly recommended the imposition of an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty on glue and gelatine. I am inclined to support their recommendation, and I hope that the Government will see fit to give way. </para>

I am quite prepared to admit that difficulty, and also to recognise the desirability of bringing them under one head, but that is no argument against the imposition of an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty. It is quite true that it may be difficult to determine where glue ceases to be glue and becomes gelatine, and <inline font-style="italic">vice versa,</inline> but the Department have had no difficulty in determining the value of a commodity whether it be glue or gelatine. </para>

                        <para>- Then this stuff is being introduced under fraudulent invoices. The same thing applies to hundreds of other articles. The Customs officers have either to take the invoices; or to find expert evidence to enable them to determine whether the value set out in an invoice is correct or fraudulent. I cannot conceive that there will be any. more difficulty in ascertaining the true market value of various grades of glue and gelatine. -.1 want to show how inequitably a fixed duty will work. Some glue, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has pointed out, runs as low as i$d. per lb., while some gelatine runs as high as £100 per ton, being equal to is. od. per lb. If we take a fixed duty of id. <inline font-style="italic">per</inline> lb., it works out at 9 per cent, on high-class gelatine, and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has shown, at 60 per cent, on low-grade glue. Trades which use large quantities of low-grade glue - bookbinders, box makers, and furniture makers - will have to pay a duty  of 60 per cent., while trades which use a higher . class product will be required to pay only 9 per cent. duty. That  discrepancy is-  too great, I think, to justify us in blindly adopting a fixed duty. An <inline font-style="italic">ad&#39; valorem</inline> duty does appear to. me to fit the circumstances of this case. It will be much more equitable. The only argument against it is that a fixed duty may save the Customs officials a little trouble. If the difference between the two duties were little, I should advise honorable senators to adopt a fixed duty, but when it runs from 9 to 60 per cent., the inequality, the unfair incidence, of a fixed duty is so pronounced that we should not &#34;hesitate to throw upon the Customs officials any little additional trouble which may be involved if we adopt an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> duty. For these reasons I propose to vote against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild&#39;s</inline> request. He desires to avoid the difficulty which would be created  by dealing with glue and gelatine in separate items, and to reduce the rate of duty,; but I cannot lose sight of the fact that the adoption of a fixed rate will hide the amount of protection really given. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator -Neild</inline> admits that the fixed duty of id. which he intends to propose would he equivalent to an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty  of 60- per cent., while the Government fixed rate is equivalent to 120 per cent. No set of men in Australia would dare to openly propose an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate of 120 per cent., and the adoption of a fixed rate makes the imposition seem less serious. A fixed rate presses so unequally on the various grades of glue that it seems to me that the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> principle, is a fairer one to adopt. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the&#34; &#39;Committee will not act too hurriedly in this matter. The opinion has been generally expressed that glue and gelatine should be classed together, and that being so, we must see that whatever rate is imposed on- glue will furnish adequate protection to manufacturers of gelatine. That the old rate was not sufficiently protective is proved by the fact that in 1905 the importations were a little over &#163;21,000, arid in 1906 over &#163;28,000 in value. The Minister of Home Affairs has shown that this increase is largely accounted for by importations, not from the United Kingdom, but from foreign countries. When the Tariff Commission was taking evidence, the statement was put before it that the glue coming from certain parts of Europe was inferior in quality, being made from bone, and not having adhesive properties comparable with those of the glue manufactured in Great Britain or of that made here. As to the difficulty of determining between glue and gelatine, the Customs Department was very definite. </para>

                        <para>- I am riot dealing with isinglass. Although a duty of id. per lb. may be sufficient protection against the inferior qualities of glue, it will afford inadequate protection in regard to gelatine. I hope that the Committee will make the duty at least 2d., so that the makers of gelatine may be properly protected. If we do not provide a sufficient amount of protection, the result will be that inferior glue, imported at a low price, will be used in Australian manufactures, and will reflect no credit upon them when they come into general use. Instead of giving what we produce in Australia a good name, the result will be that our productions will be given a bad name. If, by imposing an adequate duty, we can not only foster the production of gl&#39;ue and gelatine in the Commonwealth, but at the same time prevent the use of inferior imported glue and gelatine which would jeopardize the reputation of Australian manufacturers, we ought to have no hesitation as to the course to pursue. </para>

As a matter of fact, I am informed on the very best authority that the greater proportion of the glue produced in Australia might be used as gelatine, and that it is largely used in the manufacture of confectionery. If it is of the quality indicated by that statement, a duty of 2d. per lb. on the imported article is. not too high, and, in the circumstances, I hope that the request before the Committee will be negatived. </para>

                    <para>.- I understood that the object of the Government and of honorable senators was to classify glue and gelatine in the one paragraph of this item. But my impression also was that although 2d. a lb. may have been a fair duty on the higher qualities of glue, it was a very low duty on gelatine, and particularly on the higher classes of gelatine. Seeing that the duty of 2d. per lb. as affecting the two items, gelatine and glue, was not adopted, I certainly consider that 2d. per lb. is too little as to gelatine only. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; and the case is just the same with honorable senators opposite ; they are trying to get their own way, and cannot blame others for wishing to do the same. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> is just as well aware as I am that gelatine sometimes costs <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100</inline> per ton. A duty of i&#163;d. per lb. on such gelatine would amount to less than 15 per cent. Honorable senators opposite are too fond of saying that Australia is quite able to manufacture the lower grades of commodities, but must never have a chance of going in for the production of the superior article. </para>

                    <para>. - I must say that honorable senators opposite, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> is to be taken as advocating their views, are playing fast and loose with the Committee. On the previous item, glue, they pleaded with the Committee to amalgamate the duty with that on gelatine, because of the practical impossibility of the Customs authorities determining whether an article was glue or gelatine. Now, however, when it is a question of getting a higher duty, as the honorable senator says, he overlooks the impossibility of the authorities telling the difference between glue and gelatine, and he is prepared to have a higher duty on gelatine than on glue. I can only say that the honorable senator is not only discounting the weight which ought to attach to his- arguments on this question&#62; but must make honorable senators slow to accept them on any future occasion. If an honorable senator is going to plead that black is black in one moment and five minutes afterwards pleads that black is white, very little importance can be attached to his utterances. The very argument that induced the Committee to make the duty on glue a fixed1 one was to bring it into the same item with gelatine. That argument was quite irrespective of the amount of the duty. It is curious that the argument used for amalgamation when there was a chance of using it as a lever to raise the duty appears to be of no value when we are asked to consent to a slight reduction. </para>

                        <para>- If my honorable friends can explain these facts away, I shall be glad to hear them. I have no desire to misrepresent the position. As a matter of fact, I went carefully into the evidence on both sides with respect to glue. I was delighted to find that what I had said of my own knowledge of Tariff matters generally was confirmed by this witness, who declared that the high duties imposed in 1902 were engineered for the purpose of forming combines. One manufacturer said he would be satisfied with a duty of ijd. per lb. under the general Tariff, and of id. per lb. in respect of imports from the United Kingdom. He had? . invested &#163;15,000 in establishing a glue factory at Alexandria, New South Wales, and if the duties he suggested were imposed, would be willing to put more money into the concern for the manufacture of gelatine from wholesome materials. I wish to emphasize the point that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Firth&#39;s</inline> evidence showed that the imposition of high duties would serve the purpose of speculative combines. </para>

                        <para>- What has the height of the duty to do with the question? When I appealed to the Government a few &#34;moments ago to say whether or not there was an understanding that whatever rate we decided to request another place to fix upon glue, should also be applied to gelatine, because of the difficulty of discriminating between the two, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> cheered my remarks. That was only natural, because there was no room for argument; if there had been,  the citation made from the evidence of &#39; a manufacturer ought to have been conclusive. That witness said that it was absolutely impossible, by analyses or otherwise, to discriminate between glue and gelatine, and that gelatine could be invoiced as glue, and the revenue defrauded. A difference in the rates would not overcome the difficulty of discrimination, and if we have decided to request another place to impose a duty of i&#163;d. per lb. on glue, we surely ought to make the same request in respect of gelatine. If that course be followed the difficulty will be overcome, and we shall withdraw from importers the temptation to bring in gelatine as glue - a temptation which would exist if a higher duty were imposed in respect of the, first-named article. </para>

                    <para>. - I have been somewhat astonished at t3ie statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane,</inline> and more particularly by his closing assertion that this composition is not made in Australia. I have here samples of composition made in Sydney, and sold very extensively in the Commonwealth. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator&#39; Macfarlane,</inline> and .others, probably, I have been in receipt of a number of letters, urging that printing roller composition should be admitted free, and pointing out that it is not made in the Commonwealth. For my own satisfaction I have made inquiries, and find that it is manufactured here, and that the locally-made composition is used with great advantage. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> declared this to be a composition of tallow and grease. As a matter of fact, it is made of glue, glycerine, and sometimes of treacle, in a hard as well as in a soft, form. For my own information, yesterday, when returning home, I called . at a printing office, and without- acquainting any one with the object of my visit, had an opportunity of seeing how this composition is used. I find that on all printing machines a number of rollers are used- to convey the ink, first of all, from the reservoir to a slab, over which it is distributed evenly, and finally over the face of the type. I also learned the process by which the roller stocks are covered. The composition is cut up, melted down, and poured into a mould in which the stock is fixed. After the liquid has set the roller is removed, and the edges having been cut off, it is ready to fulfil the functions I have described. During my visit I chanced to ask one of the employes where this printing roller composition, was obtained. He informed me that it was imported, but when I looked closely at it I saw the name of a Sydney manufacturing firm upon it. I then pointed out to him that it came from New South Wales, and he replied, &#39;&#34; That is what I mean. It is imported from Sydney.&#34; This little incident will serve to show that there are some persons in the community who have not yet adopted our technical name of &#34; transfer &#34; in relation to goods which are transported from one State to another. Tt is a singular thing that whilst some of the communications which I have received from printers ask for the free admission of printing, roller com position, they request an increased duty upon advertising matter entering the Common wealth. In replying to these communications I took the trouble to point out that the last paragraph was entirely inconsistent with the first. .1 am sure that  a  large quantity of printing roller composition is made in the Commonwealth, and that a great deal more could be manufactured here. </para>

                        <para>- The A section of the Tariff Commission recommended the imposition of 35 per cent, upon this article, which is the rate that we have adopted. The price of the locally-manufactured printing roller composition ranges &#34;from is. to is. 3d. a lb., and it is a fact that the imported article has been sold in the Commonwealth at less than the quoted London prices. Of course this dumping was intended to displace the Australian-made article. A printing roller composition ranging in value from lod. to is. per lb. is also imported from Germany. I think that upon further reflection those printers who desire to see a duty of 6d. per lb., or 35 per cent., whichever returns the larger revenue, levied upon advertising matter entering into the Commonwealth will be prepared to extend to the manufacturers of printing roller composition a measure of protection such as they themselves would enjoy.- I have no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> who has a more intimate acquaintance with the technicalities of the printing trade than, perhaps any other honorable senator, will be able to say whether this composition can be made in the Commonwealth. I trust that the Committee will adhere to the 35 per cent, rate proposed. </para>

As a matter of fact, a great deal of it is produced in Australia.. I agree with the Minister of Home Affairs that some of the printers .who have communicated with honorable senators by means of circular are highly inconsistent, in that whilst urging the imposition of an increased duty upon printing matter entering the Commonwealth they claim, that printing roller composition should be admitted free. As one who has some little acquaintance with the printing trade, I know that the roller composition manufactured in the Commonwealth is very superior to much of the imported article. My experience has taught me that it lasts . longer and gives greater satisfaction to those who are in charge of the printing machines than does the imported article. </para>

                        <para>- Because the industry has not yet been thoroughly established. The manufacturers of printing roller composition have had but a limited market, because the operation of the former rate of duty permitted the imported article to enter the Commonwealth at unfair invoice prices. Of course, the big market for this composition is provided by the large daily newspapers; but probably because the imported article can be bought for slightly less than can the locally-produced &#39; article,  they prefer the former, notwithstanding that some of them profess to be imbued with strong protectionist principles.. I trust that the Committee will not agree to a reduction of the duty proposed. in the schedule. Thirty-five per cent, may appear to be a fairly high rate, but experience has shown that no matter what may be the duty levied upon this article, its price to the consumer has not been increased.  </para>

As a matter of fact, one witness before that body stated that when in New Zealand, he found that the Sydney roller composition was being sold there at a lower price than was the article from abroad. Every printer throughout the Commonwealth has to use a certain quantity of this composition, and if we impose a prohibitive duty upon it, we shall deprive our local manufacturers of all incentive to improve its quality. Surely the rate proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> is sufficient, especially when we take into consideration the freight and other charges incidental to its importation, which make it approximate closely to  30  per cent. </para>

                    <para>-  I regard  35  per cent, as a monstrous duty  to impose on any material used by printers. It is tantamount to taxing knowledge, which is a great error. The old duty of  20  per cent, seems to have enabled the manufacture of printing roller composition to &#34;have been carried on successfully. As a matter of fact, the term &#34;manufacture&#34; is a misnomer, in this connexion, inasmuch as  the whole process of production consists of mixing together several ingredients. I do not think that any of our leading printers ever dream of using the locallyproducedarticle. </para>

                    (New South Wales1)  &#91;5.6&#93;.  - I have received a number of communications upon this matter, but I regret that I am unable at the moment to put my hands on them. Indeed, one has been so utterly overwhelmed with communications that if one is not supplied with a private secretary it is almost impossible to keep them in order. But I know what roller composition is, and I think that  35  per cent, is a duty out of all reason. The making of this composition is no more a manufacture than is the making of whitewash. You get lime and water and mix them - and that is a manufacture ! You take glue, molasses, . and something else, stir them together, warm them up, and you have this roller composition. It is really a farce to call the process a manufacture. No matter how much is made here, it can only give an odd job to an occasional apprentice, because I suppose there is not a printing establishment in the Commonwealth that uses half a cwt. a week, and when it has been used it can be heated up and used over and over again. Consequently the Quantity consumed in the Commonwealth is infinitesimal. The rate asked for is unreasonable, but I am quite in agreement with the Minister that applications for a reduction in one instance, and for an increase in another, do not come very pleasantly to honorable senators, because there is so palpably involved,&#39; not a. question of principle, but a question of pocket interest in one of its most unpleasant forms. I shall vote against the  . 35  per cent., but I do not think that the rate suggested is likely to be carried, being a little extra low.

                    <para>. - I support the higher duty. It is rather amusing to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> say. that there is no manufacture in connexion with this industry, and- that it is something like mixing lime and water. If that is the case, surely we can perform such a simple little task in Australia without asking a foreign country to do it for us. If we cannot, then what industry will be suitable for Australia, and what can Australians do?&#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> stated that all the big printing firms were anxious to secure the imported article, because the local material was not as good. </para>

Here are one or two of the firms who use the local production :. - Sands and McDougall, one of the largest printing firms in the Commonwealth -  80  per cent, of their rollers are made in Victoria ; within five minutes&#39; walk of this building, our Government Printing Office also uses it; McCarron, Bird, and Company, one of the largest printing firms in Collins-street, and Messrs. Mason, Firth, and McCutcheon, use it. I am glad to say that there, is at . least one patriotic newspaper in Melbourne that uses the local article - I refer to the <inline font-style="italic">Herald.</inline></para>

                        <para>- There seems to be a little misapprehension. I was not one of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> candidates in Victoria. This is an industry that should be established here, although it may be true that the work is simple. If the newspapers in the other States do not use Australian-made composition, I hope, as a Victorian, to enable them to do so, by giving the local makers protection against imports from other countries. Practically the whole of the composition rollers used in Australia should be made in the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>. - I understand that it has already been pointed out to the Committee that the price of the imported roller composition is considerably higher than that of the local article. It cannot&#39;, therefore, be said that the cutting of prices by importers is in any way affecting the local industry. The difference between the two compositions comes in in this way : I do not say that the local composition is not quite suitable- for certain purposes. In fact, with smaller plants, where the speed is less, it is quite suitable for requirements, but in the case of high-speed machines it has not been found to give satisfaction. That is the reason why printers all over the Commonwealth are to-day content to pay considerably more for the- imported article. Do honorable senators1 suppose that they are doing it for mere fun, or that they give something like  30  per cent., more for their composition merely on account of a prejudice? </para>

I quite understand that honorable senators opposite would be at all times willing to pay a much higher price for a local article than they could get the imported one for. </para>

                        <para>- I do not care what the Tariff Commission says. The men who are buying it to-day affirm that the price they pay for the imported is higher than the price of the local article. The sole reason for that is that for certain high-speed machines it is necessary to have the tougher product which the manufacturers in other parts of the world make. Quite apart from that, the measure of duty which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> has moved for is ample for all requirements. The old duty was 20 per cent. The Government proposition of 35 per cent, means an increase of 75 per cent. Surely there ought to be some limit to the amount of these increases. I object altogether to the bare supposition- which indeed seems the gospel of many honorable senators - that so long as a manufacturer says he wants something it is the bounden duty of protectionists to give it to him. Protectionists, much as they may be attached to their theory, ought to have some underlying reason for every duty which is placed in trie Tariff. To propose to increase the duty by 75 per cent., upon absolutely no showing at all, merely because somebody asks for it, indicates that honorable senators are forgetting what really underlies the protectionist theory - to afford a sufficient measure of protection to enable local manufacturers to carry on without unduly penalizing those who have to buy the articles. I would suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> that he might commend his proposal, not to myself, but to a large number of honorable senators, if he made it 25 per cent, on imports under the general Tariff with a view to proposing 20 per cent, on imports from the United Kingdom. That would leave the duty as against Great Britain the same as the old one, with an increase to 25 per cent, against the outside world. </para>

                    <para>. - I would urge upon the Committee the advisableness of considering very seriously the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane,</inline> who is now prepared to increase the duty somewhat. While the impost may certainly affect &#39;the &#39;large newspapers with which we are acquainted and which we see every day, it should also be remembered that owing to the increase in the use of roller composition the little newspapers all over Australia, and the little job printers - men who have a hard struggle to live - will also be affected. In no other country in the world are there so many newspapers in proportion to population as in Australia. The general education of the public, in connexion with the industries, resources, and politics of the country, by means of newspapers, is a thing that we ought not to deplore, but should rather encourage. I speak with some knowledge, as I have been connected with a country newspaper all my life in Australia, and I know the hard struggle that the small newspapers have to live. </para>

                        <para>- It is bound to do so until sufficient composition, is produced in Australia to supply all requirements. That will be a long time ahead. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is absolutely correct in saying that, with modern and very delicate machines, it is necessary to have the hardest and toughest of roller composition - and the very best. So far as my experience goes, a very hard composition is not made in Australia. That made here is rather soft. I appeal to the Committee to consider before piling up an enormous increase of duty on one of the working tools of a large number of small men who are spreading education throughout the country and helping to advertise Australia by means of the press. </para>

                        <para>- I venture to say exactly the contrary. I should say that this printer uses the 20 per cent, of imported material because it is absolutely necessary for his business. Sands and McDougall, a firm of the strongest protectionist views, are compelled to purchase composition from abroad, because it is absolutely necessary in their business. Therefore I think that a prohibitive duty, which will affect all printers, large or small, ought not to be imposed. Printers have now to pay considerably higher prices for their paper and other material. </para>

                    <para>. - We have been told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> that printers are paying- more for everything they use than they did formerly ; but I contend that their expenses are not within 30 per cent, of what they were twenty years ago. This only shows the absurdity of statements which honorable senators are prepared to make when they are defending the foreign manufacturer as against the local manufacturer. I should like to point out why a duty of 35 per cent, was recommended in preference to the old duty. A duty of 30 per cent, was recommended on glue, and a duty of 2d. per lb. on gelatine - which enter largely into the manufacture of roller composition - and, therefore, the duty of 35 per cent, was suggested in the case of the latter commodity. We have still further increased the duty on glue to the extent, in some cases, as has been contended, of 60 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- I am not saving that it is. But we have been told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that he cannot tell where glue finishes and gelatine commences. I do not think the refined gelatine would be used in the manufacture of roller composition, but rather that a good class of glue would be preferred ; and, as some honorable senators have declared that a duty of 1&#189;d. per lb. on glue means more than 30 per cent., a duty 0/ 35 per cent, is little enough for roller composition. </para>

                <para class="block">That is confirmation of my statement. A local manufacturer asks for an increased duty; but he admits that the imported stuff is selling at 3d. per lb. more than the local product;. I should like, in fairness, to point out that this witness went on to say that there were some cheaper German compositions on the market. We know that a very large quantity of the composition used for machines, as distinct from hand-rollers, is of a quality known as the &#34;durable,&#34; and it is this which sells at 3d. per lb. more than the local product. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has told us that the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 35 per cent., in order that the makers of roller composition should have protection to the extent of 5 per cent, over the cost of their raw material. I am willing to meet the honorable senator in such a recommendation ; but he overlooks the fact that when that recommendation was made the duty on glue and gelatine was 30 per cent., whereas now the duty on these commodities has been reduced. </para>

                        <para>- One must be incorrect, and, therefore, I warn honorable senators to place no reliance on this later calculation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen. Senator Neild,</inline> who is now acting as Temporary  Chairman,  declared a duty of id. to mean about 30 per cent. The honorable senator proposed a duty of id., and in doing so, he gave the Committee the benefit of his calculations that on the very low-classed glues it would be about 60 per cent., and that generally it would be about 30 per cent. Now that the duty is fixed at 1&#189;d. per lb., <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> tells us that it is far below 30 per cent., in fact, about 15 per cent. Apparently his statement was made to suit the exigencies of the argument, and thereby loses whatever effect a serious statement made by an honorable senator ought to have in dealing with matters of this sort. I feel that we shall be perfectly safe in putting a high protective duty on roller composition, because there must be within the Commonwealth the power to produce the article up to any standard required. To my knowledge, it has been made in Australia for over forty years. I saw it made in Tasmania over forty years ago.. </para>

My statement with regard to the duty on low-grade glue was perfectly correct. I was particularly liberal to the local manufacturer of roller composition when I put the protection at 20 per cent. I find that the same witness, as I quoted before - a Melbourne manufacturer of roller composition - informed the Tariff Commission that - </para>

                        <para>- Is the honorable senator now going to dismiss this protectionist-manufacturing witness because his statement does not happen to suit him? I have quoted a statement which appears in a report signed by the honorable senator, and which therefore I accept with respect. If the witness is paying,&#39; as he states, &#163;120 a ton for imported glue, a duty of id. per lb. works but at  8  per cent., which I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> to note. The manufacturer is not using, glue on which a duty of id. per lb. becomes 60 per cent.,&#39; and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> I have not the slightest doubt, knew that perfectly well when he tried to .persuade . the Committee to the contrary. There is a duty of  8  per cent, on the raw material of the witness. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> says that he only wants a margin of 5 per cent, between the duty on the raw material and that on the made-up article. Although 5 per cent, added to  8  per cent, would make 13 per cent., yet he is fighting for a duty of 35 per cent. </para>

                <para class="block">Under item 264 slate slabs split, with rough edges, are dutiable at 15 per cent., and item 265 deals with slate slabs to which further manufacturking processes have been applied. But there has been considerable confusion as to the exact meaning of the item. Importers continue to urge that slate slabs properly coming under item 265 invariably have planed and not chiselled faces, and contend that the planed slabs are equivalent to the chiselled slabs. The Department, however, holds that the planed slabs are slabs which have been subjected to further manufacturing processes than entitle them to come within item 265, and therefore treats them as dutiable under item 266 as &#34; Wrought slate, n.e.i.,&#34; define ing chiselled slabs as slabs roughly faced by hand work with a. chisel. It is proposed, however, to subdivide item 265, making dutiable at 20 per cent, slabs the face of which has been chiselled, and at 30 per cent, slabs which have been treated abroad to more than chiselling, that is to say, which have been planed. If this classification is adopted, importers will not be in doubt as to whether their goods come under item 265 or under item 266. </para>

                        <para>- Item 266 deals with wrought slate, n.e.i., that is, slate not specifically included in any other item. The slabs which will be dutiable at 20 per cent, will be those roughly faced by hand work, having one or more sawn edges. They must have all these features before they are dutiable at 20 per cent., otherwise they could be introduced at 15 per cent. When the slabs are carried beyond that stage of treatment, and are imported with planed faces, I am assured that they are imported ready for use, and we suggest that they should be dutiable at 30 per cent. Instead of letting them fall under the n.e.i. item we propose to specifically set out in the Tariff that they shall be dutiable at 30 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- There seems to be the impression that the sawing is done for the purpose of preparing the slates for use, when, as a matter of fact,. it is done in much the same way as a saw-miller breaks down a log. The sawing of slates is not in any sense a manufacturing process to prepare them for use, but is done merely in order to facilitate the transport of the article. We might offer in this Tariff an inducement for the importation of slate in the block, but we do not do that. </para>

                        <para>- This will prove to be one of the items under which the Customs officials will discover some reason for bringing the article imported within a description under which it will become dutiable. What I intended to suggest to the Minister in regard to this item is this - and here again, as I have had frequently to say during this Tariff discussion, I am not putting forward to its full extent the View I hold, but a proposal which  1  think might induce the Minister to concede a little : This slate, with one or more planed faces is, as was said just now, not the same as that covered by the n.e.i. provision at 30 per cent., but it is still to bear the same duty. It seems to me that if the Ministerial design of a gradually rising duty according to the amount of preparation to which the slate has. been subjected prior to importation is to be properly carried out, the Minister should agree to make the duty under the new paragraph  b  he proposes 25 instead of 30 per cent. Slate absolutely in the rough would then be dutiable at 15 per cent. ; slate with some slight preparation, 20 per cent., if prepared to a little greater degree, 25 per cent., and where completely dressed and ready for use it would be dutiable at 30 per cent. I am not saying that if those duties were agreed upon the proportion would-be absolutely correct, but it would, at any rate, conform more nearly to the design evidently in the mind of the author of this section of the Tariff. I ask the Minister to consent to a duty of 25 per cent, on the proposed new paragraph  b. </para>

                    <para>. - There appears to be some little misunderstanding as to the way in which slate is taken out of a quarry. It does not come out of a quarry in blocks but in slabs of varying thickness, and when the edges have been sawn and one face planed, such slabs are practically in a finished state if required to be used for paving. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> has clearly explained that it is essential that there should be a certain amount of planing for certain purposes. The honorable senator has explained that slate is quarried in laminated, blocks, and divided into thicknesses for use for roofing into slabs J inch thick, and for paving into slabs 2 inches thick, or whatever the practice may be. But so far as the sawing is concerned, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has pointed out, it is done for convenience in handling and shipment, and it seems idle to increase the duty levied on slate bv 5 per cent, because it has been sawn with this object. I put mv objections to the proposal on far broader grounds. We have to deal with a very long and complicated Tariff, and for the sake of obtaining an additional 5 per cent, duty, we are being asked to divide the items dealing with slate into half-a-dozen different paragraphs, when it would be far better to include all under one item at the same rare of duty. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> will no doubt remember that &#34;under the&#39; Tariff of 1902 sawn slate was dutiable at 15 per cent., and we are being asked to impose an additional 5 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- That is an additional argument against the proposal. I should like to see all these duties on slate made uniform. It is too contemptible to be endeavouring to obtain an additional 5 per cent, under the pretence of giving employment to slate-cutters, when it is remembered that the whole of these slates are used in the building and other trades which we ought to encourage in every possible way. As I said before, in connexion with glue, we should pay some attention to the interests of the trades in which the articles are used, and not seek to impose heavy duties on what are the raw materials of those trades. In view of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story&#39;s</inline> explanation there is &#34;no justification for this attempt fo discriminate with respect to sawn slates, and, if possible, all the items dealing with slates should be included in one with a uniform duty of 1.5 per cent. </para>

With a view to economizing time, and not because it represents the full measure of concession I should like to obtain, I suggested that the Minister should make the duty on the proposed new paragraph b 25 per cent, instead of 30 per cent. If he will not agree to do so he will force upon me the obligation of moving an amendment. The amendment which he originally gave notice of some two or three weeks ago would adequately meet the situation. He proposed then that item 265 should be altered so as to read in this way - </para>

But I cannot see the necessity for making two separate paragraphs, as proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating.</inline> Slate that is sawn and planed is practically finished. Of course, it is true, as stated by some honorable senators, that if what I suggest were adopted, the stuff would be imported in the rough state. But slate comes out of the quarry in an irregular shape - perhaps nearly square - but with rough edges. To make it fit for use . even for paving purposes, the edges must be sawn square, and one face at any rate must be rubbed smooth. For other purposes, other work has to be done with it, such as rounding the corners.&#39; But I really think that if the Minister would stick to the form of the item as it stands in the Tariff, it would be better, and if he would propose to make the duty 30 per cent. I would support it. I would even support a duty of 20 per cent, rather than have the item split up in this unnecessary manner. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia) &#91;6.26&#93;. - I am very glad to hear what
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline>
                    has said, because he is a practical man, and his view commends itself to me. We are really wasting our time over unnecessary discriminations. I do not agree with
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline>
                    as to raising the duty, but I do agree with him that it is ludicrous to be chopping up these items in so many pieces. It is intended, I dare say, to reach a counsel of absolute perfection as to the employment of labour ; but by twisting the Tariff in this fashion and differentiating duties, we are simply making it harder to work under. Here we have on practically the same article duties of 15, 20, and 25 per cent. ; so that when slate comes out there is the risk of difficulty with the Customs as to whether particular slates come within a particular definition or not. If it were simply a matter of distinction between the rough slate as it comes out of the quarry, and the slate as it comes into use in any shape, it would be much simpler and better. I should therefore like to see the whole of items 265, 266, and 267 put under one rate of duty. We could fight about the duty afterwards. So far as
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline>
                    proposal is concerned, I would suggest to him that it would be better to leave item 265 as it is. Then we should try to get wrought slate and roofing slate placed under the same rate of duty as is imposed under item 265. If 20 per cent, is not sufficient, we could make the duty higher. I will certainly assist in unifying and simplifying these items. I cannot vote with
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline>
                    to increase the duties beyond 20 per&#39; cent., but if he is successful in increasing the rate to 30 per cent, on item 265, I shall go with him to bring items 266 and 267 under the same rate of duty. I dare say that if he does not succeed in increasing the rate from 20 to 30 per cent, he will adopt the same course, and agree to make the duties on items 266 and 267 the same as those on item 265. That would be very much simpler and better.

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> would go a little farther in the direction of simplifying the Tariff than I think we ought to go. Roofing slates are entirely different from other slates, and to simplify the position I would suggest that items 265 and 266, which deal with slates partly wrought and slates finished be amalgamated and made liable to a duty of 25 per cent. We should thus split the difference between the existing duties. At present the duty on slates partly wrought is 20 per cent., whilst slates finished are dutiable at 30 per cent. An all-round duty of 25 per cent, covering both these lines would simplify the work of the Department, and I believe be satisfactory to the trade. </para>

My proposition is that there should be a difference of 5 per cent, between the duties on the two lines.

                        <para>- Exactly. The reason for the suggestion is that it is clear from the debate that these slates pass through various stages of preparation. I. think it would conform to the design of the proposed new paragraphs if the duty rose in proportion to the work expended elsewhere on the slates. That would be a better way out of the difficulty, because it would distinguish between the partly prepared and the completed article. </para>

                    <para>. - With regard to the industry which it is assumed will be- protected by these duties, I would remind honorable senators that whatever claims may have been put forward on behalf of &#39;the marble quarries of Australia there is practically no white marble quarried in the Commonwealth, and placed on the local market. There are in the world, I understand, only two deposits of white marble which have been worked, the one being in Italy and the other in America. The American supply is very small, owing to the peculiar qualities of the deposit. That seems to suggest that we ought not to place white marble on the same footing as coloured marble. I believe that I am correct in saying that some of the coloured marble produced in Australia will bear more than favorable comparison with that produced elsewhere, but in regard to it we labour under certain disabilities. According to &#34;information which I have received, and which I have taken some trouble to verify, it costs more to bring the red granite from Gabo Island - where we have the finest deposit of the kind in Australia - to Sydney or Melbourne than it does to bring marble from Scotland to Australia. The obvious reason is that in the one case there are regular transport facilities, whilst in the other it is necessary to make special arrangements to obtain the marble from a place where the roads are bad and shipping facilities are almost nonexistent. We have to consider whether f!--e advantage proposed to be given under r.his item to the few men engaged in our marble quarries would not be more than counterbalanced by the disadvantages which it would impose on those engaged in working the marble after it has been, quarried. I should like to quote one or two passages from a circular which has been forwarded to- honorable senators, and which is signed by the  President  and Secretary of the Master Monumental Masons&#39; Association of Melbourne. It reads - </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>This association emphatically protests against any duty being imposed on unwrought marble or stone including stone slabs. </para>
                    <para>That the duty on wrought marble and stone including granite be fixed at not more than 25 per cent. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">The second request of the Association - seeing that its members are monumental masons - may seem a peculiar one, but I have ascertained that the real reason underlying it is that owing to the smallness of the Australian market these men undertake only a limited portion of the work of monumental masons. In other words, it is only possible for them to profitably undertake certain branches of work here. The result is that when they receive orders for work which &#39;they are not prepared to undertake, they must have resort to importation. That importation, however, still means some work for them. This explanation accounts for the request that we should not place a higher duty than &#39;25 per cent, upon what is their manufactured article. In regard to their raw material they say that there is no Australian product yet available which is equal to or competent to be substituted for white Italian marble. </para>

                    <para>The local selling price of Italian marble before any duty was levied was 12s. 6d. per cubic foot, which we consider a magnificent price for any unwrought stone, and as such local marble as is available can be obtained from 7s. 6d. to 8s. per cubic foot, why harass us and burden our industry by imposing unnecessarily high prices on our raw material. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That statement shows that the local marble is purchasable at from 7s. 6d. to 8s. per cubic foot, whilst the imported marble, exclusive of duty, costs 12s. 6d. per cubic foot. In other words, the imported article, exclusive of duty, costs 50 per cent, more than does the local marble. It is quite clear, therefore, that those engaged in quarrying marble in Australia are not being harassed by a cutting price on the part of importers. If the local marble were suitable for all purposes, it is obvious that these monumental masons would not pass it by, seeing .that they can obtain it at from 7s. to 8s. per cubic foot, whereas they are obliged to pay 12s. 6d. per cubic foot for the imported article, altogether apart from the duty. But I wish specially to show that this item, as it is framed at present, will hit the monumental masons of Australia rather severely. Be-  fore doing so, however, I would point out that some time since a petition was presented to the Prime Minister - copies of which have been supplied to honorable senators - signed by the marble and granite masons, manufacturers and others in all the States of the Commonwealth, so that it practically represents the views of the monumental trade of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>This is proved by the fact that the Australian coloured marbles, which are of equal quality to the imported, are rapidly superseding the imported article, and will shortly do so under the old Tariff. But we have to point out that about go per cent, of the marbles used is of the white variety, of which at present none has been discovered in Australia, suitable to our trade, notwithstanding newspaper reports* to the contrary. If any is discovered in the future the old Tariff is ample to protect it, as proved by the above-mentioned coloured marbles. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">Under this Tariff marble, whether white or coloured, is dutiable at 10 per cent. I cannot see any justification for imposing even that comparatively low rate upon white marble which is not produced in the Commonwealth. However, seeing that to a slight extent it may come into competition with some of our coloured marbles, I am not disposed to quarrel with that rate. But closely associated with this paragraph are the two following paragraphs, to which I desire to direct attention, because the action which the Committee may take in respect of the proposal immediately under consideration may have an important effect upon its action in respect of the subsequent paragraphs. Honorable senators will notice that paragraphs b and c refer &#39;to &#34; slabs or scantlings, sawn on one or two faces, and on one or more faces and one or more edges.&#34; Now the use of the word &#34; sawn &#34; in this connexion is utterly misleading. It has evidently been assumed that where a saw has been used upon marble blocks, it has been used for the express purpose of avoiding labour being undertaken, in Australia. But I would point out that marble blocks are frequently sawn for purposes of convenience in the matter of shipping, in much the same way as a saw-miller rips up a log. It would be impossible to send out to the Commonwealth large blocks of marble as they are taken from the quarries. Consequently, they are cut up by the saw and sent out in blocks without any packing around them. The friction which they encounter on the voyage, and the chipping which is caused by chains being passed around them, has the effect of crumbling the edges to such an extent that it is absolutely necessary to dress them upon their arrival: Thus the sawing which is done at home is of no value whatever, so far as the dressing of the stone is concerned. </para>

My honorable friend would know that, if he had ever seen big blocks of stone being shipped at Aberdeen, where chains are&#39; passed  around  them, and they are simply swung on board by means of a crane. The effect of this handling, I repeat, is to crumble the edges, so that the stone is never fit to be used until the edges have been dressed. The mere fact that it has been cut up by a saw does not diminish the labour which has to be devoted to it in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Probably the honorable senator will tell me next that we could shift the Pyramids here. The fact that the saw has been used upon these blocks does not in any way diminish the labour which has to be devoted to them upon their arrival in Australia,. On the other hand, slabs which are largely used for such purposes as the tops of washing stands and for  mantlepieces  are highly finished before they are exported, and are always cut in order to avoid that friction and erosion which must take place where the blocks are shipped without any covering whatever. It seems to me, therefore, that we might well draw a distinction between these two kinds of marble. We might well say that where marble has been prepared by being sawn, or planed ready for use, it should be regarded as the finished article, and the&#34; higher duty should be levied upon it, but where it is imported in blocks which have simply been sawn into a size convenient for shipping and unshipping, and where the work done upon it in no way diminishes the labour which will have to be devoted to it here, it should be admitted at the lower rate. Of course, the only question with which we are immediately concerned is as to whether white marble under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">A</inline> should be admitted free. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has read a letter from the Monumental Masons&#39; Association of Melbourne, in which its members ask that no further duty be imposed upon marble or granite in any form other than has been in vogue during the past five years. In regard to the paragraph . immediately under discussion, I think that the duty now proposed merely represents a continuance of the old rate, namely, 10 per cent. But as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has pointed out, the subsequent paragraphs are inter- related. They are just as inter- related as were several items which came under the designation of slate. It is proposed to levy varying rates of duty upon these paragraphs in proportion to the degree of preparation to which- the articles enumerated &#34; therein have been subjected. The unwrought marble, including rough or scabbled  from the pick, is dutiable at 10 per cent., slabs or scantlings, sawn on one or two faces, will bear an impost of 15 per cent., slabs or scantlings sawn on one or more faces, and one or more edges, are dutiable at 20 per cent., and wrought, n.e.i., will be required to pay 30 per cent. I think that honorable senators will recognise that it is advisable that we should retain varying rates according to the state of  preparation  in which any particular marble arrives in the. Commonwealth. The greater the state of Preparation the less  employment  is furnished to our own people in completing the finished article. </para>

                        <para>- I am not in a position to say, but there are different degrees, of preparation. Evidently some of it comes in sawn on one or two faces, while other of it is sawn not only on the face but upon the edges. I do not know whether the honorable senator is absolutely accurate in saying that no white marble has yet been discovered in the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chas.</inline> Joseph, a commercial broker in Sydney, appeared before the Tariff Commission as one interested in white marble quarries in New South Wales. I do not know what degree of commercial success has attended his association with that venture. The rate of duty, 10 per cent., is not very high, but the white marble certainly  comes into competition with our own coloured marbles. </para>

                        <para>- Coloured marble would serve for many of the purposes for which white marble is used but for the aesthetic value of the latter, which to that extent may be looked upon as a luxury. For ordinary practical commercial purposes - the ordinary wants of the people - our own coloured marbles are just as suitable. The white marble may be preferable from an artistic view-point, and for that reason there may be -some justification for imposing upon it, in common with all other marbles that come from abroad, a duty of 10 per cent. The duties are scaled in the proportion which I have described, and honorable senators will, I think, see the advantage of adhering to the principle as they have done with regard to slate. I do not think that the top duty of <inline font-style="italic">10</inline> per cent, on stone and marble wrought, n.e.i., will be found to be too high. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has not yet indicated his intention to move a request, and I hope that he- will not do so. </para>

                    RUSSELL (South Australia) &#91;8. 19I- Before I left Adelaide yesterday afternoon, knowing that one of my colleagues intended  to move in this matter, I made it my business to visit three monumental masons&#39; establishments. In every case they told me that the Australian marble was unsuitable.

In fact, I went to those places as a protectionist, thinking that marble suitable for the work could be, and was, produced in Australia, but I was assured by each of those firms that it was not. I was not altogether satisfied with their statements, so I asked them to show me the difference. They did so, and thoroughly convinced me. I am sure that they had no object in trying to deceive me, and if one of them might have tried to pull an honorable senator&#39;s leg, I do not think that all three could. The burden of their request was to let them have their raw material free. Of course, they did not object to a protective duty on the prepared article.

                    Russell has delivered one of the  most refreshing speeches in connexion with the Tariff that I have ever listened to. lt bears out what I said earlier in the evening, when  1  appealed to him upon another matter, that I was sure that if the light of reason was brought to his mind it would always find admittance. The honorable senator has put. two propositions to which I entirely assent. One of them is that which certainly ought to underlie - sometimes I am afraid it is obscured - even the contentions of the ultra protectionists, who do not take the trouble that the honorable senator did to inform his mind -in these marble masons&#39; places of business. That is, that you ought to have your raw material free when you can get it. I am glad my honorable friend has moved a request that this paragraph should be free. It is quite true, as the Minister stated, that the duty of  10  per cent, is comparatively small, but even so it is a very heavy, and may .be a prohibitive, tax upon people who, from the aesthetic sense, may prefer To have white marble for grave stones rather than the coloured article, which, I believe, is not used at all for that purpose. It is a choice between white marble - &#163;r or  &#163;2  will provide a little grave-stone in white marble - and perhaps granite. It is, perhaps, as the Minister said, a sentimental feeling, but that feeling permeates every class of society. The. least we can do, from the point of view of gratifying that sentimental or aesthetic sense, is to take off the duty entirely from the raw material. That is hot impinging at all upon the views of those who think that it is desirable to impose a duty to prevent it coming in in the wrought state, so as to provide employment for the people engaged in that particular occupation. I do not go quite so far as
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline>
                    . Russel&#93;_ in saying that the marble produced in Australia is worthless, but I think it is useless for the particular purposes for which white marble is employed. In South Australia there are deposits of very excellent coloured marbles.

                        <para>- Not of the kind fit for monuments. Parliament House, Adelaide, is built of a kind of marble - Kapunda marble - but that is not the white marble, and is not fit for statuary, monuments, or work of that description. But there are Australian coloured marbles which I say. do not require any protection, and that is why I took the liberty, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was discussing the question, of suggesting that it would be better that this item should be made free. The coloured marbles to which I refer are obtained from Macclesfield, in the hills about 8 or jo  miles from where I live in South Australia, and, having used them myself, I know them to be of the prettiest. These marbles can be worked into beautiful little pedestals, but they are quite unfit for the other purposes to which I have referred. I believe these marbles will supersede imported coloured marbles, and, therefore, so far as the unwrought material is concerned, we might very well adopt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell&#39;s request. The memorial addressed to the Prime Minister points out that the freight and charges on marble and granite average from 40 to 50 per cent., and if we add to that a duty of 10 per cent, we have a protection of from 50 to 60 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- Of course; they have to import it for their own work, and they employ labour to work up the raw material. If they were importers asking for a very -reduced duty on wrought or polished marble, we might take their statements with a little discount. But, on the other hand, they say that it is necessary to have this marble in free in- order to afford employment. Their statements cannot be set aside because one or two persons, who have communicated with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> choose to take a different view. When, however, we come to consider the worked-up material it will be fair to discuss what would be a reasonable duty in order to encourage the industry here. But the working-up of marble into monuments and so forth is not to be absolutely secured by means of a duty; the work depends on skill, artistic talent, and on many other contingencies for which no duties can provide. </para>

                        <para>- It is white enough. I should like to read some extracts from a letter I have received from one of the largest &#39; monumental masons in Adelaide. I am informed on the best authority that the majority of those who signed the memorial, asking- to have marble admitted free, or at a low rate of duty, are men who certainly do not, and, in many cases, could not, . do real monumental work,- but who import the material cut into slabs of exactly the right thickness, and then simply polish and letter it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frederick</inline> Herring, of Adelaide, has been a real monumental mason all his life; he could go to the quarry, take out a block, saw it into slabs, and work it to any design required. I have here some photographs of his work; and it cannot be excelled by any in Italy. After I saw the circular requesting a low duty, I wrote to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Herring,</inline> knowing him to be a thoroughly practical man ; and I received the following reply - </para>

                        <para>- He refused to sign the petition, and proceeds in the letter to give reasons why -  and consider I have done my duty in doing so - for the simple reason that we have in our State deposit of white marble enough to supply all Australia for hundreds of years; and I can say for durability and appearances the Angaston marble is not to be beaten by the Italian. The great drawback in it is that it is a little coarser and requires masons and not labourer&#39;s to work it, which is perhaps a eood thing, as any one must serve their time. They are the people who want the duty taken off for the simple reason it requires a little more skill, but I can assure you that when finished it has always given the greatest satisfaction. And in place of fretting away at the edges and corners, as the Italian marble does, it will always remain so as the day it was fixed in the cemetery, and for steps, kerbings for. building, Italian marble is not to be compared. Other firms &#39;in this line went so far as to say it was only fit for road metal. </para>

No less than three firms now with machinery working our State marble. These are the people who said it was not fit. I can show work completed in our cemetery which I am sure you would not know from Italian. I am quite satisfied South Australian marble is going to play a very important part in the future, that is, if it is assisted by the duty being ..still retained as it is to-day. I have received some more machinery  from England, and hope when got going I shall surprise the public by showing what can be done with our State marble. I have been a hewer of marble for this last&#39; forty years. I leave it with you to say whether you think I know what I am talking about. </para>

The proportion of labour in sawing marble is altogether different from the proportion of labour in sawing slate. In fact, if a man imports marble sawn into slabs, practically two-thirds of the work thereon is already completed. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to say a few words about granite, because I think that if this item does not include granite it certainly ought to. As a counter-blast&#39; to that petition, I have here a memorial which has been addressed to members of this Parliament. It is signed by James Taylor and .Sons, Australian Pioneer Granite Works, Footscray ; and by Peter Finn and Co., Bendigo Granite Polishing and Sawing Works, Bendigo. I consider that it ought to be placed on record not only that in South Australia we can produce and carve marble, but that every State has unlimited quantities of the best granite in the world. It was suggested from the other side a little while ago that we have not masons here, but I know from personal knowledge that the various States have granite and marble masons equal to </para>

                <para>Fin\:  in the world. All over Australia we have a number of Aberdeen granite workers : and having both the material and the skilled labour, I think that it will be a sin if we do not give the opportunity to develop our own industry. The memorial reads as follows1 - </para>
                <para>We beg to bring under your notice the following facts relating to the present Commonwealth Tariff as it affects our industry, viz. : - &#34; Monumental and Polished Granite Work.&#34; </para>
                <para>We have  expended  a large amount of capital in the erection of most complete plants for granite working, that of Messrs. James Taylor and Sons&#39; Australian Pioneer Granite Works, Footscray, costing the sum of ^4,000 ; and also the establishment of Messrs. P. Finn and Co., granite works, Bendigo, costing the sum of &#163;3,000 to equip, both of which are practically at a standstill owing to our inability to compete with the large amount of importations, and consequently cannot keep our plants working for more than two months in the year.&#34; </para>
                <para>Fully 95 per cent, of the monumental granite work erected in the Commonwealth is imported, and we are within the mark when we state that the cost of labour is 75 per cent.- higher here than in foreign countries, .viz., Germany, Russia, Sweden, Belgium, &#38;c, who employ quite an army of apprentices in the trade, and where granite is raised, worked, and exported to Australia. </para>
                <para class="block">I had some doubt about the statement that 95 per cent, of the granite work was imported, and therefore I decided to pay a visit to a yard which is situated at the back of these buildings, and in which some very fine specimens of monumental work can be seen. I inquired of the manager how much of the monumental work was imported. I suppose that in the yard there were fifty or sixty splendid examples of monumental work, and I learned that only one out of the whole lot had been made in Australia from Australian material. That convinced me, to some extent, as to the truth of the statement in the memorial. Not satisfied with that information,. I went into the establishment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Laycock,</inline> in Adelaide, and inquired whether it was possible that 95 per cent, of the monumental granite work in Australia was imported, and he said, &#34;It is absolutely true: in fact, it is nearer 100 per cent.&#34; The memorial continues - </para>
                <para>We also enclose a list showing the rates of wages paid to granite cutters in Aberdeen, Scotland, from whence a large amount of granite work is imported into the Commonwealth. </para>
                <para>We may state that the supply of granite in the Commonwealth is almost unlimited, there being a great variety of colours and stone of the highest quality, as can be seen in many public buildings in the capitals of the States. </para>
                <para>There is, however, 119 inducement to open and develop quarries, when&#39; so little demand can be relied on, and it is quite out of the question to think of training apprentices while we are not in a position to employ journeymen. </para>
                <para>In order to enable us to compete with the importations, which are becoming larger every year, and to be in a position to pay the increased rate of wages to our workmen as stipulated in the Factories Act Wages Board Determination, we ask that the present duty on &#34; all wrought and polished granite work&#34; should be increased to 45 per cent, ad valorem. </para>
                <para>At the present time our industry is languishing, and we are only employing about fourteen men on the average throughout the year; whereas with increased protection we could afford employment to about from sixty to eighty men during the whole of the year, and establish on a sound basis a now almost extinct industry, for which the Commonwealth provides an almost unlimited supply of the raw material in the way of numerous varieties of high-grade stone equal, and in many cases superior, to the best at present imported. </para>
                <para>Trusting that this matter will receive your  favorable consideration. </para>
                <para class="block">The writers then give a table of the wages paid in Australia and Aberdeen to show the absolute necessity of having a high protective duty, if the Australian workman is to have a. chance of competing on even terms with the Aberdeen workman. </para>

I- will give a short comparison of die wages paid in Aberdeen and Victoria. Granite cutters get 7d. per hour in Aberdeen, and is. &#60;jd. in Victoria. First-year apprentices get 7 s. per week in Aberdeen, and 5s. in Victoria. Second year apprentices get 8s. per week in Aberdeen, and 10s. in Victoria. Third year apprentices get 9s. per week in Aberdeen, and 15s. per week in Victoria. Fourth year apprentices get 10s. per week in Aberdeen, and 22s. 6d. in Victoria. Fifth year apprentices get us. per week in Aberdeen, and 30s. in Victoria. Granite &#39;polishers receive from 24s. to 26s. per week in Aberdeen, and &#163;2 4s. per week of forty-eight hours in Victoria. The writers conclude their memorandum with this statement - </para>

                <para>Tt would be difficult to point to any industry in Scotland that is suffering more severely From the inequality of the present fiscal system than the granite trade of Aberdeen and district. During the past few years it mav truthfully enough be said the granite trade in this country has been going from bad&#39; to worse, and unless some move is made in the way of exacting from foreigners who are daily exporting shiploads of worked and finished granite to this country a just tariff on the material sent in,  it is difficult to see how the reputation of Aberdeen as one of the greatest centres <inline font-style="italic">oi</inline> the granite trade in the world is go&#39;ing to be maintained. </para>

                    <para>If we include marble and other stones, and take the total importation, in 1900, 9,300 men were employed abroad exclusively on work for this country, while in 1904, no fewer than 14,500 men were employed - an increase of 5,200 workmen - while in this country we were opening soup kitchens for the unemployed ! </para>

                    <para>The granite-polishing yards in Aberdeen, as a glance at the balance-sheets of those that are limited companies wifl show, are not in a very prosperous condition, and this is not surprising. While they have suffered severely from foreign Tariffs, such as the 50 per cent. Tariff in the United States of America, which has reduced the number of men engaged in work for the United States of America by about 600; on the other hand, their market at home can&#39; be freely exploited by foreign competitors, and this&#39; is now being done by both German and Scandinavian firms, who have representatives in England pushing their goods and depressing the market. </para>

                    <para>Preference has helped somewhat, and the trade to Canada, which has been falling off, has increased so much since preference was granted that three times as many men are employed making granite for Canada now as in 1897, before preference was granted. </para>

                    <para>That decision is altogether wrong. The importers are seeking to put as many difficulties as possible in the way of the development of. Australian marble quarries. They know that the. sawing plant is the key to the situation, and unless we get something to equalize the difference between the cheap labour in Italy and the cost of labour in Australia they will have us at their mercy. </para>

                <para class="block">I do not think I need quote any more. We have as fine an example of granite work as I fancy can be seen in any part of the world in the pedestal of the statue of the late Queen Victoria, in the Queen&#39;s Hall. It is composed of Victorian red granite, wrought and polished by Victorian masons. The beautiful columns in the front of this building are composed of Victorian grey granite, wrought, turned, and polished in Victoria. The Eight Hours&#39; Monument in Spring-street was made here also of Victorian granite. We have in all our cities samples of as good granite and of as  good  workmanship in this line as, T think, are to be found in any other part of the world. Why, then, should we allow  95  per cent, of our monumental granite and marble work to be imported when we are in a position to do all this work for ourselves ? </para>

Reading the speeches, circulars, and important declarations dealing with this matter, I have been struck with the fact that on public as well as private occasions the most representative- men amongst the protectionists of Australia, and especially of Victoria, have expressed themselves in a most emphatic way in favour of the con- &#39;tention that this raw material should be admitted free of duty. On one very public occasion, the leader of the most extreme protectionists section of the Australian community, said - </para>

                <para class="block">He was followed bv men who, like himself, were speaking in the interests of Victoria, and &#39; all pleaded that this raw material should be admitted free of duty. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator -W.</inline> Russell is looking for confirmation of the wisdom of his proposal, he can- find it in the most responsible utterances of the strongest protectionists. I have looked through the reports submitted by both sections of the Tariff Commission, and as the result of careful and extensive reading on the subject, I say that the evidence is almost unanimously in favour of the contention that this material should be allowed to come in free. Those who are&#39; making the request make it in the interests of the workers, because they point out that it would increase the opportunities afforded them to secure employment. I gather from all the literature and information supplied on the subject that the value&#39; of the marble, granite, or stone used in the construction of monuments is comparatively small, and that it is the cost of the labour involved in working the material that is the important item. The monumental masons&#34; are therefore asking for the free admission of this raw material, not so much in their own interests as in the interests of the workers they employ. I am in a position to read to&#39; the Committee some evidence on this point supplied by the firm of Melrose and Fenwick, monumental masons at Townsville, in North Queensland. As I have myself objected that certain persons did not come before the Tariff Commission, it may be urged against me in this instance that the members of the firm I refer to did not give evidence before the Commission. My answer is that the Commission did not travel as far as Townsville, and that men in a comparatively small way of business could not have been expected to go from Townsville to Brisbane or Melbourne to give evidence. I quote this as evidence from a rather unexpected quarter, strongly supporting what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell has said.  The firm wrote to me, and possibly to other honorable senators,- asking that certain considerations should be submitted to the Committee. They say - </para>

                <para class="block">As bearing upon the quality of Australian marble, it should be remembered that I quote an Australian firm, the members of which would not be more likely to run down Australian products than would other per-sons. I take it as a matter of .commonsense that all workers would like to Le able to secure the material they use at their own door. It would be to their own business interest to avail themselves of it, if, for the purposes for which they required it, it was equal to what they would otherwise have to go elsewhere to obtain. This firm add a most important thing - and I direct the attention of. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> to it -  lt may be argued in connexion with the rough blocks (268A), that good marbles exist in various parts of the Commonwealth. But our inquiries in Angaston, South Australia, and Bathurst, New South Wales districts have failed- to reveal anything of such a satisfactory character as the Italian article, and for the sake of the higher branches of handicraft it is desirable that the best available material  shall be at disposal at the least possible cost. </para>

As the evidence is almost overwhelming, and nearly unanimous, that the raw material in the rough is required free for the benefit of the industry, and as protectionists themselves admit that its free importation would be of great advantage to the workers, I hope that the Government will not hesitate, but will do as they were pressed to do in the beginning - agree to make the item free. </para>

                    (New South Wales) &#91;9.22&#93;. - I am very much influenced in the vote which&#34; I shall give by two considerations - one the representations of ninety-five out of every hundred men in the trade throughout Australia, as shown by the communication sent to the Minister of Trade and Customs, and secondly my knowledge of how the marble and granite trades in New South Wales have progressed without any duties whatever to help them. Why, sir, it is a quarter of a century at least since the heavy granite columns at the Government Post Office, Sydney, were, erected. Certainly that was done under a &#34;regardless of expense&#34; arrangement, as it was a Government enterprise; but the granite used in those columns and in every other part of the building was brought from Montagu Island, away down on the east coast. Then, if honorable senators go to other large Government buildings in New South Wales they will find all the corridors floored with New South Wales black and white marble. It is not statuary marble, but it is nearly white. There may be statuary marble at Caloola; I have not seen it, but have heard of it. Certainly what is commonly called white marble in my State is fairly white, but is marked by a number of grey veins, which, of course, spoil it for high-class statuary work. But when it comes to dealing with coloured marbles, most unhesitatingly I say that New South Wales could supply not only all Australia, but all the r,est of the world. There is scarcely a colour known but is represented in the marble deposits of New South Wales. Even the rarer green tints are to be found, and have been used in the decoration of some of the city churches of Sydney. If any One wishes to see a variety of coloured marbles, let them look at the lining of the great hall of the new railway station in Sydney. There one can see an abundance of shades of- colour, and slabs of marble of a size that indicate that a considerable industry is in operation, which does not require the adventitious aid of duties. It is an industry natural to the country, and can be just as profitably worked, I will avow, as can the great beds of Hawkesbury sandstone, that supply building material for some of the chief cities of the Commonwealth. Whoever proposed to put on a duty to promote the use of Pyrmont stone? It is too easily obtained, and obtained in too great quantities, to make it necessary to pile up Tariff walls to keep out competing stone. Of course, stone may be imported for decorative purposes. I know that &#39; some Oamaru white stone from New Zealand has been imported for the decoration of some local buildings. But the Customs returns show that the importations are very small. According to these figures, one set of imports represented &#163;11,195* and the other line represented &#163;6,422. Roughly, there were &#163;17,600 worth of granite and marble combined as the total -importations for the whole Commonwealth during an entire twelve months. The duty amounted to a  trifle over &#163;2,300. Clearly some of the statements that have been made to-night, or that have been read, have been verv far astray. I think it is lamentable that there should be so much reading of private letters in connexion with the settlement of a business of this sort, because it looks as if we were not attempting to legislate in the interests of the people of Australia, but endeavoring laboriously to put a few extra pounds into the&#39; pockets of individual firms. That is what the whole aspect of this Tariff is coming to be. We seem to be consulting not the interests of Australia as a whole, but the advantage of some individwals. I cannot help saying, however, with reference to the list of persons who signed the memorial sent to the Minister of Trade and Customs, that I know a large number of the individuals whose names figure in it. I know not only some of those in Sydney, but in the principal, towns of New South Wales, and I say positively that they are not importing people but are working firms. They are not interested in importing and selling, but are makers of monuments and do work of all kinds that is required for buildings and so forth. I have been quoting a few Sydney examples, but let honorable senators go down any of the principal streets of Melbourne, Brisbane, or Adelaide, and see the amount of local granite and marble that has been used. Why, in Adelaide they have a marble palace for the Parliament to meet in - an &#34;I dreamt that I dwelt in marble halls&#34; kind of arrangement; and they do dream there occasionally, I believe ! In any of the principal cities of Australia you will see examples of both marble and granite work, the stone for which has been worked by Australian hands, and the material taken from Australian quarries. I certainly do not think that there is any excuse whatever for piling up these duties. There is, as has already been stated, a heavy natural protection because of the high freights and the great cost of handling heavy blocks. There is one thing in connexion with that which I have not heard mentioned, and that is the costly packages. They have to be made of great strength and bolted together; and when these packages arrive here, as the petitioners mention, they are worth nothing except for firewood. And yet we impose upon them a duty of 35 per cent., making a very material increase to the general cost of importing both marble and granite. I notice that the signatories to these representations do not ask that these marbles be free; they ask for the maintenance of the existing rate of duty, which I think was about 10 per cent. If the Committee determines to request that the line be free, well and good. I own that I shall be satisfied, in view of the representations made, with something a little less than actual freedom. If a duty of 10 per cent. is agreed to, we might very properly grant a preference to the United Kingdom, especially in view of the information given to us by

                    <para>.- I am fast coming to the conclusion that a legislative assembly is about the last body that should be charged with the work of framing a Tariff. After talking for hours on a given subject we find ourselves all at sea as to facts, and, as a rule, not at all prepared to arrive at an agreement. I have never heard our protectionist friends opposite admit that in. respect of an article which is not manufactured here to any considerable extent a protective duty might well be withheld for the sake of the consumers, and more particularly those who use it as the raw material of some other manufacture. Whilst standing firm in their allegiance to the policy of protection, Ministers might well say that there are exceptions to every rule, and that, having regard to the facts it would not be reasonable to apply -that policy to the importation of marble. I have here a printed copy of a letter addressed to the &#39; Prime Minister and signed, not as I thought by 300, but by 322 monumental masons living in all parts of the Commonwealth. They have taken the trouble to put their views in print, and to forward the petition, not only to each State of the Commonwealth, but to every portion of a State in which. a monumental mason is to be found. I- do not know that any more complete document in regard to the Tariff has ever been placed before honorable senators. These 322 persons are established monumental masons. They have their homes, offices, and yards here, and they employ workmen and apprentices. I will undertake to say, without fear of contradiction, that they circulate more money in the form of wages, and provide more employment, than do those persons who employ men merely to quarry Australian marble and to manufacture it. But my honorable friends opposite, who are out-and-out protectionists, will not listen to facts of this kind. They will not recognise that protection must have its limits. Nobody suggested for a moment that sufficient protection ought not to be afforded the industry to compensate for the marvellous difference which exists between the wages paid to Italian or Scotch workmen, and those paid to Australian workmen. But does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie mean to tell me that the natural protection afforded to the industry, amounting, as it does, to 50 per cent., is not a larger measure of protection than that which we have extended to most items&#39; in this Tariff? I take it that the prayer of the 322 persons to which I have alluded is worthy of attention, and they ask that their raw material shall be admitted upon fair terms.

                    <para>. - I pointed out earlier! that the word &#34; sawn &#34; in paragraphs  b  and c was quite misleading. . It has evidently- been the belief of those who prepared the Tariff that the fact that a saw had been used on the stone represented some portion of the work of preparing it for its final destination. </para>

                        <para>- Of course it can. It does not need an expert like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story,</inline> re-inforced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> to make that obvious. But the marble is taken out of the quarry in enormous blocks. By the proposal in paragraph  b,  those in Australia who are compelled to purchase marble from elsewhere will have to send instructions, if they wish to avoid the duty, that the big block is to be cut up, not by the saw, which is the most economical way, but by hand tools. </para>

                        <para>- The blocks which come out here are not cut to w⅛th of an inch. As they are sent out without any covering or packing, the edges fray or are chipped in handling, and consequently if they are required here for certain sizes they have to be cut somewhat larger before they are sent, in order to enable the men to re-dress them here. It would make no difference to the work in Australia whether the block came out with a sawn edge or cut with another tool. It would still have to be worked over again. The only slabs which come out here, ready for use are those for table tops, mantel shelves, and so on. When these are completely prepared at Home or in Italy, they are sent out! in packages in order that they shall not be subject to the friction and knocking about which the loose block necessarily encounters. The blocks mentioned in paragraphs  b  and c are simply cut in convenient sizes in the same way as timber is sent here. Under the timber duties, the way in which the faces are to be cut is not specified. Certain sizes of timber only are stipulated, because it is necessary in order to ship them here that the saw must have passed over them somewhere. That is a complete parallel to this case. . The saw is not used to economize work here, but to reduce the marble to convenient-sizes for shipping, and for its utilization in Australia. Paragraphs  b  and c, like paragraph  a,  really cover the raw material required by monumental masons. I therefore move - </para>

The method of dividing a block of marble or granite is to drill a number of holes in a straight line across it, plug them up with pieces of timber or lime, pour water in, and the block breaks in half. That is absolutely the cheapest and only method adopted. What kind of a saw would <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> vet to separate a block of marble 10 &#39;feet bv 10 feet?

                        <para>- I have seen the whole process of taking the block from the quarry, separating it into smaller blocks, and fixing the frame with a number of saws over the block. The frame may con tain anything from 6 to 15 saws, fixed for varying thicknesses when different thicknesses of slabs are required. The saw works backwards and forwards. It is simply a piece of plain iron. Water and sand are put into the chase that the saw makes. It is the rubbing of the sand with the piece of iron that severs the block into slabs. . As the witness I have quoted a little while ago pointed out, when marble is sawn into slabs, about two-thirds of the work is done, because it is of equal thickness right through, and is smooth on two surfaces. All that is required is that it should be sawn the other way, chiselled, and rounded or chamfered to make it a finished article. The sawn slabs of marble or granite mentioned in this paragraph are those on which two-thirds of the labour has been done- </para>

                    <para>. - So far as my reading goes, I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is correct. I understand that in the marble quarries of Carrara, saws are used for actual quarrying purposes. The method explained by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> of breaking up a block of stone is the old rough-and-ready way. But the Carrara marbles are not handled in that fashion. The desire is to leave a good face on the marble, and for many years the stone has been quarried with a saw. At the same time the marble imported in this state is to a certain extent wrought. A great deal of the work done by the saw might be done here with a chisel ; and to that extent employment was taken away from our operators. Consequently I should like to see .some duty imposed. </para>

                    <para>. - I shall not trouble honorable senators by reading extracts from the evidence, but many men in the trade define wrought marble as marble on which a chisel or sand has been used, and unwrought marble the stone which has been merely sawn into slabs for the purpose of transport. A suggestion which contains some merit, in view of the tone of the debate, was thrown out by a stone merchant of Melbourne, who was of opinion that slabs under 4 feet by  2  feet should be dutiable, but that all over that measurement should be free, even if sawn on the four edges. This seems to fit in with the rule applying to timber; and it is a suggestion that I shall ask the &#39; Committee to consider. </para>

I do not propose to reiterate the arguments which have been used. The contention hitherto has been that the sawing of  the slabs has been a portion of the work. I am endeavouring to enable <inline font-style="italic">monumental masons to get</inline> in their raw material at any rate in a form in which it cannot be said that any work has been? devoted to it other than that which was necessary to secure a convenient size. I therefore propose that where marble comes in not as a slab but in a block, then, on the same principle as that which is applied to timber, it shall be admitted free. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that honorable senators will not agree to the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> who apparently does not feel very sure of his ground. In the first place, he proposed that the limit should be 4 feet by 2 feet without regard to the third dimension. I believe that when, after a considerable debate, the Committee affirmed by a very substantial majority that slabs or scantling sawn, as mentioned in paragraph  b,  should bear a duty of 15 per cent., and sawn as mentioned in paragraph c a duty of 20 per cent., it intended that decision to apply generally- Any such proposal as that now put forward would have the effect, even if it is not so designed, of simply whittling away the protection which has already been given. </para>

What is meant by a slab 4 feet by 2 feet square? I do not know exactly what is meant. So far as thickness is concerned there is not the slightest indication of what it ought to be. The desire of the marble masons, who import stone of this kind, is to get it in with as much work as possible done on it. The mode of measurement suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is quite new. It is not that applied to timber, for instance, where the dimensions given are 12 x 6 and over and 12 x 6 and under, or the like, irrespective of length. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> had said 2x2 irrespective of length, there would have been some meaning in his proposition ; but he is confining it to pieces 4 feet in length. </para>

I hope that the Committee will reject the request, and stand by the Tariff.

One reason why masons wish the matter to be left alone is that rough unwrought marble will cost them more than sawn marble. Italians seem not to care to sell in the rough.

Apparently, they may be of any size. So long as they are sawn on one or more faces, or one or more edges, they are dutiable. If that be so, the request seems to me perfectly fair.

                        <para>- Because I am only a reasonable protectionist ; I fail to satisfy my free-trade friends. I suggest that the duty should be 40 per cent., because the Tariff Commission recommended that ornamental work should bear a duty of 35 per cent., and in another place ornamental work was lumped with &#34; Marble wrought,&#34; and the duty fixed at 30 per cent., which I think too low. I have two objects in view, one to protect Australian workmen, and the other to give a preference to Aberdeen workers. </para>

On page 262 I find, that one witness recommended that headstones should be dutiable at 130 per cent., and monumental figures, sculptors&#39; work and other marble work at 100 per cent. I must say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> has exhibited an amount of timidity of which. he himself will to-morrow be heartily ashamed. I suggest that, inspired by this more thorough-going witness, he should withdraw his proposal with a view to proposing one more acceptable to at least one member of the trade. </para>

The. trade would then be able to bear a duty on the imported raw material. Some honorable senators, when on the platform, are never tired of talking of our great natural .resources, and they should now be prepared to support a duty designed to develop one of them. It is idle to say that manufacturers are entitled to all the protection we can give ; we have as much right to protect the workers in the quarries as to protect those working in the yards of the monumental masons. </para>

                    <para>.- It is correct, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> has said, that the Tariff as introduced in another place contained the item &#34; Wrought, ornamental, ad val., 35 per cent.&#34;; and that after 4th December, 1907, it disappeared as a separate item. The reason is that &#39;after the Tariff was introduced in the House of Representatives the Department of Trade and Customs found it extremely difficult to distinguish between &#34;Wrought, ornamental/&#39; and &#34; Wrought, n.e.i.&#34; There was a duty&#39; of 35 per cent, in the one case, and of 30 per cent, in the other. Naturally the importers wished to bring in all their stone under the 30 per cent, duty, and protested frequently when the Custom* Department regarded some of their importations as being essentially ornamental, and, for that reason, dutiable at 35 per cent. It was therefore thought that in the best interests of all concerned, one rate pf duty should apply to the two lines. The duty of 30 per cent, was allowed to stand, and on the motion of the Government the line &#34; Wrought, ornamental, 35 per cent.,&#34; was struck out by another place. </para>

                    <para>. - The statement by the Minister of Home Affairs that the Tariff as introduced in another place contained a paragraph making certain marble or stone dutiable at 35 per cent, is of. some interest, since that paragraph does not appear in the Tariff as submitted to us. It is obvious from what the Minister said that some duty was collected under the paragraph between the date of the introduction of the Tariff in another place and that on which it was struck out. If that be so, the paragraph ought to appear in the schedule now before us making the line dutiable at 35 per cent, up to the 4th. December, 1907, and thereafter free.  In its absence, the legality of any duty collected under it can be questioned on the ground that it &#39;does not appear in the Bill&#39; as passed by both Houses. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. Since we have agreed to request another  place to remove the duty of 10 per cent, to which this firm objected - and, by the  way, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> did not assist us to carry that request - they should not ask for a further protection of 5 per cent, or 10 per cent. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> has taken up a peculiar position. I hope that the Committee will stand by the item as it appears in the schedule, &#39;in order that, as the Minister has said, the symmetry of the Tariff may be maintained. </para>

                    made out a splendid case for extending a preference to the Aberdeen granite workers. He stated that the competition to which they . were subjected from Scandinavia and Germany was very strong. I wish to point out how keenly the German workers in granite are competing against the Aberdeen workers in that material. I have in my possession two price lists sent out by one of the largest granite firms in Germany. One of these contains quotations of prices and quantities, and the other an intimation that if customers are not satisfied they are at liberty to indicate the prices which&#34; they are prepared to pay, and if the firm can meet them, it will do so, in order to shut out the Aberdeen workers in the granite industry. I appeal to
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story,</inline>
                    who pleaded so strongly on behalf of the workers, to bear that fact in mind.
