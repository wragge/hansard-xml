As regards the reports of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Staniforth</inline> Smith on the development of Papua, I notice that no recommendation has been made by the Printing Committee. I do not know the nature of those particular reports, but I think that honorable senators will agree that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith&#39;s</inline> prior reports have been of considerable public interest ; in fact, if we wish to develop that territory, I think that it would have been a good thing to have had them circulated, because they furnish a large quantity of valuable information as to the possibility of acquiring land. If his recent reports are of the same tenor as the previous ones, I consider that they should be printed, and in order to elicit that information I move - </para>

                        <para>- I cannot speak for other members of the Printing Committe, but I have read some of the reports. These documents show what is being done in connexion with land cultivation and settlement in Papua, but the information which they contain is of little or no importance to the citizens of the Commonwealth. However, there is nothing to prevent a book from being compiled from the documents which are from time to time forwarded by the Director of Agriculture in the Possession. But to order such reports to be printed merely for the sake of having them printed, would be simply a waste of public money. </para>

                        <para>- Personally I think the Printing Committee does very good work. One of the greatest burdens thrown on members of Parliament is that of deciding in reference to the enormous bulk of papers with which they are presented which are of sufficient importance to keep and which may be destroyed. A Committee such as ours does good work in going through the papers before they are printed, and deciding upon their value. The remaining papers can always be seen by members of Parliament, and the Committee relieves us of the burden that would be involved in any increase of the number of papers sent to us every morning, some of which are entirely useless. </para>

                <para>Staniforth Smith&#39;s progress reports and for the reason which I shall advance directly, I shall support the amendment. I wish it to be understood - and the members of the Printing Committee will, I am sure, accept my assurance - that I in no sense find fault with their general work, or with the decisions at which they arrive. There may be some papers the importance of which &#39;may escape their notice, though their contents might appeal to other honorable members. But the trouble seems to be in this case that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Staniforth</inline> Smith makes monthly reports but not annual ones. In the very first monthly report which has been placed in my hands he is absolutely summarizing twelve months&#39; operations. It is to all intents and purposes an annual report. It commences &#34; I have the honour to forward the following report for the twelve months ending 30th June, 1908.&#34; These words occur at the commencement of the monthly report. </para>

                        <para>- The document sets out the operations in land, the area applied <inline font-style="italic">tor. the</inline> area under cultivation, and leases withdrawn for the whole twelve months. It seems to me, therefore,, that it is something more than a monthly report. I am not laying down any rule with regard to the printing of monthly reports, but I intend to support the amendment with regard to this one. I take the opportunity of suggesting to the Vice-President of the Executive Council, or to the Minister concerned with the administration of Papua, that it might be desirable to do in connexion with the Territory what is done by our large Departments on the mainland. I am aware that the Administrator makes a report on all matters connected with Papua. But it is quite a common practice to embody in such a report reports from the heads of branches. I think that it would be very convenient to honorable senators if the Administrator, in furnishing his annual report, attached to it a report from the gentleman responsible for the administration of lands as a separate document. We should then know exactly where to turn for such information. If that were done, these monthly reports would not need to be printed, and we should know for the future where to look for a report from the Director of Agriculture in relation to all matters with&#39; which he has to deal. </para>

                    <para>. - I rise to support the amendment. I hope that the paper in question will be printed. We are responsible for the administration of Papua, and it is only right that the Senate should be informed on matters that take place there. It is quite easy for some honorable senators, in looking over a. document of this kind, to miss the importance of some points that might appeal to others as being of very great consequence indeed. The members of the Printing Committee should know that nothing but the best of feeling is entertained towards them bv the Senate, and they ought not to take it as a slur upon them if their treatment of any particular paper is criticised. That is not meant. No matter how useful their work may be, honorable senators may be allowed to differ from them without coming to loggerheads. I hope that there will be no real opposition to the amendment, and that at any time when any member of the Senate feels that a particular paper ought to be printed, which the Committee have not recommended for printing, his demand will not be regarded as hostile. A paper may very well mean a great deal to one senator and nothing at all to another. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend need not speak like that, because I am sure that every honorable senator will admit that what I have said is true. A large number of documents which are laid upon the table of the Senate are of a formal character, and we should not be justified in going to the expense of printing them. For instance, we should not think of printing a number of petitions. To lay it down as a rule that every paper shall be printed would be very unwise. In this case honorable senators will observe that the  chairman  of the Printing Committee is asking that certain documents may be printed because they are of an urgent character. I conclude from his statement that the Committee have not had a full opportunity of dealing with other documents laid before them, which were not equally urgent. If there is likely to be valuable matter in the reports to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator &#39;Pearce</inline> has referred, I am sure that the Committee will be anxious to give further consideration to them, so that they may be ultimately printed. I am given to understand that all the documents which have been laid upon the table up to to-day have been printed. I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that, in view of the fact that the wishes of honorable senators have been conveyed to the  chairman  of the Committee, he might very well withdraw his amendment. </para>

                        <para>- Of course. I point out, also, that the adoption of the report would not prevent any member of the Senate from subsequently moving for the printing of any particular document if, upon inspection, he thought it ought to be printed. If that course were followed, we should each have an opportunity of examining the paper and deciding whether, in our opinion, the expense of printing it should be incurred. I do not know whether the document which has been referred to is of such superlative public importance as to justify the expense of printing it, but I think we should act wisely at this stage in accepting the report of the Printing Committee, when we know that by doing so we shall not preclude any honorable senator from moving, at any future time, for the printing of any document which the Committee did not think of sufficient importance to print. I repeat that I think it a pity that we should take action by way of amendment upon the motion for the adoption of the report, as that has the appearance of a reflection upon the Printing Committee as though they had overlooked the importance of some document which it was their duty to examine. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> makes a sad mistake if he dreams that the members of the Printing Committee are at any time antagonistic to criticism by himself or by any other member of the Senate. It may help the Committee if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> and honorable senators generally, will understand that there are members on the Printing Committee who read the papers which they are called upon to deal with. If honorable senators generally took a similar course, these papers would have been read before they came before the Committee. In that case, they would see at once that what the Committee does is to discriminate. When a paper comes before them containing facts which ought to be printed for public information, they decide to print it, but when they have to deal with a paper in which there may be an inch of space containing information, and half-a-mile of useless padding, they consider that in the interests of economy they should make no recommendation for the printing of such a paper. But, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has pointed out, any member of the Senate can move for the printing of the paper without carrying an amendment for the adoption of the Printing Committee&#39;s report. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> could have achieved what he desires by adopting the ordinary course which is open to any member of the Senate. I believe that if the honorable senator goes carefully into the particular papers which have been referred to, he will agree with the members of the Printing Committee that, after all, they do not contain very much information. </para>

I am drawing the attention of honorable senators to a well-recognised parliamentary practice, and that is, that when the delivery of the Budget statement is imminent, it is quite unusual, by dribs and drabs, to seek information which will practically form the subject-matter of that- statement. It is usual to extend to the Treasurer the courtesy of waiting until he delivers his Budget speech. </para>

                        <para>. - I am aware that there is a general feeling amongst honorable senators that further time should be afforded for the consideration of this Bill. I must confess at once that it is not a measure which can be mastered in a day or two. It is of very great complexity, and therefore as honorable senators intimate their desire to be granted a further opportunity to study its provisions, I cannot resist their request, provided, of course, that no honorable senator is prepared to continue the discussion this afternoon. If any honorable senator is ready to resume the debate, I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will withdraw his motion. </para>

                <para>With the permission of the Senate, I shall avail myself of the liberty of reading from some notes, because the matter dealt with in the Bill is an intricate one from a business point of view. I shall at once proceed to point out the salient features of the measure, and at a later stage. I hope to satisfy the Senate that, if it becomes an Act, it will prove advantageous to the public as well as to the shareholders of the companies which decide to avail themselves of its provisions. The Bill is intended to have a wide application, namely to authorize any joint-stock company in the Commonwealth to put aside a sum from time to time out of its net profits for the express purpose of forming a special reserve fund to be under the control of trustees, to be constituted a body corporate, the said funds not to be employed in the business of the company. Many persons allege that bank reserve funds are not really proper reserves, because they are largely employed in the current business of the banks. The reserve fund is to go on accumulating until it represents an amount equal to the paid-up capital or the reserve liability of the shares of the company, according to circumstances, because, in some cases, the reserve liability equals the amount of the paid-up capital. There are many companies - as I shall show presently - which have a paid-up capital, but under their charters or deeds of settlement there is a further reserved liability in the event of their getting into difficulties. Admittedly, the Bill, if passed, will probably be more availed of by banks and other financial companies than by what may be called, for purposes of distinction,&#34; trading companies.&#34; I wish now to direct attention to clause 4, which reads - </para>

                        <para>- I shall be able to explain that provision a little later. The reserve fund will be created by amounts voted at general meetings of the company out of profits, and, permissibly, out of premiums on the issue of new shares, the proceeds of forfeited shares, and such sums as represent the recovery of debts previously written off as bad. As I shall show presently, this reserve fund is very desirable. </para>

                        <para>- The Bill provides that a reserve fund so formed with accumulated interest must be invested in Government stocks or Government securities until it amounts to the aggregate reserve liability on shares, or until the company is wound up, or until calls on the reserved liability on shares have to be made. Clause 9 provides that half-yearly reports of the trustees&#39; investments must be furnished to the company which has appointed the trustees, and doubtless these accounts will be duly audited. I feel very strongly upon this matter, because I have had it under consideration for the last fifteen years. </para>

                        <para>- The financial crisis of 1893 - unfortunately we have good cause to remember that occurrence, which has been called a banking crisis by many - is not yet forgotten. Ever since then - knowing that crises repeat themselves at longer or shorter intervals - the idea has been simmering in my mind whether it is not practicable to devise some means by which financial companies would be much better prepared than they, were in 1893 to withstand panics. Many of the banks and  companies which succumbed in 1893 have been reconstructed, and have shown commendable caution in enlarging their capital and reserves; others that, fortunately, did not close their doors, have also largely augmented their capital and their reserve funds and keep a much larger percentage of liquid assets than they did formerly, and in the case of banks with considerably larger coin reserves. It still seems to me - following in the footsteps of the patriarch Joseph of Egypt - that we should take advantage of the years of prosperity to provide for the possible years of adversity. Shortly after the 1893 crisis, I wrote at some length to the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> Buckland, at that time  president  of the Bank of New South Wales - a man who achieved a great reputation for his caution and intelligence, who came out here practically little better in social position than a farm employe, and who died worth &#163;350,000, which he had made by his own hard work. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I suggested to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Buckland</inline> a course of procedure on the lines of this Bill up to a certain point. He highly approved of the idea, but thought the time inopportune - as no doubt it was - and he looked forward to more prosperous times for its adoption. I think it must be admitted that we are now enjoying prosperous times, and it is for that reason that I am bringing this measure forward. </para>

                        <para>- By laying aside their own money to meet it. In the year 1893, following upon the failure of building societies in 1892, and the great slump in land values, bank after bank closed its doors, and many companies came to grief. Shareholders in the presumably stronger banks became alarmed. Shares were rushed on the markets, and fell precipitately, much under their true value. Depositors became uneasy, rushed the banks, and withdrew their deposits. Even the most powerful banks felt the pressure, and took all available steps to assuage the panic. One bank in Sydney, with a reserve fund as large as its paid-up capital, and with &#163;25 shares selling at &#163;121, had to close its doors. </para>

                        <para>- The bank, finding its coin reserve continuously falling, closed its doors out of consideration for its more loyal depositors. The directors argued, &#34; Why allow these timid men to secure an advantage over the honorable men who are sticking to us&#34;? So they closed their doors, thereby intensifying &#39;the panic - unintentionally, of course. Another large bank found the price of its &#163;20 shares falling from &#163;65 to &#163;20, owing to timid shareholders rushing shares on the market. </para>

                        <para>- There are at least three classes of financial companies which might not unreasonably be expected to avail themselves of the provisions of this Bill. First, there are banks and other companies whose shares are fully paid up, but whose charters or deeds of settlement entail a further reserve liability of pound for pound on shares in the event of necessity arising. In this class may be mentioned the Australian Gaslight Company of Sydney, which has fully paid-up shares with a liability to the same amount ; the Bank of Adelaide, the Bank of Australasia, the Bank of New South Wales, and the Western Australian Bank. These banks have fully paid-up shares, and under their charters, or deeds of settlement, their shareholders are liable, pound for pound, to the extent of their holding. Secondly, there are bank&#39;s and other companies registered under Limited Liability Acts, but whose Articles of Association only authorize a limited amount on each share to be paid up unless liquidation should be necessitated, or should require  the calling up of the whole, or a portion of the remainder of the capital. In this class, I may mention the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney, whose shares are nominally ,&#163;25 each, but can only be called up to the extent of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;12</inline> 10s., the balance constituting a reserved liability. The Union Bank of Australia belongs to the same class. Its shares are nominally ^75 each, but can only be called up to ^25 each, the balance also constituting a reserve liability. Thirdly, there are banks and other companies having limited liability, in some cases the shares only being partially paid up; others having preference shares, &#38;c. It is, perhaps, scarcely necessary to mention that banks&#39; existing reserve funds, whilst in some cases materially strengthening a bank&#39;s resources, do not free the shareholders from their legal liability in respect of uncalled capital, or other reserved liability on their shares; besides being largely, and in some cases wholly, employee! in the company&#39;s business. As corroborating what I am saying, honorable senators have only to look at the advertisements of the banks, in which it is usually announced that the capital paid up is so much ; reserve fund so much; reserved liability on shares so much ; and then the three&#39; are added together. It will be found that almost every bank in Australia advertises its resources in that way. </para>

                        <para>- They call the total their resources. I am glad to think that, as far as I know, we are without unlimited liability joint stock companies in Australia. It would not be difficult to cite many cases of families being ruined in Great Britain in days gone by through banks, which had unlimited liability, failing. Even now, in the Commonwealth, there are companies whose shares are only paid up to one-fortieth of the nominal share, capital - for example, <inline font-style="italic">z\</inline> per cent, of ^5 shares, or 2J per cent, of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;\o</inline> shares ; the balance in the first case, <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4</inline> 17s. <inline font-style="italic">6d.</inline> per share, and in the other case, ^9 15s. per share, representing, and being considered, a substantial guarantee to trust estates that the company is a very strong one. The companies in my mind&#39;s eye are both very carefully managed, and have influential boards. To me, personally, however, it would be anything but comforting to know that my reserve liability was thirty-nine times as large as the paid up capital upon which I was receiving a dividend. It is an enormous proportion. Briefly, some of the advantages to the creditors of a company taking advantage of this measure, and indirectly to the public - presuming the company has a growing reserve fund - would be the following : First, should a financial crisis take place, the company&#39;s creditors will recognise that funds in the hands of trustees invested in Government securities are, as a realizable asset, much better than prospective calls on a general body of shareholders, which would take an indefinite time and much expense to collect ; and with a strong possibility that considerable numbers would simply be unable to meet their liability. It is. surely, a great advantage to have a fund for the purpose of meeting such liabilities. Secondly, an unlimited danger, through timid shareholders rushing their shares on a falling market, will be in a large degree obviated, as, when depositors see a bank&#39;s shares tumbling down in price, they naturally get frightened, and, by suddenly withdrawing deposits, intensify the panic. Unfortunately, not a few of us have seen such things taking place. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly. Thirdly, the establishment of reserved liability funds, and the appointment of trustees, will necessarily increase the local demand for Government securities for investment, and thus be beneficial to the Government when floating loans locally. Some of the advantages to shareholders arising from the establishment, will be the following : First, the company will have a fund invested safely outside its own business, and available in case of need for the liquidation of its shareholders reserved liability on shares. Secondly, shares will most probably command a higher and a less fluctuating price. Thirdly, testators will have increased confidence in naming such companies&#39; shares safe investments for family funds. Fourthly, after the fund amounts to the equivalent of the reserved liability, its annual net income, as provided by clause  6,  will be available for dividends for the company. </para>

                        <para>- I thought that I had already done so. Is it not an advantage to prevent panics? Is it not an advantage to the public to establish reserve funds which, in time, will represent millions of pounds, and will necessarily increase the local demand for Government securities, and be beneficial to the Government when floating loans locally? I know that it will not be an easy matter to persuade a certain type of shareholders that, by refraining from demanding higher dividends, they will be really acting in their own ultimate best interests; such an apparently self-denying ordinance being against the grain. But shareholders who have confidence in the company&#39;s directors, and who are permanent investors, and not merely speculators in shares, will, I hope, encourage the Boards of the companies to which they belong to lose as little time as possible, consistent with the maintenance of existing dividends, to avail themselves of this measure, and thus do something tangible to provide against the proverbial rainy day. I may remind honorable senators that in to-day&#39;s newspaper we read that the Minister of Justice, in Denmark, has embezzled  &#163;830,000  belonging to farmers&#39; banks, many of whom will probably be ruined through this man&#39;s forgeries. I hope that such a thing will never occur in Australia. But imagine such a loss as that coming upon one of our institutions. I remember that the Union Bank of London, in  1861,  discovered one morning, through the illness of one of its officers, a mon named Pullinger, that he had robbed them of  &#163;250,000.  It is not every banking institution that can stand a loss like that. </para>
