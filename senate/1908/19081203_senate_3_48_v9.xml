                            <para>- The Government are prepared to give the Senate as much time as it desires for the consideration of the Estimates, and for that purpose an attempt will be made to finish their consideration in another place this week. Of course, if the. Appropriation Bill is sent here on Tuesday, there will be nothing to prevent the Senate from sitting continuously until Saturday, and then, if a majority desire to sit during the following week, the Government will not attempt to prevent them. But I feel sure that if the Bill should arrive here next Tuesday, and should the brevity usually displayed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> be observed generally, there will be ample time for honorable senators to discuss it fully, and to reach their homes before Christmas. </para>

I know a case where a man who had expected to land a machine for about&#163;200, suddenly found that it would cost him about&#163;230. I desire to know whether the Minister will consult with his colleague and see whether it is not possible, before removing tools of trade from one list to the other, to give a little notice of the intention, so that importers may be prepared ? </para>

In not one case is the business of the State set out in full, but only small details are supplied.

                        <para>Tenders have been received which, according to the size of the boat and passenger accommodation, vary as much as , &#163;3,000 per annum. The lowest tender, which is a little above that of the last contract, is one that the Postmaster-General is prepared to accept at once, as it fulfils all the requirements of the Postal Department. The highest tender even does not give the Department any better facilities. Western Australian members, amongst whom was the honorable senator, have, however, waited on the Minister, urging that consideration in the new contract should be given to the passenger and the freight requirements of the district. In view of the present state of the finances, the Postmaster-General cannot entertain the proposal of allowing the Postal Department to pay the added subsidy. Even if we had the money, he would be against the principle involved, viz., for the Postal Department to pay for services other than those connected with postal requirements. The Western Australian Government has, however, been communicated with asking if they are prepared to pay the extra subsidy for the purpose of assisting the development of the South-East Coast. If they are prepared to pay the difference in the amount of the tenders, the Postmaster-General would at once accept the higher tender providing&#39; the additional facilities. The Western Australian Government have been asked to deal will&#62; this as a matter of urgency, as the existing contract expires at the end of this month. </para>

                            <para>- I am not so anxious about that as I am about the passing of this Bill. I desire to see it become law for the same reason which prompted my, anxiety to secure the passing of the Seat of Government Bill in 1904, namely, that it is about time the Commonwealth did some thing to bring about a fair understanding between the State of New South Wales and the people of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- We endeavoured to do so, but the arrangement at which we then arrived does not appear to be a satisfactory one. Honorable members are aware that quite recently a. resolution was affirmed, both in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, which practically implied the repeal of the Seat of Government Act. By a very substantial majority in the other Chamber, and by a small majority here, the district of Yass-Canberra has been selected as the territory within which the permanent seat of Government shall be located. The Bill before honorable senators is a very short one, and an explanation of its pro visions will demand only a very brief statement from me. Seeing that we all had an opportunity of expressing our opinions upon the whole question so very recently, it is unnecessary for me to elaborate the reasons underlying my present action. Asa member of the Government, I conceive it to be my duty to do what I can to give effect to the expressed intention of Parliament, and it is for that reason that this Bill has been introduced. The Government recognise that upon a measure of this kind, which does not involve any party issue, the will of a majority of both Houses of Parliament should be given effect to. Honorable senators will observe that the provisions of the Bill differ very slightly from those of the Seat of Government Act of 1904. Clause I refers to its short title. Clause 2 is not contained in the Seat of Government Act,, because it is the provision which is necessary for the repeal of that Act. Clause 3 practically alters the locality within which the Federal Capital shall be established from Southern Monaro, or &#34; within 15 miles of Dalgety,&#34; as fixed by that Act, to the district of Yass-Canberra. As honorable senators are aware, the Yass-Canberra district is a very extensive one. It includes three, if not four, districts that were originally offered by the New South Wales Government as suitable areas within which to establish the Federal. Capital. It embraces Yass, which was one of the first sites visited by a Commonwealth Parliamentary party in connexion with its round of inspection of eligible sites. It also includes Lake George, and the Canberra site, which came into prominence some time later. I am not quite certain whether it does not also  include the  Mahkoolma  site. Of course, the passing of a Bill of this description is merely preliminary to the work which must be undertaken before the permanent Seat of Government can be established. The measure will practically enable the Commonwealth Government to open up negotiations with the New South Wales Government, with the view to arriving at an arrangement which will be acceptable to both parties. Clause 4 of the Bill, with a very slight amendment, was also contained in the Seat of Government Act. It stipulates that the area of the Federal Territory shall be not less than 900 square miles, and that the Commonwealth must have access to the sea. As honorable senators are aware an attempt was made in another place to make this provision more definite. For my own part I do not see any necessity for any greater  definiteness,  seeing that it will accomplish everything that is necessary to enable the Governments of New South Wales and the Commonwealth to enter into negotiations. When&#39; these negotiations have been completed, when the area has been surveyed, and the exact spot within that area has been selected upon which the Federal Capital shall be established, it will be necessary to introduce another Bill, and to ask Parliament for an appropriation to enable the work of establishing it to be proceeded with. Clause 5 is not contained in the Seat of Government Act of 1904. It is intended to empower the Commonwealth Government to send its servants into the Yass-Canberra area for the purpose of surveying it, arid with a view to collecting the necessary data to enable Parliament to arrive at a definite decision. Clause 6, with a slight modification, was incorporated in the Seat of Government Act of 1904. Honorable senators will notice that it alters the date prescribed in that Act to 8th October of the present year. We must all recognise that it would scarcely be possible for this Parliament to enact legislation of a retrospective character by fixing the land values in the Yass-Canberra district at the values which obtained in 1904. Consequently we must give the land-owners in that area the benefit of any increase which may have taken place in those values during the past four years. Of course, it may be urged that we have no right to do anything of the kind. But honorable senators must recognise that in the area alluded to in the original Act, there was much more Crown land than there is in the area with which we are now dealing. I believe that all the Crown land in the Yass-Canberra district has already been alienated. It is therefore very necessary that some provision should be made in the Bill with respect to valuations. When any arrangement is attempted to be made between private individuals and the Government of any State, or of the Commonwealth, there is always an endeavour to get as much as possible out of the Government. There is therefore in the present Bill a clause for the protection of the Government itself. 1 have given honorable senators a fair outline of what is contained in the measure. Everything that was in the original Act is embodied here. Matters relating to acquiring access to the sea, and dealing with any territory that may be acquired, or that Parliament may think it  necessary  to acquire for carrying our Commonwealth functions, will be dealt with in negotiations which take place between the Government of the Commonwealth and the Government of the mother State. When those negotiations are completed, and all the necessary information is acquired, a new Bill will have to be introduced to fix more definitely the site on which the Commonwealth Capital shall stand. The project will then come before Parliament again. I have no desire to weary the Senate by making a long statement. We have all had enough of the Federal Capital for at least one session. I therefore move the second reading of the Bill without further comment. </para>

                        <para>. - I quite agree with the Vice-President of the Executive Council that there is no call for lengthy speeches on the measure now submitted to us. We have traversed the ground so frequently that little that is new remains to be said on the main points at issue. I desire, however, to congratulate the Government upon the attitude which they have taken up. The position stated by the Vice-President of the Executive Council seems to me to be not only defensible but absolutely right, and not to be one that calls in any way fe&#62; apology. &#39; ^ </para>

                            <para>- I remind the honorable senator that none have advocated elective Ministries more earnestly than members of his own party have done, and I think that he has been a supporter of the principle. He will recognise that an elected Ministry would carry out the wish of Parliament when expressed by resolution. If the honorable senator and those who think with him believe in elective Ministries, and in the obligation of a Government to carry out a resolution of Parliament, surely that obligation applies also to the Ministry of to-day. When once the wish of Parliament is made clear it becomes an obligation on the Ministry to give effect to it. </para>

                            <para>- As I am asked that question, I will answer it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has been one of the principal causes of delay. But let me return to the point that every  Commonwealth Ministry has adopted the course now being taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> and his colleagues. When the Reid-McLean Government was in office it fell to the duty of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dugald</inline> Thompson to press forward the Bill which nominated Dalgety, and he Bid his duty honestly and well. He sought to give effect to the wish of Parliament as expressed in that Bill. A little later the Deakin Ministry did the same. Certain members of that Ministry, who did not believe in Dalgety - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Groom,</inline> to wit - still &#39; regarded it as a duty cast upon the Ministry to endeavour to give effect to the wish of Parliament. It is quite true that there were one or two rebels, principally in this Chamber; but at the same time the attitude taken up was that it was a duty incumbent upon the Government to seek to carry out the wish of Parliament. The present Ministry is following exactly the same course. I am not only pleased that that is being done because the proper course is being followed, but also because I think that proceedings on this subject have already been too much drawn out. Regarding the Bill itself, I quite agree that there is not much to be said, because this measure, except for the substitution of Yass-Canberra for Dalgety, has already been discussed in the Senate. Every clause has been before us previously. The provisions that were right in regard to Dalgety cannot be wrong with regard to Yass-Canberra. </para>

                            <para>- I approve of them in regard to Yass-Canberra. There has been, with regard to the present Bill, moreover, a very frank declaration on the part of the Government of New South Wales, that they are prepared to regard&#39; any overtures from the Commonwealth Government in a spirit of liberality. The various details of the measure have been threshed out before. Consequently there is. not much need for criticism at any length now. I should like, however, to point out, rather in emphasis of the remarks, made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, that this measure is in no sense final. It merely reduces to the four corners of an Act of Parliament a resolution previously arrived at. That resolution had no legal force outside the walls of Parliament. It is now sought to embody the will of Parliament in an Act. The sole purpose of that Act, to my mind, is to put the Government of the Commonwealth, in a position to enter into formal negotiations with the Government of New South Wales. I believe that those negotiations will be entered upon with an honest desire on both sides to bring the matter to completion. It will, I am confident, be found that the Government of New South Wales will lend every assistance, and make every effort to bring about the completion and&#39; settlement of the question. For those reasons, and with a desire to make my remarks as brief as possible, I shall conclude by saying that I will assist the Government, to have the matter carried through. </para>

                        <para>.- Motions expressing disagreement with rulings of the  President  have been submitted in the Senate at various times since I have been a member of it, but I have never yet known such a motion to be treated as one of urgency requiring immediate determination.&#39; These motions have always, in accordance with the Standing Orders, been adjourned to the next sitting day for discussion and decision, and certainly no one has ever suggested that their determination was a matter of urgency on such flimsy grounds as those put forward by the Vice-P.resident of the Executive Council when he says that the determination of this matter is urgent because of the late period of the session. The session has not lasted for many months altogether, and we have been sent here, not to close up a fortnight before Christmas, but to do the business of the country, no matter how long it takes to do it. </para>

Any intelligent man is able to say whether the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is one which requires immediate determination. We know very well that it does not require immediate determination. No hardship will accrue to any one if it is not dealt with at once. Honorable senators opposite who are so anxious now to proceed with the Seat of Government Bill must be aware that during the present session the Capital site question has been postponed, and a decision upon it delayed on two or .three occasions, whilst the members of their party squabbled amongst themselves as to who should occupy the Treasury bench. </para>

I submit that this is not a matter of such extreme urgency that the Senate should depart from the practice hitherto invariably followed. I have said that honorable senators who appear now to be so anxious that the Bill before the Senate should be passed have not always considered the settlement of the question a matter of such urgency that the standing order should be set aside in order that it might be proceeded with. No one will be injured by the postponement of the determination; of the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> until to-morrow. </para>

                                is all eagerness to work at the present moment.  His  desire is that the Federal Parliament should be housed in its own building at the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth immediately, if not sooner. But he must admit that a delay of twenty - four hours in the settlement of the question is not a matter of vital consequence. In answer to the Vice-President of the Executive Council, I said that we are sent here to do the business of the people, and not to adjourn a fortnight before Christmas. We are given an allowance to cover our expenses, and I imagine that the people regard the allowance as sufficient to cover our expenses, even though Parliament should be obliged to sit the whole yea&#39;r round. The idea that members of Parliament can take a holiday at any time they think fit, and arrange to do the business of the country to suit their own convenience, should have been exploded long ago. We are not here to suit our own convenience, but to do the work of the country in a legitimate way. Honorable senators cannot honestly claim that the determination of the point raised by

                            <para>- The representatives of the Government in the Senate came to the conclusion that the best thing to do was to get this Bill through the second-reading stage, and then take up the Manufactures Encouragement Bill. In accordance with the promise I gave on a previous occasion, I am anxious, if time permits, that honorable senators, who have private business on the paper should be given an opportunity to deal with it this evening. If we pass the Manufactures Encouragement Bill to-day, we can resume the consideration of the Seat of Government Bill to-morrow. I shall then probably be in a position, according to the progress which has been made with business in another place, to make a statement as to whether the Senate should be asked to meet on Monday, Tuesday, an&#39;d Wednesday of next week. </para>

A similar power is contained in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Cases may arise in which there may be a State industrial authority, such as a Wages Board, to which the matter might be referred, but for the fact that its awards are limited to a particular district.

In the first place I take it that he would have recourse to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court, but circumstances might arise in which the adoption of that course would not be convenient. </para>

For instance, any person might manufacture some of these goods incidentally to his ordinary manufacturing operations, and under such circumstances it would be farcical to refer the question of whether he had paid fair and reasonable wages to his employes to an authority a thousand miles away when recourse might be had to an industrial authority which was much nearer. </para>

                        <para>- The Government take up the position that the rates of wages practically cover the whole of the labour conditions. If a man be asked to work more than eight hours a day, the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court or the State industrial authority to which the question is referred will say that for overtime he must be paid at the rate of time and a quarter. That is equivalent to saying that he shall not work more than eight hours a day. </para>

                            Higgins in his award in the case of the agricultural implement makers, laid down a rate of wages for eight hours, and then prescribed the payment for overtime. He further laid down the rate which should be paid for adults, and for youths. In his award, he only, prescribed the wages which should be paid to apprentices and journeymen, thus wiping out the improver system in its entirety. I think, therefore, that the Committee may confidently accept the provision.

In the absence of an industrial organization there, and seeing that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins would not have an opportunity of expressing an opinion upon the conditions obtaining in that State if the industry were established there, it would be well to embody the eight hours&#39; system in this clause so as to put the position beyond dispute. </para>

The Minister who is1 in charge of this Bill to-day may not be charged with its administration when a dispute arises. There is no guarantee that the present Government will continue in office indefinitely. Suppose that the Minister is satisfied that the industrial conditions prevailing in the iron industry are fair and reasonable, and that he subsequently ascertains that they are not being observed in the way that was originally agreed upon, will the manufacturer to whom the bounty; has been paid be liable to a penalty? </para>

Even when a case was cited before the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court the McKay firm came forward and endeavoured to prove that they were paying fair and reasonable wages and observing proper industrial conditions. Attempts will doubtless be made by people in the iron industry to prove the same thing. In the event of the manufacturers making a departure from the conditions which they ought to observe, what course is open to the Minister? </para>

                        <para>- If a manufacturer says &#34; I have made 100 tons of pig iron under fair and reasonable conditions as to labour,&#34; the Minister will pay him the bounty on the <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100.</inline> If he afterwards departs from those conditions, and again asks for the bounty, the Minister will not pay it to him. If &#39;the manufacturer says that he has observed proper conditions of labour when he has not done so, he will be liable under clause 12 to fine and imprisonment. The present case is not on all fours with that relating to harvesters. There the manufacturer was not getting a bounty but a duty. There was no payment to him by the Minister. The only obligation was that if he did not observe proper labour conditions he should pay Excise. Here the reverse is the case. The manufacturer will have to come to the Treasurer for the bounty. Before the Treasurer pays any money over to him he will have to be satisfied that the labour conditions are fair and reasonable. </para>

                    <para>. - Two points have been raised, the answers to which, will stand some amplification. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> is under a misapprehension. He asks how a standard rate of wages is to be determined when there is only one industry of the kind. That question is being answered now. There is to-day in New South Wales a Wages Board under the Industrial Disputes Act, which has already. determined the question for the iron industry ; .and I believe that the Board is only awaiting the decision of this Senate before making its final determination. </para>

                        <para>- To my mind, the proper thing has been done, and I do not find fault with it. The Minister has properly pointed out the strongly-marked difference between, the collection of a tax from certain men and the payment of a bounty. The bounty remains in the Treasury until it is paid out, and the manufacturers can only get the money by satisfying the Minister that they have observed the conditions. That is the marked difference between this proposal, and the one with reference to harvesters that has been declared <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> We are not attempting to regulate wages. The manufacturers can pay any wages they like. We simply say to- them, &#34; Unless you pay the recognised standard of wages you will not get the bounty.&#34; That consideration ought to allay the fears of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> as to the constitutionality of the grounds upon which we are proceeding. I am with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> in his desire to see the interests of the men protected. I have looked into this clause very carefully, and it seems to me that it safeguards the interests of the men by throwing upon the Minister the responsibility of seeing that proper wages are paid before he authorizes the payment from the Treasury of a single penny in the way of bounty. </para>

If he turns to clause 13, subclause 3, he will find that it is there provided that the books of the manufacturers may be inspected for the purpose of ascertaining and reporting on the cost of production and manufacture. The Government would therefore be in a position1 to obtain all the information that they required. We can ascertain what wages are being paid, and if the Minister is not satisfied, he can refuse to pay the bounty. </para>

                    <para>.- A Government officer, under the Factories Act in Victoria, and under the Arbitration Act in New South Wales, can enter factories and workshops, and make inquiries from those engaged as to the hours they work and the wages they receive. But there are great difficulties in obtaining the information sometimes. If, however, the Minister was supplied with information as to the ages, addresses, rates of pay, and hours worked, of employes in the industry, he would have complete control. Had such a regulation been enforced in the harvester industry, a great deal of expense would have been saved to the workers. As a matter of fact, I made a similar suggestion upon the Bill affecting the harvester industry, but it was pointed out to me that such a provision could not be inserted. The suggestion is a good one. I make it again now. I am told that a Government officer can inspect the manufacturers&#39; books. But that is a costly, and sometimes an unsatisfactory, method. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the Bill will not be overloaded with a number of these provisions. I suppose that if this industry grows, it will employ1,000 or 1,500 persons, probably more. With men going and coming, probably every week, the preparation of a long list every week would lay upon the employers a burden which, I think, would be altogether unfair. It takes weeks to prepare some of the returns which are called for under the Factories Acts. The returns are sent in, pigeonholed, and never looked at. </para>

                        <para>- Why should the honorable senator call upon an employer to detail a man, week after week, to prepare a list of the workmen, and post it where, probably, it will never be looked at. If it would be of any value I should not object, but I do not think it is worth while to overload the Bill with a provision for that purpose, because the Minister, before he pays the bounty, will have every opportunity to discover whether proper conditions have been complied with, and that, I think, ought to be sufficient. </para>

                    <para>. - The last speaker spoke very feelingly of what he calls the very unnecessary hardships which are put upon employers by compelling them to make out a list of their employ&#233;s. and compiling various returns under the Factories Acts. I contend that from such legislation the good employer has benefited as much as, if not more than, any workmen. </para>

                        <para>- Formerly the good employer was driven to do things which were abhorrent to him by the competitive action of the bad employer. But under the Factories Acts all employers have to comply with certain conditions. In that way the good employer is safeguarded from the undue and sweating competition of the unfair employer. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> is contending for would be a very simple, but most important, safeguard, because no employer would dare to post a false notice as to the wages of any person. I take it that the fact that a man was set down as receiving certain wages would beprim&#226; <inline font-style="italic">facie</inline> evidence that he was entitled to them, and could recover them, by process of law. </para>

                        <para>- I have frequently gone into factories, and that has always been the first thing I have looked at. Some of the notices were eye-openers to me. As a safeguard to the workers, the posting of a notice at the ironworks would be almost invaluable. No man would be forced to become a marked man by insisting upon the right to look at the books, because the facts would be posted for every one to read. I hail with pleasure the Minister&#39;s declaration that he will see what can be done in that regard. I regret that the clause does not go far enough, and, therefore, the amendment in that respect will be defective. The clause  only  provides a safeguard for the men employed in the manufacture  of  the goods. It makes no reference to men employed in the mining of the ore. In reply to an interjection, the Minister said that he thought that the latter would be covered. I do not hold with that idea for a moment. For instance, a man growing wheat cannot be said to be engaged in the manufacture of flour any more than a man engaged in mining ore in Tasmania, although it might be for the same company, could be said to be engaged in the manufacture of iron at Lithgow. Tasmania possesses valuable iron ore. Probably the works at Lithgow, or any other works which might be established under the Bill, would draw a considerable portion of their ore from that State. They might own mines there, and directly employ men or contract for the supply of ore from their mines. In the limited sense in which the clause can be read, the employers, while paying fair and reasonable wages to the men engaged in the factory, could take it out of the unfortunate men who were working for them in the mines, and pay them under a contract or other system absolutely sweating wages. As we propose to give a handsome bounty, we should insure that the men engaged in the production of the ore and the manufacture of the goods, no matter whether there is a local Wages Board or a Factories Act, or not, shall receive fair and reasonable wages. The principle of new protection is generally approved not only by Parliament, but also by the people, and we should see that it is given effect to. I hope that the Minister will consent to a recommittal of the clause, so that it may embrace all employes. The amendment which the Minister seeks to insert is a valuable one. But it seems to me that there is a danger that it might be abrogated by future Administrations. The question as to whether the matter should be  referred  to a Judge of a High Court or a Judge of the Supreme Court of a State would be entirely optional with the Minister. He could act according to his own sweet will. In the whirligig of politics, it is quite possible that the administration of the law might be placed in the hands&#39; of an honorable senator opposite. It is quite possible, for instance, that it might be administered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon,</inline> who has emphatically declared that he is against all this unwarrantable interference with private enterprise. </para>

                            may indulge in all the&#39; cheap sneers he pleases, but the fact remains that Ministers come and go. In every State in Australia different Acts have had to be administered at frequent intervals by men holding varying opinions. We have little reason to expect that political conditions will be any more stable in the Commonwealth than they have been shown to be in the States. Our experience since Federation was established has not shown that any Federal Minister has a permanent hold of a portfolio. We must provide for the contingency that in the whirligig of politics, Ministerial changes will take place, and that men holding totally opposite views with regard to the justice of this kind of legislation, and with regard to the remuneration and conditions of labour, will at different times be called upon to administer this Bill. I do not desire that its administration should be at the mercy of any Minister. I have no wish to place such a responsibility upon any Minister. Under the amendment, it is left optional with the Minister to refer the matter to a Judge of the High Court or of a Supreme Court of a State, and I prefer a mandatory provision that, in the absence of the other standards provided for, the Minister shall refer the matter to a Judge of the High Court, or of the Supreme Court of a State. The Minister, whoever he might be, would then be relieved of the responsibility of giving a decision which might bring upon him the obloquy of employers or of employ&#233;s. The decision of the matter would be left to a Judge of the High Court or of the Supreme Court of a State to whom interested motives could not be attributed. He would therefore be removed from any adverse criticism, and his decision we might expect would give satisfaction to every one.

                        <para>- It is only right that they should be careful in such matters. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon&#39;s</inline> apprehension that there would be difficulties in the way of the adoption of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> &#39;s proposal is not well founded. I have occupied positions which have enabled me to Become acquainted with the inside running in connexion with the management of many industries. I know the way in which employers keep records of payments to their employes, and I say that there would be no difficulty about providing in this clause for the adoption of the course suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley.</inline> Every employer keeps a pay-sheet of his employes, and at least one copy of it. In the case of industries in which large numbers of persons are employed, it is the common practice to make up a pay-sheet, and to provide one, and in many cases, two or three copies of it, for every fortnightly pay. The purposes for which these pay-sheets are made up I need not describe. I venture to say that when the iron industry is set going, and is controlled by a company, a pay-sheet will be made up for every payment made to the employes, and a copy of it will be sent to the London office of the company, another to their Melbourne office, and another to their Sydney office, and a copy will be filed in the office of the works irrespective of the book records. There would be no difficulty at all in striking off a fourth or a fifth copy of the pay-sheet giving every item of information sought by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> and leaving it open to inspection in the works. With regard to the statement that the union secretary is the man who ought to fossick out all this information, I should like it to be shown that it has ever yet been possible in Australia for a union secretary to enter the office of an employer and demand from him a record of the wages paid to hisemploy&#233;s from time to time. </para>

I remember that on one occasion when, as secretary of an association of workers, I wished to see a number of the employes in an industry, who were members of the association, I went to the works where 300 men were employed. The office and the works were enclosed within a fence, and there was a great big six-feet-four policeman on hand to prevent me from getting through the enclosure to speak to the employes of the company.

                        <para>- Honorable senators must know that in these cases, the company always manages to have a big policeman at the office, whether to watch the pay-clerk or the men I am not prepared to say. When we are being asked to pay&#163;30,000 a year out of the funds of the Commonwealth to assist this industry, I see no reason why we should not make provision in this Bill for an accurate statement of the wages paid to the men working in the different branches of the industry ; not such a statement as has sometimes been submitted in some of the Courts of Victoria. All these records are kept by every employer of labour. </para>

                        <para>- He cannot. It is obligatory upon the Minister to satisfy himself in one of the ways I have outlined before the bounty can be paid. The Government pointed out to the Law officers of the Crown that, under the Sugar Bounty Act, the discretion of satisfying himself as to the wages paid in the sugar industry was left to the Minister, and we instructed them in drafting these clauses not to leave that discretion to him. The Law officers assure us that the clauses do not leave the matter to the Minister&#39;s discretion, as does the Act to which I have referred. He has to see that one of the three conditions to which I have alluded obtains. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator, I am sure, has the Sugar Bounty Act in his mind. But, as I have already pointed out, the position here is entirely different. This clause does not say anything about the Minister having to be satisfied as to the wages which are being paid. Let me put a concrete case - that of the Lithgow ironworks. We have been told that the conditions which obtain there are now being investigated by an Industrial Board, which will make an award. When the proprietors of those works claim the bounty, the Minister will say, &#34; I have first to ascertain whether the standard wages prescribed by the State industrial authorities have been observed.&#34; If he is satisfied upon that point, he will pay the bounty. </para>

                    <para>. - This clause provides that a return shall be laid before Parliament setting forth the names of all persons to whom bounties have been paid during the previous financial year, the amounts of such bounties, the goods in respect of which they were paid, and the names of the places and States in which the goods were manufactured. It seems to me that that return must contain a certain amount of information regarding the wages paid to, and the hours worked by employes, and that information I think ought to be laid before Parliament, otherwise Parliament cannot know whether the bounty has been properly or improperly paid. Under the circumstances, I think it would be wise to insert in the clause a new paragraph providing for the tabling of information regarding the number of hands employed, the ordinary hours worked bv them, and also the wages paid to the different classes of employes in the industry. </para>

                <para class="block">I wish to reduce the amount of the bounty to be paid for the production of pig iron from 12s. to 8s. The proportion proposed is altogether unfair. I voted against reducing the total amount of bounty because I considered it quite small enough. But I wish to see a fair distribution of the money. Every one who has any knowledge of the making of iron must admit that not half so much labour is expended in making pig iron as in making malleable iron ; while still more labour is involved in making steel. Yet, according to this schedule, the same amount of bounty is provided under each heading. The amount of labour put into the making of the article may be taken as a basis of calculation. According to the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allard,</inline> which has been distributed, the labour cost of making iron at Lithgow is very much inflated as compared with the cost of manufacture in other parts of the world. I cannot understand how the works have been managed - perhaps I should say mismanaged - because the sums mentioned are ridiculously high. For the life of me, I cannot see the justification for them. The various costs are stated under different headings. Whether that has been done for the purpose of concealing the mismanagement, and the enormous cost of manufacture at Lithgow, I do not know. First of all, we are given the figures for the making of a ton of iron. </para>
                <para class="block">It is stated that the cost of production is &#163;3 10s. per ton. The cost is made up of raw material, wages, coal, stores, repairs, depreciation, so much for reserve, the cost of relining furnaces, and administration expenses. It seems to me that the latter should be included under wages. </para>

                        <para>- Limestone, coal, and iron ore are requisite for the making of pig iron. In this book &#163;2 is set down for raw material and under the head of coal, stores and repairs I see the amount of  2s. 2d.  However, we will not quarrel about the headings under which the items appear, so long as they are accounted for. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jeans,</inline> iron is made at Pittsburg at &#163;1  12s. 5&#189;d.  a ton, and at Middlesborough, in England, at a little higher cost. The difference) is due, I suppose, to the fact that in England the plants are not so up to date as in Pittsburg, and perhaps the raw material costs a little more. We know that the. iron ore used in England contains a much lower percentage of iron than does that which is used in America. The price of making iron at Middlesborough is &#163;2  12s. 2d.  a ton, so that the price of &#163;310s. at Lithgow is very inflated compared with that which obtains elsewhere. We wish to do a fair thing by any companies which engage in the iron industry, and I hope that for the sake of the industry itself other works will be started. If I owned the works at Lithgow I should, remove them to a more suitable place. I believe that the great cost of producing pig iron at Lithgow can be traced to the fact that the iron ore has to be parried a considerable distance, from either Cadia or Carcoar, while the pig iron has to be taken a long distance to the coast. It is a place at which it is very expensive indeed to carry on an iron industry. The proposed bounty should be apportioned so that the makers of steel would get more than the makers of pig iron. Although it is well known that it is much more expensive to make steel than to make pig; iron, yet it is proposed to give the same bounty -  12  s.a ton - in each case. In Canada the bounty allowed for pig iron is about  8s.  a ton. If we adopt that figure, we shall deal very fairly indeed with the company. I do not propose to reduce the total amount of the bounty, but merely to secure a fairer apportionment of it, so as to enable other companies to engage in the industry, with the possibility of obtaining a share of this money. I wish to reduce the amount by  4s.  a ton. I believe that it would be to the advantage of the iron trades generally if we had another ironworks making pig iron. There are foundries at Melbourne, Ballarat, Castlemaine, and Bendigo, in Victoria; at Adelaide and Gawler, in South Australia; at Brisbane and Maryborough, in Queensland; and at Perth and Kalgoorlie, in Western Australia. In the interest of existing foundries we should encourage as many makers of their raw material as we possibly can, in order that it may be procurable at. a reasonable price. I hold&#39; that my amendment is calculated to induce other companies to engage in the iron industry. Such encouragement can only be given by apportioning the bounty in a more equitable way. </para>

We are supported by the Iron Bonus Commission, which went pretty extensively into the question of the cost of manufacture, and recommended a bounty of  12  s. a ton on pig iron. </para>

The higher we fix the bounty the more likely are we to secure competition. If it were reduced probably there would be fewer applicants. </para>

                        <para>- In the account which has been presented to us, the average cost of labour is put down at 12s. out of a total of 70s. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford&#39;s</inline> original estimate was near the truth. I am borne out by a statement which I saw only to-day in regard to a system of producing pig iron by electricity in Canada. The various costs are given, and the amount put down for labour is only $1 per ton. Of course the remark just made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> is partly justified by the fact that labour is required in getting the raw material. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I do not believe that the Senate would give a bounty to assist the production of coal, as that is quite unnecessary. In view of all the facts of the case I think that 8s. a ton is not only a sufficient but an exceedingly handsome sum to give. My desire is to put  all  the facts as I know them before the Committee. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has referred to the Canadian bounty. This year, the amount payable is $2 10 cts., which is equal to 8s. 9d., on what is known as the short ton of 2,000 lbs. Our bounty is based on the long ton of 2,240 lbs. The Canadian bounty of this year is equal to 9s. rod. on the long ton. Next year, on the long ton, Canada proposes to pay 7 s. 1 id., and in 1910, 4s. 3d. For years the &#34;Canadians have been chopping and changing. In 1897 they were giving equal to 14s. on the long ton. Originally they started with a duty of $i&#163;, equal to about 7s. ; then they adopted a duty equal to 4s. -lid. a ton, and afterwards they went up to 14s. a ton, so that they have been paying a variety of rates. This year they are paying a rate between 9s. and 10s. per ton, and, according to their law, the rate next year will be reduced to 7s. nd. per ton, and in 1910 to 4s. 3d. per ton, if in the meantime there is no change in the law. </para>

                        <para>- I think that 8s. per ton on pig iron, in view of the labour expended in production/, would be a very handsome payment. In fact, it is much higher than 12s. per ton on puddled iron. Honorable senators should bear in mind that we are being asked to give this &#34; bounty because of the extraordinary cost of labour. We have in three cases a uniform rate of 12s. per ton proposed irrespective of the labour expended in production. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie&#39;s amendment would provide for a fairer rate of payment, and the honorable senator does not propose to reduce the total amount of bounty granted. Whether the total amount agreed to be ^100,000 or .&#163;150,000, it is evident that we shall secure a greater production by paying at the rate of 8s. per ton than we should secure by paying at the rate of 12s. per ton. Looking at the matter all round, I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie&#39;s amendment should be accepted. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that Senators de Largie and Pulsford are entirely sincere in the statements which they have made to the Committee. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford</inline> publicly stated that he could manufacture pig iron at Lithgow at a certain price. He went into details as to cost of labour, and other charges accounting for the price which he quoted. He subsequently visited England and America, and returned to Lithgow, where he carried out a practical trial, and in a letter published in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Miming Herald,</inline> when he desired to secure additional share capital, and issued a statement of the cost of manufacturing pig iron, he had to confess he had made a mistake in the first estimate of the labour cost. It is clear that, in trying to issue fresh shares, no man would carelessly publish a statement which might have the effect of preventing financial people from investing their money in the business; but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford</inline> stated, emphatically that he had made a mistake in his first estimate, and that the labour cost involved in the manufacture of pig iron at Lithgow was double what he first anticipated it to be. Honorable senators must remember that in the manufacture of pig iron, the cost of coal, coke, limestone, iron ore, smelting, labour, cartage, and freight, must be taken into account. </para>

                        <para>- The freight on pig iron produced at Lithgow is 7s. 6d. per ton to Sydney, from 12s. 6d. to 15s. per ton to Melbourne, and 20s. per ton to Western. Australia. These charges must also be taken into account in reckoning the cost of carrying on the industry at Lithgow. It &#39;must be remembered also, that the Lithgow iron is brought into competition with pig iron imported from Lon don at a rate of freight which, in many cases, is less than the freight charged from 1 Lithgow to Melbourne. It is well known that pig iron imported from Glasgow and from America, can be landed at certain ports in the Commonwealth at a lower rate of freight than is charged from Lithgow to the same places. It is not often that, one has to make such a charge against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> ; but I must say that the honorable senator was very unfair in his references to Canada. He should have known that in Canada there is a duty of 10s. 3d. per ton, which is not imposed today and removed to-morrow, but is permanent. This must be added to the bounty of 8s., 10s., or 12s. per ton. If the duty is added, it will be found that even in those years in which the lowest rate of bounty was paid in Canada,, the actual encouragement given to the industry was far greater than that proposed1 to be given under this Bill. </para>

                        <para>- I am not dealing; with that argument, which I do not think is worth twopence. In- my opinion, an ounce of fact is worth a ton- of theory.. Men who have spent all their lives in the iron industry, have put their money into the works at Lithgow. They would not- have done so if they knew that they might - have carried on the industry more advantageously} at some other place. Every expert in the industry who has so far expressed an opinion, has stated that, taking the surrounding conditions into consideration, no place has yet been discovered in the Commonwealth which is more conveniently situated than is Lithgow for the successful manufacture of pig iron. It is idle to suggest that experts in. the business would invest large sums of money in an effort to carry on the industry at a place where the natural conditions are opposed&#39;&#34;&#39; to its being carried on successfully. If our honorable friends opposite know of some place where limestone, coal, iron ore; and all the other essentials of the industry could be obtained more cheaply than at Lithgow, it is strange that they should&#34; withhold the information from the Committee. They have given- reasons why, in&#187; their opinion, Lithgow is not a suitable place for carrying on the industry, and/&#39; it is acknowledged that, in view of the cost of distribution from Lithgow, there is something in the contention ; but unless -they can point to some other place in the Commonwealth offering better facilities for the successful prosecution of the industry, it is idle to repeat a general statement that Lithgow is unsuitable. For the reasons I have given, I trust that the Government will adhere to the rates of bounty as set out in the schedule. </para>

                    <para>- - The microbes have evidently been very much in evidence in this chamber. I always understood that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> was a free-trader ; but it seems that the microbe of protection has affected the honorable senator to such an extent as to induce him to deliver one of&#34; the strongest protectionist speeches I have ever had the pleasure of listening to. I do not suggest for a moment that the fact that the iron industry, so far as it is established at all in the Commonwealth at the present time, is established in the State of New South Wales, has anything to do with the honorable senator&#39;s sudden conversion, or with his enthusiastic support of this Bill. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray,</inline> animadverts upon his colleague. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> he should be able to give good reasons for his condemnation. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> gave excellent reasons for his support of the amendment proposing the reduction of the rate of bounty on pig iron from 12s. to 8s.  1  have always been in favour of granting a bounty to the iron industry, because I believe that its establishment is necessary to Australia. I am in favour of reducing the rate of bounty per ton proposed by the Bill, though  1  am not in favour of reducing the total amount of the bounty proposed. I do not believe <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie would favour a reduction in the total amount. </para>

                        <para>- I . favour a reduction of the rate of bounty per ton,, because I believe the reduced rate proposed would offer sufficient encouragement for the manufacture of pig iron, whilst it would insure a larger production,, which would be a distinct advantage to the people of Australia, whose money it is proposed to expend. It is proposed under the Bill to grant a maximum of &#163;30,000 a year in bounty, and 50,000 tons of pig iron would absorb the whole of that amount if the rate of &#34;bounty paid were 12s. per ton, as proposed in the Bill. But if the amount of the bounty be reduced to 8s. per ton, as proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, a production of 75,000 tons of pig iron would be necessary to absorb the &#163;30,000 which is to be annually paid in bounty. </para>

                        <para>- I do not anticipate that we shall have a surplus production for some time. But we are a young and growing nation, and it is possible that in the near future our requirements of iron will largely increase. Personally I shall be pleased if our production more than keeps pace with our increased demand. I repeat that it will be better for the people of Australia to have 75,000 tons of pig iron produced annually than to have only 50,000 tons produced. The question, therefore, arises, &#34; Is the bounty of 8s. per ton which is proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">&#39;Senator de</inline> Largie a sufficient encouragement to offer the industry?&#34; Upon the evidence that has been adduced I contend that it is. Before the Lithgow ironworks were taken over by the present proprietor, a competent actuary inquired into the conditions which existed there. In passing, I may mention that  1  had every sympathy with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford</inline> in his heroic efforts to establish the iron industry under difficult circumstances, and that sympathy is equally extended to the present proprietor. The actuary who inquired into the conditions which obtained at Lithgow prior to the transfer of the works, set down the total wages paid in the manufacture of a ton of pig iron at 12s. id. Under the Bill it is proposed to grant the firm in question a bounty of 12s. per ton - in other words, that we shall pay the whole of the &#39;wages of its employes. </para>

                        <para>- I could do an immense amount of work if I were subsidized to the same extent. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie does not propose to go the length of sanctioning the payment of the whole of the; wages absorbed in the industry, but he, nevertheless, proposes to treat it handsomely by paying two-thirds of its total wages cost. That is what his amendment to make the bounty  8s.  per ton really .represents. I contend that it is a proposal which should satisfy even the most ardent advocates of the establishment of the iron industry. We all recognise that in a young country like Australia one of the strongest reasons why industries should be encouraged by means of bounties is because employers are obliged to pay higher rates of wages than those which obtain in other countries. But I contend that when we assist the iron industry by paying two-thirds of its wages cost of manufacture, we are doing everything which can be expected of us in the way of relieving it of the disability under which it labours by reason of the higher wages which it is called upon to pay. According to the report of the actuary to whom I have referred, the cost of producing a ton of pig iron at Lithgow was <inline font-style="italic">&#163;3</inline> 10s.,  and the selling price of that iron was  ^3 7s.  id. per ton. In other words, there was a difference of  2s. 1  id. per ton between the cost of production and the selling price. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford</inline> was therefore losing, approximately,  3s.  per ton. </para>

                        <para>- That is not so. The actuary merely stated that he did not think he had allowed a sufficient sum for depreciation, and probably his statement was correct. But even if we add to his figures an extra is. per ton, the total loss sustained by the Lithgow firm would amount only to  4s.  per ton. Under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie&#39; s amendment, the industry would be encouraged by a grant of double the amount of that loss. In other words, it would be enabled to carry on its operations, and to convert its loss into a profit. </para>

                        <para>- All such matters are included in the total cost of production, which is  ^3  ros. per ton. Of course, it has been said that the freight from Sydney to Lithgow and from Lithgow to the seaboard is a very important item. But I would point out that ironworks in other parts of the world have also to pay freight to the coast. As a matter of fact, the great ironworks in America are situated  800  miles from the seaboard. </para>

                        <para>- In view of all the circumstances, I contend that the proposal which is embodied in the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, is an eminently fair one. If my calculation be correct - and I believe that if it errs it does so on the side of generosity to the Lithgow firm that amendment would have the effect of converting the loss of  4s.  per ton sustained by the works there, into a net profit of  4s.  per ton. That is a handsome allowance, and I hope that honorable senators who, like myself favour the Bill, will support the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - I was very much surprised to hear the arguments used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> in debating this question. I have a vivid recollection that last year, when other industries were asking for some slight measure of protection, he was in the habit of reminding us that they already enjoyed a large measure of natural protection by reason of their geographical position. . Yet he now calmly assures us that that circumstance tells against the iron industry which he is anxious to protect. I am in favour of reducing the bounty in accordance with the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. That amendment appears to me to be an eminently sensible one. We are asked to grant a&#39; bounty to those engaged in the iron industry because of the higher rates of wages which they pay to their employes as compared with the rates which are paid in other countries. We are not asked to give a proportion to make up the difference between the cost of labour in America, England, or Germany, as compared with Australia. We are asked to take the total cost of the labour. Never before have we been asked to give such a large amount of protection to an industry as this. Another reason for the amendment is that it would give to the manufacturer of pig iron proportionately the same assistance as to the manufacturer of bar iron and&#34; of steel. On pig iron costing  ^3 10s.  per ton to manufacture the Bill asks us to pay  12s.  per ton in bounty. It is admitted bv the actuary that the cost of making bar steel is _&#163;io  12s.  5d. per ton. So that it costs three times as much to manufacture bar steel as pig iron. Yet it is proposed to give only the same amount of bounty on an,&#39; article which it costs three times as much to make. We are certainly justified in asking that the bounty on a ton of pig iron shall bear some proportion to the bounty paid for the manufacture of rod iron or bar steel. Therefore the proposal is an eminently fair one. Seeing that the total amount of loss on the manufacture of pig iron at Lithgow is 3s. a ton, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie proposes to make up that loss, and, in addition, to pay the manufacturers 5s. a ton. We have never proposed to do more than that in connexion with any other industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has said that depreciation and interest are not reckoned in the actuary&#39;s statement. </para>

Unless we reduce the amount per ton as proposed, we shall in the first place be creating one big monopoly in New South Wales, and shall in the next place force all the users of iron in every part of Australia to go to one firm at Lithgow for all the iron which they require. Just imagine what that may mean. We establish the industry by means of a bounty. It being essentially an Australian industry, efforts will be made to stop the importation of raw iron. There will be a duty. </para>

Has there ever been a case where duties have been imposed and afterwards withdrawn because manufacturers made excessive charges? By having only one manufacturer, there will be an absence of competition. The monopolists will be able to charge the consumers any price they like. The consumers will have no alternative but to pay. </para>

                        <para>- That is a marvellous statement. If it be true that the manufacturers at Lithgow have been losing at the rate of 9s. per ton they must have lost thousands and thousands of pounds. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford</inline> told the Federated Chambers of Manufactures&#39; meeting the other day, that he was in a position to pay 20s. in the&#163;1. He was for a long period engaged in the industry, and we were given to understand that he had lost everything in his endeavour to establish it. But even if it were true that the manufacturers were losing 9s. per ton, is that a reason why Commonwealth money should be spent to make up the loss? If we cut down the rate as proposed, we shall be better able to give encouragement in other directions. According to the document received from Hoskins and Company, the cost of pig iron per ton is  &#163;3  10s., and the selling price&#163;3 7 s. I do not know where <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> obtained his information. </para>

                    <para>. - It seems to me that this bounty on pig iron has. been proposed under a false assumption. It is too large. We are asked to recompense the makers of pig iron at a higher rate than that at which they have been selling for years. If, as has been shown, they lose 3s. a ton, why should we give them a bounty of 12s. a ton? </para>

                        <para>- The conditions are different. If we reduce the bounty to 8s. a ton, we shall increase&#39; the prospects of getting pig iron made elsewhere. In my opinion, Lithgow is not a. proper place for that purpose. The iron.  industry should be established at the seaboard, where the fluxes could be obtained much more cheaply. </para>

                        <para>- The raw material of our ironfounders will be taxed to such an extent that it will drive out of politics the free-traders who are supporting the grant of this bounty. I do not wish to take too narrow a view of this question, and to pit one State against another. In order to illustrate what it will mean by-and-by to our manufacturers, I have been obliged to cite numerous places; but I can assure the Committee that the manufacturers of New South Wales regard this proposal from the same standpoint as do those in other States. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>

                <para class="block">Pearce said that the Iron Bonus Commission recommended a bounty of 12s. a ton on pig iron. But in its report, I can find no evidence why it should be 12s. rather than 8s. The only witness from whom I have been able to get any evidence is a New South Wales manufacturer whose opinion I am sure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> must take notice of ; and that is no less a person than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Franki,</inline> of Mort&#39;s Dock. He said that 12s. 6d. a ton - the amount which was proposed in the first instance - would be an extortionate one. That is the statement of one of the leading manufacturers in a favourably-situated centre, and one which my honorable friend cannot ignore. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, above all things, let us be generous; give a bounty of &#163;3 10s. a ton, so that the firm could supply pig iron free. That is the only way I can see of getting out of the difficulty. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> referred to the great expense experienced at Lithgow - high wages and so forth -as compared with other countries; but I am afraid that he is not so conversant with the conditions that obtain in those countries as he should be, otherwise he would not have argued in that way. I find that the conditions under which the industry is carried on in America are, in some respects, less favorable than those prevailing at Lithgow. It must be borne in mind that the principal works at Pittsburg, in the United States, are situated between 400 and 500 miles from the seaboard, and honorable senators will agree that it must cost something to transport iron over that distance. </para>

                        <para>- They are not fools. When the anti- Socialists have an opportunity to put their hands into the public purse, the Socialists are not in it with them ; they are elbowed to one side. According to the statements of those interested in this industry, the loss in manufacturing pig iron is 3s. per ton. If a bounty of 8s. per ton was granted, as I propose, that would provide for a clear profit of 5s. per ton, which would be a very fair profit on pig iron. I should like to quote the wages cost per ton in other countries, so that honorable senators may be satisfied that a bounty of 8s. per ton would be a very reasonable &#39;bounty to offer. According to the figures given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> Stephen Jeans, Secretary of the Ironmasters Association of England, in his latest work, published in 1906, the labour cost of manufacturing a ton of Bessemer pig iron in England is as. 9&#189;d.  In Sweden it is 3s. 1 id. In the United States, 6s. <inline font-style="italic">gd.</inline> ; and on the Continent of Europe, 2s. 2d. </para>

                        <para>- The matter has been discussed so fully that I do not think I shall be justified in continuing the debate much longer. It has been clearly pointed out that it must be a handicap to all engaged in industries requiring iron as a raw material if there is only one firm in Australia from which it can be obtained. Apart from their fiscal views, honorable senators naturally desire that justice should be done to all industries established in the States they represent. I strongly advise the Committee to do all that is possible to encourage the establishment of more than one ironworks in the Commonwealth. The rates of bounty set out in the schedule appear to have been specially arranged to suit the requirements of the only ironworks so far established in Australia. It will be noted that the rate proposed for pig iron would be just sufficient to cover the output of the one furnace erected by the Lithgow Company if it were worked at its full capacity throughout the year. A reduction of these rates by one-third might have the effect of forcing the Lithgow Company to erect another furnace or of encouraging others to establish a furnace elsewhere in the Commonwealth. I cannot understand free-traders, who know something of the operation of monopolies, regarding this matter as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> does. One of the principal manufacturers of Sydney  has said that he regards the rate of 12s. per ton as too high, and that if that rate of bounty is paid his interests are likely to suffer. </para>

                        <para>- He said the rate proposed was extortionate, and what other deduction could be drawn from that statement? The secondary industries requiring iron as a raw material must suffer if they have to pay the cost of transit on their supplies from works established in the Blue Mountains. It is so evident that, as it stands, the Bill will lead to the establishment of a monopoly in the  iron industry, that only a desire to secure its passage without alteration can justify those who are opposing my very reasonable amendment. A bounty of 8s. per ton is very reasonable, and is a great deal more than the bounty paid in Canada. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators opposite can take my word for it that later on we shall have the duty imposed in addition to the bounty. We should not shut our eyes to the inevitable. Unless this industry is given protection it must go down, and if after setting it going we are to keep it going, nothing is more certain than that a duty will have to be imposed later on. In the interests of the manufacturing industries requiring to use iron, I hope that honorable senators will do what they can to insure that those engaged in such industries shall have more than one ironworks to purchase their supplies from. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators propose to reduce the rate of bounty on pig iron and to increase the rate proposed on bar, sheet, and rolled iron. The effect of that would be to handicap the manufacturer using iron as a raw material. Because of a difference of a few shillings in freight the South Australian Government sent abroad for a large order for iron. In the Government workshops at Adelaide, the South Australian Government have established a plant which is second to none in the world for the manufacture of cast-iron pipes, and they use there 100 tons of pig iron per month. If a bounty at the rate of 12s. per ton were given for the production of pig iron, the South Australian Government would be able to purchase their supplies in the Commonwealth instead of having to send to England for them. The pipes manufactured are used in the  conservation  of water and the whole of the people are benefiting from the water that has been thus conserved by the South Australian Government. That is a strong argument in favour of retaining the Bill in its present form. Even if only one ironworks be established in Australia, by all means let us grant their enterprising proprietors a bounty of 12s. per ton in order to encourage our manufacturers to use pig iron of local production. Let us give them cheap iron, and all our other industries will unquestionably benefit. Up to the present, the loss sustained by the works at Lithgow has not represented a gain to anybody because of the practice which obtains of dumping iron here from abroad. It is an undeniable fact that almost every ship which enters Port Adelaide carries as ballast 400 or 500 tons of pig iron, upon which it receives no freight. I believe that the payment of the proposed bounty will have the effect of almost entirely preventing the continuance of that practice, because in connexion with the last contract entered into by the Government of South Australia the difference between the cost of the local and the imported article was only about 4s. per ton. I absolutely deny that the iron industry enjoys any natural protection by reason of our geographical position. </para>

                    <para>. - Before we proceed to a division I should like to refer to one or two statements which have been made. In the first place, I must express surprise at the warmth with which some honorable senators opposite have repeated the word &#34;monopoly.&#34; Because there is only one firm at present engaged in the iron industry they appear to assume that nothing should be done to place the industry upon a better basis. I am surprised that such remarks should emanate from honorable senators opposite, especially when I recollect that last year they did not hesitate to sanction the imposition of a very heavy duty in order tq assist the piano industry, notwithstanding it was well known that only one firm was engaged in that industry. Thus it .appears that in their  -eyes a monopoly is a legitimate thing to assist by means of a duty,&#39; but an illegitimate (thing to assist by means of a  bounty. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators -opposite have made it clear that they are prepared to kill this Bill by any means in their power, in order that they may pave the way for the nationalization of the iron industry. At the time of which I spoke just now, there was no prospect whatever of nationalizing the piano industry. They realized that any such proposal would have been laughed at. Therefore, although only one manufacturer was engaged in the industry, they cheerfully assisted him by the imposition of a  heavy  protective duty. If their arguments upon that occasion were sound, surely they are equally sound now? Having approved of the payment of a bounty to encourage the iron industry, Parliament should be prepared to grant that bounty, irrespective of whether there be one man or fifty men engaged in the industry. Do we not desire that others should embark upon the same enterprise? If we wish to induce -competition with the Lithgow works, are we not more likely to accomplish our aim by offering* a high bounty than by offering a low one? </para>

In the case of pianos, one of the richest men in Australia, having a monopoly in the goods which he manufactures so far as this country is concerned, was granted a duty equivalent to 50 pei cent, on wares. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> was not precluded from voting for that. </para>

                        <para>- There was a duty imposed on pianos which was equivalent to 50 per cent, on the lower grades. To come down to the temperature of cold iron again, the next argument which I have to answer - if I may dignify it with the name of an argument - is the astonishing assurance that the bounty is going to increase the price of (he commodity upon which it is paid.  One is accustomed in politics to expect extraordinary statements from those who are placed in a tight corner, but it surprised . me, with my limited political experience, to hear such an assurance from a body of presumably intelligent men. </para>

                        <para>- Really, I venture to think that after that remark there is no: thing more to be said. It sums up the whole position, so far as my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> is concerned. We have only to remember his attitude when the Tariff was under discussion. There was then no industry so insignificant and paltry, even if the whole of the machinery employed in connexion with it was run by a &#39;possum-power gas engine, and only a boy and a half were employed to distribute the goods, but the honorable senator dinned our ears with harrowing stories of the suffering that would be inflicted upon the employes unless a duty of anything up to 50 per&#39; cent, was imposed. Now, however, when we are concerned with an industry which is employing 1,000 men, we have to face <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley&#39;s</inline> strenuous opposition, because they are employed at Lithgow. It is evident to all of us by this time that the honorable senator confines his patriotism to the limits of the State in which we are assembled. </para>

                        <para>- The cost of manufacture, as given by the actuary, is 12s. per ton. Here let &#39;me draw attention to an error into which, I think, honorable senators opposite have fallen. They seem to assume that the 12s. per ton set out by the actuary was the full labour cost in connexion with the manufacture of pig iron. That is a lamentable mistake. Long before that labour cost of 12s. per ton commences to be incurred, there is an enormous proportion paid away in labour in producing the crude ore. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators opposite should arrange amongst themselves what story they are going to tell before they ask me to believe either of them. I believe the actuary rather than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. The actuary, I have not the slightest doubt, was correct in saying that the labour cost at the Lithgow works was 12s., but it is not correct to argue from that statement that only 12s. worth of labour is involved in a ton of pig iron placed on the market. </para>

                        <para>- Half-a-dozen honorable senators have said so. I quite admit that 12s. is represented in labour from the time the raw material enters the Lithgow works until the time it comes out manufactured. But it is wrong to infer, as some honorable senators have done, that only 12s. per tcn is involved in labour in the total cost of making pig iron. </para>

                        <para>- I find a difficulty in arguing with honorable senators who take up an authority, and say that he is competent and efficient, but who, when it no longer suits them to quote that authority&#39;s statement, throw him under the table. Is this actuary a <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> authority or not? He is an authority of recognised standing in Sydney, who, for the time being, became an officer of the Court, seeing that the Court called him into its service to perform the duty of reporting to it. It is idle to assume that his figures are open to challenge. I say again that whilst 12s. mav be the total cost of the labour at and around the furnaces, a very much larger sum is paid to labour in connexion with the total production of a ton of pig iron. The great bulk of the cost in obtaining the crude ore is represented by labour. </para>

                        <para>- All that I am saying is that we are not giving a bonus of 12s. per ton in return for 12s. per ton spent in labour, but that far more is spent on labour than is represented by the expenditure at and around the furnaces at Lithgow. May I now return to the point from which I was drawn by interjections, namely, whether the bounty is likely to increase the selling price of iron in Australia. I say again that it is impossible for the Lithgow or any other ironmasters to charge more for their iron than the price at which it can be brought into our different ports; nor, may I add, do I think they will sell it for less than the price for which it can be imported. </para>

                        has questioned my attitude with respect to the duty on pianos when the Tariff was under discussion. He said that on that occasion we did not hesitate to impose a duty of 50 per cent, on musical instruments. In the first place, that is a mis-statement. We did not vote for any such duty. We wanted a high duty in order to establish the piano-making industry in the Commonwealth ; and when those who desired a reduction of the duty pointed out to myself and others &#34;that the imposition of a duty on pianos would give a monopoly to a certain gentleman in New South Wales, I said, &#34;&#39; If it is a monopoly, we will increase the duty in order that you who make that complaint may be able to come in and break up the monopoly by starting the industry in other places.&#34; The result has been that since the passing of the Tariff a piano factory has been established at Richmond, in Victoria. There is no analogy between the imposition of a duty on pianos and the grant of a bounty to the iron industry at Lithgow. Disguise if as we may, this bounty is intended for Hoskins and Company, and for no other firm, because no one in his wildest moment would suggest that another iron industry will be established in the Commonwealth during the lifetime of any one of us.

                        <para>- I did not. The fact that this firm have found it difficult, not  only  in New South Wales, but in every other State, to get the capital which they say is necessary to thoroughly establish the iron industry is evidence that for a considerable time there will not be any further attempt made in any part of Australia to establish a similar industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has stated that about 1,000 men are employed at Lithgow. Are they employed in connexion with the industry which we are now discussing ? Because, if they are engaged now, it is clear evidence to me that without a bounty and a duty they have, notwithstanding &#39;the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford,</inline> made immense headway since he had the works. </para>

                        <para>- I am only showing that the industry has been making splendid progress in New South Wales, notwithstanding the statement made that it is a ruined one. When he was examined at that time, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford</inline> told the Commission that he could produce pig iron at Lithgow for 35s. a ton, and when he was asked afterwards to give the prices of pig iron in other parts of the world, he said, quoting from <inline font-style="italic">American Industrial Conditions and Competition,</inline> that the cost of Bessemer pig iron at Pittsburg was computed at 32s. 5&#163;d. per ton, and at Pittsburg No. 1 Foundry at 36s. 6d. a ton. Considering the charges incidental to the carriage of that heavy material, if he could produce pig iron at 35s. a ton at that time, and the&#39; cost of production in America was 36s. a ton, what was the reason then for asking for a bounty on pig iron ? Further, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford</inline> said that it would be an impossibility for .the industry to be carried on, even with a bounty, without a duty being imposed on the raw material. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> knows as well as any one sitting on his side that if an additional bounty is not granted to this industry, demands will be made for the imposition of a duty on the raw material. When the bounty is exhausted, will fie be prepared to vote for the duty suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford,</inline> namely, 20 per cent, against foreign countries, and 10 per cent, against Great Britain? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford</inline> said that those rates would have to be added to the cost of the raw material turned out at Lithgow. So that, looked at from the free-trade aspect, it will mean eventually higher prices for the raw material required by the manufacturers in every State. </para>

                        <para>- Neither a duty nor a bounty will deter the honorable senator and his colleagues from New South Wales from voting for probably both a duty and a bounty in order to see the iron industry established there. When he said that we are doing all we can to kill it, he made an unfair and incorrect statement. We are doing all we can to prevent the industry from being established with Commonwealth money to enrich a few citizens of New South Wales. We are striving to establish it on a concrete foundation, in order that all the citizens rf the Commonwealth, instead of being disadvantaged as they will be by a bounty, may be advantaged as they will be when the industry is nationally owned. I believe that it would be one of the best industries which Mie Commonwealth could possess if it were so owned. But I fear that it will be one of the worst industries ever established in the Commonwealth if it is established under the conditions contained in this Bill. In the first place, it will penalize every citizen, because the money will have to be found by the taxpayers. Probably, the representatives of New South Wales have been approached more than once with a view to taking shares in the concern, and would not put their money into it. But they have no hesitation in putting, metaphorically speaking, their hands into the Commonwealth Treasury and taking the people&#39;s money to start the industry. </para>

                        <para>- Protection is altogether distinct from a bounty to a private monopoly. I am surprised at honorable senators opposite trotting out that argument day after day. There is no analogy between the bounties granted under a previous measure and the bounty proposed in this Bill. It was stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> in reply to an interjection, that those bounties gave a fair field and opportunity to every citizen. Now this bounty will give an opportunity to only  :i.  small section in New South Wales who are using influences of all sorts in order ro move Parliament to grant the money which they say is necessary to start the industry. I hope that the amendment will be carried. </para>

                        <para>- Then we have misunderstood the honorable senator,, and the sooner he makes himself intelligible and clear on the matter the better it will be for both himself and us. I have quoted the labour cost in America simply because it appears to be from 12 per cent, to 25 per cent, more per ton there than in any other place where iron is made. I think that we can safely assert that there is something radically wrong if a ton of pig&#62; iron cannot be produced at Lithgow at a less labour cost than 12s. In the evidence which has been submitted to us no one has asserted that that sum will not cover the labour cost of producing a ton of iron. I do not pay any attention to the argument, which classes the coal miners with the producers of pig iron in black furnaces at Lithgow, because I hold that those are two separate branches of the business. Whilst they may come into contact indirectly, they are absolutely apart when it is a question&#39; of the cost of producing a ton of pig iron. I do not imagine for a moment that the mine which is required to produce coal will be used exclusively in connexion with the production of pig iron. If it is any kind of amine it will produce much more coal in one year than the Lithgow blast furnaces can use in three times that period. The cost of production, which it is fair to consider, is the true cost of manufacture after the raw material is landed at the works. If the Lithgow works cannot produce iron for less than 12s. per ton, I am at a loss to understand how they can expect to continue the industry under almost any conditions that could be named. I have quoted a cost of &#163;1 7s. 8d. per ton for the manufactured article, with all the labour cost and other charges added,, and in all the circumstances, if a bounty of 8s. per ton is not sufficient to enable- those interested in the Lithgow works to continue the industry, their position must be absolutely untenable. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope the Committee will not accept the amendment. The duties imposed upon galvanized iron are so low as to constitute merely revenue duties. They cannot have the effect of establishing the industry for its manufacture in Australia. That is proved to demonstration, and their imposition simply means that a certain amount of revenue will be collected from them. The payment of the bounty proposed would almost certainly lead to the establishment of the industry on sound lines, and the cost of galvanized iron to those requiring to use it would fall as the result of the internal competition thus set up. </para>

Subsequently the Tariff was altered, and pipes of not more than 6 inches internal diameter were admitted free, and over that diameter dutiable.

The result of last night&#39;s division upon a crucial amendment, which provided for the nationalization of the industry at some future date, proved conclusively to me that my honorable friends opposite, having secured all that they desired, wish to defeat the purpose which the Government have in view. That being so, I should like to see the measure consigned to oblivion. The very best arguments which have been adduced against granting a bounty to the iron industry were those advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> this afternoon. </para>

                    <para>. - I shall vote against the motion for the third reading of this measure. In the first place I believe that more power should be reserved to the Commonwealth to take over and conduct the iron industry in the interests of the people. I do not believe in taking money from the Consolidated Revenue for the purpose of assisting private enterprise, and in again dipping into the public Treasury after the industry has become a monopoly, for the purpose of enabling those who are engaged in it to make a considerable profit. If the Bill becomes law, the industry will be assisted by the people of Australia collectively. </para>

                        <para>- Since I have been a member of this Chamber, no Bill has been brought forward which provided for the granting of bounties to Queensland industries. But when the Bounties Bill was under consideration last session, I voted for most of the items contained in it. I have since learned that under that measure about&#163;10 has been paid by way of bounty to industries in Queensland, and about  &#163;1,000  to industries in Tasmania, the representatives of which strenuously opposed &#34;its passing. </para>

                        <para>- I. voted for the Bill (because it was intended to encourage people in different parts of the Commonwealth to -embark upon various enterprises. We have  merely  to recall the fact that the bulk of .the money expended under the authority of that measure has been expended in Tasmania to perceive that its benefits are not confined to Queensland. Nevertheless, Queensland industries have as much right to claim bounties as have Victorian or Tasmanian industries - no &#39;more and no less. We all know that only one firm in Australia is at present producing pig iron. </para>

                        <para>- No. I have always contended that it is just as  necessary  te establish the iron  industry  in the Commonwealth as it is to construct railways. But I believe that Australia is better off as the -result of its railways being controlled by the State than it would be if they were controlled by private enterprise. For the same reason I hold that the iron industry should be nationalized. In this connexion  wi?  ought to recollect that the States Governments are the largest users of iron in &#34;.the Commonwealth. That is one reason why I am opposed to the third reading of this measure. Another reason is that it contains a clause which presumably is intended to safeguard the interests of the wage-earners - a clause in which I have not a great deal of faith. In the first place, whom will such a provision protect? Will it protect those who are engaged in procuring the raw material of iron ? Will it protect those who. are employed in obtaining the ore, the limestone, the fluxes, and the coke? At the present time, these persons. I contend, have no protection under the law. </para>

                        <para>- That is possible; just as in Queensland we have a Wages Board Act, which- covers every industry in the State, though at the same time many years will elapse before those engaged in the farming industries receive the benefit of the legislation. But we are not giving bounties to the employers in those industries. We are not putting the public purse  at their disposal. In this instance, however, we are taking out of the public Treasury a large sum of money for the benefit of people who will be enabled to employ labour under almost any conditions which workmen can be induced to accept. I say that that is not fair. I do not know whether the Bill will extend to the hours of labour or not. It contains no provision stating whether the workmen are to work eight or ten hours a day. But power is given to the Minister to deal with wages in a certain way. In what way? When the manufacturer claims the bounty he will send &#39;in to the Minister a statement of the wages that he has paid to various employes in accordance with awards given under the laws of New South Wales. But we have been told that within two years or so the iron industry will be established in Tasmania. Is there any legislation in that State regulating wages ? None whatever. </para>

                        <para>- That is so; but if the ruling rate of wage common to the district is paid in the industry, I hold that the Minister will have no power under this Bill to say that the wages shall be the same as those paid at Lithgow. Take the present condition of things with regard to Commonwealth contracts. A clause is inserted in them to the effect that the rates of wages ruling in the district where a contract is carried out shall be paid for labour. How does that work out? In a district where there is. no industrial legislation, the ruling rate is anything that employes can get. Say that the ruling rate around Brisbane is 8s. a day. Twenty miles from Brisbane work may be done for the Commonwealth, and the ruling rate of wage may be anything that the people employed can obtain, and nothing more. I know of cases where men have been employed on Commonwealth work for very low wages indeed. Similarly in connexion with this Bill, I hold that &#39;we shall not be able to determine what is the ruling rate of wage for similar work in a particular district, because there will be no similar work there. </para>

In some parts&#39; of Australia the shearing rate is 24s. per 100, and&#39; in another part of Australia the rate is &#163;1 or 2 is. If the ruling rate in the place where the industry is established is considerably lower than in another place,  the  lower rate will be fair and reasonable as far as that particular locality is concerned. </para>

Another reason for my opposition is that there is no other industry in Australia as to which it has been advocated that the full labour cost of the material produced shall be paid by means of a bounty to the manufacturers. We are told that some of us, when the Tariff was under consideration, voted for a duty of 25 per cent, on pianos. </para>

                        <para>- As a matter of fact, I am informed that nothing like the value of the labour put into that commodity was represented by the duty. At any rate, it was not money taken out of the public Treasury to subsidize a particular firm. We are able to estimate exactly what the present proposal means, because we have the evidence of men &#34;who were specially appointed to make an investigation, and who reported that 12s. was the value of the labour put into a ton of pig iron. Yet the Commonwealth is asked to defray the whole of that cost. It is altogether too much bounty to give. When we recall the very hard fight we had to get a slight modicum of protection for a number of industries which have been established in practically every State, and which were not in the nature of monopolies, we cannot help but be surprised at our OPponents on that occasion coming along now and coolly asking that the full labour cost of producing pig iron should be borne by the public Treasury. I decline to be a party to such legislation. In all probability the Bill will pass. I do not expect for a moment that honorable senators will worry- about how much money is to come out of the public Treasury, so long as the </para>

                <para class="block">Commonwealth is prepared to build up this industry at the public expense. But I have a right to enter a protest if I believe that it is not being done in a satisfactory manner. It was stated only a little while ago that no honorable senator who supported the Bill would be a party to supporting any proposal whereby a bounty and a duty would run concurrently. Yet that is what is proposed. I was prepared in connexion with the Tariff to vote for a sufficient amount of protection on the articles which are enumerated in class 2 of the schedule to this Bill, but who frustrated my efforts? Honorable senators on the other side said then that in the interests of the primary industries, articles such as galvanized iron, wire netting, and things of that sort, must be admitted either free or at as low a rate as possible. I do not complain about their action. I was prepared to extend to those industries a fair amount of protection, because I believed that it was necessary. But I preferred to do so in a straightforward manner. In the case of articles which are essential to primary industries I can understand that by imposing a certain duty, manufacturers will be enabled to put them on the market, and every one will have an opportunity to get them at practically the same price. But it is a different matter when honorable senators who voted for those articles to be admitted either free or at a low duty come down with a Bill of this description and say, &#34; We .do not believe in assisting industries which are established in different parts of the Commonwealth, but in order to assist an industry which in its very nature is a monopoly, we are prepared to go back upon our opinions and our votes in connexion with the Tariff, and, by a side wind, to supplement the duties imposed on certain  articles with a bounty which, will be taken out of the public purse.&#34; I ask my honorable friends to consider whether that is the best method to pursue. From an interjection made by the leader of the Opposition in the debate on the second reading of the Bill, I gathered that he would be no party to a duty and a bounty running concurrently, and I think that I interjected &#34; Hear, hear &#34; to his statement. I still hold to my view, because, in my judgment, it is not right to play a sort of &#34;in and out &#34; game. I know very well that the argument will be advanced that this bounty of about ^180,000, which it is proposed to. give to practically one firm, will foster primary industries in that it will enable a man who goes out back to get his galvanized iron more cheaply than he could do in any other way. But that applies to only a limited portion of Australia. Who believes for a moment that it applies to the farthest parts of Western Australia, or to the central portion of Queensland, or to the northern parts of Australia? Not one honorable senator believes that the bounty will assist a settler in those localities, although he will be called upon to contribute to the bolstering up of a particular industry. This proposal is altogether wrong. When the Tariff was under consideration no one proposed or hinted that because wire netting was used by a particular class a bounty should be given if it were made locally. It was proposed that it should be subject to a duty which would apply equally throughout the Commonwealth. It is because this bounty will apply to only a limited area, and will bes subscribed by the people, that I am prepared to vote against the third reading of the Bill. I voted against its second reading and did my best to get amendments made in Committee, and now, because I do not believe that it will do much to assist industries which are receiving a certain amount of protection, I shall record my vote against its third reading!. </para>

                    <para>. - Although I have opposed this measure, I do not altogether deplore the fact that it is proposed to give some encouragement to the iron industry. I entertain grave objections to the manner in which it is to be established, because I believe that it will lead to a great deal of trouble by-and-by, and that we shall have to cover the same ground again. Not only that, but once a vested interest has been established, we shall experience greater difficulties, in dealing with the industry, than we would if we undertook to establish it straight away. I believe that in the future it will become a great industry, and of greater advantage to Australia, perhaps, than any other industry which could be established. But it will cost an enormous amount to the taxpayers, who, I am afraid, will receive very little return. I believe that the time will come when the industry will be very remunerative to those who have an interest in it. It is because I believe first that a great expenditure will have to be incurred to establish the industry, and secondly that it will return an enormous profit, just as has been the case in other countries, that I think we are taking a step in the wrong direction in allowing it to get into the hands of private individuals. If ever there was an industry which should be placed in the hands of the central Government, it is- this one. However, the Senate has decided to take a certain step, and though I believe that it is a false and foolish one, judging by all the evidence at our disposal, I recognise that I must bow to the inevitable. I should not have offered such strenuous opposition to the Bill, but for a sense of public duty. Before the electors I have always advocated the establishment of the iron industry. Had I not taken up a strenuous attitude against the Bill, I should have felt that I had failed in my duty. It would have been cast up at me that I had failed simply because a Labour Government was in office. I think that I have demonstrated that whether political friends are in office or not, I am prepared to stand by my principles. A man should always consider his principles before he considers even his political friends. I have done so; and I am now content to allow the measure to pass and to let time reveal whether we acted wisely in the interests of the community as a whole, in permitting the iron industry to get into the hands of a private company or not. </para>

                        <para>- Order ! The honorable senator appears to be alluding to a debate which took place in Committee, and in which certain statements were made regarding an amendment. A little time ago, I pointed out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> that he could not allude to a debate which had taken place in Committee. I have since read standing order 399, which is perfectly clear on the point. It is as follows - </para>

                <para class="block">When I pointed out previously that this course was not in order, I had in mind a distinct ruling which was given by a  Speaker  of the House of Commons some years ago. When an honorable member was attempting to reply to a debate which had taken place in Committee, the  Speaker  ruled that members were prevented by the Standing Orders from doing so. I again ask honorable senators not to allude to debates which have taken place in Committee. </para>

                        <para>- The principle that was defeated by a majority was one which was strenuously advocated after the last general election by the party to which I belong. The Labour Party, at the last elections, made it clear and distinct that their policy included the nationalization of monopolies, and that they intended to minimize in every possible way the evils resulting from the competitive system, which gives rise to monopolistic institutions. In opposition to that policy there were arrayed against us all those who were opposed to the collective principle. When I said that, in view, of the provisions of the Constitution, the amendment was merely make-believe, I said what I conscientiously believed to be true. Certain amendments have been made in the Bill, and as a result it will be returned with those amendments to another place, where I hope it will receive its quietus. It is unfortunate that within the last four or five years such a change of front should have taken place on the part of certain persons with regard to this measure. I invite the Senate to look at the voluminous report of the Iron Bonus Commission, which was published at considerable cost to the Commonwealth. On that Commission there were members of this Parliament who occupied prominent positions, not only in the Legislature, but in the esteem of the majority of the citizens of the Commonwealth. The inquiry conducted by the Commission was extended over a considerable period of time. Exhaustive evidence was taken, and after summarizing the evidence, one section of the Commission decided in favour of the taking over of the industry by the Government, and another section, equal in number to the first, reported in favour of its conduct by private enterprise with the assistance of a bounty. Amongst those who signed the report in favour of the nationalization of the industry as against the bounty principle was a gentleman who to-day is Attorney-General in the Labour Government. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> M. Hughes. </para>

In politics he was regarded always as an extreme Conservative, but he favoured the nationalization of this industry. Other members of the Commission signing the report to which I refer were Messrs. J. W. Kirwan, G. W. Fuller, J. Chris. Watson, and Joseph Cook. The only member of that Commission who, in dealing with this Bill, has consistently stood by the principle which, as a Labourite, he has advocated throughout his political career, is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> C. Watson. In paragraph 6 of their report the members of the Commission, whose names I have mentioned, said - </para>

                    <para>Nearly all the witnesses examined before the Commission agreed that the payment of bonuses would be useless unless followed by a duty. Experience shows that if the payment of bonuses be commenced the liability of the Commonwealth will not be limited to the sum proposed under the Bill, but that further Government aid will be sought. </para>

                    <para>The evidence failed to show that there was any commercial necessity for the bonuses proposed. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford</inline> said he could produce pig iron at Lithgow under 35s. a ton. Allowing for freight to Sydney, Melbourne, and other parts of the Commonwealth he could, on this showing, compete favorably with any imported pig iron. Other witnesses who, however, had less experience than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford,</inline> doubted the correctness of his estimate of cost. But on the supposition of his having made an under estimate, he would still, even without a bonus, be in an excellent position as compared with the imported commodity. </para>
                    <para>No effort was made to bring forward witnesses against the Bill. Notwithstanding that fact, the evidence given failed to establish a case in its favour. Several witnesses thought the establishment of iron works in the Commonwealth premature, and much of the evidence was strongly against any attempt by the Government to establish the iron industry by the payment of bonuses. </para>

                        <para>- The members of the Government certainly made a move to give power to the Commonwealth, under certain restrictions, to nationalize the industry in the course of time, and as that involved a cardinal principle of the platform of the party, I had hoped that the Government would not proceed further with the Bill when that principle was defeated. But the Government are evidently determined to see this Bill through at all hazards. With others, I have made a protest against it. I do not expect that anything I am saying now will have any effect upon any one, but having made my protest, my hope is that when the Bill is returned to another place, it will receive its quietus there, and we shall have heard the last of this proposal to tax the people of the Commonwealth in order to enrich a few people in New South Wales. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not wish to take up time unnecessarily. As I have supported the Bill so far, I wish to give one or two reasons why I intend to vote against the third reading. I wish to say that I am a believer in the bounty system under ordinary conditions. I hold that in some cases it is the best means to adopt to assist an industry in its earliest stages. I do not think it can be contended that in dealing with the development of the iron industry we are dealing with an ordinary commercial proposition. The main reason why I shall vote against the third reading of this Bill is that under it I recognise that we shall be distinctly subsidizing one firm. I was, however, quite prepared to go to that length so long as we were safeguarded against the industry being controlled by not less than three companies for many years to come. Personally I do not think that it will be controlled by more than one company. Under this Bill, therefore, we are asked to subsidize the industry and - after it has been established at the expense of the taxpayers - to turn round and purchase it as well as the goodwill&#39; which public expenditure has created in it. So far as the Bill itself is concerned, I have very little fault to find with it, and I shall vote against its third reading on account of its sins of omission rather than of commission. The States Governments and the Commonwealth Government will shortly lie in a position to purchase, roughly speaking, about one-third of the iron consumed in Australia, and with the developments which are taking place in the railway workshops not only of New South Wales and? Victoria, but to a limited extent of the other States, it seems likely that they will be increasing consumers of this commodity in the future. That being the case, it seems rather rough upon the public to ask them to provide the funds with which to establish the iron industry, and at a later period to expect them not only to purchase the industry, but also to buy back the goodwill in it which the expenditure of &#163;180,000 of public money has assisted tocreate. </para>

But had honorable senators; opposite been as ready to do that as they now profess to be, the whole of Australia would today have been enjoying the benefits which flow from a protective policy. </para>

                        <para>- It is a wonder that persons who hold such opinions have not the courage to give expression to them at the proper time. I should have been prepared to support this Bill had there been any reasonable prospect of the Government retaining control of the money which under its authority will be handed over to a particular firm in the form of bounty. I know of no other section of the community which is treated in the way that it is proposed to treat the proprietors of the Lithgow ironworks. To-day we assist farmers by means of the <inline font-style="italic">Credit F oncier</inline> system, but we do not say to them, &#34; Take this money to assist you in establishing your industry, and we will not exercise any control over you whatever.&#34; On the contrary, the advances made under that system are usually limited to about two-thirds of the value of the farmers&#39; holdings. But, under this Bill, we are asked to provide the whole of the wages cost of manufacture without retaining any control whatever over the iron industry. Some honorable senators have pointed out that the States possess full power to nationalize the industry if they so desire. But we all recognise that so long as the present Legislative Councils continue in existence there is not the remotest chance of that power being exercised. I regret that I cannot support the third reading of the Bill, not because the measure is a bad one, but because it does not give the Commonwealth which has to subsidize the industry, a sufficient security. </para>

                        <para>- It is not the prerogative of this Chamber to turn a Government out of office. But it certainly is peculiar that we should find a Labour Ministry supported by Senators Mulcahy and Gray, and some of the other high priests of Conservatism. Those who advocate this Bill ought to be manly enough - the Government in particular -to say where the money is to be obtained with which to finance it. </para>

I can quite understand now that Lithgow is in New South Wales, and that, in all probability, he will be a candidate for the constituency which embraces that district before very long. I say that before we sanction the expenditure contemplated under this Bill we ought to be in a position to provide the  funds  to  be so expended.

                        <para>- He did not, because he could not. I am not going to discuss the taking over of the industry in the way that has been suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> not because I do not believe in its nationalization, but because we have not the means to undertake that work at the present time. I am convinced - and I made the same statement upon the motion for the second reading of the Bill - that before the expiration of the period fixed for the operation of the bounty, unless a protective duty be imposed upon iron in the interim, the industry will demand the assistance of a further bounty, in order that it may be kept alive. </para>

                        <para>- The whole of the  &#163;30.000  to be paid by the Commonwealth will be spent in wages. Would it not be just as well to give the men a picnic with the money? Those who are opposed to the Bill cannot be blamed for this extravagance. We have done our best to protect the revenue, but, apparently, honorable senators opposite have an axe to grind in supporting the Bill. They have the numbers, and they have &#34;collared&#34; the Government. They are having a.  jolly  good time  in  consequence. I opposed the Bill from the beginning, and should have vetted against the third reading, except that I promised <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> to pair with him. I thought that it would be a good thing to get him out of the way  on  this occasion, and therefore I paired. It does not matter to me what Government is on the Treasury bench. I am here to support principles. I am sorry to be opposing the Government. I love <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> I recognise his ability. But I  pity  him in his present position. It must be very trying to him. He has my sympathy. </para>

He is one of the strongest Socialists in the Senate, and ar the same time, he is a free-trader. As to the honorable senator, who has just interrupted me, I noticed the other day, in. looking over my <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proof, that there was a good deal of Mulcahy in the report. I do not want the honorable senator to make a speech for me now. As a politician, God knows where he is ! Honorable senators cannot classify him by any means. He is not a Labour man, nor a Liberal, but a peculiarity who does not know where he is himself. </para>

                        <para>- I shall not say what he has. With regard to the inquiry from the leader of the Opposition, he must know very well that it will take a considerable time to prepare an amendment of the Bounties Act in order to give effect to the recent resolution of the Senate. In view of the difficulty we have had to carry the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, he can hardly expect that an amendment could be framed in a week or ten days. </para>
