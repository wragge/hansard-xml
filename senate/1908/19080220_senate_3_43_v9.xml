                    <para>. - I should like to say, by way of preface, that, in offering a few remarks,&#39; I wish to convey no reflection whatever on the Printing Committee. A question asked just now by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> will illustrate what I wish to say. The practice has been for the  Chairman  of the Printing Committee to lay a report upon the. table, and for the  Clerk  to read out the titles of the  various documents that the Committee have thought fit to recommend to be printed. I think it will be recognised that, in adopting that procedure, it is practically necessary for every, member of the Senate to pay the very closest&#39; attention to the reading of. the  report by the  Clerk,  in order that he may - even then only imperfectly - ascertain what is going to be printed. The practice then is to suspend our Standing Orders to allow a motion to be carried without previous notice. I regard the work of the Printing Committee as important, and I may add that I think that the present Committee have done better work than any Printing Committee we ever had. </para>

                        <para>- I say that without the slightest hesitation. I merely rose to put it to the  Chairman  of the Printing Committee that, appreciating, as we do - speaking for myself at any rate - their work, it would perhaps be a little&#39; better if the  Chairman  gave notice, whenever he brought up a report, that on the ensuing play he would move that it be adopted. That procedure would secure an opportunity for every member of the Senate (o look through the list of documents and ascertain for himself what the Printing Committee had recommended to be printed. That would also give a senator an opportunity to. ascertain why the Committee thought it not desirable to print any particular document. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator&#39; Henderson</inline> clearly understands my attitude - that I merely desire to join with him in promoting- the convenience of every member of the Senate. If he could make it convenient, when bringing up a report, to give notice that on the next day he would move that it be adopted, it would be decidedly&#39; for&#39; the benefit of honorable senators all round. </para>

                    <para>. - I gather from the report just submitted that the Printing Committee does not see the desirableness of having printed the list of permanent servants in the employment of the Commonwealth Government as at the end of  1907.  The ground taken is, I presume, that the list has already, been published in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Gazette.</inline> But the form in which it is issued renders the list so published practically of no use whatever to honorable senators. The list is not bound, and it is impossible to keep the sheets together. For that reason it is valueless as a work of reference. I therefore intend to move, by way of amendment on the motion for the adoption of the report, that the list of Commonwealth  officers  be printed. </para>

                    <para>. - In my opinion <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> amendment ought not to be agreed to. Look at the unwieldy nature pf our . parliamentary papers already. It is impossible to carry a volume of them, owing to its bulk. Honorable senators have already had the list referred to in their copies of the &#39; <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Gazette.</inline> There is, therefore, a permanent record for the purpose of comparison. If. we reprint the list as a parliamentary paper it means that not .only will every Member of Parliament get another copy of it, but that it will be sent afresh to every newspaper, library, and public institution which receives parliamentary papers. The expense appears to me to be out of all proportion, to the service proposed to be rendered. </para>

                    (New South Wales) &#91;11.19&#93;. - I beg to draw attention to the fact that the Printing Committee, with two small exceptions, have not recommended the printing of any document. When a few days ago- I presented a petition from a medical institute in New South Wales, representing 25,000 members of friendly  societies - practically the whole of the friendly societies in my State - I moved for the printing of the document, and was asked to leave it- to the Printing Committee. I agreed to do so, but although the petition was so short that it was stated on a single sheet of letter paper, the Committee has not recommended that it be printed. I make no complaint about the action of the Committee, because I understand that, owing to the early sitting of the Chamber, it had this morning only about five minutes in which to deal with all the work submitted to it.

                        <para>- I was told that that was the position. If I have been misinformed, I regret that I should have made the statement. The fact remains that, with, possibly, two. exceptions, the Printing Committee has refused to recommend the printing of any of the papers referred to it. I desire the printing of this short petition, and trust that the Committee will consider my moving an amendment in that direction as being not in any way a reflection upon it, but an evidence of my desire that the large body of electors represented by it might have their views put before honorable senators in the usual manner. I do. not know that I ever heard before of the printing of a petition being refused-. I think this is the first occasion in the history of this Parliament that such a course has been adopted; it certainly is the first time that such an incident has occurred within my knowledge of twenty-five years of parliamentary doings. This was a petition for a reduction of the duties on medicines. </para>

I do not know how far .he indicated that he would vote for its being printed if the matter went before the Printing Committee; but I hope, that he will vote for the amendment I intend to move, that the document be printed, since it is representative, not of some little out-of-the-way place, but of a very large body of responsible voters and citizens. </para>

I hope that the Senate will accept the amendment that I intend to move in favour of the printing of this petition from a very important rep resentative and responsible body of the citizens of New South Wales. I understand that it repre 1sents not only 25,000 electors, but some 100,000 of the population - the members of the friendly societies and their families, on whose behalf it is signed.

                    <para>. - I fail to see what object would be served by the Senate- agreeing to either amendment. I do not know that at any time since I have been a member of .it the Printing Committee has recommended that&#39; a petition of any kind should be printed and circulated. If the Senate orders that the petition presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator&#39; Neild</inline> shall be printed and circulated, then, to be consistent,&#39; the Printing Committee will have to observe that practice in respect of all other petitions. Of what interest to the general community is the petition which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has presented? If any citizen is anxious to ascertain its contents, I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> will be delighted to- supply him with a copy of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> showing that he presented it to the Senate, and that it was received in the usual way. It seems to me that some honorable senators desire to take exception to almost everything the Printing Committee does. In the first place, we have a statement that it had this morning only a minute or two in which to deal with the business submitted to it. </para>

                        <para>- I object to it. because it is unfair. The Committee met at 10.30 this morning, and concluded its business long&#39; before the bells rang for the meeting of the Senate. I hope that honorable senators will not agree to the printing of the petition. I do not feel so strongly in regard to the matter mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline> The return is already in type, and the suggestion he makes is that the half-dozen different papers relating to permanent officers of the Commonwealth Service, and the salaries they receive, shall be bound in an inexpensive form. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia) &#91;1.1. 29&#93;. - This debate illustrates the very great inconvenience of the summary method of submitting a report to the Senate and moving forthwith that it be adopted. I am sure that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hender</inline>
                    son will not take it ill - because no one appreciates more than I do the services of the Printing Committee - if I commend to him the suggestion that in future it would be better for him as  Chairman  of the Printing Committee to lay its reports on the table, and move on a subsequent date that they be adopted. There is no great urgency about securing the adoption of the report the moment it is laid upon the table. It would lose nothing in value by the motion for its adoption being deferred until the next day, or a day or two subsequently. In the meantime, it would be possible for honorable senators, who might not be acquainted with the particular papers to which it makes reference, to make themselves familiar with them, and to form a precise opinion as to whether there were any documents which should be added to the list of those the printing of which has been recommended. I am not prepared to express an opinion regarding the suggestion which has been made by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart. Senator Findley</inline>
                    has advanced some reasons which might make the adoption of that suggestion an expensive proceeding to the Commonwealth. But

                    speaks without any precise knowledge upon this matter, because, in reply to an interjection, he stated that he was not aware whether stereotypes of the list of permanent officers in the Public Service were in existence. Of course, if they are in existence, no difficulty will be experienced in complying with the suggestion of

                    <para>. - I intend to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> suggestion. This Parliament has absolutely surrendered the control of the Commonwealth Public Service to a Public Service Commissioner, and as a result, we have no check upon his actions. He has prepared a report relating to the status of public servants and their  salaries, but that report is merely published in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Gasette,</inline> and is not kept as a parliamentary paper. I believe that a list should be published annually of all Commonwealth public servants, and that it should set forth their salaries and their increments, and that it should be bound up with the ordinary parliamentary papers for the year. </para>

I do not feel so strongly upon the question of the petition to which reference has been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline> Petitions, upon being presented to the Senate, are read by the  Clerk,  and published in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and I do not think that many of them ought to be published in Blue Book form and preserved from year to year. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> that instead of the adoption of the Printing Committee&#39;s report being moved immediately that report is presented, honorable senators should be given an opportunity of making &#34;themselves familiar with the contents of the documents to which it  refers. In the re port submitted this morning a recommendation is made regarding a memorandum of the Public Service Commissioner relating to the Public Service, with the nature of which I am not acquainted. Under the plan which has hitherto been followed. I shall be denied an opportunity of making myself familiar with that memorandum before the report, has been adopted. 1 should like to become acquainted with its contents, because we have placed the Public Service . Commissioner absolutely above Parliament. </para>

                    <para>. - A great deal of this discussion is due to honorable senators paying insufficient attention to papers when they are laid upon the table. It they took the trouble to familiarize themselves with the contents of those papers they would be in a position, when the Printing Committee presented its report, to say whether or not they ought to be printed. The special function of the Committee is to reduce the expenditure .upon printing as much as possible. It has been suggested that the motion for the adoption of the Committee&#39;s report .should not be submitted immediately the report is presented. I cannot see what advantage would be conferred by delay. We know the nature of the report, because it is read by the  Clerk.  If the adoption of the report is delayed, it will necessarily delay the printing of any document which is ordered . to be printed. If the documents referred to are printed, 950 copies will be spread broadcast over the country, and ninety-nine people out of 100 will not have the least interest in them. The petition to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> refers is not very lengthy. It can be examined on the table, and no earthly good can be done by having 950 printed copies of it distributed. My only object is to reduce our heavy  printing bill. </para>

                    <para>. - I support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild&#39;s</inline> amendment, because the petition is in the interests of a- large body of the people, not alone in New South Wales, but in Queensland. There are- thousands of members of the friendly societies, who will regard it as an insult if the Senate refuses to print the petition. This is the second discussion we have had on this subject. More time has been occupied on these two occasions than would pay for the whole of the printing. Apparently, some honorable senators think that the petition, and those who sent it, are not worthy of consideration, but the duties protested against are vital to the whole of the friendly societies of Australia. Most of them are revenue duties. The petition is signed by two men on behalf of 25,000 members of the societies. </para>

It has never neglected at all times during this Parliament to do its utmost to discharge its functions properly. It meets as often as is necessary, and presents its report immediately. Yet the result is that it is the only Committee subjected to adverse criticism. If it did nothing, not a word would be &#39;said against it, but because we try to do our work and prevent wasteful expenditure upon unnecessary printing we are subjected to every kind of fault-finding. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> asks, &#34;Why appeal to the Committee, when we can appeal to the Senate?&#34; Then why have a Committee at all? Why not appeal to the Senate direct with regard to every paper? If there is a Committee, it should not be harasse&#39;d every time it brings down a report. If the Senate is dissatisfied with the Committee, it should be told so straight out, and another Committee appointed. </para>

                        <para>- The paper in question is exceedingly bulky ; it has already been printed and laid upon the table, and consequently has become the property of Parliament. There is no necessity for incurring the- wasteful expense of having it printed over again. A great deal of the printing done is unnecessary. The wastepaper baskets are filled every day with papers which members open, look at, and throw away. I refuse to be a party to continuing to pile up that wasteful and unnecessary expenditure, and while I remain a senator I shall resist it. </para>

                    <para>. -I shall oppose the amendment for the printing of the petition. I see that quite a number of petitions have been brought up from sawmillers, public morals associations, women&#39;s liberal leagues, retail confectioners, and others, and that in every case, the rule adopted has been that petitions in connexion with the Tariff should not be printed. If we break that rule now we shall be stultifying our past action. I do not underrate the importance of friendly societies, but there is no reason why we should give them the special honour of being the only body throughout Australia whose petition has been ordered by the Senate to be printed. </para>

                        <para>- As one of the silent members of the Chamber, I am making a protest on their behalf. I notice that a silent protest .has very little effect. If the silent members decide to be a little more garrulous in the future, in keeping with the rest of the Chamber, perhaps the business will proceed more quickly. In order to economize the time of the Senate, we have, amongst other things, appointed a Printing Committee, which met earlier than the Senate did, went through the papers in detail, decided which were worthy to be printed, and made certain recommendations. The Senate has now debated the question from every point of view. Some say that certain papers only should .be printed, while others declare that every paper should be printed. Then, when the Estimates come before us, the newspapers draw attention to the extraordinary size of the printing bill ; the taxpayers talk of ex&#39;travagance, and very likely the very senators who ask for the most useless papers to be printed, will rise again, and, in their own garrulous way, criticise the extravagant expenditure on printing. We talk from  11  o&#39;clock in the morning until  11  o&#39;clock at night all on the one subject, and get no  nearer to a conclusion. If time is to be taken up in this way by useless talk, we had far better return to our ordinary hour of meeting in the afternoon; otherwise we shall be so tired that we shall not care whether or not we attend the next day. I regard the Printing Committee as one of the very best working Committees of Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I think that it is at least allowable for an honorable senator to speak to both questions before the Chair ; and, in reference to the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> I sincerely hope that the Senate will sanction the course taken by the Printing Committee. In the early stages of the session the necessity for economy in the matter of printing was forcibly brought under the notice of the Senate; and the speeches then made were an inspiration to every member of the Committee to, as&#34; far as possible, prevent superfluous and useless printing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> and every other honorable senator, could, if they chose, avail themselves of every item of information already presented to the Chamber. I admit that <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> reports referred to are not bound in morocco, with gilt edges, nor are senators&#39; names printed in gold letters on the back of them; but, although unembellished, the reports for all practical purposes place the necessary information easily within reach. If we accept the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> that the type has been distributed, and that there are no stereos, it would prove very costly to print this particular report now. </para>

                        <para>- The amendment of the honorable senator proposes that a liability shall be incurred in order to place a few figures and names in a paper which will find its way into the waste-paper basket within the next three or four days. I sympathize very much with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> in his laudable desire to serve friendly societies and other bodies which wish to present petitions to the Senate; but I ask him to recognise the wisdom of the course which has hitherto been followed by the Printing Committee. </para>

                <para>Petitions innumerable have been presented, and each and every one has been read by the Clerk; and that reading serves every public purpose. The petitions are for the information of honorable senators ; they are not presented with a view to providing the public with useless literature. I think it must be admitted that the Printing Committee have followed a very wise course in refusing to keep a whole staff going night and day simply for the purpose of printing petitions. I sincerely hope that both amendments will be rejected. Senator demons suggested - and I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> took the same view - that, when a report is laid on the table, it ought to be allowed to lie there until the following day. The Printing Committee would willingly adopt that course but for the fact that, in doing so, the rules of the Senate would compel me to move that the report be printed and circulated. At an early stage of this session we discussed that point ; and it was in order to prevent the necessity of printing and circulating the report that the present practice was adopted. </para>

I do not wish to be discourteous, but, as a matter of fact, I told him yesterday that I did not for one moment admit that any accusations of wholesale drunkenness were ever made by my honorable colleague, and what is more I cannot see my way to agree to the appointment of the Select Committee suggested. </para>

                            <para>- Arising out of the answer to the question, will the Vice-President of the Executive Council kindly explain what is meant by a &#34; definite scheme.&#34; He has said that the result of this trial survey and partial survey would enable the Commissioners to submit to Parliament a &#34; definite scheme.&#34; Does the honorable senator mean a definite scheme for the construction of the railway or for a final and proper survey? The answer as given is ambiguous, and I wish only to know exactly what is meant by it. </para>

I am not in a position to say whether an application has been received from Queensland, but I shall be happy to mate inquiry on the subject if the honorable senator desires me to do so. </para>

The questions on notice, primarily, refer to a grant of money to the Victorian Immigration League, and further questions tending to elucidate the replies given to them will be in order ; but questions asking for other information should be placed on the notice-paper, to be asked. on some other occasion. </para>

                            <para>- The answer to that question would not make clearer the replies which the Vice-President of the Executive Council has already given to the questions on notice. As he referred to  three States, questions tending to make clear the action of the Government in giving money to those States may be asked; but in asking whether money will be  granted on some future occasion to other States, the honorable senator is transgressing the rule governing the case. </para>

                </quote>
                <para>The object of the amendment is to obtain a clearer definition, and to remove the possibility of anomalies and disputes. What are known as blousing flannels may be classified at the will of the Customs authorities under any one of three items. One firm has paid 25 per cent. <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> upon a large importation of blousing flannels, they being defined at the time by the Comptroller-General as woollen piece goods. Afterwards a second definition was applied to these materials, which brought them under the heading of dress goods, and another firm was fortunate enough to be able to import them on payment of a duty of 10 per cent. It would also be possible for the Customs authorities to declare the goods dutiable as flannels, and I think that they should be classed as coming under this item. </para>

I wish to put this point to the  Chairman  : I have already intimated that I intend to move for a lower duty than 20 per cent. I am prepared to do that at once. The question upon which I desire to have a ruling is whether it is in accordance with our Standing Orders and practice that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> without moving a request that takes priority of mine, should address himself to the item, and to that extent preclude either myself or any one else from giving reasons why a lower duty should &#39;be imposed. </para>

                <para class="block">The reports of the free-trade section of the Commission have been prepared with care, and references to the evidence are given in support of the statements contained in them. I defy any honorable senator to detract from their reliability and value. The report of the protectionist section on this item is, however, imperfect and misleading. I also find that the freetrade section of the Commission report that it was admitted that a 10 per cent. duty would more than cover any disability which the manufacturers here might labour under in regard to the payment of higher wages and more onerous industrial conditions. That being so, one can well understand why it recommended that the duty on flannels should be reduced to 10 per cent., and that on all other woollen goods or blankets there should be a duty of 15 per cent. I am at a loss to understand why the Government, in view of the evidence given before the Commission, should have proposed that the old duty of 15 per cent. be raised to 25 per cent., and it is for that reason that I propose to move a request that a duty midway between the two be imposed. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, and every protectionist member of the Labour Party in the. Senate, utterly disagree with the opening speech made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best.</inline> The Government are not content with the imposition of a duty that will counter-balance the disabilities under which our manufacturers suffer by reason of the higher wages they have to pay ; they propose a duty that is calculated to do more harm than good. I find from the report of the free-trade section of the Commission that in the past excessive duties have done more harm than good to the cause of protection. Instead of building up industries, they have caused the manufacturers to continue the use of obsolete machinery, believing that they can carry on successfully behind the stone wall of the Tariff. To use the term employed by some of the witnesses, they &#34;wanted shaking up,&#34; and a reduction of the duty shook them up to such an extent as to cause them to improve their methods of manufacture. The free-trade section of the Commission embody in their report a table showing the duty on woollens, and the number of hands employed in given years, and it is an utter condemnation of ultra-protective duties. It shows that in 1878, with a duty of 11 per cent., 736 hands were employed in the industry. In 1888, when the duty stood at 22 per cent., there were 784 hands. In 1891, after a duty of 33 per cent had been in operation for three years, there were 7.91 hands employed. In 1895, after a duty of 44 per cent, had been in operation for three years,, the number of hands employed in the industry had fallen away to 690 ; but in 190.3, with a duty of 16J per cent., the number of hands had increased to 1,013. Can <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> answer these figures? What made the woollen industry fall away ? With duties of 33 per cent, and 44 per cent, it could not flourish, whereas, under a duty of 15 per cent, during the last six years, it has made splendid progress, and in New South Wales, under free-trade, prior to Federation it did very well. </para>

Apparently they are terribly in earnest in this connexion, and yet we now find them supporting an excessively high duty upon blankets, the adoption of which is calculated to lead to the establishment of a monopoly in the woollen trade.

                        <para>- I know that the Vice-President of the Executive Council is doing an injustice to the  mill-owners.  in little Tasmania the woollen mills have already been enlarged. New machinery has been installed in them, and they have been brought up to date. What the Vice-President of the Executive Council suggests will take place, has already taken place.. During the past four or five years under the operation of a 15 per cent, duty a mill  has been established in Hobart, which is a credit to the Commonwealth. But the Vice-President of the Executive Council talks as if the industry had yet to be created. As a matter of fact, it is doing everything that we can expect of it. </para>

                        <para>- Under the old Tasmanian Tariff the duty levied upon one class of flannel was 15 per cent., and that upon another- class 20 per cent. Does the Minister of Home Affairs suggest that a difference of 5 per cent, upon one-half of their goods was the cause of the establishment of the large factory which exists in Collins-street, Hobart ? </para>

                        <para>- It is full of orders, and, notwithstanding that the imports of flannel are increasing, it does not fear that competition. The owner of. those mills himself told me that a duty of 15 per cent, was more than sufficient for the industry, and that he could carry on operations under a duty of only 10 per cent. That  statement was also made upon oath before the Tariff Commission. The agitation for a higher duty originated with the Ballarat mills, which suggested that a duty of 30 per cent, ought to be imposed upon woollens. Later on, other mills asked for a duty of 25 per -cent., but the little Tasmanian mill-owners refused to join in that request. </para>

On an extreme estimate, the total Australian labour disability is not more than 10 per cent, of the value of the goods  produced.  Putting it in another way, from a protectionist stand-point, and ignoring the natural protection of freights, a duty of 10 per cent, on the goods in question would equalize all the alleged disadvantages of the Australian manufacturer in respect of higher wages and shorter hours. v </para>

Another witness quoted evidence from the published statistics of Victoria, showing that in the years of the highest duties on woollens in that State, the lowest number of hands was employed. I have already read statistics showing conclusively that that is the case. A South Australian manufacturer talked a little sense when he said - &#34; Really, what determines the amount of imports is the financial position of the country and the harvest.&#34; The total imports of blankets and blanketing were ,&#163;114,500 worth in 1902, and decreased to &#163;53,506 worth in 1906. Of that amount Great Britain exported to us &#163;51,600 worth, so that this is an item on which we can give the Mother Country a considerable preference. I hope the preferential rate will be retained. The importations are gradually coming down, and in &#39; every way the woollen industry under a 15 per cent, duty is doing well. The  quality of the goods has been improved; the manufacturers have all had a&#34; shake up and are being kept up to the mark, but now the Government and their supporters wish, by over-protecting them, to let them go back again to the old conditions, and to victimize the consumer. When the history of Victoria comes to be written, it will be one of the wonders of that age how men in Victoria could ever have believed that high protection alone could bring about general prosperity. I admit that protection may do good when moderately employed; but it is a mystery to me how honorable senators opposite can take up their present attitude. In the evidence on the flannel industry almost every one of their axioms has been contradicted. I move - </para>

                <para class="block">This duty affects the whole of the working community of the Commonwealth. I should like to vote for a lower duty ; but, under the circumstances. I think I am within the limits of moderation when I submit the request I have indicated. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has covered the ground in the main, but, in some respects, he has not given the subject that close consideration which I think is necessary. The present policy of the Government is diametrically opposed to their policy, not only at the first Federal election, but at the last Federal election. In New South Wales, at any rate, no increase of duties was suggested by any of their candidates, and I&#39; have not yet heard from the Government, or any honorable senator, a practical reason why any increases should now be sought. True, there was a protectionist crusade in Victoria, and those who conducted it talked about the&#39; decaying industries in that State. In regard to the woollen industry, at any rate, those allegations were proved to be without foundation, and to have been made solely for political purposes. So far from the woollen industry having suffered under the old duty, all the evidence proves that it is one of the most prosperous in Australia. I am pleased that such should be the case ; and I honestly believe that the old duty was sufficient to give all that any real protectionist - though not the prohibitionists, who are so strong within this Chamber - could desire. If the experience of the past be any guide, the woollen industry, instead of being helped by a prohibitive duty of 44 per cent. in Victoria, suffered materially. The number of those engaged did not increase, and the quality of the goods turned out was not sufficient to compete with the woollens of Tasmania, where there was a 15 or 20 per cent., or of New Zealand, where there was a duty of 15 per cent., or of New South Wales, where there was a still smaller duty. Protection run mad simply means the rearing of hot-house plants, and weakens that personality which is so necessary in all industrial undertakings. When healthy competition has to be met manufacturers secure the most modern machinery and appliances, and on these, and on his personal qualities, he depends for financial success. Regarding the matter even from the protectionist point of view, we know that, when a duty is above a certain figure, competition decreases, and manufacturers are content to rely on the duty alone for success, thus leading to a weakening of commercial acumen. If this debate has proved anything, it is that this Chamber is not of the deliberative character which the public think. Some of the most instructive speeches have been made to empty benches, because honorable senators opposite have made up their minds how they will vote, quite irrespective of the facts. </para>

I shall endeavour to prove that, with a further increase, we shall have more effective protection; and, in doing so, I shall not confine my remarks to Tasmania, but extend them to Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia. I shall quote statistics to prove that, notwithstanding the duty of 20 per cent., the industry has not flourished, and that there is a desire for an increase on the part of many witnesses.

For the last eight years Government contracts had specified that the woollen materials supplied should be of New South Wales manufacture. Under its free-trade policy New South Wales had become a favorite dumping-ground of the oversea woollen manufacturer. Goods so imported were sold, not for what they cost, but for what they would bring, and were usually sacrificed. There was a duty of  5  per cent. for a short time, and under the Dibbs Tariff they had a 10 per cent. duty for two and a half years. </para>

                        <para>- I am quoting the figures from the report of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, and if they are not right the Government should not have supplied me with the book. Turning to the return of exports we find that in 1906 Australia exported 480,242,885 lbs. of wool. What is the good of our continuing to shear the wool, export it to other countries, and import it in the form of manufactured articles ? Why should we not  reverse the position and export the manufactured articles? It has been said that our market is limited, but it is not. We can not only supply our own requirements, but we can also have the markets of the world to supply. I welcome the announcement that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> intends to move a request for an increase in the duty, because, if adopted, it will put the. industry on a sound basis. </para>

                    <para>.- In the first place, I want to make a personal explanation. I regret that I missed the opportunity of moving for a rate of duty equal to that which obtained in the old Tariff. I also regret that after I had given a pair to ah honorable senator last night, at his request, and on the understanding that he would pair with me on this item, and after I had reminded him at two minutes to 1 o&#39;clock that I expected him to pair with me up to 3 o&#39;clock, and he agreed to do so, he voted and I did not. </para>

However, pairing is not recognised by the Chair, and I have to put up with that sort of thing. Of course, if I had been present I would have voted for a duty of 20 per cent. </para>

This afternoon he reminded me about the arrangement which was entered into early last night at my own suggestion. I entirely forgot about the pair, and if I have done <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> a wrong I can only express to him my regret. I assure him that I acted without any thought of doing him an injury ; &#34;in fact, sir, if there is a way of removing my name from the division list I would wish that to be done, in order to make reparation to the honorable senator for what may appear to be a wrongful act on my part. </para>

                        <para>- That is an unfair statement for the honorable senator to make. I came here this afternoon sorry to find that my vote was not recorded for the imposition of a lower duty. I had not heard from or seen <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> but I accept his explanation unreservedly, and I am sure that he is just as sorry as I am for what has occurred. I want to condense my remarks in regard to this item, . because we have had an indication that a request for an increase of the duty is to be moved, and also because we have had some criticism with regard to the desirability of promoting a sound and proper industry in the Commonwealth - an industry which, by reason of the purity of its goods, will compete on terms that we must all desire with the imported article. I wish to offer some remarks with regard to the purity of our Austral ian made flannel and blankets. But let me preface them by saying that, so far as. the Tariff Commission could learn - and they went into this item most exhaustively - in the whole of the Commonwealth there is only one factory from which the purchaser has any guarantee that when he is buying, for instance, blankets, which ought to bo all wool, he gets what he wants. I am glad to say that that factory happens to be located in Tasmania. I should welcome the existence of such a factory in any State. We have not many factories in Tasmania, but it does happen - by a coincidence, if you like - to include the one and only factory owner in the Commonwealth who brands, or has woven in every item he supplies from his mill, a guarantee to the public that it is all wool, and has no cotton mixed with it. </para>

                        <para>- No. We had no evidence on that point. I am only dealing with the direct evidence . I know that in regard to the Victorian industry there is no guarantee that a buyer is getting what he ought to receive-an all-wool article. The adulteration of local goods was a very interesting phase of our inquiry. It ought to be interesting to honorable senators who want to offer additional protection to this industry. I ask them to pardon me while I quote from the report of the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission - </para>

                    <para>An incident in the examination of this witness <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Williams),</inline> brought about a searching investigation as to the Mature and extent of the adulteration of flannels. As already indicated, the witness contended strongly that the adulteration of Australian flannels was brought about by their being exposed to the competition of such goods from abroad. In this connexion a Commissioner read a letter in which a member of the Victorian Parliament in the year 1895, challenged the witness - who was also a member - to deny that the mill of which he was director was responsible for placing flannel on the Victorian market (then protected by a 40 per cent. duty), adulterated with 40 per cent. of cotton. The reply, in which the challenge was declined; was also read to the witness, who then proceeded to give a detailed explanation of the episode to your Commission, the purport of which was that his challenger had been the subject of a joke by certain gentlemen who had misled him. Subsequently a Melbourne journalist, who said he had experience in the woollen trade, appeared before the Commission with evidence regarding the adulteration of Victorian flannels. </para>

                    <para>He stated that he had obtained in a Flinders-lane warehouse six samples of flannel which had been manufactured in certain Victorian woollen mills. He had taken the samples to a firm of public analysts in Melbourne, whose tests showed all of them to contain cotton in quantities varying from 28.6 per cent. to 70.9. per cent. Next day a witness, representing one of these mills, appeared before the Commission, and denied that the samples the previous witness had alleged to come from his factory had been made there. The witness whose statement was thus challenged came forward a second time, with two new samples of flannel, and with documentary evidence to prove that they came from the mill in question. The analysis showed that one contained 24.2 per cent. and the other 54.8 per cent of cotton. </para>

                <para class="block">I pause here to tell the Committee what the position was at that stage. Mir. Max Hirsch brought special samples from Victorian mills, which were analyzed, and proved to contain cotton. Subsequently a Victorian mill-owner called Laycock said it had been alleged that samples had been taken from his factory, but that they were not so taken. To that statement a reply was given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hirsch</inline> who, by documentary evidence, and on oath, proved conclusively that there was no doubt that the two fresh samples which he produced were not merely Victorian samples, but were taken from Laycock&#39;s mill. They were submitted with every possible precaution to a proper analysis. The Commission included protectionist members, and so every care was taken to see that there could be no slip or possibility of a wrong deduction being submitted to them. The analysis showed that of those two samples taken from Laycock&#39;s mill one contained 24.2 per cent. of cotton and the other 54.8 per cent. The report continues - </para>

                <para class="block">I pause again to make an explanation. It was alleged that the samples had not been properly taken, and so, in order to prevent the possibility of any one interested on either side taking samples, the Customs authorities, who, I suppose, are expected to be impartial, were authorized by the Commission to get samples - the Customs authorities, at the instance of the Commission, obtained samples of Victorian and of  imported  flannels in order to institute a comparison between, them in the matter of adulteration. The analyses showed that out of thirty-six samples of imported flannel, five contained cotton in proportions varying from 28 to 40.4 per cent., while in the case- of twenty Victorian samples fifteen contained from 26 to 58 per cent, of cotton. </para>
                <para class="block">I analyze these figures in this way : They show that of the importers&#39; samples only five contained cotton, whilst of the Victorian samples there were only five that did not contain cotton, and that the percentage of cotton in the Victorian samples was practically higher than that in the imported samples containing cotton. The report goes on to say - </para>

                    <para>The Commission, on the casting vote of the  chairman-  and there is much meaning in that - decided that the method of obtaining these samples &#34;had failed,&#34; and the Customs Department was requested to procure a second set. </para>

This was the position : First of all, we had perfectly <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> samples produced in Victorian mills. They were shown conclusively to contain a large percentage  of cotton. Stage No. 2 - One  manufacturer  came along and said, &#34;I am a Victorian manufacturer ; none of these samples that contain cotton came from my mills.&#34; Stage No. 3 - Two samples were produced which on sworn evidence were stated to have come from this manufacturer&#39;s mills, and he subsequently had to admit that the two samples in question did really come from his mills, and from no other mills in Victoria. At this stage, the protectionist members of the Commission did not like the appearance of things, and said, &#34; We do not care about samples obtained in this way.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- The members of the free-trade section of the Commission then said, &#34;We ought to have an official inquiry, and the sampling as well as .the testing&#34; should be done by officials. We should apply to the Comptroller-General of Customs, and ask the Customs authorities themselves to select samples not merely of Colonial, but also of imported flannel, and let us know the result of an analysis of them.&#34; That was done, and I have told the Committee what happened after the Customs authorities selected the samples. The tests showed still more conclusively that the samples selected by the Customs authorities supported absolutely the contention that Victorian flannel was largely and frequently adulterated with cotton. What happened then? The members of the protectionist section of the Commission then said, &#34;This does not suit; the sampling is wrong.&#34; The sampling was done by the Customs authorities, but still it di3 not suit them. </para>

                <para>That is interesting in view of the demand by these .manufacturers for a higher duty.  &#34; that they could not supply any fresh orders for some considerable time to come.&#34; However, with the assistance of a lady expert, the samples were eventually obtained  by the detective inspector employed by the Customs Department. </para>
                <para>The only difficulty about  procuring  the samples of imported flannels was that the season for importation was practically over when the order was circulated for the officers to take samples at the various shipping sheds. For over a month the collection went on, and then, when the question of ceasing was dealt with in the Department, the following instruction was issued - &#34; If the officers notice any importation of very inferior flannel, a sample might be retained, but otherwise no further samples are required.&#34; </para>
                <para>Every effort was made to secure samples of every kind of flannel imported into the Commonwealth, and 136 samples were obtained. </para>

                        <para>- Of course. Will any man in . Victoria contend that if imported flannel was found to contain 1 per cent, or 10 per cent, of cotton, it would have been argued that it was a good thing that it should contain cotton? That is the argument of a man who had had to admit that two samples from his mills were heavily adulterated with cotton. He made that admission only after he had been forced into a corner, and was utterly unable to escape, and then he came along w th this sort of evasion, and told the Commission that if the Australian people desired that the blankets they purchased should be made entirely of wool, they were asking for more than it was wise for them to have, because it was desirable that they should contain a percentage of cation. I am not dealing now with piece goods, but with blankets, and especially with flannels. I am &#34;glad to say that there were other manufacturers of flannel in the Commonwealth, and the report goes on to say - </para>

                <para>That was the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hogarth,</inline> a Tasmanian manufacturer. It is in strong contrast with that given by Victorian manufacturers. As soon as it had been abundantly proved, on their own admissions, and in other ways, that their flannels were largely adulterated with cotton, cornered as they were, they said, &#34; No flannel is any good unless it contains some cotton.&#34; But, according to the evidence of Hogarth, who has never put i lb. weight of cotton into any woollen piece goods manufactured by him during the last twenty years in Launceston, it is a bad thing to have cotton in flannel. That is just what we all should say. We know that this talk of the advantage of adulterating flannel with cotton is nonsense. Hogarth knew the reason why the adulteration went on, and that it was in order to obtain more profit out of the consumer. Another interesting little sidelight was thrown on this matter. The report continues - </para>

                <para class="block">In making our inquiries on the Tariff Commission, we found out repeatedly, not in connexion with this item alone, but in connexion with a dozen other items -also, that if some witness, carrying on an industry in any part of the Commonwealth was not doing as well as he expected to do, he put it down to the competition of adulterated imported goods. But a few manufacturers had a sufficient knowledge of the way in which industries were conducted in the Commonwealth, and they recognised that it was not an imported adulterated article that was injuring their trade, but that nine times out of ten, it was a product of a Victorian factory. I need say no more on this matter. I refer honorable senators to the quotations I have made from the report of the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission, at pages 146-7. There is one other aspect of the case to which I should like to refer. I know it is of no avail to do so, but as most persons can remember during the discussion of the principle of protection in Australia, the one basis of demands for increased duties time after time has been a desire to prevent our workmen being subjected to competition from abroad, where labour is paid for at a much lower rate than in Australia. </para>

Perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> knows more about the matter than I do, but I think he would have extreme difficulty in substantiating his statement. If the example of England in the matter of factory labour is bad, and in one respect I think it is, we are- following it very closely in Australia in the number of children employed in our factories. It will be found that nearly one-third of the labour employed in this industry is child labour. I have not the figures which might be obtained from reports under the Victorian Factories Act. showing the ages of the .children employed in the factories, but a large proportion of the number are under sixteen years of age. In that respect, at all events, Australia is little in advance of England. </para>

                        <para>- I have already said that I have not the figures before me, but I invite the honorable senator to consult the reports made under the Victorian Factories Act. It is sufficient for me to say that from my point of view the fewer Children employed in factories in Australia the better. I wish to say something with regard to the wages in the industry. Every witness who came before the Tariff Commission was carefully examined as to the  extent to which wages in Australia were higher than those paid in England and other competing countries, and not one claimed that wages in Australia were 50 per cent, higher than in other countries. At page 145 of the report of the free-trade section of the Commission, this statement is made - &#39; </para>

                </para>
                <para>This gives approximately 30 per cent, as the proportion of labour in a given output. </para>
                <para>If this matter is worth discussing at all, honorable senators should be- present to listen to the discussion, even though what is said may be unpalatable to them. I call&#39; for the attendance of a quorum. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Quorum formed.&#39;&#93;</inline> It is admitted, even by interested manufacturers, tha? to produce &#163;100 worth of these goods in Australia costs not more than &#163;30 in wages, while in Great Britain the wages cost would  be <inline font-style="italic">&#163;20.</inline> Thus in the cost of labour our manufacturers are under a disability of 10 per cent., taking no account of the freight and other charges incidental to importation, which alford them a certain amount of protection against competition.. Therefore, if the labour protectionists were tied down to the demand for an equalization of labour conditions, they would be forced to accept a duty of 10 per cent.- as sufficient, lt is proposed, however, to make the duty 25 arid &#39; 20 per cent. At the time of the elections these lofty patriots declared that their aim was to protect Australian manufacturers, so that they would not be forced by the competition of manufacturers abroad to reduce the rates of wages here to the level of those prevailing in other countries where labour is cheaper. But now. we hear very little about this need for the equalization of competition in respect to wages. Nor do we hear it stated, as we did at one time, that high duties will not increase prices. No matter how clearly it may be proved that much lower rates would adequately compensate our manufacturers for the higher wages which they must pay, the demand is always for increased duties, with the inevitable result that consumers must pay more for everything they buy. No doubt we shall be told that the new protection will apply to this item, and that that is a reason for increasing the duty. But, notwithstanding all that is predicted of &#39;the marvellous advantages of the new protection,, even if it succeeds in giving to the workmen the wage which, in the opinion of its advocates, he should get, and. to the manufacturer the profit he desires, I doubt whether the consumer will be able to obtain at a fair price the articles which he needs. I shall vote for the lowest duty I can get, and as the lowest yet proposed is per cent. I shall vote for that. As utterly misleading figures have been quoted in regard to the state of the industry here, I wish to point out that, whereas in 1899 the importation of blankets into Australia was valued at ^111,000, in 1906 it was valued at only &#163;53,000, while the value of importations of flannels remained practically unchanged. </para>

                    <para>- - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> asked why cannot Australia manufacture into cloth the wool which is shorn from her sheep, and he quotes figures to show the immensity, of our wool export.  His  desire is that we shall manufacture at least all our own clothing requirements, and thus find additional labour for our people. No doubt his arguments express the views which strongly influence every protectionist in this connexion, and induce h&#39;m to support duties even higher than were recommended by the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission. By way&#39; of analogy, let me point out that, although in America they grow cotton in large quantities, and are able to employ cheap nigger labour in its cultivation and preparation.- for market, they are forced, notwithstanding the <inline font-style="italic">\m&#177;</inline> position of remarkably .high duties on cotton goods, to import largely from Manchester. If the United States of America, with a population of 80,000,000 to make a home market, with suitable soil . and cheap labour for the production of cotton, and heavy duties for the protection of its manufacture, have not succeeded in meeting their own requirements in the way of cotton material, and have to import largely from England, what hope has Australia, with a population of only 4,000,000 people, of supplying wholly her woollen &#39; requirements, dispensing with the manufactures of Bradford and Huddersfield ? According to the <inline font-style="italic">Shipping World Year-Book</inline> for 1907, the American duties on cotton cloth vary from&#34; 25 to 45 and 50 per cent., and have &#39;been in force tor a considerable number of years. The same authority shows that the manufacturers of that country are&#39; protected by similarly heavy duties on woollens - duties probably heavier than the protectionists of this country would dare to advocate ; but notwithstanding that fact, and the existence of a home market of 80,000,000 people, she cannot supply herself with woollens. </para>

                        <para>- We. are doing marvellously well with our natural primary industries, and with some of our manufactures, and therefore we should not unduly tax our people by placing heavy duties on necessaries such as blankets and flannels, to exclude foreign manufactures wholly from this market. If America has not succeeded in dispensing with English manufactures, what hope have we of doing so? Last night the Vice-President of the Executive Council argued that what he desires are protective, not revenue, duties ; but it seems to me that these are revenue, not protective, duties. The Treasurer appears to have thought, in preparing the </para>

As it is clear that we cannot dispense with the manufactures of Great Britain and the Continent, the Government must abandon the pretence that these are protective duties, and must admit that they are revenue duties, imposed to squeeze the last &#163; out of the masses. I shall vote for the lowest duty possible. </para>

                    <para>. - I shall support a high duty, but not because I think that to increase the rate by 5 per cent, will increase, to any great extent, the production of blankets  and flannels in Australia. I am not doing it with that &#39;object. It has been clearly evident for some time that Australia is capturing the market for these particular commodities. There is no fear on that score. But, in travelling round with, the Tariff Commission, I found that it was a continual source of complaint that there was a great variety of duties on similar articles. It is to bring flannels, and blankets as woollen goods into line with woollen piece goods that I am .going to vote for the increased duty. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger will understand that I am not voting for the increase for revenue purposes. I believe that the revenue from flannels and blankets is a diminishing quantity in Australia, because very excellent articles of that description are being produced in sufficient quantities to meet the demands of the Commonwealth. In the near future I hope we shall become exporters. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> was speaking, I made an interjection in connexion with the obtaining of samples for analysis. It was by the casting vote of the  Chairman  of the Commission that a new set of samples was obtained. I am not so well acquainted with the circumstances to which the first portion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons&#39;</inline> statement related as I am with the. second set of samples, because I was not on the Commission at the time. But when the samples were obtained it was made very clear to the Commission that the manner in which they were procured was not conducive to finding out the real facts of the case. It was clearly shown that .when the order was given to the Customs Department to obtain the samples, the Department went about it in the usual official way. Like the officers of the Military Department, they buckled on nil their armour and equipage. When asking for samples, they told the people from whom they were obtained what they were wanted for. The warehouse people, as a general nile, are less favorable to local production than to the importers. Knowing this, we did not think that it was a fair thing that the purposes for which the samples were required should be known. Consequently, we called for a fresh set. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has proved by the statement of Detective Christie that, even with all the precautions taken, it was impossible to get fair samples. No one has ever made the statement that there was no cotton in Australian flannels. There is pure Australian wool flannel, and also what is called &#34; union &#34; - that is, a mixture of cotton and wool. The manufacture of &#34; union &#34; was shown to be necessary through&#39; foreign competition, and also to suit the .convenience of the poorer classes of Australians, who want a cheaper article. Taking all the facts into consideration, it appears to me that an additional 5 per cent, on the duty is justifiable to bring the item into line with item 123A. The increase will meet the complaints which have been made by the importers that they would rather pay a higher  dutv than have confusion. They have said that it does not matter what the duty is as long&#34; as the rates are uniform, so that no confusion may arise between them and the Customs. </para>

                    <para>- - I may perhaps be accused of giving a somewhat contradictory vote on this question, because I voted for a higher duty on woollen goods and against any reduction of the duty on woollen piece goods. But I shall vote for a reduction on this item on a ground that is not entirely fiscal, but is largely due to evidence given before the Tariff Commission. I recognise that competition can be of two kinds. It may be helpful, or it may be of a dangerous character. The competition in the woollen trade, so far as I know,- has been very keen, and that competition in a sense has been helpful. It has helped the Australian manufacturer to keep up the supply of a pretty good article, and indeed to try to improve the commodity that he puts upon the market. In the flannel industry, the competition has not been so keen. The percentage of duty represents a high protection as regards the value of the goods, with the consequence that the Australian manufacturer of flannels has not been so solicitous about the quality of his material. I shall vote against any  increase in this duty, because I believe that in the interests of the manufacture of good flannel it is desirable that the Australian manufacturer should have some competition. I am certain that the competition under the old Tariff was not in any way dangerous to him. The figures show that he was not only able to stand&#39; up against it, but to increase his output. I want to give the &#39; Committee some even more startling figures than those given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons.</inline> I am going to take the output of the factories themselves. In Victoria in the year 1900 there was used in the woollen mills 6 per cent, of cotton. The figures show that the Victorian mills used 3,045,000 lbs. of greasy wool and 178,000 lbs. of cotton. . In the year 1906 the Victorian woollen factories used 4,745,000 lbs. of greasy wool, and 658,000 lbs. of cotton. Those figures are taken from the return to the Victorian Inspector of Factories. In other, words,  in 1906 the Victorian woollen mills used 14 per cent, of cotton as against 6 per cent, in 1900, or more than double the. proportion. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator may quarrel with the Victorian Inspector of Factories. I am. dealing solely with the use of cotton by&#39; the woollen mills. The figures which I have quoted show that with increased protection there was a decrease in the quality of the article manufactured ; for I contend that the Federal Tariff did give increased protection, because it gave a greater area of market. I venture to say that had the Victorian manufacturer been subject to competition - and the evidence given before the Tariff Commission shows that the imported woollen goods were superior in quality and contained less cotton - it would not have been safe for him to put double as much cotton into his product in 1906 as he did in 1900. </para>

                        <para>- I have quoted the actual figures from the official report. When honorable senators come to consider that whereas in the year 1900 Victoria manufactured 1,500,000 yards of flannel, whilst in the year 1906 she made 3,600,000 yards, and take that fact in conjunction with the fact that more than twice as large a percentage of cotton was used in the latter year, they will, I think, be convinced, as I am, that when the competition was lessened the manufacturers decreased  the quality of their flannel. That is not a desirable state of affairs. It is not desirable that our manufacturers should be so sheltered from competition as to be able to give the consumers a poorer quality of article: I have never heard any protectionist advocate .protection to such an extent as to allow a manufacturer to give the consumer cotton instead of wool in what is supposed to be a woollen garment. </para>

                        <para>- But the facts show that as the Victorian manufacturer became more prosperous he gave a poorer article. If the output of his factory had been dwindling as the result of foreign competition - if he had been &#34;strangled,&#34; to use a well-known ^^-manufactured term - under the Federal Tariff, one could understand his resorting to the use of cotton to save himself. But the facts are quite in the other direction.  His  output was three times larger in 1906 than in 1900, but whilst increasing his output he manufactured an inferior quality of material. These facts convince me that no case can be made out for increased .protection. They certainly indicate that it might be advisable to give the manufacturer such protection as will bring him more into competition with superior woollen articles. Because the incontrovertible facts show that a greater percentage of the imported article than of the local article is pure wool. I am sorry to have to admit that. The analysis made by the Customs officers - I am not taking the analysis of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Max</inline> Hirsch - shows a greater percentage of cotton in the local article. If we are going to shut out the competition of the purer material to a &#34;greater extent, we shall be giving a premium - a direct encouragement - to the putting of more cotton into these goods. I am not going to vote for pro lection of that character. . I make that explanation so that the Committee may understand the motives which, while permitting me to vote for&#39; the highest protection in the Tariff on woollen tweed goods - because I recognise that the manufacturers of tweeds are turning put a good article - will rot permit me to vote for an increase on an article that, a.s the figures show, is less pure than it was six years ago. </para>

                    <para>. - The startling figures quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> have been produced before and quoted with the object of creating several different impressions. It. is a fact which can be easily verified that a large quantity of cotton wadding was manufactured at Messrs. Laycock, Son and Nettleton&#39;s woollen mills. I have ascertained that in the year referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> no less than &#163;3,480 worth of cotton wadding was manufactured by the firm, and it was returned to the Inspector of Factories as being of the value of 4d. per lb. </para>

                        <para>- Reference is made only to the wool and raw cotton that went into the manufacture. I cannot say why the report does not refer to the output of cotton wadding, the manufactured article. A little multiplication sum should enable the honorable senator to get at the true position. If we multiply twenty by three we have sixty, and if we multiply &#163;3,480 - the value of cotton wadding produced in the year referred to - we get a total of considerably over 200,000 lbs. pf cotton used in the manufacture of this wadding. I rose only to clear away the misapprehension that might have been created by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> observation. </para>

                <para class="block">I submit this request so that if it be agreed to I may move, later on,  a  further request  that  the Tariff  On  goods from the United Kingdom be increased from 20 per cent. to 25 percent. I would direct the attention of honorable senators to the necessity for preserving something like order and simplicity in the arrangement of these items. To secure uniformity in respect of some of the earlier items in the schedule, we have agreed to  a  sacrifice of a certain amount of revenue, and I do not think that it can be claimed that a duty of 25 per cent. on imports of this kind from the United Kingdom is too high. It is not more than is necessary to foster and encourage the production of blankets, blanketing, and flannels in Australia. Last year, under the old duty of 15 per cent., &#163;53,000 worth of these materials  were  introduced. I propose that that duty shall be increased by 10 per cent. in respect of imports from the United Kingdom, so that the difference between the duty under the general Tariff and that in respect of imports from the United Kingdom under this item will be the same as we have requested in regard to items 106 and 107. My desire is that the woollen industry of Australia&#39; shall be established once and for all upon a permanent basis. We are engaged in framing a Tariff which we hope will last for some years, and will enable the people of Australia to judge of the results of an effective system of protection as against the luke-warm indifferent kind of protection extended under the old Tariff to the woollen industry of Australia. I should like to know why some honorable senators who voted for a difference of 10 per cent. between the duties under the general Tariff and those in respect of the United Kingdom under items 106 and 107 are not prepared to support this proposal. </para>

                        <para>- The extension of a higher measure of protection to Tasmanian manufacturers will enable them to pay their operatives better wages, and upon that ground I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> to support my proposal. According to the report of a Royal Commission which was appointed in 1907 to inquire into the rates of wages paid to, and the industrial conditions of, certain classes of wage-earners in Tasmania, the woollen industry there, from the stand-point of the operatives engaged in it, is in a deplorable condition. I do not say that similar conditions do not obtain in the other States. If an investigation were made, probably it would be found that they do. </para>

If such a duty enables him to pay only the wages I have mentioned, surely we ought to grant him an increased measure of protection, so as to permit him to pay a more decent wage in the future. </para>

                        <para>- I have quoted the entire paragraphs from the reports of both Commissions, and the -honorable senator can strike the average for himself. My point is that the wages paid in Tasmania are about the same as those paid in England - if anything, they are a shade less. The average wage paid to male weavers in England is 32s. ; in Tasmania, it ranges from 40s. to 15s. 3d. The quotations which I have made must convince honorable senators that the condition of the operatives in the Tasmanian woollen industry are not such as we ought to encourage. Notwithstanding the statement of a Tasmanian manufacturer who professes himself satisfied with a duty of 15 per cent., we ought to extend to him a sufficient measure of protection to enable him to pay his operatives higher wages. </para>

                        <para>- The new protection will, I hope, assist .us to do so. In conclusion, I should like to point to what is happening in this industry in other countries. From the report of the Tariff Commission appointed in the Old Country, I quote the following, which appears under the heading of &#34; Erection of Mills Abroad &#34;- </para>

                    <para>Many instances are riven by witnesses and firms of the transference of mills from Great  Britain  to foreign countries. This began on an important scale, after the raising of the French and German Tariffs, 1879-1882, and was gradually accentuated by the successive changes in the United States Tariffs. Amongst those who have set up mills in foreign countries can be mentioned : Messrs. Isaac Holden to France ; Mundella to Chemnitz; Brigg (Bradford) to Russia ; Priestley, of Bradford, to the United States ; Marshalls, of Leeds, to the United States - this film is reported&#39; to have at onetime employed 4,000 hands in Leeds; Wilford, North Riding of Yorkshire, to Belgium ; Holroyd, to Germany ; Lister, of Huddersfield, their seal skin (imitation) cloth trade to the United States. </para>

                <para class="block">That simple paragraph conveys an eloquent lesson of what is happening iri the Old Country. It shows that its best manufacturers are leaving for other lands, where there is decent shelter alike for manufacturers and employes. My object in moving this, request for an increased duty is to bring the item into consonance with items 106 and 107, in order to secure the necessary simplification of the Tariff and at the same time give the manufacturers of blankets, woollens and flannels the same measure of protection as is afforded to the manufacturers of apparel. </para>

                    <para>- - I think we ought to have a quorum. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Quorum formed-&#93;</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> began by asking a very pertinent question which I told him I would answer.  He said that the duty on item 123  a,  woollen piece goods, had been increased from 15 per cent, to 25 per cent., whereas the duty upon other woollen materials, such as flannels and blankets, had been increased by only 5 per cent.,- and he wanted to know why. The very evident reason is to be found in the. following figures.: - The production of cloth and tweed goods in Victoria - a State which is a very good criterion by which to judge these matters - showed a substantial decline from 1,051,006 yards in 1899 to 971,000 yards in 1900, and to 662,000 yards in 1903 - a decrease of about 45 per cent, in five years. On the other hand, under similar circumstances, according to the report of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission there was an increased output in Victoria in the same years of flannels from 1,108,000 yards in 1899 to 3,201,000 yards in 1903. The production of flannels in those five years had been multiplied by three under a 15 per cent. Tariff, while in the case of the blankets there was an extraordinary increase in the output from 226,000 lbs. weight in 1899 to 557,000 lbs. weight in 1903 - or more than double. Would any fair-minded protectionist, or even an extreme and bigoted one say that those different branches, of the industry ought to be put on the same level? The protectionist section of the Commission, consisting of four bigoted protectionists, recommended a. distinction which has been followed, although their rates were altered by another place. Certain reasons have been, given why the Committee should increase this duty. One - a very proper one - is that we should enable the woollen manufacturers to pay higher wages. </para>

The average for males employed at the minimum wage and over - journeyman males - is  39s.  8d., which may be fair, but is not very high. The average wage for females over twenty-one years of age is  20s. 1  id. I will put the Tasmanian wages in any mill against those figures, and guarantee that they are as good.. </para>

                        <para>- That report&#34; does not deal with the matter so&#39; fully or comprehensively as does a Department which carries on this work year after year. &#39; The Tasmanian Royal Commission did not have time to go into all the details and weigh the whole of the circumstances. In one case the Commission stated that men were employed at  13s.  a week. That was accurate to this extent, that there was an adult male employed at that wage. But he was employed, not for his work, but for charity, to keep him out of the invalid depot - a poor half-demented fellow who was really not fit to earn a wage anywhere. </para>

With the extra definition terms added this morning, all the difficulties of interpretation have been practically removed; and I hope that the Government will stand by their proposal, and not be pushed along, as I am sorry to say they very frequently are. </para>

                    <para>- Undoubtedly the object of the request before us is to exaggerate the Tariff  and, with great respect, I submit that that is what I am speaking about. We have now before us,, from the very party who are pledged to reduce the Tariff, -a proposal to increase a duty. Within the last few days, honorable gentlemen on that side have had one lesson which they do not want to get from other parts of Australia, and they should not be so restive because, occupying the chair temporarily, I could not speak at an earlier stage. I admit that my remarks would have been perhaps more appropriate to the first column than to the second, but still they are not inappropriate to the latter, even if British preference, so hateful a thing to some honorable senators, is the subject immediately before the Committee. </para>

                        <para>- I repeat that every previous effort here to increase duties has indicated that there has been an understanding or arrangement between the Government and the member of the Labour Party who proposed the request. It would have been very much more in accord with my idea of parliamentary procedure, and an evidence of a frankness which is altogether missing in this case, if the Minister, instead of flying kites, had come forward and himself proposed to modify this Tariff. Instead of taking that course, they allow these requests to be put forward. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend is utterly wrong. It is the Government who are stringing the Labour Party. Wishing these things to be done the Government take the psychological moment and the psychological man. The requests having been put forward the Government stand on velvet, because if beaten it is not a Government defeat, and if carried it is a Government victory. I rose to enter an emphatic protest against the action which has been taken here. No one who has submitted a request for a higher duty has attempted to show that the industry needed that additional protection. The most which they have ventured to say has been that if we imposed a higher duty some possible benefit might be obtained. This reckless piling up of one duty upon another, without any justification, without any one attempting a justification, is something which, in my opinion, will sooner or later redound not to the credit of the Senate) but to the political disadvantage of those who are responsible for it. </para>

                    <para>.  - We are discussing the preferential duty, and I have no doubt that the Government intend to support the request for a higher duty. Under the old Tariff the duty against Great Britain was 15 per cent. The Government, I suppose, intend to go on with their fervent assurances that they are going to assist. Great Britain by means of a preferential duty, and I expect that they will point to this very item as one of the means which they will adopt. What will be the position? It will be that, whereas under the Tariff of 1902 Great Britain could send us these materials at a duty of .1:5 per cent., under the Government&#39;s so-called preferences it can send in the same articles at a duty of 25 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- There is no doubt that we have not got sufficient synonyms for the word &#34; sham &#34; to properly describe the attitude of the Government with regard to preference. But a concrete instance like this one is, I think, a sufficient illustration of the whole of their attitude in that respect. I do not believe that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> ventures to speak he will attempt to defend the position of the Government. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> I am not so much concerned with what a private senator is doing as with the attitude of the Government who are sitting here and anxiously awaiting the time when they can say to Great Britain, &#34; Here is a further- sample of the splendid preference we give you - a duty of 25 instead of 15 per cent.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- That may be so. Here is the balance-sheet of another company which surely has not been injured by Inter-State competition, and that is the Castlemaine Woollen Company of &#34;Victoria. The figures for the period from 1902 to 1907 are given; In 1902 the company paid a dividend of 5 per cent., and since then it has paid three 4 per cent, dividends and two 3 per cent, dividends. I do not think that any one will assert, that it is financially in a very strong position, or that it can be called opulent in any sense of the word. </para>

                    <para>. - I propose to vote for the item, as it stands. I do not think it can be said that I have not given the Government very good support during our consideration of the Tariff. I have made up my mind where I can to support the Tariff as it stands, and to correct anomalies. . It has not been shown that there is any anomaly involved in this duty. But honorable senators are trying to create an anomaly, because never before in the history of any Tariff in Australia have blankets and flannels been put on the same footing as tweeds. They have always hitherto been dutiable at 5 or 10 per cent, lower than tweeds. One reason for this is that the manufacture of tweeds involves the employment of a great deal more labour than does tha manufacture of blankets. Another reason is that &#163;1,000 worth of wool may be converted into &#163;4,000 worth of tweeds, whereas if manufactured into blankets or flannel the product would be worth no more than ,&#163;1,500. It should not be forgotten that the Government in this Tariff submit- an increase of io per cent, on the duty on this item under the old Tariff. Under the operation of the old Tariff the local mills might have suffered, but they are not now going back, and surely an increase of 10 per cent, on the old Tariff should be sufficient to give them a fairly good start. There is one section of the people that seems to have been entirely left out of consideration in the discussion of the Tariff in this Chamber. I refer to the consumers. Honorable senators opposite, and members of the Labour Party, are crying out in the interests of the manufacturers and the workers, but they have no regard whatever for the consumers who must use these goods. I am prepared to give, the manufacturers the advantage of. a reasonable duty, and I think I shall do so by supporting the Government proposal. We are told that the Tariff should be simplified and made uniform, and that it is therefore necessary to bring the duties on this .item into line with those imposed on other items. .But these items have never been made dutiable at the same rate in any Tariff previously passed in Australia. Before Federation, the duty on the goods covered by this item was 15 per- cent, in most of the States, and in Victoria from 15 to 25 per cent. We- are now told that we should increase the duty submitted by the Government in order that the mills may pay better wages to their workers. If that be so, it is extraordinary that in New Zealand, where the local mills have only the market represented by a population of 800,000 people to supply, they are worked with great success under a 20 per cent, duty, and at the same time pay higher wages than are paid in woollen mills in Australia. I find that the wages paid in this industry in New Zealand are: Girls, first year 8s., second year 11s., third year 14s. j youths, 14 to 22 years of age, 8s. to 35s. ; men, wool sorters, 50s., scourers, 42s., dyeing, teasing, and carding, 42s., spinners 44s., feeders and piecers, 16 to 22 years of age, 25s. to 42s., milling, pressing,&#39; and stock hands 42s., teasers 45s. to 56s., and labourers 42s. How is it that under a 20 per cent, duty, and with a limited population of 800,000 as against our population of 4,500,000; this industry is profitable in New  Zealand, and pays higher wages than those ruling in Australia ? </para>

                        <para>- That is rubbish. People here wear just as heavy clothing as do the people of New Zealand. The request submitted is, in my opinion, unwise, and if accepted will, I think, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has said, re-act in future upon those who support it. I feel that the Vice-President of the Executive Council in allowing certain other items to be included under item 114 was simply trapping the Committee in order that Crimean and other shirtings, and similar goods, should be included amongst tweeds, which have always borne higher duties than those goods in the past. Occupying the Chair for a time, I regret that I was unable to make these remarks sooner, otherwise I should have made them when the duty on imports under the general Tariff was being considered. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> probably was not in Queensland at the time I went through those mills twenty-seven or twenty-eight years ago, and, as an insurance manager, I took a risk on them over a quarter of a century ago. So that I know what I am talking about, which is a great deal more than some honorable senators do. The balance sheet of the Queensland Woollen Company at the present time is not indicative of the position of the woollen manufacturing industry of Australia. It is a clothing factory. Let honorable senators take up any odd <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Gazette,</inline> and they will find that the company referred to are tenderers for uniforms and for all sorts of odds and ends of military trappings. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> is not aware of the fact let me tell him that die Queensland Woollen Company have travellers going all over Queensland taking orders for single suits of clothes. It is an offence that quotations from the balance-sheet of such a company should be made here as indicative of the position of the wool spinning industry of Australia. The factory of the company referred to is as much a clothing factory as a woollen factory. On the question of British preference, I am not going to make any animadversions on the past or present action of the Government in this connexion, but I wish to say that if, after the- action of Ministers in this Chamber and their vote upon the last division and that about to take place as representatives of the Government of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alfred</inline> Deakin, they continue in put forth any pretension to a desire for preferential trade with the United Kingdom, it will be a fraudulent pretence. I hope they will not be guilty of fraudulent pretence, but my words will apply in future if they pursue the course I have indicated. Of course they do not apply to Ministers up to the present date, and my words are used in a political sense. I would not say that Ministers were personally guilty of wrong doing. But if the representatives of the Government in this Chamber maintain their late attitude in the future it will be a hideous political scandal and a shameful blot upon the &#34;fair name of a country, the administration of which is in the hands of men who, doing one thing, profess another, and I hope they will for the future drop .any protestations or pretensions to a desire for a preference of this kind. </para>

Earlier to-day I went into the question of the adulteration of woollens with cotton and mentioned what a member of the Victorian State Parliament had said on the floor of the State Parliament Souse. As a matter of fact what that gentleman said referred to this very Castlemaine factory. I might say that the first discussion of the cotton adulteration in woollens before the Tariff Commission arose in connexion with this factory. I propose to read only the concluding sentence of a letter addressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Greaves,</inline> the member of the State Parliament of Victoria to whom I have referred, to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Williams,</inline> the manager of  this Castlemaine- factory.

If it were possible to obtain even higher rates, I would vote for them.&#39; I plead guilty to the statement attributed to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> though, as he claims to have been in politics for thirty years, I am surprised that he should rely on the reports of a Sydney newspaper. What I said at Erskineville was that I am an Australian protectionist, and believe in the highest protection for Australian industries, but that I desire the free admission of all goods which cannot be produced here. I have offered to support - and am still ready to make that offer good - every request for placing on the free list goods which cannot be produced in Australia. I have been asked why I have not moved in the direction of getting goods placed on the free list. I have moved ; I have made inquiries among honorable senators as to their views on the subject, and, finding that I am in a minority, I have remained silent, because I wish to see a Tariff agreed upon which will remain unaltered for many years. I said, speaking from memory, that &#39; there are 123 items in the Tariff which cannot be produced in Australia, and I am only too ready to support any request to put those items on the free list. </para>

                        <para>- I voted twice yesterday for the lowest duty proposed, and I do not think more than five items were dealt with then. I have tried to put into force the principles which in Sydney I announced myself as holding. I do not take any responsibility for the Tariff as proposed by the Government. We could do nothing in regard to it until it was put before us. I am still ready to support requests for placing on the free list articles which cannot be produced here, and shall not be influenced in -my votes by the consideration that these requests come from any particular party, or that the Government may be beaten. </para>

Russell has been a little longer in politics he will know that the next worst thing to making an indiscreet speech is attempting to explain it.

May I ask him, then, why he did not vote for tea and rice to be placed on the free list? </para>

                        <para>- I refer honorable senators to the pair-book entry regarding <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson&#39;s</inline> request for free tea. The honorable senator should have explained at Erskineville what he meant when he said that he would place on the free liSt everything that cannot be produced in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> on the strength of a statement  appearing in the &#34; Wild Cat &#34; column of the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> said that an Ipswich factory, which for many years prior to the imposition of the first Commonwealth Tariff paid dividends&#39;,  ceased to do so when that Tariff was imposed. I am surprised that he quoted that statement, because had he referred to official sources of information he would have known that prior to Federation the factory was protected against competition from without the State by duties of 15 and 5 per cent. - much lower rates than were given by the Tariff of 1902. The moment the higher rates of the Commonwealth Tariff Game into force the factory declined. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> wishes to give it more of the poison which is obviously killing it. I would point out to the honorable gentleman that the real reason why the Ipswich factory has suffered is that prior to Federation it had no competition except that within the State, whereas now it has the competition of the&#39; factories in the other States, and for many years to come the developed mills of Victoria and the growing mills of New South Wales will, by a law which no Tariff which we can pass will interfere with, gather to themselves the bulk of the manufacturing business of the Commonwealth, and starve out the factories in those States which have smaller populations. The Ipswich factory has suffered, not from the. competition of foreign factories, but from the competition of factories in other States, and the only thing that would help it would be the re-erection of the Tariff wall, which, prior to Federation, kept the manufactures of other States out of Queensland. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> quoted a balance-sheet to show that the factory is not paying dividends, but a day or two ago I quoted a balance-sheet of a Victorian company which for some &#39;time past has been paying a dividend of 15 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- One of the Ballarat mills, managedby <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Grainger.</inline> When before the Tariff Commission this witness attempted to mislead the Commissioners by saying that the dividends of the company worked out at 71/2 per cent, on a total subscribed capital of &#163;60,000, but the balance-sheet of the company subsequently produced showed Its  capital to be , &#163;30,000, upon which for several years it had been paying a dividend of 15 per cent. We know that it is not an uncommon thing to water the shares of a company in order to make its profits less apparent. The Commonwealth &#39; statistics show that in this industry the number of workmen employed has increased, that the output is larger, and that its conditions altogether are more prosperous than they were in the past, and no one has brought forward any facts justifying an increase of duty. </para>

                    <para>. - I have not come to a conclusion as to what course I shall adopt with respect to this item. I want more information about it. Will the Vice-President of the Executive Council be goodenough to  tell us whether floor cloths and carpets are manufactured in Australia? If they are, in what quantities are they manufactured, and how many of the other articles included in this item are also made here? For instance, are felts manufactured here? It seems to me to be utterly ridiculous to impose a duty of 20 per cent, upon articles such as these, if the duty is simply for revenue purposes. </para>

Tariff I see no reason why that fact should affect our decision now.

                    <para>. - I desire first&#34; of all to draw the attention of my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson,</inline> to the fact that in this item we are only about to put up the duty against the foreigner. The duty of 15. per cent. was the general rate under the old Tariff, and that duty has been recommended by both sections of the Tariff Commission. It is a noteworthy thing that we have in our possession a letter received from certain leading carpet manufacturers in the United Kingdom asking that a preferential duty be imposed in this connexion. I do not pretend to say.. that at the present time we have any carpet manufacturers in the Commonwealth. But I think it would be a mistake to eliminate altogether the revenue aspect of the duty. Those who chiefly contribute to the revenue under this item will, I imagine, be persons who can well afford to pay. </para>

                        <para>- Not at all, but the more expensive carpetings certainly are. We cannot ruthlessly throw away &#163;71,00.0 in revenue. The revenue aspect of this Tariff is one that we cannot overlook, especially, as the States are largely dependent upon the revenue which the Commonwealth receives. Every honorable senator must recognise that this Tariff has been designed to protect our industries, but at the same time to enable us to fulfil&#39; our obligations to the States. I must admit that I do not look with any equanimity on any suggestion which would deprive the Commonwealth of revenue to the extent of &#163;71,000. The Treasury has been depleted of revenue already to a large extent by the alterations made by honorable senators. Something like &#163;60,000 was knocked off yesterday; &#163;13,000 was&#39; knocked off in regard to sago, and &#163;18,000, if I remember rightly, in respect of spices. So that we are doing pretty well in the way of knocking off revenue. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson&#39;s</inline>
                    very pertinent inquiry has made the task of honorable senators who are seeking to arrive at a decision, a very simple one. The honorable senator has made the plainest statement which he has given us during the whole course of these Tariff debates. This is a revenue item. The Minister, did not attempt to qualify it by saying that it was incidentally protective. He acknowledged that it was a purely revenue item. In order t&#39;o justify it, he advances the reason that we have to regard our obligations to the States. Now, what are our obligations? We are not required to raise any fixed sum of money. There is no obligation of that kind. The obligation is to return to the States three-fourths of what we do raise.

                        <para>- It means that the less we raise by means of revenue items the less we return. But we are under no legal obligation to raise anything. There may be an implied understanding or a moral obligation to raise something equal to the sum that the States were receiving from Customs and Excise duties previous to Federation. But we have long since passed that stage. The States are getting far more revenue from Customs and Excise now than they ever did under their own Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- The States as a whole are getting- more to-day from Customs and Excise than they ever did before Federation; and if there are certain States who obtain less, the accurate way of adjusting that disability is not to raise more revenue but to hasten the time when we can have one common purse. There is no legal obligation upon us to do anything such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has described, nor is there any necessity to raise so much money by means of the Tariff. Taking the States as a whole, their Treasurers are well off. The Minister himself, in introducing this Bill, showed that the amount that was estimated to be raised by this Tariff was something like &#163;1,250,000 more than was received under the previous Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- There are many people who estimate that the amount- will be much greater; and we are dealing with the current year. Remembering the increased yield of revenue, it .will be seen that the amounts lost by the reductions of duties which we have requested are comparatively unimportant. Honorable senators need not concern themselves about making further reductions on purely revenue items. The Minister said also that clearly this was an item which concerns the well-to-do, and therefore was a fair subject for taxation. Are we to understand, then, that the Minister thinks that to buy a piece of oilcloth for the cottage of a poor man is an iniquity? </para>

Anything worthy of the name of home generally has a little&#39; oilcloth on the floor. That it is in many cases of poor quality is due only to the fact that  the means of the occupants of such homes prohibit their purchasing better goods. Should we add to the difficulties in their way? The sole question before us is whether we should raise so large a revenue in respect of an article which enters into general consumption? I am prepared to make the item free.

                        <para>- Here is another honorable senator who objects to the poor man having a strip of oilcloth in his home.&#39; I should like&#34; to hear some of these stalwart supporters of labour telling their constituents that they object to their having a carpet or a piece of oilcloth in their homes. The time has gone by when things which are becoming day after day more and more necessities of life could be regarded as mere luxuries, and we should&#39; do all we canto see that they do not continue to be regarded as such. I desire to bring such things within the reach of every one. </para>

No honorable senator has been more consistent than I have been in the effort to place every revenue item on the free list and to secure a reduction of the duty on every protectionist item. I certainly hoped from the words used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> when he rose just now that he was prepared to vote for a reduction of the duty. </para>

                        <para>- Carpets are not made in Australia, and why should <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> vote for a heavy duty upon them? Even the honorable senator seems to be always ready with an excuse for refusing to vote to reduce the burden of taxation.  His  present proposal means first of all that he is desirous of class taxation, because he is saying as clearly as possible, &#34; I shall exempt from taxation the class that use oilcloths, but not the class that use carpets.&#34; That is intrinsically a very poor sort of argument, but it goes still further. It means that if a man with a moderate income of &#163;200 or &#163;300 per annum desires to go, so to  speak, beyond the oilcloth stage to the carpet stage. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> would interpose and say, &#34; No; stick to your oilcloths and you shall have them free ; but if you wish to progress from the oilcloth to the carpet stage you must pay . a duty of 4s.&#39; in the &#163;1 upon your carpets.&#34; We talk glibly about duties of 20 per cent, without actually realizing what they mean. The imposition of such a dutv on carpets, for instance, means that when a man emerges from a shop in which he has spent say &#163;20 on two or three carpets he is met by a Government official, who says, &#34; You have been spending <inline font-style="italic">&#163;20</inline> on carpets, pay me &#163;4.&#34; That is how <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> would treat the carpet man, but he would allow the oilcloth man to go free. I cannot understand his attitude. It seems to me that even the honorable senator will find it difficult to explain why he desires to tax the man who buys carpets but not the man who buys oilcloth. Is oilcloth the only line in the item which appeals to his desire to reduce the burden of taxation? Why should there Be a duty of 4s. in the <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> on the other lines included in the item. One of them is floor and carriage mats. There may perhaps be a prejudice against carriage mats- </para>

And yet some honorable senators say &#34; This is a great industry; let us import all the coir we. require and impose a duty of 25 per cent, in favour of the putting-together industry.&#34; Then we come to &#34; lap dusters.&#34; I do not know what they are, but do not think they are handkerchiefs for the wealthy. </para>

                        <para>- I suppose that the honorable senator thinks it is reasonable to impose a duty of 4s. in the &#163;1 on something which he puts across his knees to keep the dust off his Australian-made tweed when he goes out for a drive. Then again I ask why we should impose such a duty on &#34; floor rugs and coverings (including felts and pads).&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> will tell us that they are made in Australia. I have no doubt that25 per cent, is a proper duty from his point of view when he cannot get a duty of 55 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- Some honorable senator said just now, &#34; If we do not impose these duties how shall we be able to raise wages?&#34; A pertinent question is &#34; To what extent will you have to raise wages in order to enable the people to buy the goods on which these duties are imposed?&#34; In dealing with these duties we are apparently to overlook the fact that the value of wages is represented not by the actual coin received, but by the purchasing power of that coin. In the hands of one man in some circumstances &#163;2 per week may be of far more value than &#163;3 per week received in other circumstances by another. With all these accumulated duties in the Tariff we are most surely reducing largely the value of every sovereign that circulates in Australia. There is one other consideration which probably influences Queensland and Tasmanian senators more than it does those from any other State. Despite any high protective duties that we may impose, it is extremely likely that a fair proportion of these goods will continue to be imported. The balance will be made in the Commonwealth. In other words, the citizens of Queensland, Tasmania, and Western Australia will be called&#39; upon to purchase goods which are largely manufactured in the other States. But they will get no revenue from the purchase of those goods. They will be compelled practically to pay the same prices as they would pay if they bought imported goods, but no revenue will be forthcoming. The further we proceed in our consideration of this &#34;Tariff, the more the representatives of the smaller States must be induced to reflect that we are largely depleting the revenues of those States&#39;. I intend to vote for the lowest duty that may be proposed in respect of this item. </para>

                    <para>.- The reasoning of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> is extraordinary, coming as it does from a labour representative who professes <inline font-style="italic">to be</inline> a strong protectionist, and one who is absolutely opposed to revenue tariffism. He differentiates between carpets and &#39;floor cloths in the same way that Ee does between champagne and beer. Nobody by any stretch of imagination can urge that either champagne or beer is essential to life, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> desires to admit floor  cloths free because the}&#39; are necessities. I wish to inform him that, as the result of my visit to Japan some three years ago, I arrived at the conclusion that floors are better if - they are not covered. Consequently, I have only bare boards in my room, and I believe that, as a consequence, I enjoy better health than I would otherwise. But I wish to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hen</inline> derson whether he wishes to always limit the working classes to the use of oilcloths? Does he think that the wives of our working men have no ambition so far as household effects are concerned? Practically he says to them, &#34; My dear ladies, by all means have a piece of oilcloth upon your floor, but if you have any ambition in the direction of putting a carpet upon your stairway, you must pay a duty of 4s. in the &#163;1 upon it.&#34; Evidently the desire of some honorable senators is to levy taxation upon the result of the efforts of the working classes. We saw that evidenced in this Chamber yesterday in respect of silk, because somebody had a hazy belief that only a small section .of the community used silk. Personally, I desire the Government to inform me what articles included in this item can be manufactured in the Commonwealth.. Those I desire to make dutiable, but -I shall vote with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> to admit free such articles as cannot be made locally. </para>

                    <para>. - When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> initiated this discussion by asking the Minister for information, I and several others waited with bated breath to hear it, but I regret that the&#39; Minister conveyed no information to the Committee as to the practicability or otherwise of establishing any industry in connexion with this item in Australia. _ He said that these articles were legitimate subjects for taxation. I disagree with. that. I fail to see why, in the absence&#39; of proof that they can be made in Australia, the people should be called upon to continue to pay a revenue duty of &#163;71,034 per annum. The Minister did not tell us where in Australia these articles were being made, or whether there was any hope of their being made here, but he candidly stated that &#163;60,000 had been knocked off the revenue yesterday, in addition to previous reductions of &#163;13,000 and &#163;18,000, and asked the Committee not to knock off any more. Ardent protectionist&#34; as I am, I shall not vote for a revenue dutv pure and simple. These articles are not made in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Nor even if the protection was increased by 100 per cent. In any case, almost the whole of the raw material would have to be imported, and in order to give the industry a start it would be necessary to admit that raw material practically free. I cannot see any logic in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson&#39;s</inline> desire to dissect this item, and exempt floor cloths which include linoleums, while leaving carpets dutiable. I am quite prepared to make floor cloths free, but I am prepared also to make the whole item free. The honorable senator compared carpets with champagne, but carpets are just as necessary an adjunct to the comforts of a home as tapioca or sago are necessary for the table. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> moved recently that sago and tapioca should be free - a motion which I supported and was glad to see carried: While sago and tapioca are household necessities, I regard carpets as a necessary to make a home comfortable. They are not necessarily a luxury. The eating of food is not the whole aim and end of life. Every man is ambitious to make his home comfortable. I do not mean that he wants to indulge in the luxury of a Brussels carpet, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> is anxious to tax all carpets, no matter what their quality. </para>

Is there any hope of establishing the oilcloth and linoleum industry ? When will it be established? Are the people to be called upon to continue to pay &#163;71,000 a year for an indefinite period until that and other industries are established ? That is an utterly foolish proposition. This is a revenue duty only, and, unless evidence to the contrary is forthcoming, I am prepared to vote to make the item free. - </para>

In putting forward that rather astonishing proposition, the honorable senator, unfortunately for himself, sought to compare &#39;carpets with champagne, and floor cloths with beer, and indicated that he was at all times willing to put a higher duty upon champagne. It is rather curious that when a proposal was before the Committee to increase the champagne duty <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> religiously voted against it. </para>

                        <para>- Even if it was 40s., my statement is correct that the honorable senator . voted against an increased duty on champagne. I refer to this because I want to show <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> that he has mixed up the contents of his two bottles. He assumes that carpets are in the champagne bottle, and linoleums and oilcloths in the beer, bottle. Let me tell him that carpets are as cheap as - many of them much cheaper than - linoleums. </para>

That is true of Western Australia, and also of a large portion of the interior of New South Wales and Queensland. . </para>

                        <para>- Both honorable senators cannot be national in this matter, because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> is prepared to free all floor coverings, whilst the other &#34;nationalist,&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson,</inline> is prepared to make free only those things  which his constituents are likely to require. The, admission of the Vice-President of the Executive .Council, coupled with the knowledge- which honorable senators must themselves possess, is sufficient to justify the statement that this is a revenue duty pure and simple. That being so, is there any justice in saying that the miner of Coolgardie, who uses linoleum, shall have it free, but the workman of Melbourne; who wishes to use carpet, must pay duty on it? Is it fair that the small prospector in Western Australia, who is erecting a hut, and lining it with oilcloth because timber is too dear, should have the commodity admitted free, while the man in the settled timber districts of New South Wales should have to pay duty on the wood he uses for the same purpose? I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson,</inline> as a fair man, to show any sound reason why the people of Coolgardie, or of the hotter districts of New South Wales, should have linoleum and oilcloth free, while those in the colder or cooler districts, who require a warmer floor covering, should have to pay duty. I make this appeal without regard to the question of protection or free- trade ; and I am hopeful that the honorable senator will see his way to vote with us, in endeavouring to place these commodities all on one basis. </para>

                    <para>. - I intend to support the duty as it stands. . This may sound strange from one who. has always declared himself against revenue duties; and probably some explanation may be desired. I am not to be led away by the statements of either <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> the latter of whom so cunningly endeavours to induce honorable senators, who I think have never given fair consideration to the. possibilities of the Commonwealth, to make this item free. This duty is not half as much re1 venue producing as that on item 123, and yet a majority of  honorable senators are, in the latter instance, prepared to give protection to the extent of 30 and 25 per cent. If there never had been a duty on woollen goods, would they ever have been produced to any extent in Australia? Millions&#39; of pounds have been derived from the duty on woollen goods, and will continue to be derived until the industry is thoroughly established. But why should we call that a revenue duty only? There should be no  greater difficulty in producing carpets and&#39; similar materials here in the future than&#39; there was in producing woollen goods. </para>

                        <para>- I shall vote for the highest duty that it is possible to obtain, because I believe it will have a protective effect. I have every sympathy with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> in his endeavour to exempt linoleums and oilcloths from duty, in view of the fact- that he regards this to be a revenue duty only. But&#39; I believe that in the future we shall produce carpets, oilcloths, and linoleums, not only for Australia, but for other parts of the world. Not long ago, we decided to grant bounties particularly applicable to industries in Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria - bounties for the production of hemp, flax, jute, and other fibres which are used extensively in the manufacture of both oilcloths and carpets. We were also prepared to grant a bounty for the production of cotton, which is extensively used in these industries ; and goodness knows we produce enough wool here ! We would not grant bounties unless we hope! that these commodities would be produced; and if they are produced, what do we propose to do with them? Not only are we prepared to grant the bounties I have indicated, but we desire tq encourage the production of oils, paints, and lead ; and, again I ask, what do we propose to do with these commodities when they, are produced ? Are we to paint tents and nothing else? Can these products not be utilized in the manufacture of carpets, oilcloths, and linoleums? Although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> makes his proposal with the best of intentions, I contend that this item is one on which the heaviest duty should be imposed. It is true that at present we import the most qf our floor coverings. The commercial travellers who come here from the United Kingdom and other parts of the world may be most frequently met on the line between Melbourne and Adelaide, the latter being the port of arrival and departure. And when this question was under discussion in the train some time, ago, the representative of a Scotch firm, which&#39; does as much business as any other in&#39; Australia, when questioned as to the effect of the duties, said that if, from any cause it did not pay to do business here with the imported materials, his principals would be prepared to start manufacturing in Australia. When I have an assurance of that description I am perfectly justified in voting to retain these duties. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator need not endeavour to mislead me by trifling interjections of that kind. Some honorable senators, who are likely to be misled by the cry about revenue duties, may inquire why it is not proposed to impose a prohibitive duty on the present item, so &#39;as to bring about the local manufacture of these goods more rapidly. But I remind honorable senators that, in almost every industry, low duties were at first imposed in the interests &#39;of the people. The great woollen industry was not started with a duty of  40  or  50  per cent., either in Australia, America, or elsewhere. At first low duties were imposed in order to test the possibilities of the industry,- and when the industry was proved to be suitable to the country, reasonable protection was afforded, Prohibitive duties would stop all importation, whereas a reasonable duty is a means of proving the worth of the industry, and preparing the way for a higher impost. In the meantime I advocate the duties pro posed in the schedule, and as recommended by the Tariff Commission. These matters were all discussed by the Commission, and the conclusion arrived at was that the duties, though low, will ultimately prove protective, and in the interest of the people of Australia. The increase in the duty under the general Tariff is proposed by the Government with the object of giving greater preference to Great Britain; and I agree with that policy. If we are to continue for some years to import largely, and we can give a preference to Great Britain, let us do so. The larger duty against countries outside the Empire will only result in greater incidence of protection ; and for the reasons I have stated I hope the item will be allowed.. to remain as proposed. </para>

                    <para>. -  We ought- to be grateful to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> for furnishing &#39; us with the information which he as a member of the Tariff Commission was able to acquire concerning this item, and the prospects of the industry from a protective aspect. Hitherto I have discussed where we are at the present time and the past history of the matter. The strictly revenue aspect is that out of a total revenue of  .&#163;71,634  received under this item in  1906,  carpets yielded  &#163;19,000,  and floorcloths - that is, oilcloths and linoleums -  &#163;&#91;48,400,  or a total of  &#163;67,400.  Honorable senators will therefore see that in the past this&#39; has been practically a revenue duty, and it was with that aspect that I dealt previously. I Would point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> that a carpet or floor cloth is not purchased every day or every week or even every month as a dress may be. Three or four or five years is, roughly, the usual period for which a carpet will last, and consequently the duty is felt and considered to be very light. </para>

                        <para>- It is an exceedingly light tax. I am referring to the item chiefly from the revenue point of view. I have pointed out that it must be recognised that in this Tariff there are certain revenue items. In the case of silk 15 per cent; was fixed as a fair amount for a revenue tax, and so far as this item is concerned 15 per cent, from that stand-point alone cannot be regarded as an unreasonable revenue duty. I have already emphasized  - and I Was very glad to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> confirm that aspect of it very forcibly - the great importance of this duty to the smaller States. Practically the whole of the revenue from this particular tax is credited to them. The Committee cannot afford to disregard the protective influence of the duty as urged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor.</inline> In my previous speech I did not touch upon that point, because I admit at once that this is a revenue duty. But out of the articles which come under item 115 we produce rope mats, floor rugs and lap dusters. The revenue derived from the imports of these particular articles in 1906 was very small) representing the difference between &#163;67,400 and &#163;71*034. But there is no doubt that incidentally, the duty has had a protective influence in regard to those things.  1  would impress upon the Committee the broader aspect in which the question has been presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor.</inline></para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator can hardly regard it from that stand-point alone. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> urged very forcibly that the duty has a protective effect, all along the line. While no doubt it is at present a revenue duty substantially, yet it has a protective influence, and there is a fair and reasonable prospect, the evidence for which has been furnished by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> of development in that direction, particularly when it is borne in mind &#39; that many of our industries were started&#39; by the aid of a &#39;small duty. They were encouraged, but achieved, I admit, only small proportions on the small duty. But if this duty should have the effect of even influencing the starting of these industries in ever so small a way, there will be every encouragement for us to increase the protection on a subsequent occasion for the purpose of promoting further development. In 1906 we imported carpets and carpeting material to the value of &#163;127,665, which, at 15 per cent., yielded &#163;19,150. The United Kingdom sent us &#163;115,376 worth, Germany &#163;4.426 worth, and the United States &#163;1.717 worth. In 1906, we imported floor cloths to the value of &#163;322.70 r, which, at 15 per cent.,  Yielded  &#163;48,405. The United Kingdom furnished us with &#163;304,833 worth, Belgium with &#163;2,094 worth, India with &#163;1,303 worth, Germany with &#163;8,108 worth, and Japan with &#163;2,030 worth. I Submit that the Government were justified in raising the duty against foreign imports to 20 per cent. For the reasons I have given, I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> that from the revenue and protective stand-points, he might see his way to ask leave to withdraw his request. and permit this exceedingly reasonable duty of 15 per cent, to be imposed. </para>

But this duty is not imposed with that object at all. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has told us without qualification that it is a revenue duty. I do not approve of this system of raising revenue. I do not believe in taxing the floor cloth or the carpet which a man lays down to keep out the wind or to assist in maintaining the comfort of himself and family, while other sources of taxation are allowed to remain untapped. I do not know how my honorable friends on this side who call themselves free-traders are going to act. Do they intend to sweep away the duty or to be merely revenue tariffists? </para>

                        <para>- I want to find out how much sincerity there is on this side of the chamber, and when I have accomplished that I am going to turn to the other side, and address an inquiry to my Labour friends. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> seems to be  anxious to tax carpets, because presumably they are used by rich people, and to allow linoleums and floor cloths to escape scot free because they are used by poor people. Is that in accord with his professed principle as a labour man of preferring direct to indirect taxation ? I have the free-traders on the one hand, and the direct taxationists on the other, and we will see how the thing is going to pan out. I intend to vote for the abolition of the duty. </para>

                        <para>- That is not a  revenue duty. Any duty for which I voted I regarded as a protectionist duty, and if the Vice-President of the Executive Council had not stated so distinctly that this is a purely revenue duty, and if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> had not delivered his speech, it is very doubtful&#39; indeed whether I would not have voted for this also as a protectionist duty. But fortunately for myself at last I have had my eyes opened. I am not going to walk into the trap again. I assumed from the&#39; beginning that this was purely a revenue duty. I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> whether the Tariff Commission had taken any evidence about the duty on carpets, and he said that they had not. and that there had been no appearance on the part of any carpet manufacturer. </para>

                        <para>- We can grow rice in Queensland. 1 will tell Senators Best and McGregor what I am prepared to do. If a request is moved to raise this duty to  30  per cent. I will vote for it, because I believe that then it would be a protectionist &#39; duty, which, would encourage carpet manufacturers to establish the industry here. But so far as I can gather the Government are not prepared to adopt that suggestion. They want revenue from this source. They are not going to get it. </para>

He said that the woollen industry and a number of other industries were established in exactly the same fashion. In Victoria the duty on woollens was very much higher than  15  per cent. </para>

                        <para>- They impose duties as low as  15  per cent, until an industry is strong enough to walk,, and when that stage is. reached and presumably a duty lower than  15  per cent., would be sufficient protection, they double .the duty and make it  30  per cent. The fact of the matter, is that for a long time in Australia - and I am sorry to say that the superstition prevails to a large extent even to-day - raising revenue through the Customs was the one object of our statesmen. They never thought of taxing incomes or of levying succession duties, and the very idea of a tax upon land was so repulsive to them that no one dare mention it in their presence. It was only when the pressure of circumstances became very great that they were compelled to transform their revenue duties into protectionist duties, and some of my honorable friends in this chamber are trying now to repeat the operation. I at least am not a. protectionist of that kind. I want duties which will really protect industries or node at all. The Tariff to me is an instrument not for extorting revenue from the poorer sections of the people, but for the establishment of industries. If I have made some mistakes that only shows that I am human. If I have failed to do my duty as a protectionist that is no reason why I should continue to adopt a wrong method. </para>

If the Vice-President of the Executive Council or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> will submit a request for an increase of the duty on carpets by  30  percent., I will vote for it, be- cause such a duty would have a protective effect. There is a fair chance. If 20 per cent, will encourage the manufacture of carpets at some time in the distant future 30 per cent, might give us carpet factories within two years. I am quite willing to vote for a duty of 30 per cent. </para>

                    <para>.  - I was very much impressed by the reminder we had from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> that we are not taking due notice of the possibilities of Australia in connexion with the item with which we are now dealing. If we were to have due regard for the possibilities of manufacture in Australia in the way the honorable senator suggested, there is not an item in the Tariff on which we should not impose duties of 30 or 40 per cent. It is possible to manufacture in Australia practically everything that is included in the Tariff. The question is, are we at all likely to produce many of these things? Some passing traveller whom the honorable senator met somewhere appears to have given him an assurance that if we raised the duty on linoleums, some Scotch firm would be induced to commence their manufacture in Australia, and on this basis the honorable senator sees a future large industry. The honorable senator said that we were giving bonuses for the production of cotton, flax, and many other things, and he asked what we were to do with them when we produced them? What did the honorable senator do last night, when we were considering the duties on cotton and linen fabrics, the manufacture of which in Australia is much more probable than is the manufacture of linoleums, because the market for them would be sufficiently large to justify the establishment of extensive factories, which cannot be said of linoleums ? Why did not the honorable senator rise in his place and say that because of the possibility of their manufacture in Australia the duty on cotton and linen fabrics should be 25 per cent. ? Why did he allow all classes of fine cottons and linens to be admitted duty free? The real position in connexion with this item is that to be consistent we must, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has suggested, make the duty_ sufficiently high to be protective, or adopt the practice we have already adopted in connexion with other revenue items, and go infer a reduction of the duty. </para>

                        <para>- I can tell the Vice-President &#34;of the Executive Council that in connexion with some items he has succeeded in imposing very heavy taxation1 upon the poorer classes of the community, and that the duties on dress goods will return a very much larger revenue than he anticipates. I say that linoleums and carpets are necessary in every house. In some of the warmer parts of the Commonwealth-, people may prefer linoleums, but carpets will be preferred where the climate is colder. The cheaper kinds of carpet- ordinary tapestry and&#39; Kidderminster carpets, that come in here in squares, are not likely to be manufactured in the Commonwealth for the next score of years. They look nice, arid the working man buys them to brighten up his little parlour or best room. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Henderson&#39;s request is agreed to, the man who uses linoleum will be able to get it free of duty, whilst the man living in a colder climate, who- would prefer some kind of carpet, will have to pay a very high duty upon it. The request is further inconsistent, because even those who would prefer to cover their floors with linoleum would like to have a hearthrug or doormat of carpet, on which  20  per cent, duty is paid. The proper thing for us to do is to reduce the duties on this item, as we have reduced other revenue duties. </para>

                    <para>. - In the discussion of this item, we have been given some useful or certainly  some startling information. Possibly I do not entirely grasp the protectionist argument, but the substance of that used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> and confirmed by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, is that the more successful a protected industry becomes, the higher the duty which must be imposed to protect it. I do not think that is in accord with the doctrine of protection as understood in the United States of America, which may be called the fatherland of extreme protection. I believe that the practice begun there was to impose a duty for the purpose of establishing an industry, and when that purpose has been achieved, to gradually remove the duty. If - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s</inline> view of the policy of protection be correct, it effectively destroys the argument used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> who, I suppose, may be considered the Bayard of protectionists in the Senate. We began iri Australia by imposing low duties. </para>

                        <para>- that may be, but they were imposed for protectionist purposes, and after the industries were started with duties of  12  or  15  per cent., it is suggested that they should now be given a protection of  20. 30,  or  .40  per cent. If that be the correct course to follow, -in what position should we find ourselves if, following <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> suggestion, we started with a  30  per cent, duty on linoleums? If a factory for their manufacture were established in Australia, and it was proved that linoleums could be made here in the course of a few years, the honorable senator would inevitably come to Parliament with&#39; a demand for a duty of  60  or  100  per cent. Another argument to which I ask the consideration of the protectionists is this:. I regard blankets and flannels as more in the nature of necessaries than are floor cloths and linoleums ; but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> voted for dear blankets and flannels, and proposes to vote for cheap floor cloths and linoleums. </para>

                        <para>- I prefer in &#34;this instance to accept their statements as probably the more correct, and therefore regard the position of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> as untenable.  His  fellow-protectionists have destroyed his arguments. I. rose chiefly to emphasize the extraordinary statement &#39;&#39; of protectionists that the more successful our protected industries become, the higher must our duties be. If that is to be so, the people of Australia will probably in a short time have to reconsider the position. </para>

                    <para>. - I regret that I am unable to get the goods under this item in free, but I do say that every honorable senator who voted to make them free will be doing his best in a practical way if he will now support me in trying to make the duty 10 per cent. Those honorable senators who voted to make the item free have done so, if they were honest, for this purpose and no other : to remove the burden of taxation. They recognise that this is a revenue duty, and they do not want to raise revenue from such an item. If they are honest they will prefer 10 per cent, to 20 per cent. </para>

It seems strange that as a free-trader I should be found putting forward any argument of. the kind, but my object in voting for a reduction of the duty on these goods is not from any fiscal standpoint whatever beyond this - that I think that the consumers of the Commonwealth are being so outrageously &#34;had&#34; under the vast majority of items in this Tariff, that if it is possible to get even one duty reduced somewhat, it is my duty in the interests of the vast mass of consumers to vote for the proposed reduction. For these reasons I shall be very happy to vote with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons.</inline> I hope there will be a sufficiency of honorable senators having a similar regard for the consumers to secure the carrying of the proposed reduction of this most excessive duty on a number of goods that concern the poor rather than the rich. </para>

                    <para>. - Whilst I regret that we have not decided to request that the duty be removed, I am sure that it will be a source of extreme satisfaction to tens of thousands of people in the Commonwealth to learn that our friends of the Labour Party have &#34; thrown up the sponge,&#34; so far as direct taxation is concerned. It is not long since we learned that the Labour Party would on no account vote for revenue duties. We were told that they believed in direct taxation, and it was understood that the principal plank in their platform was that of land values taxation. Yet honorable senators of that party have acknowledged tonight - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> at all events, has done so - that he considers that for all practical purposes there is not within the scope of the Tariff one revenue item. It will be a relief to many people to learn that the desire on the part of the Labour Party for land values taxation is apparently dead and buried. </para>

The Labour Party on the fiscal question are free to act as they individually- think well. It is not with us a question of policy Some of us happen to be protectionists, while others are free-traders. I am a protectionist, and claim to be consistent. If the Minister in charge of the Bill had not failed to show that the duty was a protective one, I should not have voted against it. The honorable senator failed to do .so, and even the Government Whip was not game to try to help him out of his difficulty. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> - whom I acknowledge as my leader in many matters, although not in regard to the fiscal question unless I am consulted- - rose and addressed the Committee. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> then proceeded to proclaim the virtues of the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> as much as to say that members of the Labour Party should come into line with their leader. We did not. We have our own convictions, and I am satisfied that I was consistent in the attitude that I took up. Who would describe <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> as a labour man? How did he vote on the occasion to which reference&#39; has been made?

                        <para>- Nonsense. What is the use of this incipient rioting on. the part of the one supporter of the Government? As a stranger and a pilgrim in the land, I was forced to the conclusion that nobody took any heed of the blind in Victoria, on account of the unseemly exhibition, to which I have referred. But if there be an institution for the care of the blind in Melbourne, and if- the afflicted inmates - for whom I entertain the greatest sympathy - are enabled to assist that institution by their labours, we ought to extend some consideration to them,, especially in  view of the fact that we have been voting all kinds of fiscal benefits to the lusty, the  strong  and particularly to the rich. So far. the whole  object  of this Tariff has been to breed, if possible, in Australia, the same class of financial parasite that has been eating the heart out of the great Republic of America - I refer to millionaires. That  being  the. case, I shall withdraw from the attitude of sympathy which I had intended to assume towards <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons&#39;</inline> pronosal. I do not like to vote against one of the members of this Committee who, according to the views which he entertains - very many of which I share - has shown himself to be sternly consistent, like myself - unpopularly  consistent, in fact. But under the circumstances, all that we can do is to retain the duty proposed under the general Tariff, and afterwards to grant a preference of 5 per cent, upon this item to the- products of the United Kingdom. I am sorry that I do not see my way in the circumstances to vote for 15 per cent. I am prepared - I  say  it with regret - to leave the general Tariff duty as -it is, and strive for what seems a reasonable and fair thing in the shape of a preferential du&#39;tv of 20 per cent.,- as we have been granting preferences to the United Kingdom pretty well all through this division of the schedule. </para>

The first, which has been urged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> is that this is a class of goods that are made in our blind asylums, and that can be easily made by cripples and others who have the misfortune to suffer physical infirmity. There is no reason why we should not make the whole of this coir matting here. From that stand-point, recognising it to be a thoroughly protective duty, the Committee &#39;should have no hesitation in voting for 25 per cent. </para>

What did Senator Trenwith and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> do in those cases? There was no question of the blind when they clamoured for 40 per cent, protection.

If I had adopted <inline font-weight="bold">Senator.

It is a great pity that the question of the blind was brought in at all. I daresay if we could go into the cold facts of the case it would be found that the quantity of these goods manufactured by the blind is small.

                        <para>- Clearly there cannot be a great deal imported, because the bulk of the importations will be of carpets, carpeting, and floor cloths, and I see that the total was under &#163;500,000 for the whole of the Commonwealth. If I had noticed that before, it might have caused me to temper my remarks as to what I intended to do. &#34; I admit that I was influenced by the sentimental side of the question introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline></para>

                        <para>- With the exception of sewn or padded quilts not a single quilt is made in Australia, and this duty has no effect in a protective sense. Are we to tax cleanliness to the extent of  25  per cent, on towels? Of all the articles I have mentioned I do not know of any that are made here, except, perhaps, doyleys, and I am not particular whether these .are included in the request or not. </para>

                        <para>- If it pleases the honorable senator I shall leave doyleys out of the request. Table-covers come here ready woven, and there is no reason for imposing a duty of  25  per cent., when, in the case of other revenue duties, we have been satisfied with  15  per cent.  Counterpanes are under the same heading as quilts, bedspreads, table-mats, splashers, table-cloths, runners, and mantel borders. I have not included sheets, which do afford a little employment in the way of. hemming in factories. </para>

                        <para>- I doubt if the&#39; honorable senator, who is so emphatic, could even tell me what a table cover is.&#39; We sometimes make patchwork counterpanes in our own houses, but there is certainly no industry for the making of them. It may be taken up as fancy work by a lady, but. it certainly gives no industrial employment. Why should we impose a high duty on articles which are necessary in every poor man&#39;s family ? Nearly every one of these articles is an absolute necessity. </para>

                    <para>- I hope that the Committee will not set to work to mutilate an item which has been framed by experienced men in such a Svay as to enable us to deal with the articles under one duty. The articles have been grouped with care by the Department as the result of experience. Generally speaking, the raw material for all this class&#34; of work is admitted free, and it is undertaken by women, principally old women. </para>

                        <para>- I am told most distinctly that in the case of each article employment is afforded, chiefly to elderly persons. The item includes such articles as furnishing drapery and napery, sheets, pillow-cases, covers, bolster cases, counterpanes, bed-spreads, table mats, tablecloths, runners, mantel -borders, bags for linen, brush and comb bags, nightdress cases, and handkerchief sachets. I could understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> submitting a request in respect of the duty on the articles, but a proposal to take one article out of the item and include it in another item is one which honorable senators should not entertain for a moment. I ask my honorable friend to permit the grouping as it now stands to remain, and if he is dissatisfied with the duty to submit a request on which we can take a vote. I beg him not to attempt to disturb the grouping, as that would involve complication, trouble, and waste of time. I assure him that there is hardly an article included in the item which is not made at home by women, particularly by &#39;elderly women. </para>

                    <para>. - If I were disposed to do a factious thing I would take the Minister at his word and try to secure, and I believe that if I tried I could secure, a reduction of the duty on these articles in keeping with the reduced duties on other articles. I admit that certain articles included in the item are manufactured here and give a certain amount of employment to persons of the class to which the honorable senator has referred. Towels, quilts, and counterpanes are not imported in the piece to be made up here, but are imported ready for use, and are necessary in every household. To impose a duty of 35 per cent, on the cotton counterpane used on the poor man&#39;s bed is nothing short of robbery. </para>

                        <para>- That is because, unfortunately, the, honorable senator will not give way until he is beaten. I should like him to show a more conciliatory spirit, and not to regard the Tariff in its present Form as a sacred thing which should not on any account be disturbed. What I suggest would no doubt lead to some reduction of revenue, but I speak of goods on which it is not right that high duties should be imposed. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> were present, I am sure that he would be in favour of having some of these articles admitted free of duty. </para>

                        <para>- It is quite correct that a few diaper towels are imported in the piece and cut up, but for every dozen cut up and hemmed here, giving little . employment in factories, a thousand dozen&#39; towels imported ready made are sold. Huckaback towels cut up here are often sent to the Old Country to be hemmed. Cotton quilts and counterpanes are imported ready for use, and they represent a very important item in every household. I am anxious to arrange a compromise without breaking up the item which the Vice-President of the Executive Council regards so sacredly. </para>

I fear, as has been said in the Senate, that the Tariff is becoming a machine for taxing the masses, and while I am prepared to vote for fair and reasonable protection,  1  do not wish to kill the policy as it was killed in- Victoria by the imposition of duties at which the people revolted.

But, apart from that, I, with the greatest good-will and personal kindliness, beseech, beg, implore, and supplicate the Minister not to be so infernally &#34;cocksure&#34; about everything. . There is nothing that the honorable senator does not know, whether it is about driving a tack in a factory. at Coolgardie, or catching a shark at Thursday Island. He can give the&#39; A B C and all the details of every possible function connected with commerce and manufacture throughout the Commonwealth.

                        <para>- Yes, I think it has, and, unfortunately, with a great many other items also; because the Minister expects us to accept his <inline font-style="italic">ipse dixit</inline> as being absolutely unanswerable. But, apart from jocularity, I ask the Minister not to be so absolutely positive about everything that comes before us, and not to be so dogged in his opposition to everything that is proposed. On many occasions, as in the present instance, the Vice-President of the Executive Council ought to have been willing to admit that, just as he is one of the most prominent and profound ornaments of the law, it is possible for the Committee to contain a few gentlemen having a straggling knowledge of some of the business propositions that come before us in connexion with the Tariff. Just as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> is an ornament of the law, I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> is equally an ornament of that branch of commerce&#39; that deals with such articles as are now under consideration. Just as I am prepared to follow the Minister in a matter of law, I beg him in his graciousness and his extreme condescension to be willing to follow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator- Mulcahy&#39;s</inline> advice in a matter pertaining to these articles of commerce. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> is an authority on such things, and in the same way I assure the Minister that I am an authority with regard to some of them. Am I not an authority on bed covers? Do not I know what a pillowcase is, and at what it ought to be taxed? I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> should be looked up to as the sole responsible authority on such questions. Does not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> appreciate the comforts of a cosey, that it is proposed to tax under this item, and does not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> know the inestimable benefits attaching to spats that come in under the n.e.i. provision? When the Minister considers these matters, he must admit that there are man\ experts here. I am going to support the man who knows what he is talking about rather than a gentleman who is profoundly unacquainted with the matters that he has the Ministerial responsibility of submitting to the Committee. </para>

                        <para>- Not so. I may explain, as I mentioned a little earlier, that, first of all, I am very desirous that the grouping of this Tariff should not be disturbed. The items have been grouped after much consideration by experienced officers; and if one item is to be taken out and put in another place, and another item is to be removed from its group and put elsewhere, it must seriously disturb the Tariff; and it is difficult to realize. exactly what the effect will be. Speaking generally, the object in&#34; grouping these various items together is to bring a particular class of goods together, which goods, it is understood, are. essentially the. work of a particular class of people. If honorable senators ask me to enumerate the factories where these goods are made, I could not, of course, do so.&#34; What I have stated is that the cutting, trimming, and fringing of these various things afford a considerable amount of work to elderly people and to women. Very largely the work is done privately, but still those who do it are entitled to protection. </para>

                        <para>- It is none the worse if the work is done privately. The people who do it deserve protection none the less because they, are not employed in registered factories. The point is that the work actually gives employment. Though I do not know exactly where the work is done, I am assured that there is not a thing mentioned in the item that ought not to be mentioned here. As I have said, the raw material is imported free, and it is cut up into shapes, or fringed, or otherwise dealt with. Under those circumstances, we can treat it grouped as it is, and we should then be able to fix such a duty as the Committee may think fair and reasonable. </para>

                    <para>. - The Vice-President of the Executive Council, has just asked the Committee not to disturb this item on the ground that it has been carefully thought out by experts and experienced officials. I venture to say that the Minister would address exactly the same appeal to the Committee with regard to every other item when an attempt was made by anybody on this side of the Chamber to interfere with it. But we did not hear that appeal from him when others sitting behind him&#39; wanted to disturb the grouping. When there was an attempt to take corsets out of one item and make a separate sub-item of them, the Minister did not ask us to consider that this grouping had been designed by experienced experts. It was the same when an attempt was made to put two items into one. The Minister approved of that. He now tells us that we must not think of taking such a small line as towels out of this item, because the expert wisdom of the Department has decided that they should be embodied in it. I do not think the Committee wi.ll&#39; be swayed by such a statement. If there is anything in it, it means that we ought not to alter a point or a comma in the Tariff as prepared by the officials. The responsibility is upon us to look into every item in the Tariff, and to request such amendments as s&#39;eem desirable. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has endeavoured to assure the Committee that a great many goods covered by this item are made in Australia. I should like him to ask the experts of the Department whether it is not a fact that the great bulk of the goods imported coming under it consist of quilts, counterpanes, towels, and table-covers in a complete state, ready to be sold. There is not even a stitch to be put in them. </para>

If a great deal of work is done here in connexion with the articles imported under this item, surely the Minister can submit official figures as to the number of persons so employed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has pointed out, however, that there is no such record.

I may explain that at present the Department experiences some difficulty in determining whether these saddle bags are furnishing requisites or articles of ladies&#39; attire. They are certainly not identical with the saddle-bags which the over-lander uses, and which I have had the pleasure of using across the back of a reliable horse in days gone by. It appears that at the present time some difficulty is experienced by the Customs Department in determining whether saddle-bags should be . included under item 108, with which we have already dealt, as &#34;articles&#39;, n.e.i., partly or wholly made up from textiles, felts, furs, or feathers, not included under items 107 and 134, and including materials cut into shape therefor. &#39; &#39; With a great deal of confidence I submit that an article which appertains to the care of furniture is undoubtedly one of furnishing and not one of apparel or attire, as is claimed by the Customs Department.

Just imagine a person who desires to leave his home for a few days attiring all his furniture in feathers. Imagine putting feathers all round his dining-room furniture and decorating his drawing-room sofa with furs. As item 117 undoubtedly refers to furnishing articles, and as the class of saddle-bags to which I have alluded are unquestionably furnishing articles, I trust that the Vice-President of the Executive Council will for once exhibit that charming acquiescence which always delights the Committee when he gives expression to his most agreeable attributes. </para>

                        <para>- I would not. But there is a difference between taxing them fairly and taxing them unfairly. I have followed consistently throughout the Tariff the line which I laid down at the beginning, to vote for fair revenue duties in the revenue items, and fair protective duties in the protective items. I defy any honorable senator to charge me with inconsistency. It is now proposed to charge these very high duties upon articles of absolute necessity in every household. The Vice-President of the Executive Council, refers occasionally for information to his departmental officer, who supplies it to the- best of his ability, but who in some cases does not know a great many details of how trade is handled. Will the. honorable senator, between now and to-morrow morning, ascertain the proportionate value of the towels, quilts, counterpanes, and a few other articles of absolute household&#39; necessity that come in in a finished state?They are goods in use in every workman&#39;s house, just the same as are carpets or linoleums. </para>
