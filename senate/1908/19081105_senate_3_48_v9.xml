I desire to know whether he has remembered the matter, and, if so, whether he can give me any information. </para>

                        <para>- I think that I made myself quite clear to my honorable friend on the occasion referred to. I pointed out that there was no immediate cause for apprehension because New Zealand imported only£20 worth of South African wines, as against  £22,000  worth of Australian wines. I mentioned that in the event of negotiations for a treaty taking place, the matter would certainly receive consideration. Of course, I conferred with the Prime Minister; but my honorable friend will see that nothing can be done until negotiations in regard to that and other matters are under consideration. </para>

But I desire to refer to two or three observations which have been made by honorable senators who have addressed themselves to the question. I very much regret that during the course of the debate Senators Stewart and Givens have seen fit to misinterpret the feeling of New South Wales upon the Federal Capital site question., and to insult the people of Sydney. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator says that I have misrepresented him I have the greatest pleasure in withdrawing my statement. But I certainly understood both Senators Stewart and Givens to declare that the people of Sydney, who represent New South Wales, have acted in mean, sordid, and contemptible fashion. I cannot conceive of more offensive language being applied to their attitude upon this question. Of course I recognise that the bark of both Senators Stewart and Givens is worse than their bite. But we must recollect that in this Chamber they speak in a representative capacity, and in the circumstances their references to the people of an adjoining State, who for a prolonged period have enjoyed friendly commercial and political relations with those of the sister States, are to be deplored. They appear to forget that their accusations against the people of New South Wales apply equally to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson,</inline> the ex-leader of the Labour Party, and to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> who was a Minister in the Labour Government. These gentlemen, amongst others, are thus charged by Senators Stewart and Givens with being mean, sordid, and contemptible. I repudiate the accusation levelled against them because they have endeavoured to bring about a satisfactory solution of the Capital site question. It is a pity that the representatives of Queensland in this Chamber should have seen fit to broadcast such charges, especially in view of the fact that they are unable to substantiate them. I consider that the Minister who had charge of this motion introduced it in a fair and equitable spirit. I have only one reason for finding fault with him. I refer to his interpretation of the word " reasonable " in the Premier's minute. I will not waste the time of the Senate in expressing my own view when it has been better expressed by others. I may refer to a speech made by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Nash</inline> in the Legislative Council of New South Wales on the 14th December, bearing upon this subject. He said - </para>

                    <para class="block">As to the limit which has been stated in the Constitution Act, I consider the chief guide should be the opinions which were held by those who took part in the framing of the section, and of those who spoke immediately after the section was framed, and after the decision was come to that the capital was to be in New South Wales territory, and not less than 100 miles from Sydney. A debate took place in the Legislative of this State on the21st February, 1899. It was a debate on the address in reply to the Governor's speech, and it was spoken to by the Right  Hon.  G. H. Reid, who was at the time Colonial Treasurer, and by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edmund</inline> Barton, gentlemen who took a very leading part in the bringing about of federation. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> had come afresh from making a compact with the representatives of Australia, in Melbourne to the effect that the federal capital should be in New South Wales, and that it should not be less than 100 miles from Sydney. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barton</inline> was accepted as the greatest authority in Australia upon the Federal Constitution and upon federation. I take it that there is no stronger proof to be found of what was intended by the Premiers when they met in Melbourne than the opinions of those two gentlemen; and for the information of the House I will quote what they said at the time. In regard to the 100 miles limit, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barton,</inline> now <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, said : </para>
                    <para>If the capital is a little more than 100 miles from Sydney, it will still be within a three-hours rail journey, and I take it that it will be the endeavour, however federal and however patriotic-minded they may be, of a large number of the representatives of New South Wales, and most of them, so long as considerations of position and climate are faithfully observed, to see that that capital is not placed too remotely from either Sydney or Melbourne. </para>
                    <para class="block">That was the expressed opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barton</inline> on that occasion. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid,</inline> in the same debate, expressed himself in the following manner :  - </para>
                    <para class="block">In my opinion, if I may give it for anything it is worth, the federal capital, although in a country district, will be as near as possible to the 100 miles limit. </para>
                    <para class="block">That expresses fairly well what I remember was the opinion of the general body of electors in the State of New South Wales at that time. And I might repeat that, coming fresh as it. did from those gentlemen, when the matter had been under consideration, it proves to me that the intention was that, if a suitable site could be found, complying with the other conditions necessary, on the margin of the 100 miles limit from Sydney, that site was the one intended to be chosen. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That passage shows clearly the interpretation which the members of the Conference put upon the word " reasonable." Dalgety is situated at the extreme corner of New South Wales, nearly 1,000 miles from the extreme west, and the same distance from the extreme north. Surely the Minister, does not contend that " reasonable distance from Sydney" means anywhere within the State. Honorable senators should repudiate such an interpretation. The whole agreement was in the nature of a concession. Dalgety is no doubt a healthful and beautiful place. Whilst it is not in my opinion suitable for the purposes of a Federal Capital, it is in other respects one of the beauty spots of New South Wales. The Snowy River is a lovely stream, and the site possesses qualities in respect of pure water and power with which we should like the Capital to be endowed. Persons born in the district are in physique and health superior to those born in warmer or milder climates. Experience teaches us that, throughout the world - whether in Norway, Sweden, Scotland, or even in the north of England - the finest types of manhood physically are those who are born where the climate is cold during part of the year. But it is a very different matter to expect those who have been accustomed to live in warmer or milder climates to go to a place like Dalgety at the beck and call of Ministers, and in conformity with conditions regulating the political atmosphere. Gentlemen who have reached middle life, or who are over fifty years of age, and who have been during the greater part of their career residing in Queensland or in the neighbourhood of Kalgoorlie, or anywhere in Western Australia, if planked down' in the winter months in a climate like that of Dalgety, would suffer severely. The consequence of selecting such a place would be that we should lose the services of many of our ablest politicians, who would find it impossible to live under such trying conditions. </para>

But in reply to the contention urged by the Vice-President of the Executive Council and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> that the majority of the people of New South Wales do not approve of the selection, of Yass-Canberra, I should' like to quote some remarks on the subject from articles which appeared in three of the leading newspapers of New South Wales on the day when this debate began in the Senate.

                        <para>- Of course New South Wales is interested. I ask honorable senators to imagine the absurdity of the interjection. Every elector in Australia is interested, I hope, in having justice done, and in seeing that an agreement entered into in good faith by representatives of each State at a Conference called for that particular purpose, is carried out. It will be a bad day for the Commonwealth when agreements signed by representatives of the people are repudiated by those who come after them, because they happen to hold different views. The agreement to which I refer was entered into with a knowledge that it included a concession favorable to the State I represent. It would be idle to say otherwise. Though I was not satisfied at the time the agreement was made, I feel sure that Commonwealth affairs will in every respect be advanced if the agreement is carried out in the spirit in which it was made. Let me say that it comprises, perhaps, the only condition of Federation in connexion with which the people of New South Wales feel that they have not received the justice and fair play to which they are entitled. I venture to say that it must be to the advantage of the whole Commonwealth, in the immediate future, that the people of the wealthiest and most populous State should not continue to suffer from a sense of irritation, due to a belief that they are being unjustly treated. I can sav without any misgiving that if honorable senators will rise to the occasion, and, recognising that the settlement of the's question is not for a day, but for all time,  realize that in securing the full friendship of a State like: New South Wales they will be doing that which, must be not only to the advantage of the different States, but in the interests of the Commonwealth as a whole. </para>

                    <para>. - I agree with the last  speaker  that the essential features of this question have been fully discussed. I recognise one essential and that is that the numbers are up. That is the real essential not merely in this case, but in every other. I am very sorry that this, question has been reopened. Four years ago when it was debated here every honorable senator had made a recent inspection of the various sites. He had before him all the reports and all the information which are now available. And, as I said, he also had the additional advantage of having made a personal inspection of the country. </para>

                        <para>- At that time there were only two sites in the estimation of the honorable senator, namely, Tumut and Dalgety. With him, Tumut came first, and if he could not get that site selected, he recognised that the only other site with a water supply was Dalgety. AN these things can be verified by reference to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> was also a very strong advocate of Bombala. The Southern Monaro district was the only part of New South Wales which, according to him, was fit to establish the' Federal Capital in. On this occasion I do not intend to make any reference to the previous debate, or to quote any extracts from the reports. These have been dealt with very! exhaustively, but have not made the slightest impression upon an individual senator. If one were to read the reports in favour of Dalgety from now until doomsday, it would not make the slightest impression on a member of the party sitting on the opposite side. I am satisfied that the selection of a site has been made a party question by the Opposition here. </para>

                        <para>- This is the only question on which the leader of the party has been able to round up the whole team by the crack of his whip. Even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> who has been running an independent course on nearly every other question, have been roped in. I do not think that that fact is altogether due to the crack of the whip by the leader of the Opposition. It is partly due to the crack of the whip by. the New South Wales press. Honorable senators on the other side have referred to the influence of' the Melbourne press, but undoubtedly the influence of the Sydney press is being felt by every one on that side. In my opinion, it is purely cowardice on the part of honorable senators, who really believe that Bombala or Dalgety is the best site for the Federal Capital, which allows them to come here and, for fear of provoking future opposition, vote for a site which they know is not the best. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator knows anything about my attitude, he will be aware that from the time I saw Dalgety,' Canberra, and other sites, I favoured the first-mentioned. I visited Dalgety at three different seasons of the year. It will be remembered that, with the idea of inducing this Parliament to select another site, the Government of New South Wales invited all its members to visit Dalgety in the winter time, so that it could be seen at its very worst. What was the result of that inspection? The visitors struck the most delightful weather that any one could possibly imagine - the day was equal to the finest spring day in Melbourne, in fact, equal to the most delightful day in South Australia, and higher praise than that could not be given to Dalgety. I have also had the opportunity of driving through the district for some miles. When Senators W. Russell and Sayers paid their visit, they were most unfortunate. Practically, all they know about the Dalgety site is the character of the' country over which they drove from Cooma to Dalgety, f in disagreeable and distressing circumstances. </para>

                        <para>- I know from personal knowledge that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has been a great traveller. When this question was discussed on a previous occasion he spoke in favour of Dalgety. He complimented <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith-</inline> upon his speech. He explained that it was a most unusual thing for him to compliment that honorable senator; but he could not help complimenting him on his magnificent speech in favour of Dalgety. He went on to say that he had spent a fortnight in the Dalgety country, exploring nooks and crannies, and all the rest of it, and came to the Senate delighted to advocate it very strongly as the best possible place in Australia for the Federal Capital. On that occasion he was right, and the only reason 1 can assign for his change' of front - and I hope that I am not doing him an injustice - is that he fears to reiterate his real opinion against the influence and interest of the daily press of Sydney. </para>

                        <para>- Even a gallant colonel is afraid. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell dwelt very strongly upon the fact that the land about Dalgety was not fit for intense cultivation. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> in his admirable speech - which would have convinced any one who was approaching the question with an open mind - clearly showed that part of the site of Canberra for which a water supply could be made available by gravitation, was absolutely useless for building purposes. In this Chamber there are not very many builders. I happen to be one, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is another. But any one without building experience would know that if heavy buildings have to be erected on a mass of alluvial soil, or, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> says, silt, there is no possibility of them standing. The only way in which heavy buildings could be erected on the proposed site at Canberra where a water supply would be available, would be to sink the foundations to the bedrock, a distance of 20 or 30 feet, perhaps even more, and to fill up the excavation with concrete. That would be a serious prospect to face in connexion with our public buildings. We must recollect that the decision of this Parliament - assuming that it now selects a particular site which has commended itself to a majority of honorable members in another place - will be unalterable. In that respect it will differ from our ordinary legislation, which, should experience demonstrate its unwisdom, can be repealed. In dealing with this question, I contend that climatic considerations ought not to enter into our calculations so largely as some honorable senators appear to think. Unless the climate of Dalgety can be said to resemble that of Siberia, so that it is absolutely impossible for people to live there in comfort throughout the year, I think that we may well dismiss climatic considerations from our minds. Official reports assure us that Dalgety enjoys a bracing and healthy climate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> has argued that the strongest and hardiest men and women are bred in cold climates. I quite agree with him, and consequently, I say that Dalgety is a suitable site in which to establish the permanent Seat of Government. Upon its healthy, bracing tableland, we should be able to breed sturdy Australians, who would mix their blood with -that of the residents of the warmer portions of the Commonwealth to the advantage and improvement of our race. It has been pointed out that the inhabitants of Northern Queensland are not so sturdy as is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell, who hails from one of the coldest parts of Great Britain. Yet that honorable senator fears that he would perish from cold if he were removed to Dalgety. He need have no apprehension upon that ground. I do not think that this question ought to be approached from a New South Wales stand-point. It has been argued during this debate that our aim should be to allay the irritation which exists in that State. I do not think that we should do anything of the sort. There is no real reason why we should admit that New South Wales has any right to feel irritated. The position is that that State offered Dalgety as one of the eligible sites for the Federal Capital, and this Parliament selected that site. It was only then discovered that Dalgety was too far removed from Sydney to suit the interests of that city, and consequently our choice has ever since caused its people a certain amount of irritation. We have been told that we ought to permit them to have their own way in order that this irritation may be removed. But I hold that if the interests of New South Wales conflict with those of Australia so much the worse for New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>- I would prescribe a period of waiting. This Parliament has faithfully discharged its duty under the Federal compact. It has selected a site for the permanent Seat of Government within New South Wales territory, and if that State does not choose to acquiesce in its decision we can afford to wait a while. In the meantime, it is not improbable that another change will come over the electors of New South Wales. We must remember that six or seven years ago they did not entertain the slightest objection to the selection of Dalgety. It is only recently that all sorts of bogeys have been raised in that connexion. If we wait for another seven years it is possible that by that time New South Wales will have arrived at the conclusion that the proper course to pursue is for this Parliament to select the best site available within its borders. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. It would <inline font-style="italic">te</inline> better to wait five, ten, or even twenty years, and make the right selection, than to make the wrong selection now. To my mind there are four essentials which a Federal Capital site should possess. The first is a healthy, bracing climate such as Dalgety undoubtedly possesses - a climate in which a hardy race may be bred. It goes without saying that wherever the Seat of Government may be located there will be an immense population settled within the next  .100  years. A second essential is easy access to a port which can be made a Federal port, In the near future, I hope that the Commonwealth Government will possess a navy of its own. How necessary is it, then, that it should also have a port of its own, where docks might be established for the repair and construction of ships - a port in which not only vessels for our naval defence might be constructed, but also our mail steamers. Within a very few years it is not at all improbable that the Commonwealth will be carrying its own mails and its own merchandise. Honorable senators may jeer, but I am indulging in no wild dream. Within a very few years what I have outlined will be an accomplished fact, and it will then be absolutely essential that the Commonwealth should possess a port in which all these undertakings may be carried out to the best advantage. Again, it would be to the advantage of the other States to be afforded secure, easy communication with ' the Seat of Government by sea. Then all would have an equal opportunity of supplying its wants. There should be a port within an easy distance of the Federal city. The only district which offers this advantage is Dalgety. We have been told by some of the supporters of Canberra that the New South Wales Government will very generously regard the idea of allowing the Federal Government to have access to Jervis Bay. They may even go- so far as to give us a slice of foreshore. There is nothing definite, but they will probably consider the point. But do not honorable senators know that Jervis Bay cannot be Federal territory ? </para>

                        <para>- Our experience of New South Wales leads us to believe that if there were any possibility of preventing the Commonwealth from enjoying any right, whether to Jervis Bay or any other place, New South Wales would be willing to resort to such means. Up till now that State has shown an, almost un-Federal spirit.  Her  Government have worked against the interests of the Commonwealth whenever they have had an opportunity, and or, one or two occasions have acted in an illegal manner. I consider that they were fortunate that nothing happened to them in consequence. Another advantage which senators from other States should consider to be necessary, is that the Federal Capital should be near the border of another State. T, for one, do not like the idea of the Capital being located at a place like Canberra, surrounded absolutely by State territory, where the Commonwealth authorities would be at the mercy of the State authorities for their means of access, water supply, and other requirements. For that reason it would be a very great advantage - in fact, I consider it is an essential - that the Federal Capital should be fixed somewhere near the edge of New South Wales, so that in the event of unFederal action by that State the Commonwealth authorities would have access to their Capital through a friendly State. Dalgety fills the bill in that respect exactly. It would be very easy there to secure access direct from Melbourne as well as from Sydney.. One other absolute essential is water supply. I do not propose to deal with the subject at length, because it has been thoroughly threshed out. But there is no question that the Dalgety water supply is superior to any other in New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>- I will not say that, because we have in the Northern Territory some rivers which are perhaps equal to the Snowy. But in New South Wales the only river furnishing a supply of water fit for drinking purposes, which could be relied upon, is the Snowy. Figures and contradictory reports from experts have been quoted. The latter are absolutely unreliable. But we do not need the opinion of experts regarding the water supply of Dalgety. We, who have seen it, know that the Snowy River is always running, that the country from which it derives its water enjoys almost the highest rainfall in New South Wales - I refer to the Kiandra district - and that there is no possibility at any time, no matter how great the drought, of a water famine at Dalgety. The same cannot be said for Canberra. We have at Dalgety a natural foundation for a beautiful city, a round hill in the middle of undulating country surrounded on two sides by a magnificent river, which by means of a comparatively cheap dam could be made into a beautiful sheet of water on which, the inhabitants of the city would be able to enjoy themselves. The city could by this means be beautified to a greater extent than could any other suggested site. It seems to be generally agreed that there are only two sites in the </para>

                        <para>- Does the honorable senator really think that tha fact of the Senate taking a ballot and' deciding in favour of Canberra will settle the question finally? Does he not recognise that it will be necessary to repeal legislation already in existence? Does he not realize the possibility that a change may come over the minds even of some of those who are voting for Canberra? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger himself might have an opportunity of visiting and comparing the two sites, and he may change his mind just as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> have changed theirs in the opposite direction, because the impressions that they gained on visiting Dalgety have become obliterated, and they have forgotten the beauties of one site and the disadvantages attaching to the other. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger had an opportunity of visiting the sites and making a careful examination, not only as to water supply but as to land settlement and other requirements, I believe that he, being in earnest in desiring to fix the best possible site, would probably return, and announce that he had made a mistake, and intended to alter his decision. In a question of this sort the cost is an important element. It will be remembered that in the Act of 1904 provision was made to the effect that any land that was repurchased should be obtained at its value in January of that year. That provision was inserted to prevent land speculation - the buying up of land and the re-selling of <inline font-style="italic">h</inline> at a high price to the Federal Government. What is the position in regard to Canberra? I am not in a position to know, but I think I am safe in hazarding the guess that the whole of the land surrounding Canberra which would derive an advantage from the establishment of the Federal Capital there is in the hands of private speculators ; and when the Federal Government propose to re- purchase they will have to pay a comparatively enormous price, which will add very materially to the cost of establishing the city. </para>

                        <para>- I am sorry if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> thinks that I am saying anything ill-natured of him. But I am satisfied that if he saw as much of the land about Dalgety as I did he would have recognised its value for agricultural purposes. I admit that he is a better judge of agricultural land than I am. He COUld form a better opinion of how many bushels of wheat a certain piece of land could produce than I could. But the fact remains that I know something about land. I have not lived so long as the honorable senator has done, but I have lived over fifty years in Australia, and my early life was spent in the cultivation of the soil. I have no desire to thrust my opinion down the honorable senator's throat, but I feel aggrieved to think that he did not have an opportunity of seeing what I saw at Dalgety, or I am sure he would have arrived at a different conclusion. </para>

The question might have been asked, " Why do not trees grow there?" They did not grow at Jamestown because it was swept by wind. But trees have since been planted there, and now it is one of the best wooded parts in South Australia. -There is nothing to show that the whole of the Dalgety district could not' be similarly treated. </para>

                        <para>- The mere fact that trees are not growing in a certain place is no argument to show that they will not grow if planted. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> had an opportunity of driving from Bombala to various parts of the Southern Monaro country, and of seeing some of the finest apple and other fruit trees there that he ever saw, not even excepting those grown in Tasmania. All the evidence points to the fact that the country of Southern Monaro is capable of growing everything that the residents of the Federal city could require. We have the right to repurchase land around Dalgety at the price at which it was valued in 1904, which was, I think, roughly, 50s. per acre. That is the valuation which a local resident put upon the land. The establishment of the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth in the midst of that country would increase the value of that land from 50s. to <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> or per acre, which would be a low price for fairly good agricultural land. Even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell will not dispute that. </para>

                        <para>- I say that the establishment of the Federal Capital in that country would increase the price of the land to the extent I have mentioned, and possibly even to a greater extent. As the population of the Federal Capital increased, the value of the land would continue to increase, and the whole of the increased value thus brought about might be appropriated by the Federal Government,, and devoted to providing a water supply, the erection of public buildings, and public conveniences of all kinds. If the area upon which .this Parliament has decided* for the Federal Territory were acquired, the increase in the value of the land' in the way I have described would go a very long way towards meeting the whole of the cost of providing all the necessary public conveniences. With the selection of Yass-Canberra, nothing of this kind would be possible, because land in that district is already at its top price, and the Federal Government would have to buy it at that price. The enhancement of its value by the establishment of the Seat of Government there would only be slight, and would not take effect for years to come. What the citizens of Australia would gain in the saving of taxation to cover the cost of public buildings and conveniences at the Federal Capital were Dalgety selected, would, if Yass-Canberra were selected, go into the pockets of private speculators, who bought the land with the object of holding it that they might obtain the increased value due to the establishment of the Federal Capital. </para>

                        <para>- What I mean is that in one case the land speculator would gain the advantage which in the other case would be secured by the people under the provisions of the Act which we passed in 1904. I do not think that I need detain the Senate much longer. I feel that the whole of the discussion on this motion has been useless, because, before it began, honorable senators had made up their minds. The only object which any member of the Senate could have in speaking to the motion is to place on record, as a. matter of history, his views on the question. If when the vote is taken the decision arrived at is final, the action of honorable senators will  be either admired or condemned by those who come after us, who will be either benefited very greatly or injured very seriously. If certain honorable senators feel impelled, as the result of an influence against which they are unable to contend, to vote in a direction which in their innermost hearts they know will not be in the best interests of Australia - well, I have no wish to reflect upon them, but their position is unfortunate, even serious, and I pity, rather than blame them. </para>

                    Russell has expressed. Following the honorable senator's interjection, they should, logically, take another ballot to decide whether, after all, the result of the ballot now proposed had wisdom on its side. Tt would be ridiculous to adopt such a course of procedure. Surely the honorable senator is not serious, and, if he be, he cannot have seriously considered the position before he arrived at a conclusion as to how he should vote.

                        <para>- It  was the honorable senator himself who did the sermonizing, and he has now shown that, after all, his sermon had no logical basis. If the honorable senator had endeavoured to build up his sermon, upon a logical basis, he would have seen that the fact that he happens to be a new member of the Senate is no reason why the Federal Government should depart from the constitutional order laid! down, that when a measure has become an Act of Parliament, it shall continue in force until it is repealed by the voice of those who represent the people. The honorable senator certainly never dreamt of that phase of the question when he suggested that because there are new members in the present Federal Parliament, the question should be reopened. If the honorable senator's argument were sound, it would afford a good reason why every measure passed by the Parliament in this session should be reconsidered after next session, because, in all probability, some new members will then have been returned, who, according to the honorable senator, should be given the right to say whether the Acts of the previous Parliament are Acts which should any longer be tolerated. But, to follow the course of procedure at present proposed, before doing so it would be necessary that they should take a ballot to express a.i opinion which might carry weight, but which just as likely might carry no weight at all. f agree with those who suggest that, should the question we are now discussing be settled in a certain way after the proposed ballot is taken, it will by no means have been finally settled by the Federal Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- The very fact that there have been changes of opinion, that representatives of New South Walesa - and I am not going to blame them - have never really had an opinion on this question; that is to say, have never given expression as representatives' of the State in Parliament to any definite opinion, which might be regarded as a reflex of the views of the people of the State, leads me to believe that almost insurmountable difficulties still surround the settlement of this question. I venture to say that when the matter was first dealt with by the Senate, every honorable senator approached it with a view to doing what he believed to be best in the interests of Australia. Certainly he tried to be faithful to his charge in carrying out the provision in the Constitution. That having been done, and the present departure having been sprung upon us almost like a leak in a vessel, what is the position when we come down to the practical side of the matter? Yass-Canberra - which may mean, God only knows what, for I do not - is subdivided, showing a series of suggested sites. The probabilities are that after we have made a choice of one of the sites which we see sketched on the map here, the people interested in other sites in the district will come to the Federal Parliament with a petition, asking us to review our decision once more. Surely there is no one here who dreams for a moment that New South Wales intends to cede all that territory to the Commonwealth. I do not. If any honorable senator has been so deluded as to conceive of that possibility for a moment, he is the most innocent man who ever entered the political arena. </para>

                        <para>- When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> and his colleagues have got this Parliament, to adopt the Yass-Canberra area, whatever that may mean, it is just possible that they will get down to what they call practical operations, and indicate the bit of country, which they think should be quite sufficient to satisfy the demands of the Federal Parliament. I recognise that this is an important matter, but I wish to enter a protest against its being brought before the Senate in this way. I believe that in selecting a site we shall be  laying the foundation stone of the Federation. That remark may sound strange, but so far we have been dealing with simply the preliminaries of Federation. We have been digging out the foundation, and only when we fix the site of the Capital shall we lay the real foundation stone of the Australian nation. I was rather pained to hear certain expressions which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> used. Usually, he is a very mild man. But to-day he resented very strongly the references made by some honorable senators to the representatives of New South Wales and its people. I agree with him that there ought not to be any acrimony between the people of a State and the Commonwealth. In my opinion, he exaggerated very much the position as regards some important factors in the selection of a site. If we assume that the impending vote will settle this question finallly, there are several important factors which have to be considered. I do not propose to quote from the reports of experts, as they have been quoted from year after year, for the last five or six years. I am quite sick of reading them. But there are several points that we should keep in mind. One is climate. I am' very sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> made such a statement as he did this afternoon, concerning what is one of the most beautiful parts of New South Wales. That remark is not based upon knowledge gained in a momentary visit like that which was paid by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell. </para>

                        <para>- No; I was born in a place where the climate is vastly different from that of Southern Monaro. When an honorable senator deliberately states that if the Federal Capital is established at Dalgety the climate will kill the representatives of Queensland. Western Australia, and the interior of New South Wales, I confess to astonishment. </para>

                        <para>- In the second place I think that the question of water supply ought to be always kept in the forefront in Australia, because it is one of those matters which conduce very largely to the maintenance of the public health. In the whole of Australia - not even excepting South Australia, where there are some very good rivers, and the northern part of Western Australia, where there are also some good rivers - there is not to be found a better water supply than that which is provided by the Snowy River. The land as a factor in the determination of this question has been referred to. I wonder again what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell had in his mind last night when he was giving the Senate the benefit of his great knowledge as a land expert. </para>

                        <para>- But he has not grown a crop at Dalgety. As a matter of fact, when farmers from the Old Country come to Australia they have to unlearn a great deal that they have learned. I have travelled over a large portion of Australia, and I know that a farmer who may be an expert in one part of it may be a fool in another. He may do well in certain patches of South Australia and be regarded there as an expert ; but when he settles in portions of Western Australia he will probably be unable to grow even a cabbage. For a man to assume that because he has been a farmer for fifty years in one portion of Australia he possesses an absolute knowledge of the qualifies of the soil throughout this vast continent, is the acme of absurdity. I might just as logically claim that though I am a miner, I possess an intimate knowledge of farming and sheep-raising, when, as a matter of fact, I know nothing about those pursuits. </para>

That is the whole trend of modern thought. Dalgety possesses all these essentials- </para>

                    <para>. - I should not have spoken upon this motion, but for the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> has personally attacked me as one who is under the whip of Sydney influence. It is quite true that four years ago I voted for the selection of Dalgety. Put three years since I visited Canberra in company with another honorable senator. I saw its fine soil, its fine water supply, and experienced its fine climate. In many ways, its climate is superior to that of Dalgety. After seeing these things for myself, I resolved that if the question of the Federal Capital were again brought forward, I should, in the absence of a better site, vote for Canberra I advocated its selection because it is the best site that is available. Undoubtedly, Dalgety possesses a magnificent water supply. But, according to the reports of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. de</inline> Burgh and other officers, the Cotter River is capable of supplying Canberra with a water supply of 33,000,000 gallons per day, which I contend is ample to meet the requirements of six or seven times the number of inhabitants likely to be settled at the Seat of Government for a very long time. But even this supply could be augmented by tapping other streams, so that there is an abundance of water available to meet the needs of a large population. That is a very important consideration. </para>

                        <para>- Both Dalgety and Canberra would benefit by being supplied with water by means of a pumping scheme. It has been found that a pumping scheme would be the most inexpensive way of supplying even Dalgety with water, by reason of the fact that the Snowy River is below the level of the township. </para>

                        <para>- It was never intended to supply Dalgety with water from the Snowy River, but to tap one of its affluents. ' 1 hold in my hand a telegram from a resident of Dalgety, who declares that so far from possessing a Siberian climate, the spring temperature of the Southern Monaro district ranges from 65 degrees to  90  degrees. He remarks. "No </para>
                    </talk.start>
                </continue>
                <para class="block">Siberian climate about that." He further states that to-day the temperature of Dalgety is 84 degrees. That is warm enough for any of us. But my informant does not tell me what I was told by another resident in Sydney on Monday last, namely, that only the previous week the temperature at Dalgety was 10 degrees below freezing point. That being the case, it is idle to talk about producing small fruits there. In the Canberra district, the frosts are not so severe as those experienced in Southern Monaro, whilst the temperature is about the same. It will be seen, therefore, that there is very little to choose between the two sites from the stand-point of climate. But I rose chiefly to emphasize the fact that I am not wedded to any particular site, and that I am not prepared at present to vote large sums of money to enable Federal buildings to be erected at any site we may select. I decided to support the Canberra site long before it was mentioned in the public press, and consequently I am not open to the charge of being swayed by Sydney influences. I see no objection to changing one's mind when a better site is discovered. </para>

                            says that trees would grow with cultivation. But that is different from fruit-growing. As to access from the sea, we have engineering reports which show that that access could be obtained more easily from Queanbeyan to Jervis Bay than from Dalgety to Twofold Bay. There is no doubt, also, that Jervis Bay is a finer port for extensive operations like the building of wharfs than is Twofold Bay, which is only limited in extent.
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hutchison,</inline>
                            the Chief Engineer of tramway construction, in his report, says that the distance from Queanbeyan to Jervis Bay is ninety-three miles, but the cost of a railway would be less than from Bombala to Twofold Bay, seventy-four miles, where the estimated cost would be ^1,300,000. So that there is nothing in the argument that Twofold Bay is easier of access than Jervis Bay. I also desire to-day to say that it is quite fictitious for the supporters of Dalgety to cry out that those who are supporting Canberra are influenced entirely by a Sydney microbe.

                    <para>. - At this stage of the debate I cannot hope to add anything new. But I should not like to give a silent vote on a question of such importance. Some of the honorable senators who have preceded me have indicated that I have been guilty of saying something in connexion with the Federal Capital which betrayed a change of opinion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> levelled the accusation against me that I had condemned Dalgety. But before making an attack upon me, he should have been quite sure that I had altered my view, and should not have attacked me for something which I am merely supposed to have said. I desire to say before proceeding further that not one of the sites which I have visited comes up to my ideal of what a site  for the Federal Capital should be. Therefore, I am practically forced into the position of accepting the lesser of two evils. </para>

                <para class="block">If I thought that sufficient support would be forthcoming, I should have no hesitation in voting straight out for Tooma. But I have a strong objection to Canberra. My first ground of objection is that an attempt is being made to establish a Federal city where there is not the slightest room "for future expansion. A city established so close to Sydney must for all time be merely an appanage of that place. </para>

                        <para>- Several honorable senators have praised Canberra from the point of view of the crops growing there, the splendid agricultural resources, and the possibilities of the district for closer settlement. I visited Canberra in company with a number of honorable senators, and did not see a crop of any kind in or around Canberra. What is more, there is no cultivation. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell saw a single crop anywhere in the neighbourhood of Canberra, I should be glad to know what it was, and where it was growing. We have a map upon the wall, showing a creek running through the centre of the proposed site. I never saw a creek there, because it was absolutely dry. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> has interjected about beautiful grass growing there. Let me remind him that the grass is so fine, and the climatic conditions are so good, at Dalgety that the honorable senator himself stated here, on a former occasion, that Tasmania derives its prime cattle from the Dalgety district. </para>

                        <para>- I consider that in selecting a site for the Capital of the Commonwealth we should choose a position that is not restricted, where a large population can thrive, and which has possibilities from the commercial and manufacturing point of view. That means that we must have a Federal port, under Federal control. It has been said - and I feel inclined to anticipate that before the debate closes a statement will be made by an honorable senator acting as the mouthpiece for the New South Wales Government - that the State will concede Jervis Bay to the Commonwealth for the purposes of a port. I trust that the leader of the Opposition will not make such a statement in the closing moments of the debate. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that I have said anything to Kurt the feelings of the leader of the Opposition. If so, I am very sorry. But assertions have been made in the State Parliament, and in this Chamber, that certain territory will be ceded which will make a Federal port possible in the event of Canberra being selected. I hope that, as nothing has been said on the subject throughout the debate, no honorable senator will make a definite statement about it towards the close of the debate, because that would be unfair to the Senate. But even if New South Wales does concede a port, what are the facts regarding the country between Canberra and Jervis Bay ? It is not worth anything whatever. Furthermore, we must consider the great cost of a railway between Canberra and Jervis Bay. </para>

                    <para>The harbor works and railways which would be required were the Federal Capital established at Bombala, would tend to make that the most expensive site suggested. I grant that were those railways and harbor works constructed they would not only benefit the Federal Capital, but the Commonwealth and the State of New South Wales, as they would be the means of building up a commercial city, and would give another port to New South Wales  and  the Commonwealth. In that view, it is, perhaps, not correct to say that Bombala would ultimately be the most costly site. </para>

                        <para>- I do know, something about it. I have had a look at the country, and have been over the hills at Canberra. I must admit that the city site there is a very pretty little spot. The surroundings are pleasant. If the intention were merely to look for a place for a little village, where there were to be no manufactures, no teeming population, no industries of any kind, but where there were to be merely a number of peasant farmers cultivating the soil, I should have no hesitation in voting for Canberra. It is one of the beauty spots of New South Wales. But we are looking for a site for a large city, which is to have extensive suburbs, and in connexion with which there are to be manufactures. It is to have di,ect communication with a port, and must have water power in unlimited quantities for use for manufacturing purposes. 1 do not think even the most enthusiastic supporter of Canberra would for a moment call in question tha superiority of the Snowy River over the Cotter in that respect. There is another difficulty. There are no less than eight sites marked on the map. While many senators have indicated that they want to have Canberra selected, I wish them to realize that the site indicated on the map is not the site sought to be obtained from the State Government. The State Government expert who accompanied the party with whom I visited the site said that the best site in the Yass-Canberra group was the one indicated as "J" on the plan. If that is to be the site chosen, let me say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell did not see it, because, although I took the honorable senator up to the top of a hill, he could certainly get no idea from that position of the quality of the soil at a spot 20 or 30 miles away. </para>

                        <para>- It has been stated by honorable senators representing New South Wales, and others who are very anxious to help them, that Victorian senators dare not vote for any site but Dalgety, because they have been intimidated by the scare headlines in the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> and have been led to believe that something terrible will happen to them if they do not vote for Dalgety. I want to say that I have never taken my views from the <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> I have had the courage in this Chamber to abuse the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> for things that I have believed to be incorrect. In the circumstances, to charge me with being frightened of the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> after I have condemned the views expressed in that newspaper, is rather unfair. No honorable senator representing Victoria has expressed a narrow view regarding the Federal Capital site. If one has done so, honorable senators opposite, instead of making wide and vague assertions, should indicate the particular member who has expressed narrow views and the statement about which they complain. I may be said to have no reason to te enthusiastic about the removal of the Seat of Government from Melbourne, but 1 am enthusiastic in my desire to see the Federal Parliament established in its own home. If the decision of the Senate should result in the selection of Yass-Canberra, I can say, as a representative of Victoria, that I shall place no obstacle in the way of the removal of the Seat of Government to that district at the earliest possible moment. Above any interest which Victoria' or New South Wales may have in the matter I place the necessity of the Federal Parliament being established in a home of its own, having control of its own territory, and being independent of the particular views held in various States. If there be one thing which, more than another, proves the necessity for the establishment of the Commonwealth Parliament in a territory and home of its own, it is the action of the New South Wales Government, from time to time, in connexion with this very question. </para>

                        <para>- I did not deprecate the making of charges. What I did was to defy honorable senators opposite to give a specific instance of a statement made by any Victorian representative indicating any prejudice against the establishment of the Federal Capital in New South Wales or at any place outside of Melbourne. I do not desire to continue longer. The reports have been torn to tatters. Every honorable senator is seized with the advantages and disadvantages of the various sites suggested. I wish to say that in voting for Dalgety that site would not be my first choice, but I accept it as inevitable, since it is a better site than the only alternative site left me, Yass-Canberra. In giving my vote for Dalgety I intimate my regret that I am unable to record a vote for Tooma, on the border, which I regard as the best of the sites suggested. </para>

                    <para>.- I approach the reconsideration of this matter with very great reluctance. The heat engendered, the ill-feeling created, and the atmosphere which now surrounds the consideration of the matter are not conducive to a wise -decision. 1 have never varied in my views about the selection of the Federal Capital site. Every day I believe that my views are still further confirmed. I hold that we commenced the consideration of this matter altogether too early. We are in too great haste, and having regard to the financial position, I desire to te no party whatever to the spending of money on the building of another city which we do not want. Although I am forced now against my will into choosing a site, I protest with all the earnestness that I possess that we are going ahead too fast, and do not want a Federal Capital now. I have said again and again, and I am prepared to repeat the statement from any platform, that in order to do justice to New South Wales, to carry out the spirit of the Constitution, to give us ample time to think the matter over and see where, on national grounds, we should place the Federal Capital, it would be tetter that the Federal Parliament should continue for a session or two longer in Melbourne, and that we should then remove to Sydney for twelve years, when we might talk about the selection of the Capital site. In the meantime, we could watch the trend of population and the progress of railway construction, and when we have a greater population than we have now, we should be better able to decide where the Capital should be situated, and what sort of a city we should build. I contend that there has been the most mischievous impatience and haste displayed in this matter from the very beginning. I am borne out1 in that view when I remember that it was twenty-seven years after the creation of the Dominion of Canada that the Dominion Parliament was housed in the Federal Capital at Ottawa, and that it was twenty-four years after the Declaration of Independence before the great republic of the United States established its Federal Capital in Washington. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to do nothing of the kind. Let me accentuate a fact which honorable senators do not appear to realize, and which is due to the haste and indecent impatience exhibited in dealing with this question. We have never once, when this question has been placed before us, been prepared to settle it. I make that statement from my own knowledge, and in view of the ignorance which honorable senators have displayed with regard to the various sites, not forgetting the fact that many of the members of this Parliament have not seen any of them, and the fact also that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, who is a surveyor, and knows something about land, has said in another place that hardly any of them have been sufficiently examined to enable Parliament to make a wise choice. I have been told by a dozen members of this Parliament that Tooma is the best site for the Federal Capital. That is said in the most positive way ; but it is the only site that I have not seen. I have been given no opportunity of visiting it. I availed myself of every opportunity afforded to inspect the various sites proposed, and now I am told that the one site I have not seen is the best of all. I do not know whether it is or not; but I say that we have not half the information we should have before we are asked to settle this question. Long ago I took up the position, in dealing with the proposed selection of Dalgety, that we had no business to plant our Capital in a place that was inaccessible, without first making bargains and contracts with New South Wales as to the railways which should be built, and the land to be acquired. But New South Wales representatives and others pressed the Government, and suggested that they were guilty of gross delay. As a result of the pressure, the Government commenced to act before they were ready, and before we had nearly enough reports from engineers and surveyors. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> who comes from the Green Isle, said, with all the earnestness characteristic of an Irishman, that in every singular particular, Dalgety was superior to any other site suggested. When I asked the honorable senator, "What about its accessibility?" he said. " Of course it is accessible." When the Government of New South Wales build the railway from Cooma to the Monaro. and the Government of Victoria build the railway from bairnsdale to the border, and it has been decided, after a big fight, who is to continue the line from the border to Monaro, and when we have constructed another railway from Monaro to Eden, there is no doubt that it will be accessible. Notwithstanding all this, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> says that it is accessible now. This is the kind of argument we have from the other side. I venture to say that even if my eloquent friend. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> takes a part in the debate, it will be found that the weight of argument is on this side. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> commencedby finding fault with the water supply of Canberra, when everyone knows that if there is one spot in New South Wales which is teeming with rivers and water, it is that particular spot. There are four or five different water supplies available at Canberra, and it is folly, and I might say hypocrisy, for any honorable senator to suggest that there is not available there a water supply sufficient for the requirements of  500,000  people or more. </para>

                        <para>- Does not the honorable senator remember that, from the hill above the Cotter River, we looked at the valley of the Murrumbidgee and saw the watershed which feeds that river, and also the bold distant mountains from which the Cotter River flows? From what I have heard and seen, I venture to say that in Australia there is no purer stream of running water than the Cotter River. That was one of the matters which made me think seriously of preferring Canberra. If I have to cast my vote in favour of one of these sites, I still hold to my former opinions. I believe I am correct in saying that on this question the Senate does not correctly and truthfully represent the feeling outside. I have made it my business to converse with all sorts and conditions of men - from men in the street to men in very high places - and I have not found any indication of the slightest injustice or unfairness on the part of Victoria. Two-thirds of the Victorians I have spoken to have said, " Take the Capital to Sydney and be done with it." There has been no effort made on behalf of Victoria by those who have a right to speak to keep the Federal Capital here for one hour longer than is necessary. But we all shrink, I believe that thousands of men shrink, from the financial responsibilities which are not only in front of us, but at our very doors. Do not my honorable friends believe that the questions of old-age pensions, naval defence, military defence, transcontinental railway, and other matters of that sort are of far more importance than the establishment of the Federal Capital ? </para>

                        <para>- No. My honorable friend seems to me to be suspicious that should there be any delay, some kind of trickery or dodgery, or whatever it may be called, will be resorted to by somebody to take from New South Wales a' right that is as clearly implanted in the contract as is the provision that we shall have a Senate and a House of Representatives. I appeal to his common-sense, and ask what reason he has for entertaining that suspicion ? One great reason which has led me to change my mind is that of finance. I believe that Dalgety is about the most costly site which it would be possible to select. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator "W.</inline> Russell, who read part of my previous speech, will do me justice, he will admit that at its close I showed I was impressed with the costliness of that site. But I said, " If we could build a commercial city with a railway and a port, in the future it might be the" cheapest site of all." But what is the prospect of the near future? Here we have a Prime Minister who professes that the very foundation of his policy is to people this great continent by means of immigration. But every one of the twenty-eight members in another place and fourteen senators here who keep him in office object to anything of that kind being done. They are opposed to the foundation of the Prime Minister's policy. What hope have I that a commercial city or a great city can be built up when the Government are not to be allowed to bring people to the Commonwealth? I am astonished at the attitude of my honorable friends. And even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell talked about building up a great city. Do they think that cities are built for flies to inhabit? </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The only thing which can justify the establishment of a big Federal city is an enormous scheme of immigration and the unlocking of the land. Let me carry the recollection of honorable senators back to our first picnic, when we drove from Cooma, and well do I recollect it. In order to get to Bombala we had to pass through Dalgety, and according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> the worst approach to it is the one which we took. I ask any member of the first picnicking party if we did not pass through Dalgety, bathe in the Snowy River, camp, eat, and drink by its bank? Did it cross the mind of a single person then, from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver</inline> downwards, that Dalgety was going to be' chosen as the site for the Federal Capital? No. It is most amusing now - simply because <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest has said that our first love, Bombala, is not as good a site as Dalgety - to see my honorable friends opposite work themselves into a state of enthusiasm and try to make out that Dalgety is a perfect paradise, although we saw no evidence of anything of that kind at the time of our visit. On the contrary, we saw not a tree, not a bramble, or a bush big enough to hide a rabbit, and there were granite rocks all over the place, with an inch or two of soil upon them, which accounts for the fact that there is not even a single stunted gum tree visible for 10 or 15 miles around. That is my recollection of Dalgety, and it is confirmed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell, who, I think, made a most useful speech. Passing on to Bombala we got rid of the granite rocks, the treeless and little-grassed country, and saw undulating country which was fairly well-grassed ; a very pretty township, a beautiful river and smiling homesteads. I was very much struck with Bombala; first, because there was access to a port, and secondly, because it was not in the middle of "New South Wales, but somewhere near the border of Victoria. If we intend to consider the theory of a. Capital it is better to place it between two States, if that can be done under the contract, than in the middle of a State, and to have a port than to have no port at all. Then came <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest with his great knowledge, which we all recognise, and he told us that Bombala would not do as a site, and suggested that Dalgety ' should be selected. As it was the nearest to our first love, as it included the Snowy River, as  we still thought that a port would be available, we all voted for Dalgety. I am thankful to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> for reminding me of what I said. Does not the whole of my short speech bear disappointment on its face? It discloses the very thing that I felt. I was giving up Bombala, which I liked, and driven by the superior opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest to accept a place which, in spite of the Snowy River, has no attractions for me, because I am accustomed to green trees, bushes and flowers. I am not accustomed to great granite rocks and no soft. </para>

Now I am forsaking Dalgety first on the ground that it is the most costly of the sites, and, secondly, because the financial outlook is very serious indeed. How are we going to carry out, without overloading the taxpayers, schemes of naval and military defence, provide ^2,000,000 for the Post Office, and, eventually, I suppose, build the transcontinental railway in addition to establishing a Capital? I do not know. Of all things, the establishment of a Capital ought to come last. At Dalgety, we cannot have the Capital which honorable senators have been orating about unless we have four expensive railways. Until those lines are built - and some of them cannot be built for years- Dalgety will be most inaccessible. I think that one honorable senator has made that admission, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest expressed regret that it was not more accessible. The questions of cost and accessibility are two very important factors. The next important factor - and at one time I think I put it first - is accessibility to a port. Leaving Bombala at 6 a.m., we arrived at Eden at 4.30 p.m. </para>

                        <para>- It was a beautiful drive in which we saw a few dairy farms scattered about, but the honorable senator will admit that it was most broken country. There was not one big mountain round which a railway could be taken. It was a mass of sugar-loaf hills, 500, 800, and 1,000 feet high, all jumbled together. That gave the country we drove through its beauty. Every report shows that a railway through that country would be most expensive. I do not believe that without a proper survey - not a flying survey - any engineer could estimate the cost within ^500,000. We were afforded facilities to inspect Twofold Bay. Seated in a launch we saw what some honorable senators have called an open roadstead. I think that a Court would say that, technically, it was not an open roadstead. But for practical purposes it may answer that description. We were shown that it would be necessary to&gt; build two breakwaters; in fact, to incur a.r expenditure of over /[i, 000, 000 to make the port available for snipping. It must be admitted that from the standpoint of a port, Jervis Bay is infinitely superior to Twofold Bay. It is a safe port - a port where the cost of insurance will be very small, where the warships can engage in gunnery practice, and where 30 feet of water can be obtained alongside the shore. All that we should have to do at Jervis Bay would be to erect wharfs. Further, I believe that the journey by rail from Dalgety to Twofold Bay would be 7 miles longer than would the journey from Canberra to Jervis .Bay. </para>

                        <para>- I am just coming to that. The fourth reason why I intend to change my vote upon this question is that whilst Dalgety is pretty close to the Victorian border, and whilst we should not be dependent upon any one State for access to the Seat of Government, we have now to consider what is fair and just to the people of the Mother State. Two most important points must be considered in this connexion. Upon one of these I am quite opposed to New South Wales, but upon the other I am in favour of that State. We have' been told that certain minutes of the Premiers' Conference have been unearthed which show that the intention was that the Federal Capital should not be within 100 miles from Sydney, but that it should be within a reasonable distance from that limit. When the Premiers agreed to that compromise, it had to be drafted in legal form and embodied in the Constitution for the ratification of the electors. Does any honorable senator mean to say that when that provision was inserted in the Constitution it did not accurately represent the meaning of the Premiers? I contend that it did. We have not to trust to hearsay in this matter, or to the document itself, or to any form of words. We have to consider the acts of New South Wales. We must recollect that at the very inauguration of the Federation, that State offered the Commonwealth the choice of Albury and Bombala, amongst other sites, and that she sent her Commissioner along with the members of this Parliament upon certain visits of inspection. I do not think that any; honorable senator had more chats with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver</inline> than I had, and he seemed to be quite pleased that we were favorably impressed with the claims of Bombala. In the face of these facts, and of the silence which has been maintained upon the point for three or four years, it is perfectly idle to contend that we ought now to read into the Constitution something which is not already there. Simply because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barton</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> expressed the hope that' a good site would be found within a reasonable distance of the 100 miles' limit, are we to be bound by that expression of hope? I cannot, for a moment, consider that point. . If there are two sites available, and we cannot very well make up our minds as to which is the better, and if the selection of one of those sites is absolutely opposed to the wish of the Mother State, whilst the other has . her approval,  is it unfair for honorable senators to choose the latter? Ought we to be lectured for so doing? I have abundant justification for reversing my vote on this occasion. For honorable members to talk about an insufficient water supply being available at Canberra is positively ridiculous. Has anybody attempted to forecast the population of the Federal Capital ten years after its establishment? Do honorable senators imagine that it will then be 10,000, or that in twenty years it will have a population of 20,000. The idea is ridiculous. I believe that the Federal Capital will be a small place for generations to come. We do not want another big city in Australia. We have not the people to fill it. If we had, we could put them in a better' place, namely, upon the land. There is no room for another big city in the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- Will there be any great advantage in that? Certainly not. It will interfere with certain rights which have grown up in our two largest cities. We cannot make bricks without straw, nor can we establish a big city without population. Another point which we have to consider is how much money we are prepared to spend upon the Federal Capital. Can we afford - as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest pointed out the other day - to erect a Capital as fine as that of Washington? I have had the pleasure of visiting Washington, and I say it would be ridiculous for us to attempt to build a city as fine as that. Then I would ask, " Is the Governor-General's residence to be established in the Federal Capital, and is he to be required to remain there? Do not the people of Melbourne and Sydney wish to see him? </para>

                        <para>- It is not merely a question of " society." The late Governor-General made himself familiar with every institution and good work in the Commonwealth. The people like to have the ViceRegal representative at their different meetings. Under such circumstances, are we going to require the Governor-General to reside at Dalgety or Canberra, and, at the same time, ask him to take part in our civic and industrial life ? The whole thing is a great mistake. Just as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> does not appear to trust anybody in this matter- </para>

                        <para>- Yes. When we come to select a particular site, I maintain that the conditions under which our choice is made ought to be embodied in the Act. I wish to give the Minister of Home Affairs notice that when that Act is under consideration, I shall move to insert in it the conditions under which our selection is made. One of those conditions will be that the line of railway from Sydney to the Capital shall be constructed by New South Wales. That railway will certainly be ai paying one, although it may not pay for seven years. The Bill should also provide that if this Parliament desires to obtain a portion of Jervis Bay, it shall be ceded tait. The measure should also stipulate that unless the Capital site question be finally determined, to the satisfaction of this Parliament, within two years from the passing of the Act, that Act shall be null' and void. I do not think that we want the New South Wales Government to treat us liberally in this matter. We merely desire to be treated justly. </para>

                        <para>- That is a point which remains to be considered. We should not tie ourselves up, but should make the conditions of the settlement elastic. We could do that by providing that unless the Governor- General in Council were able to come to an agreement with the Executive and Parliament of New South Wales, as to water supply, railways, and access to a port, on terms of which we could approve, our choice should be null and void. It is,  1  think, only in that way that the rights of the citizens of Australia can be safeguarded, and I am quite sure that it is the only way in which we, as men of business, and men of sense, can justly carry out the vast responsibility which rests upon us. </para>

                    <para>.. - I do not intend to prolong the debate*. because it has already lasted long enough in all conscience. I have risen partly for a selfish reason, although a justifiable one. On this occasion I shall vote differently from the way in which I voted when the matter was last under consideration, and it is desirable, in my own interests, as well for the information of the Senate, that I should give a few reasons for doing so. A great deal of unnecessary heat has been imported into the discussion. It is not a matter that need involve the breaking up of friendships, or quarrelling among parties. I am quite sure that what we all want to do is to select that site which will be the test possible one for a Capital for Australia. I cannot gee the possibility of the existence of any personal element, or interest. A desire on the part of members of Parliament representing particular localities to have the Capital chosen in the areas which they represent is natural enough. But in the Senate we do not represent particular localities at all. We represent States, and Australia as a whole. Therefore, there seems to be no possibility of our falling into the mistake of being parochial. Throughout the debate there has seemed to be a certain amount of prejudice in the minds of some honorable senators - quite honestly, no doubt - against New South Wales and her desires. If we. try to ascertain what New South Wales wants, it seems to me that the representative Parliament of that State is entitled to speak. </para>

I was referring to the unreasonable amount of prejudice in regard to New South Wales, and particularly as to Sydney. It has been stated over and over again that the desire to change the site from Dalgety to some other territory or area has been inspired entirely by selfish people in Sydney.

                        <para>- The honorable senator is surely discounting the intelligence, and, to some extent, the honesty, of some of his own colleagues in the Labour Party when he makes that' statement. There has been in reference to this subject an amount of squalid bargaining that is not creditable to Australia. Even when the Constitution was being framed the wretched parochial spirit crept in  and caused to be inserted in the bond of Union what I regard as the only real blot upon the Constitution, lt is a greater flaw than the so-called Braddon blot, because it puts on record for all time the fact that Sydney and Melbourne were so jealous of each other that one was determined that the other should not have the Capital of the Commonwealth within its area. But we have nothing to do with that feeling. We are confronted with the fact that the Constitution enacts that the Capital shall be somewhere in New South Wales. It is our duty to select what we believe to be the best site in that State. </para>

                        <para>- That remains to be seen. On a former occasion, believing that I was doing what was right, I gave my vote for Dalgety. At that time I had not seen the place. I was influenced very much by what I had read, particularly in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin.</inline> I was also influenced by the well-known fact that there is a large amount of water power available at Dalgety, as well as a permanent water supply. Above 'all, I was influenced by the fact that Dalgety could be connected with a. sea port by a railway of moderate length. Since that time, however, I have seen the site. I saw it under two totally different aspects. I reached Dalgety on a dull forenoon when the outlook was anything but inviting. Certainly, the road from Dalgety to Cooma was not such as one cares to travel over very frequently. But in the middle of the clay the weather cleared up, and I do not think that I have ever seen a clearer sky or enjoyed a more beautiful atmosphere than we experienced during the remainder of that day. I came to the conclusion that Dalgety was a reasonably good site. But I also visited </para>

                <para class="block">Cooma, and came to the conclusion that it possesses almost every one of the advantages that Dalgety has. Although it has not the Snowy River, it 'has an adequate water supply and is surrounded by beautiful scenery. I do not set myself up as an authority on land questions. But I am informed that there ate large areas of good agricultural land around Canberra, while this site also possesses equal advantages with Dalgety in regard to a sea port. It is true that Dalgety possesses a large amount of water power, but we know that with the march of modern science, the transmission of energy is a comparatively cheap thing. If we select Canberra, we shall not part with the water power in any way. Canberra is only 100 miles away from the source of the power, which can be transmitted over a copper wire j just as from the Falls of Niagara to Toronto in Canada 10,000 horse-power is transmitted over a single copper cable a distance of about 100 miles. So that we shall not lose this great source of power which Dalgety possesses. That being so, and the two areas being other- wise, in my opinion, equal, I think that the wishes of New South Wales are deserving of respect. I take- the Parliament of New South Wales as being authorized to speak on behalf of that State. To say that the State Parliament is dominated by Sydney, is to cast a reflection upon our modern system of government. We have been clamoring to give the people power, and they have the power by election. The people of New South Wales, having elected their Parliament, it has a right to speak for them. </para>

                        <para>- The New South Wales senators seem to be one and all in favour of the Yass-Canberra area, so that if the honorable senator is going to pin me down in that way, he must feel that I am justified in viewing sympathetically the choice of the New South Wales representatives. As far as Tasmania is concerned, there is no feeling about the matter at all. Canberra, being much mora accessible than Dalgety, and it being much less costly to connect by railway, possesses in those respect points over Dalgety. But what weighs with me is that the people of New South Wales, through their Parliament, express a desire that Dalgety shall not be selected, and, so far as I can judge, have expressed an equally strong feeling in favour of the Canberra district. That being so I feel justified in altering my vote,, and consider that I am doing the right thing in supporting Canberra instead of Dalgety on the present occasion. </para>

                    <para>.- I regret that I shall shortly be called upon to record a vote on this question, for the reason that I, in common with many others, thought that we had fixed the site of the Federal Capital for all time. It is somewhat remarkable that although Dalgety was approved of by a fairly substantial majority in another place, and by a very good majority in the Senate, influences should be exerted in certain quarters with a view of having another site than the people's site chosen, in order to placate a small but noisy minority in New South Wales. For a considerable period, the daily morning newspapers in Sydney have been endeavouring to create animus against the idea of the Seat of Government being located in Melbourne. In almost every issue, there have appeared misrepresentations and incorrect statements as to the advantages which cause Victorian representatives to seek to retain the Seat of Government for all time in Melbourne. When I, on one occasion, pointed out that no Victorian had a greater advantage than any other senator, that statement was not agreed to by those representing New South Wales. What has been the moving force in favour of Yass-Canberra? A certain section of the commercial world in New South Wales, aided by two powerful newspapers, the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> have enunciated outrageous propositions. To me it seems an outrageous proposition that the Federal City, which we hope will endure, should be established within a stone's throw of one of the biggest cities in the Union. </para>

The honorable senator may not have used those words, but that is in effect what he said. The statement can have no application to myself or to other members of the Labour Party, because we hold our seats in spite of the opposition of both <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Argus.</inline> Who are the Victorian representatives referred to? Probably those who are not going to vote for Dalgety. If this matter is to be decided from the point of view of .State interests, Victorians ought to vote for Dalgety. </para>

                        <para>- It was in favour of Southern Monaro, which embraces Bombala and Dalgety. Speaking as a Victorian, I say that Dalgety would be as far removed from Melbourne as from Sydney. Its selection would advance the development of a portion of New South Wales that possesses immense resources. It would create a new territory. Honorable senators should be moved to record a vote for Dalgety by the magnificent reports which have been presented by those authorized to investigate and report upon the various sites suggested. The main objection urged against 'Dalgety is that it is a cold place. But honorable senators who have visited Dalgety at various seasons of the year have told the Senate on many  ocasions  that, so far as they are able to judge, there is no better climate in any part of Australia than the climate of Dalgety. </para>

                        <para>- So far as I am concerned, there is only one party to this bargain, and that is the people's representatives in the Federal Parliament, who desire to select a site which will meet with the approbation, not of New South Wales, but of the people of Australia. It will be within the recollection of honorable senators that when Albury was suggested as a suitable site, the suggestion was scouted. Some of the people of New South Wales who took the proposal seriously were up in arms against it on the ground that Albury was too near Melbourne. For that reason, and because of other objections, Albury received scant consideration, and yet Albury is further removed from Melbourne than Yass-Canberra is from Sydney. I have mentioned the influence exercised by the newspapers. I do not suppose that in the history of Australia there has been, on the part of newspaperdom, anything like the attempt that has been made by  certain sections of the Sydney press to influence and to coerce members of this Parliament to vote for a certain site - to coerce them by making known to all the electors of the Commonwealth those who did as the newspapers told them to do. I have here a copy of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Mail,</inline> the weekly publication issued from the office of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> which has been extremely anxious to have the Yass-Canberra site chosen. This issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Mail,</inline> of Wednesday, 28th October, contains two pages of photographs, two pages of "Australia's Noblest Forty," who did as newspaperdom dictated they should do. We hear much about machine politics, but the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> have been working their machines to such effect that, in my opinion, three or four votes in this Chamber have been changed in consequence. The letterpress at the head of these pages of photographs is somewhat interesting. It is as follows - </para>

If going back upon their former choice - the people's choice - and voting, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> said last night, in favour of a site which might be called a suburb of Sydney, can be called a " stunning blow to provincialism," the pictures and names of Yass's forty deserve the widest publication. At one time it was thought that there would be little or no serious consideration given to it, because many persons in different parts of Australia felt that it would be premature, not only to select a site, but after having made a selection, to begin the erection of buildings suitable for governmental and' departmental purposes. However, so much publicity has been given to the question within the last few months that the people of Australia are commencing to realize that it is a matter of great moment to them. And every representative in favour of Dalgety is anxious to do that which he conceives to be in the best interests of the Commonwealth. The advantages of Yass-Canberra have been stated on numerous occasions. Although I have not had an opportunity of visiting the proposed site, I have perused much of the printed literature in regard to it. I have seen innumerable photographs or pictures descriptive of the country, but the pictures of Yass-Canberra pale into insignificance when compared with the magnificent surroundings and scenery of Dalgety. As regards that all-essential - water - there is no comparison between the Snowy River and the miserable trickle called Cotter Creek. </para>

Special trains, coaches, and conveyances were made available for them. Programmes were mapped out for them, and, having no bias in respect to any site, it does seem strange to me that Yass-Canberra should have received no consideration at their hands. </para>

                        <para>- I did not say that it had not been voted on. I mentioned incidentally that many sites had been visited, that nearly every member of this Parliament had availed himself of the opportunities placed at his disposal to acquire information and knowledge which would guide him in making a choice ; and that at that time, no mention, so far as I can remember, was made of Yass-Canberra. </para>

                        <para>- I have no guilt in regard to Dalgety. I voted in favour of that site before, and am prepared to do so now. The determination of this question depends upon one or two votes. Is it fair that, after the people of Australia through their representatives have approved of an Australian site, it should be relegated to the limbo of obscurity by one or more votes - votes that were not capable of being recorded when it was previously approved of? </para>

                        <para>- I am not concerned for a moment about what the members of the Labour Party in another place did. The members of that party in the Senate represent States, not constituencies, and on a question of this kind a senator can, perhaps, take a broader view than can a member of the other House. We view this question from the Australian aspect, and from no other. On the other hand, we know that as regards the other House, the representative of a district in which a site is located is anxious to gain kudos, and get as many votes as possible recorded in favour of it. The members of the Senate are only concerned about getting a truly Federal vote on this question. </para>

                    <para>. - In dealing with this motion, it is well to remind honorable senators that as far back as 1901 or 1902, a resolution was adopted by both Houses of this Parliament affirming the necessity of imposing conditions in respect of contracts carried out on behalf of the Commonwealth, and conserving the interests of those who' might be employed on those contracts. From the terms of this motion and from the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in submitting it, I take it that he desires effect to be given to the principles which we then affirmed by providing proper machinery for the purpose. If the motion is to be regarded as an instruction that a special staff of inspectors shall be created to attend to nothing more nor less than supervising the observance of those conditions in the performance of Commonwealth contracts, I think there is no necessity for it. But, speaking more particularly for the Department of Home Affairs, I wish to say that every reasonable effort has been made in connexion with every contract that has been entered into to insure the fulfilment of the conditions which were laid down by Parliament in the resolutions to which I have referred. So far as general contracts are concerned, it will doubtless be recollected, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> pointed out, that in four of the States, Commonwealth contracts are carried out by the Public Works Departments of those States. Generally, the results which have flowed from this arrangement have been very satisfactory. In New South Wales and Victoria the contracts entered into by the Department of Home Affairs are carried out directly with the Commonwealth. In .every contract entered into by or om behalf of the Commonwealth, conditions are inserted, which are precisely similar in language, tenor, and effect, to those which were affirmed by the two Houses of this Parliament in 1901 or 1902. The question then arises, " How do we know that those conditions are fulfilled by contractors? How do we know that in every instance they pay the rate of wage ruling in the district in which the contract is being carried out, and that they observe the conditions of labour which we say should surround their employes?" Well, in all contracts with the Commonwealth we provide that the contractor shall pay not less than the minimum rate of wages ruling in the district in which the contract is being carried out. We recognise that the rates of wages vary in different portions of the Commonwealth, and in different portions of the States. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Therefore, we provide that contractors shall pay not less than the minimum rate of wage ruling in the district in which the contract is being performed. In the case of particular localities, the ruling rates are specified in a schedule. But it is impossible to make that schedule applicable to every locality, and to every contract. So far as overtime is concerned, we also provide that the contractors shall pay as a minimum at least the additional wage that is payable in respect of overtime in the district in which the contract is being carried out. We further declare that the hours of employment shall not exceed those ruling in that particular district. Of course, it is necessary that some check should be imposed upon those engaged in these enterprises, in order that we may assure ourselves that the requisite conditions are being fulfilled. We recognise that those employed in the performance of Government contracts are fully cognisant of the conditions which this Parliament has decreed shall be observed, and that they know that their interests are being carefully looked after by their representatives here. To use a phrase, which was employed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in addressing himself to this motion, we necessarily trust to the employes to police the provisions of the Act. Although there may be an indisposition on their part to complain, the Department of Home Affairs has rigorously enforced the principles which have been laid down, and whenever there has been the slightest scintilla of doubt that an employer was complying with those conditions, it has insisted that before any progress payments shall be made to him he shall file a declaration made before a justice of the peace, or some other competent authority, that he has fulfilled r.ll the terms of the contract. I merely mention this for the purpose of showing what has been the policy of the Department in giving effect to the resolution which was adopted by both Houses of this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I am not in a position to say. But whether it has been followed or not, I have no doubt that it will be followed in the future. Since <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> submitted this motion, 1 have had his remarks brought under the 1 notice of the various Departments of the Commonwealth, as well as the practice which has been adopted by the Department of Home Affairs, and I feel sure that if they have not hitherto followed a practice at least as rigorous, they will do so in the future. In addition to bringing tha observations of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> under the notice of other Departments, my own Department has issued special instructions to the public works inspectors of all the States to pay strict attention to these features in connexion with every contract. As a matter of fact, they were already under an obligation to do so. I think there was no special instruction to that effect. But since the matter has been ventilated by my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> and reference has been made to departures from those conditions by contractors, we have thought it advisable to instruct all inspectors on behalf of the Home Affairs Department throughout the Commonwealth, to attend specially to these features of every contract in respect of which they are carrying out their inspectorial functions. </para>

                        <para>- In the State of Victoria that practice has been followed in. every instance, whether there has been ground for suspicion or not. I do not say that as a reflection upon the contractors in Victoria, but greater opportunities have been given to the Department to enforce the conditions in this State than were afforded in any other State. That was the only reason. If my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> will accept my assurance that sofar as my Department is concerned all reasonable efforts are being made to achieve the fulfilment of the conditions prescribed in. regard to all contracts, <inline font-style="italic">~1</inline> will go the length of saying that, provided it be understood that the motion is not to be interpreted' as an expression of opinion on the part of the Senate that a special staff of inspectors should be appointed, I see no objection to it. We can utilize those officers who are already dealing with our contracts. </para>

                        <para>- Many of the' officers are now performing inspectorial functions,  and to have these new duties intrusted to them would be no hardship. lt will be possible for us to utilize the existing officers to see that the proper conditions are fulfilled; and so long as that is understood, I have not the slightest objection to the motion, because it has been the object of the Government to see that what has been laid down by Parliament with regard to contracts shall be adhered to in regard to every contract entered into with the Commonwealth. The steps that we have taken in the past, and the steps taken by previous Commonwealth Governments, go to show that. But if the passing of the motion involved the creation of a new staff who would have nothing to do than to fulfil the functions suggested in the motion, it would mean a considerable increase of the cost of public works, and that increase would be more emphasized in regard to works carried out in the remoter localities, and especially in the smaller centres of population. </para>

                    <para>. - The resolution that has been submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> and that was supported' by him in an extremely fair-minded and able speech, is a desirable one. I agree with the Minister of Home Affairs, however, that it is not possible to create a body of inspectors for the purpose of carrying out the functions mentioned in the motion. But it is desirable that there should be in connexion with every Commonwealth work inspection, and supervision to insure that the labour conditions are observed. I know, having had a good deal of practical experience in enforcing such conditions, that there is a difficulty unless there has been <inline font-style="italic">a priori</inline> some agreement in detail.. While it should be the duty of the inspectors to see that the conditions are observed, it should also be somebody's duty to specify in detail what the conditions are". Because, in case of a prosecution, or a refusal to pay, the officers charged with the duty of inspection would have to make inquiries to ascertain what the conditions really were. It seems to me that it would be better that they should ascertain beforehand and specify in the agreement the exact conditions demanded. </para>

                        <para>- Failure to carryout the conditions is a breach of contract, and when a contract is broken, I presume that the party aggrieved may proceed for damages, or the contract may be cancelled, or a certain penalty may be enforced, or there may be a deduction from the amount to be paid to the contractor. What I wish to impress upon the Minister is that at some stage before the Commonwealth can proceed for a breach of contract, inquiries to ascertain the ruling rates must be made by some one. That being so, it would be very much better for those inquiries to be made beforehand, and specified in the agreement. Then the added security could' be given that the agreement, so far as it relates to wages and conditions of labour, should be posted wherever the work is being done, so that the persons engaged upon it might know exactly what they were entitled to. In Victoria I know that that condition was prescribed, and insisted upon, in one Department over which I had control for sometime. Of course, it was easier to do that in Victoria - as it is also in New South Wales - than it would be in some other districts, because ruling rates are more clearly defined, and, in some instances, are almost statutorily defined, here than elsewhere. We have Wages Boards, and where such machinery exists it is very easy to specify conditions as to wages. But, in any case,. it seems to me that the safer and better way is to make the conditions part of the contract in specific terms. That is to say, the Department, before a contract is entered into, should specify what the labour conditions are to be. </para>

I can see that it might not be practicable to state the conditions of work in all contracts. But after a tender had been accepted, it might be held liable to be not accepted subject to certain conditions, which should then be put into the contract. It seems to me that it would be very much better before work is done for the persons engaged upon it to have some means of knowing exactly * and specifically what labour conditions were to prevail. </para>

But I admit at once that we must, in considerations of this sort, give a little elasticity. Otherwise, we render action impossible. Wherever practicable, however, the conditions ought to be in the contract; and wherever, they are stated in the contract there ought to be an obligation to post up at the works the conditions applying to every person engaged. </para>

                        <para>- That is not before us just now. Parliament has not carried such a resolution as my honorable friend suggests. I am dealing with this question with knowledge derived from experience. I know that where Wages Boards exist, and where there is no doubt whatever about the wages ruling and the conditions to be observed, there is still very great difficulty iri compelling their observance. I can refer to one instance in my own experience, in which I learned that it was indisputable that a man had not been paid the ruling rate of wages, to the extent, I think, of  ^27.  There had been, if I may so express it, some collusion, that is to say, the man in question had not the courage to insist upon his rights. I felt that the principle involved was so important that I sought out this man, and, having found him with some difficulty, insisted upon the  ^27  being paid to him. That was only possible because the wages he ought to have received were prescribed in the contract, and, as he did not receive them, there had been a breach of the contract. I make another suggestion, arising from my experience, and it is that payment should not be made in connexion with contracts of this character until a statutory declaration has been ma'de that the conditions prescribed have been observed. Even then, of course, there will be evasion, as there would be evasion of any rule we laid down. There has been a law in operation for a very long time against the picking of pockets ; but it is still being done. All we can do in such matters is to adopt every possible safeguard against evasion, and I have taken the liberty to suggest to the Minister one or two practical safeguards which might be adopted in the carrying out of these contracts. </para>

                    <para>. - Whilst I support the motion, I realize all the difficulty of giving it effect. The suggestion put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> that the nature of the work should be defined in the contract, is a good one, because that is even more necessary than the appointment of an inspector, although such an officer might be very useful under existing conditions. In connexion with many of these matters which have come under my notice, I have found the Minister of Home Affairs and the officers of his Department very fair in dealing with difficulties that have cropped up. I ' recognise that very many difficulties are likely to arise under a condition that the ruling rate of wages shall be paid. The Minister of Home Affairs is particularly anxious that no new appointments should be made; but I should like to see at least one officer of the Department given a power beyond that of inspection, and the right to define the various classes of labour required in carrying out a contract. I might give an illustration of the difficulties to be met by a reference to a case which came under my notice, and which I have in hand at the present time. It occurred in connexion with the undergrounding of telephone wires, when the ruling rates of wages were clearly defined in the contract. Under an award given in Victoria by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Cussen at the time of the building strike, the wages of plasterers' labourers were fixed at 9s. per day. Under the Commonwealth, they were fixed at 8s. per day. I regret to have to say that the rate fixed by the Commonwealth authorities was is. per day less than the ruling rate of wages in Victoria. The contractor states that the work is labourers' work, and is paying 7s. 2d. per day. Honorable members will understand that if the men engaged in the work were to go to the contractor and make a noise about the way they are being treated, there is so much labour available in Melbourne at the present time that their positions would very soon be filled by other men. The trade union investigated the matter, and when I waited upon the officers of the Home Affairs Department, I found them inclined to agree with the contractor that the work is labourer's work. If we had an inspector with power to make inquiry, and define the various classes ot work required to be done under a contract, honorable senators will see that it would then be unnecessary for those engaged in the work to contest these matters with the contractors. I have no hesitation in saying that the fact that no officer of the Works Department is given this power is likely to be a source of trouble. We know that it is only too true that men enter into collusion with contractors. There is, unhappily,' some difficulty in getting some men to stand up for what are their legal rights under these contracts. The resolution to which reference has been made was carried because it was recognised that the men occupy a weak position, and should not be called upon to engage in an unequal contest with a contractor. We require an inspector with power to define the character of the work to be done, and then for that work the contractor should have to pay the recognised rates, and so the' men would be relieved from the necessity of a personal quarrel with the contractors on the subject of the rate of their .wages. My experience, and I suppose it is the experience of most honorable senators, is that the rates of wages ruling in the metropolis determine the rates paid throughout a State. There may be some increase given in certain districts tq meet travelling or living expenses; but men belonging to trade unions are generally able to look after themselves in that respect. I hope that the Minister of Home Affairs, and the officers of his Department, will assume the responsibility which I. believe honorable senators generally desire to place upon their shoulders, and insist upon good conditions and fair rates of wages ' in the carrying out of all contracts let by the Commonwealth. In my opinion, the power to define the class of labour which must be done in the carrying out of a contract, is more essential than the fixing of a minimum wage. Where a number of men are engaged on a contract, it would be ridiculous to have the whole staff involved in a labour trouble because there is <inline font-style="italic">no</inline> responsible officer charged with defining the nature of tEe work in which each of the men is engaged. In the case to which I have referred, the contractor, who is paying 7s. 2d. per day for what he describes as labourers' work, is willing to make a declaration that he is paying the ruling rate of wages. On the other hand, the trade union authorities are willing to make a declaration that 9s. per day is the ruling rate for that particular class of labour. There may be only half-a-dozen men concerned, but their workmates will naturally sympathize with them, and considerable delay, expense, and trouble, might be avoided by the appointment of an inspector, with such powers to act as I have suggested. I trust the motion will be carried, r.nd that the Minister of Home Affairs will consider the advisability of clothing some officer wilh power 'to define the various classes of work under a contract. </para>

                    <para>. - I can offer no objection to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> seeks to obtain by the passing of this motion. As I understand it, the honorable senator desires to take such steps as will insure that a resolution, previously arrived at by the Senate, shall be given effect. What the honorable senator proposes is exactly what we do with regard to every law and regulation we pass. We take steps, in extreme cases by the appointment of a policeman, and in other cases by the appointment of various officials, to see that the .will of Parliament is given effect. I take that to be <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> object, and with that we must all be in agreement, not merely because of a desire to see that a fair wage is paid to those who do manual labour in carrying out a contract, but quite as much in the interests of contractors who are prepared to do a fair and decent thing. For these reasons I anticipate that the motion will commend itself generally to the approval of the Senate. -I had not an opportunity of listening to the remarks of the Minister, but if I understand the position he takes up, it is that he is not disposed to at once commit himself to sanction the appointment of additional officers, but he is prepared to take steps to arrange that the  officials already concerned in the supervision of Commonwealth contracts shall have thrust upon them the additional responsibility of seeing that standard rates  of wages are paid. I have no reason to suppose that any honorable senator desires unnecessary appointments to be made merely that employment may be given to an additional number of persons, and" if the officials, to whom the Minister referred, are in a position to exercise the supervision sought by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> under this motion, I think that should satisfy the honorable senator. Let me say that I think the Minister's remarks have justified the tabling of the motion, because it is quite evident that hitherto these officials have not been in a position to exercise that supervision, or it would not now be necessary to require them to do it. </para>

For that reason I feel that the Senate is under an obligation to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> for having brought under its notice what undoubtedly has been a laxity in the administration of a rule or regulation which I am certain has its cordial support. </para>

It falls specially within the province of a practising lawyer, who is consulted at all times by companies and financial institutions in regard to important dealings under such legislation, to give help and advice about a measure of this kind. So far as I can judge, the Senate would not be justified in accepting the Bill in its present form. In the first place, its constitutionality, is not quite clear.

                            <para>- No; that deals with another matter. The scope of the Bill, I repeat, is not confined to foreign corporations and trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth, but, of course, its operation in that regard could be limited. In the second place, there is no demand for a measure of this kind at the present time. It contains a principle which is not only new and experimental, but also most debatable. The principle has not yet been incorporated in any companies law <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> Australia, and is unknown to British companies legislation; and, as I have said, it is largely experimental. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly there was the precedent of the Merchant Shipping Act. The Torrens Act was based on the principle laid down for dealing with the ownership of vessels. This measure is somewhat complicated as regards the working out of the details, and the Senate would certainly require further expert advice and assistance before dealing with it. If its principle! is a sound and good one. it should form part of a Commonwealth scheme of companies legislation. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> is aware from the Governor-General's speech, a Bill has been drafted to make the companies- laws of the States uniform. It is undesirable to legislate in a piece-meal manner on this subject. But more important is it to remember that each State has its own companies law. The companies laws of the </para>

They are drawn more or less with regard to local conditions, and embody for the most part general principles  |0f  British legislation. This measure is brought forward as a sort of plaster on the State laws, quite irrespective of their character. It is a proposal to graft on those laws a new principle, regardless of whether it will harmonize with them or not. That is not only an interference with State matters, which would be reprobated by my honorable friend in many circumstances, but also a meddling with State companies. </para>

                            <para>- If certain dividends were declared and paid over by a company, and it by that means discharged its obligations, the shareholders could, if they thought proper,, apply those dividends as they chose, even to providing for their uncalled liability; but that is a vastly different thing from what the Bill deals with. As it is made applicable to existing companies, it may amount, so far as a minority is concerned, to an adverse alteration of the memorandum and articles of association. In the constitution of a company, nothing is more serious than such an alteration. As a matter of fact, while the articles of association may be altered in the manner therein prescribed, an alteration of the memorandum of association is practically a recasting of the very basis on which the company was formed - a new agreement altogether - and it can only be done within limitation, with the consent of the Court. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. In other circumstances, they would have to go to Parliament for a variation of the kind. Honorable senators will recognise that the Bill would thus place in the hands of a majority of the shareholders of any company, the power to alter the terms of its memorandum and articles of association. Of course, the exercise of such a power might be in the best interests of the company if the shareholders were honest. But we have to guard against dishonest operations. From that stand-point, this Bill represents what is known as <inline font-style="italic">ex post facto</inline> legislation. The measure would also have the effect of altering the relationship between debtor and creditor. Let us look at clause 3. </para>

                            <para>- It is possible that that may be so. In the balance-sheet of any large financial institution the reserve fund and uncalled capital are all-important factors to creditors. Let us suppose that a financial institution advertised a substantial reserve fund, and a larger amount of unpaid capital. Upon the faith of that advertisement deposits would, probably, be made. But under this clause it would be quite competent for that reserve fund to be transferred to the payment of uncalled capital. </para>

I have already quoted clause 3 of the measure, and I can see very little difference between that clause, in its original form, and the form in which the honorable senator desires to amend it. The whole point largely turns upon the question of net profits, which is one of the most debatable of questions. How profits are to be ascertained is a problem of very considerable difficulty. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Roundell</inline> Palmer, in dealing with that question in the 9th edition of <inline font-style="italic">Palmer's Company Precedents,</inline> page 735, after referring to both the single and double account system, says - </para>

                            <para>- It may be. I am now dealing with the creation of reserve funds for a special purpose. I am endeavouring to show that under the heading of- profits there might be paid away as dividends as the apparent excess of revenue over expenditure for the year, what was really part and parcel of the capital, so that a company might be left at last without a single shilling of capital. Of course, I am putting an extreme case. But certainly, under this Bill, the capital of a company might thus be largely, if not completely, exhausted. The result might be that the so-called profits having been paid to uncalled capital, and that capital being of a wasting character, the creditor might get nothing. </para>

                        <para>Accordingly, if a company with a paid-up capital of£100,000 likes to buy, say, ten acres of coal for£100,000, and works one acre per annum, and, after paying expenses of raising the coal and of management has, say,£15,000 per annum in hand, that sum is profit available for dividend, and there is no obligation on the company to treat any part of it as capital ; and when at the end of ten years the coal has been worked out, and the £100,000 has disappeared and the capital has thus been reduced to nil, we are not to regard this as a reduction of capital prohibited by the Act. Yet it is obvious that each half-year's income includes a return to the company of part of its capital outlay, and, therefore, that the company each year pays dividend consisting in part of capital. </para>

                        <para>It is only a matter of prudence, and not of law, whether or not dividends shall be paid when the assets of the company are of less value that the original capital. And, so long as a company pays its creditors, there is no reason why, in an apparently flourishing concern, it should not go on and divide profits, though every shilling of the capital may be lost. This is entirely a question for the shareholders themselves to determine. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot say. The position was that the company sought to declare a dividend of 10 per cent., and the balance-sheet showed losses amounting to£1,367, the result of a flood which had occurred. Litigation was resorted to by one of the shareholders to prevent the distribution of the dividend in consequence of the capital having been lost. Under this Bill, after the capital of a company had disappeared, the net profits might have been placed to the uncalled capital account to protect shareholders, so that creditors would have nothing upon which to fall back. I am putting matters in an extreme form, to show what is possible. </para>

                            <para>- That is quite possible. Under those circumstances, the creditors, not being aware of the loss of capital, might, when they came to seek their remedy, find that there were no assets for them. But, as it well-known, such efforts are made by unscrupulous individuals to evade the law, that we have to legislate against them. It is not that we are legislating against the honest man at all. because the honest man would not commit himself to any action of the kind. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; I have quoted one case from <inline font-style="italic">Palmer,</inline> and have also given the name of a case where the capital being actually lost, the directors desired to pay a dividend of 10 per cent., and the Court said that it was perfectly legitimate for them to do so. It may be suggested that this is a fictitious system of trading, so far as the general public are concerned. They do not know that this ostensible profit which is being paid away is practically a payment of capital. That is the position that has to be legislated against. </para>

                            <para>- No; the argument is not in favour of the Bill. If the Bill is to be read literally, even the present reserve funds may vanish though I admit that that is not intended; but the Bill authorizes the payment to the special reserve fund of such a sum as shall be determined out of " the net profits of the company in any half-year or other period." Mark the words "other period," which might, I say, jeopardize even existing reserve funds. Honorable senators will be aware that we have frequently had before our Courts applications either for the reduction of capital or for the cancellation of uncalled capital. In those cases,  the greatest publicity must take place, and the fullest scrutiny must be made. When an application is made to the Court, the matter is referred to the creditors. Meetings of creditors are called. The Court satisfies itself in this way before it exercises a discretion as to whether, under the circumstances, the proposed reduction shall be allowed. That was what was usually done in regard to the reconstruction of companies which was so frequent in this country some years ago. The companies had to go to the Court in a public way, and the relationship of the shareholders to uncalled capital and the rights of creditors were matters most carefully scrutinized and considered. </para>

                            <para>- It might be distributed in dividends, but that is not the point. Whether it was distributed as dividends or not the uncalled liability of the shareholders would remain. The position is this. Here is money going out every year in the shape of net profits. The term net profits practically means in some cases so much capital that is being paid away - under the terms of this Bill to a separate fund - in order to satisfy the uncalled liability of the shareholder. Therefore, that profit having gone to protect the shareholder, the creditor is left lamenting. </para>

                            <para>- Under the Bill, the capital might be actually paid away into a fund to satisfy uncalled capital, and in that way the shareholder might be unfairly and unduly protected at the expense of the creditor. In other words, part of the capital might be paid into a fund supposed to be made up of profits, but which were not really profits. </para>

                            <para>- It is possible to provide safeguards to meet such contingencies, and to satisfy the Court that the capital is intact. If safeguards of that kind are properly applied, and with care, the principle may be a good one. But then I come back to what I originally said. We cannot pick out one feature of the companies law in this fashion. If there is to be Commonwealth legislation on this subject at all, it should be introduced as part and parcel of a general system of uniform legislation. This piecemeal legislation cannot be satisfactory. It is calculated to interfere with the memoranda and articles of association of existing companies. </para>

                            <para>- But it would give power to the majority to coerce the minority in a company. The minority might fairly say, " When I joined this company there was no such legislation as this." To interfere with the memorandum of association of a company in such a fashion would be grossly unfair to the minority. This is a very serious aspect of the case, and it affects the relationships of debtor and creditor very closely. I have put matters in an extreme form for the purpose of showing that in the hands of unscrupulous men the Bill might operate in a direction far different from what my honorable friend contemplates. </para>

I find it difficult" to apprehend the full purport of clause 7 of the Bill, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> now proposes to alter. He proposes to take out the latter portion of it, which I think will effect an improvement. There is another feature of the measure to which I direct attention, namely, that it provides for the creation of a kind of company within a company, and to some extent would interfere with the control by a company of its own finances. </para>

                            <para>- They are mere creatures of the directors. As to how, under those circumstances, the funds might be misapplied, I am not prepared at this moment to say. But that is a feature of the Bill that cannot be overlooked. First of all, I put it from the stand-point of a company to some extent losing control of its funds, and then seeking to continue the control by the directors, not the shareholders, keeping their finger on the trustees. How far, of course, those trustees will be influenced and controlled by the directors is a matter for subsequent consideration. The last two clauses of the Bill are of a delicate and complicated character. </para>

                            <para>- I have to deal with the Bill as I find it. I agree with the honorable senator that the clauses to which he refers are objectionable. By striking out the latter portion of it, clause 7 will certainly be improved. For the moment I see very little difference between clause 3 as it stands in the Bill and as set out in the amendment which has been circulated. As I said in the beginning, I would urge upon my honorable friend that this is not the way in which to introduce legislation of this kind. It should form part and parcel of a general scheme of legislation defining the Commonwealth law, on which upon its introduction, the honorable senator would have an opportunity of engrafting his views, the object, of course, being to secure uniformity throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>. - I received somewhat of a shock when the Vice-President of the Executive Council commenced to speak. Bearing in mind that this Bill was introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> I heard the Vice-President of the Executive Council commence with some reference to the possibility of the measure affording encouragement to fraud. It seemed to me inconceivable that anything introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> could justify the use of such terms. I listened to the Vice-President of the Executive Council very carefully, and it may be said that the honorable senator condemns the Bill upon the following grounds. First of all he says that the principle is bad. </para>

                            <para>- I understood the honorable senator to say that the principle was bad ; that even if it were good it was introduced in a bad way ; that even if it were good and the way in which it was introduced was also good, it was not desirable ; that even if the principle were good, the method of introduction good, and it was desirable, its constitutionality was in question; and that even if all these difficulties were overcome, it was still undesirable to deal with banking business in this piecemeal fashion. 1 wish to follow some of these arguments as well as I can; First of all, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> said that one objection to the Bill is that it involves a new principle. Is that going to stay the hands of the Senate in the passing of the Rill if otherwise it is shown to be a good measure? </para>

                    <para class="block">Since when has the Vice-President of the Executive Council been afraid of the introduction of a new principle? Ever since he has been in charge of the Treasury Bench he has been doing nothing else but bringing forward things - I shall not dignify them by the name of principles - which have been new and fantastical. Surely the Senate will not approve the proposition that merely because a measure embodies a new principle it is therefore to be condemned. Another objection brought forward was that the States have laws dealing with this subject, and that this measure might to some extent override or interfere with them. That is a- curious objection to be urged by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. </para>

                            <para>- What a modest, innocent little plaster this measure would be as compared wilh the enormous legislative plasters we have been placing over States laws, at the instigation of the Government, since Federation was established? This is hardly a postage stamp as compared with such an enormous mustard plaster upon States laws as our Quarantine Act. The Senate has never been restrained for a moment in the passing of a law merely because some State had already passed a law dealing with the same matter. All these objections have nothing whatever to do with the question, which after all is simply : Does this Bill seek to do something which would be advantageous? I approach its consideration from that point of view. I can state the object of the Bill, as it appears to me, very simply indeed. It is to enable shareholders to do what they like with their own profits. At present they can, if they please, pay them away in dividends. </para>

                            <para>- Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> does not consider his interjection an answer. The argument I offer applies just as forcibly whether the profits be legitimate or illegitimate. The question is whether they shall be paid away in the shape of dividends or to the special reserve which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> seeks to create. If we are to have business so badly conducted that moneys which under any legal definition may be called not profits but capital can be paid away as dividends to be. used by the ordinary shareholder as income, the position would be different. What the Bill proposes is that the profits, whether legitimate or not, instead of being paid away to the shareholders, to be spent by them as income, shall be put to a special trust account to meet uncalled capital. </para>

I admit at once that the doctrine read out by the Vice-President of the Executive Council as the decision of one of the English Judges, that a public company can legally pay away a portion of its capital under the guise of net profits, was a revelation to me. But if that might be done now, the Bill will not affect it. </para>

                            <para>- It appears to me that from the legal definition of net profits it might have been, though the money would certainly not be what a business man would understand as net profits. The decision quoted by the Vice-President of the Executive Council would uphold the contention that the difference between receipts and expenditure would be regarded as net profits, although there may have been a wasting, as in the case quoted, which was that of a <inline font-style="italic">coal mine, or</inline> a depreciation of plant, as in other cases which honorable senators will more readily call to mind, greater in value than the amount of net profits actually earned. Whether the profits called net profits are legitimate or not, and legally available for distribution, it has been shown that the power to distribute them in the way described exists  to-day, and this Bill would in no sense alter that position, nor would it add to the facilities with which that species of fraud - for I call it fraud, though the law permits it - could be perpetrated. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator must surely see that the money is put into the hands of trustees for the specific purpose of meeting the demand for payment when it arises. To continue my illustration : I am liable at any time to be called upon to meet a payment of£100. Seeing that to have to meet it at once might cripple me, I decide to put on one side every month, or to pay into the hands of trustees, if honorable senators please, a certain amount of my ordinary income until the £100 is made up, so that when the demand is presented, I shall have at hand the money to meet it. How could I injure my creditors by the adoption of that course ? </para>

                            <para>- Let me proceed to show whom it might injure. It is clear that the man who might feel a little hurt would be the shareholder. Hitherto he may have been receiving a dividend of 8 per cent. on his shares, and the directors, under this Bill, might decide to pay him only 6 per cent., and put the other two per cent. to the credit of the special reserve proposed. He might feel a little  aggrieved at first about it, but he would have the consolation that the 2 per cent, would be in a reserve fund to meet the liability on his shares which, in the event ot a banking crisis, might cause his ruin. How does the creditor of the bank stand? At present there is the uncalled capital on which he can fall back ; but let me ask any honorable senator whether he would prefer a security, under which he could make me bankrupt by calling upon me to pay up uncalled capital in respect of shares in the bank, to the knowledge that in the hands of trustees there was money safely invested to meet the whole of my liability? </para>

                            <para>- It certainly would he wrong to take it into account as part of the assets of the bank. Let us assume that the uncalled capital of the bank is ^1,000,000, and that it has a special reserve fund to meet .£500,000. It would be wrong for the bank to say that it has in reserve £1,500,000. What it has is £500,000 of a special reserve fund, and £500,000 of uncalled capital, because, in proportion as it builds up the special reserve fund, it must write down its uncalled capital, otherwise it will be making it appear that it has two assets when it has only one. I can see no possible chance of any fraud being committed in that way other than an absolutely intentional fraud, and, of course, we cannot guard against that. We may take steps to punish persons, but we cannot pass a law that no body shall at any time publish a fraudulent prospectus. Let me again apply mv argument in a personal way. If any person here is dealing with a firm and he knows that it is setting on one side a certain sum as a nest egg, or, in the language of this Bill, as a reserve fund for the purpose of meeting any claims which may arise, he will feel greater confidence in doing business with that firm. What is proposed in the Bill exactly fits that situation. It takes certain power for the shareholders of a bank to exercise if they like, but not otherwise. They can forego a portion of the profits which they are receiving, and pass them to a special reserve fund so that when a crisis arises, instead of each shareholder having, perhaps with great difficulty, and, possibly, with the prospect of insolvency, to find the money in respect of which he is liable, a special reserve fund built up with the dividends of which the shareholders had denied themselves, will be available for the purpose. Had a measure of this kind been in force when the bank crisis occurred in Glasgow many years ago, or in New South Wales, a good many individuals and a great many homes which were ruined would have been secured from the result of that crisis. </para>

                            <para>- No, they were ruined by the fact that they were liable. Many persons who had purchased shares and received dividends year after year, using them as their income, which they were entitled to do, suddenly found, when a financial crisis swept over the country, that the banks were in difficulties, and that they themselves were liable for their amount of the uncalled capital. It would have been far better for them if, instead of receiving  8  per cent. for a number of years, they had received 6 per cent., and the balance had been set aside to meet that claim ; and it would have been a thousand times better for the credit of the bank, which, instead of having to sell off household furniture and ruined persons to get its own, would have been able to look to the trustees in charge of tht special reserve fund to meet claims. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend should remember that it is proposed to have the special reserve fund in as liquid a form as we can have any profit-bearing investment. The Minister has raised the objection that it is proposed in some way to confer a special favour upon the shareholders. To my mind the Bill contains a wise provision, not only on their behalf, but on behalf of those who may have claims against them. Nothing is better to meet a demand for a sovereign than twenty shillings. Under this Bill power is taken for a bank to put aside twenty shillings to meet a demand for one pound when it is made, instead of having to run round and look for the man who owes a pound, and if he cannot pay it, sell him up through the Bankruptcy Court. For that reason I propose to support the second reading of the measure. It contains one or two provisions which, I trust, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> will see his way to amend in Committee. He has already indicated a desire to abandon two provisions which I confess I was unable to understand. There is one other proposal which I think may require amendment. Under the Bill a majority in value of shares is to determine whether or not a company or a bank shall be brought under its provisions. I am not quite certain whether it may not be desirable to require the sanction of a majority of another kind, or, at any rate, something more than a bare majority. I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> that if he will make some provision by which a larger majority will be required before the measure can be applied to existing banks it may facilitate the passage of the Bill through the Senate. </para>

If that amendment is made it will be necessary to make a similar alteration in the second part of the proposed new section. In law the word " injure " has a technical understandable meaning when it comes before a court. But " to do anything to his detriment as an employe " is rather a vague form of words to use.

Now, if the employe is to be protected from dismissal and from injury in his employment, because he is a member of an applicant organization, it necessarily follows that the same mantle of protection should be thrown about the employer under analogous circumstances.

                    <para>. - The remarks of the Minister of Home Affairs have revived recollections of the chief difficulty which confronted us when we were dealing with the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. He has indicated where the root of that difficulty lies, but he has not told us how we can get at it. In declaring that what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, he conveniently overlooked the essential fact that by providing for the imposition of a penalty upon an employer, and of a similar penalty upon an employe, he does not place both in the same position. We know perfectly well that if, by legislative authority, we inflict a fine of , £20 upon an employer, in 99 cases out of 100 that penalty can be recovered. But in 99 cases out of 100 it cannot be recovered from an employe. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps I am exaggerating a little, but we know that upon mining fields we have to deal with a very migratory population. It is practically impossible to enforce a penalty of £20 in the case of a miner who may choose to leave the service of his employer. But in almost every instance an employer has funds adequate to meet such a penalty, and, therefore, it can be enforced. When the Minister of Home Affairs talks about what is sauce for the goose being sauce for the gander, he knows that he is merely playing with words. It would be infinitely better for us to devote ourselves to an attempt to achieve something practical. There is only one way in which that can be accomplished, namely, by compelling labour organizations, as well as employers' organizations, to show their <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> in this matter. I would prefer that in the case of an employer, the penalty of <inline font-style="italic">£20</inline> should be enforceable against his organization, and that in the case of the employe it should be enforceable against his union. </para>

                        <para>- I say that it would be fair. The union should take the responsibility on behalf of its members. If we were to allow that exception, we should have the same kind of evasion as we have now. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> is keen and honest about this thing, as I am sure that he is, he will recognise that this is the great fault of Arbitration Acts. It is a perfectly simple thing, but most of us foresaw, and indicated long ago, that the penalties were enforceable on the one side, but could absolutely be ignored on the other. </para>

But we are providing for penalties, and in the one case we are providing penalties that may be enforced, whilst in the other they cannot. There is only one way of proceeding, if we are to bring arbitration within the scheme of practical legislation, and are not merely parading our hypocrisy, and that is to put into this Bill a clause which will offer to the employers the same guarantee that the penalty may be enforced against the employes, as the employes have in the <inline font-style="italic">vice versa</inline> case. </para>

                        <para>- The history of the question is a very complex one, and I do not want to argue it now. I am dealing with an essential principle of earmarking the funds belonging to the employes, through their industrial organization, for the purpose of the payment of penalties. We have not got that; and I shall vote against this clause, simply because it represents another piece of hypocrisy, by means of the imposition of penalties that are of no use at all. </para>

                    <para>. - When this Bill was before the Committee some few weeks ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> intimated his intention, as he did when he circulated the measure, of making provision to prevent an employer from penalizing an employe who belonged, not to an organization as the term organization is used in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, but who belonged to an association which was applying to be registered as an organization. Provision is made in clause  9A,  and in clause10a, which is now before the Committee, with regard to penalizing employes who are members of associations which have applied for registration, but have not been registered. But it was found that it was quite possible, in actual practice, that an ordinary penalty that would attach to those who were attempting to prevent persons from belonging to a registered organization, might be evaded in the particular period which must necessarily elapse between the intimation by an association of its intention to apply for registration, and the entertaining of its application. During that period, the body is known as an association. When it receives a certificate, it becomes an organization under the Act, and has, no doubt, all the attributes of an organization. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> knows - probably no one in the Senate knows better - how difficult it is to deal with what are regarded as unincorporated bodies. He has had experience of such bodies in connexion with mining enterprises, and is aware that the law can hardly comprehend such bodies while they are in an unregistered state, and while they are simply bodies of men voluntarily associated for their own purposes, and having practically no legal capacity whatever. lt would be an. extremely difficult matter to attach legal obligations to associations of that character. Attempts have been made in different States to endow with a limited legal capacity such bodies as that in relation to mining, and to impose upon them legal obligations. Those attempts have met with more or less success. But where success has been achieved, it has only been by providing, by a large number of clauses, a certain amount of machinery for what I might term semi-registration of a semi-organization. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons'</inline> views were to be given effect to, this would hardly be the place to do it, but we could do it with regard to organizations once they have been registered, have come properly within the ken of the law, and have imposed upon them the obligations and attributes referred to in Part V. of the Act, dealing with registered organizations, how they may be registered, the adoption of rules, and so on. I am sure that my honorable friend will see that that would be a difficult matter. </para>

                        <para>- That is the point. But it is a difficult matter also to do it with respect to these embryo organizations - which are in an embryonic stage, and which are applying for registration. This Bill is intended only to cover that  particular period, which, in any case, must be at least one of thirty days. It would be difficult to say that the funds of a body in that particular condition should be earmarked. I do not think that we could so provide by any single clause. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so, but it is a matter of very great difficulty, even by a succession of clauses, to impose obligations upon associations in that stage of their existence. . The clause which I am now moving is in harmony with clause qa, which has already been adopted. If the clause is passed as it stands, we simply put in this measure corresponding provisions to those in the existing main Act with regard to registered organizations. </para>

                    <para>. - I have no objection to offer to clause  10A,  which has been moved by the Minister of Home Affairs. I recognise that just as we penalize an employer who may dismiss an employe" because he is ai member of an association that has applied for registration, it is only right that the employer should be protected if an employe leaves his employment in consequence of the employer being a member of another organization that may apply for registration. On that" ground, it is only right that the clause should be inserted. Arbitration, as administered in Australia, is not for the benefit of employes only. 1 understand it to be for the benefit of both employer and employes. It is also intended to protect the interests of the public at large. As to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons'</inline> objection that a fine would not be recoverable from an employ^, I submit that the honorable senator's sense of proportion is not just. The organization behind an employe is on a different footing financially from an organization behind the employer. But it an employe is fined, the fine is recoverable, and, I think, is usually paid- </para>

But the organization of, say, fifty employes cannot be pitted against an organization of ten or twelve employers from the financial stand-point. Still, as I have just said, if an employer is penalized for a certain action, it is only right that the employ  should also be liable in the event of similar action being taken by him. The amount  of  the fine may be ai subject of contention, but, so far as the clause itself is concerned, I am prepared to accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating's</inline> proposal. </para>

                    <para>. - As has been explained by the Minister, a fine imposed on an employe, whatever may be its amount, bears no proportion in its effect to a fine inflicted on an employer. As a general rule, an employer would be employing a large number of men, and would probably be carrying on business in a large way. A fine of <inline font-style="italic">£20</inline> against such a man would be no punishment at all. But a fine of <inline font-style="italic">£20</inline> imposed on a working man earning <inline font-style="italic">£2 2s.</inline> per week would be more than he could pay, because such a man would probably not have <inline font-style="italic">£20</inline> to his credit at any time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> says that rather than put this on the workmen, who, he knows, could not pay it, we should put it 011 the organization to which he belongs. But the honorable senator knows that the action taken by the Government to which he was attached prevented such a thing. The unions had to register under the Act, and it is impossible to inflict a fine upon a union. </para>

                        <para>- I can refer the honorable senator to the rules of employers' associations that had not one-penny piece in their funds. There is no provision in their registered rules to meet a fine. There is provision for only a small annual fee sufficient to meet working expenses. I take the case of the federated shipowners. They have formed a new association for the purpose of registration under the Act, which they call the Commonwealth Steamship Owners' Association. Although they comprise six large firms, carrying on business on a very large scale, they have formed this new association for the purposes of registration, and it has absolutely no funds at all. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that is correct, but I read the Act differently. Parliament said that if unionists contributed funds to any political body, they should not be entitled to preference, and so they were forced into their present position. In fact, they were advised to take the course they have taken. I remember <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> laying down here the course they should take if they desired to secure preference. It was necessary that they should form new unions altogether, apart from the old political unions. </para>

                <para class="block">The object of the proposed new section is not to make it an alternative matter, for consent by all the parties or by leave of the  President,  but to make it absolutely necessary, before counsel, solicitor or agent is employed to represent a party, not only that the  President  shall give his consent to that course, but that all the parties shall be agreeable. This question was discussed at some length at the second-reading stage. I pointed out then how unjust and unfair such a provision would be in very many instances. One party, by simply refusing to assent to the representation of the other party by- counsel, attorney or agent, could prevent the Court from getting the facts in relation to a particular dispute presented to it in proper sequence, and by those who were trained and experienced in assembling for proper presentation to a judicial tribunal, a number  of facts, and dissociating them from matters which, in the minds of inexperienced persons, might seem relevant, but which were wholly irrelevant to the issues to be determined. I hope that honorable senators will see their way not to interfere with section 27 of the Act, and to leave tha matter to be determined by. the parties or the  President,  who may be safely trusted to determine correctly whether the assistance of counsel or attorney in a particular matter is required or not. I think that honorable senators will be acting wisely if they will not interfere with the section,, which I may mention was debated at very great length, both here and elsewhere, a few years ago. </para>

                        <para>. - To-day, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, who I regret is not here, laid upon the table further  correspondence bearing upon the Navigation Bill. I wish to draw attention to the fact that he did not also table the reply to that correspondence, although, on the 30th October, he promised that he would. On that date, he laid one despatch upon the table, and said - </para>

                    <para class="block">The Minister's reason for not tabling the reply with the correspondence to-day was that he thought it was fair that the reply should first reach the Colonial Office in London. In view of the fact that the Navigation Bill is before the Senate, I think that the reply ought to be placed in our hands. It may be that the Minister does not intend to proceed with the Bill; but I suggest to him that if he does, the despatch ought to be laid upon the table, in accordance with his promise of the 30th October. </para>

                        <para>. - I am not aware of the facts advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford;</inline> but if they are correct, as I assume they are, it adds another to the many instances in which the Government have evidently shown an intention to delay as long as possible placing the Senate in possession of correspondence relative to the Navigation Bill. On very many occasions, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> sought to elicit from the Government information as to the correspondence in its earlier stages. It is known to honorable senators that time after time the answers given were evasive, and that a desire was manifested to put off the presentation of the correspondence.I think that the attention of the Senate should be drawn to the matter, because it is entitled to be placed in possession of a correspondence of this character, particularly as it relates to a Bill in its possession. Certainly the Government ought not, I think, to attempt to play fast and loose with the Senate in the presentation of documents which are not only of public importance, but also of importance to us, bearing in mind that we are dealing with the Bill. </para>
