It was objected to his proposal that if it were agreed to it might be necessary to strike out the word &#34;engraved,&#34; or to add the word &#34;plain&#34; before &#34;panes.&#34; I ask the Committee to make heraldic glass free, not because it is used for church windows, but because it has been determined, on general principles, that works of art shall be outside the ordinary scope of the Tariff. I am informed that the honorable member for Angas withdrew his amendment on receiving an assurance from the Minister that the matter would be considered in dealing with exemptions. I do not know whether it has been considered, or whether - which is quite likely, because it is not very important - it has been overlooked; but I think that we should hot make this glass dutiable. </para>

            <para>- In the old Tariff there was some provision for the admission free of works of art for public institutions. A debate took place on this question in another Chamber; and on the representations, to which I have referred, being made to me after the introduction of the Tariff in the Senate, I read the report in order to ascertain exactly what took place. I do not know that the Treasurer made any distinct promise that he would endeavour to exempt this glass, but there seemed to be a disposition on the part of the Committee in another place to reject any proposal1 to that end. When the representations were made to me, I remembered that some months before I had received a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> -Montgomery, an artist in stained glass, who carries on business in Melbourne, referring to the fact that about two years before 12th .September, 1907 - the date of the letter - I was present at the unveiling of a stained-glass window at Launceston, and there expressed &#39;my pleasure and satisfaction that such stained glass windows could be made in Australia. The writer pointed out the necessity for adhering to the Tariff as it was submitted to the House of Representatives, and attached an extract from one of the daily papers published in Launceston, giving details as to this decorative art in churches. As there was some confusion in my mind as to painted glass and stained glass, I caused inquiries to be made by the officers of Customs, with a view to ascertaining, not whether a duty should be imposed, but what distinction there was, if any, between painted glass and stained glass. The following were the replies received :  - </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. P.</inline>Lironi, Little Collins street, Melbourne, states these are similar. The painting and staining is done to produce effect. Glass may be painted, and it may be stained. &#34; Heraldic &#34; is glass painted and stained. </para>
          <para>Messrs. Bryant &#38; Co., Queen-street, Melbourne, state the work of painted glass and stained glass is performed by the same workman, and is practically the same. </para>
          <para>Messrs. E. L. Yencken &#38; Co., Little Collins-street, Melbourne. - &#34;Heraldic&#34; is painted and stained glass, and is a special class of work. The work in it is limited to that subject alone, whilst painted and stained glass has a wider field and embraces &#34; Heraldic.&#34; </para>
          <para>Messrs. Brooks, Robinson and Co., Elizabeth-street, Melbourne - Painting of glass and staining of glass is the same. It may be of a different subject to &#34; Heraldic,&#34; which is also of painted and stained glass. &#34;Heraldic&#34; is confined to the subject of heraldry alone, whereas painted glass and stained glass may be used for windows to represent any subject. Painted glass and stained glass could be imported without being framed, and assembled here to represent a subject. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline>Montgomery, Alfred place, Little Collins street, Melbourne Painted glass and stained glass is the same class of work and is performed by the same workman. It is not coloured &#39;glass. It is a special work placed on glass to represent a subject. &#34;Heraldic&#34; is painted and stained glass, but ends with that subject. Painted and stained glass contains &#34; Heraldic,&#34; and is unlimited as to design. Painted glass and stained glass could be sent to Australia in parts and brought together here to represent a subject other than &#34; Heraldic.&#34; </para>
          <para>Messrs. Brooks, Robinson and Co., and. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> Montgomery - That stained glass and painted glass should be specially mentioned in Tariff item, so as to distinguish it from &#34; Heraldic.&#34; </para>
          <para>Coloured Glass. </para>
          <para>This is entirely different from stained and painted glass, and has a colour imparted to it in its manufacture and is pot glass.. There is a glass which has colours coated upon it, termed &#34; flashed &#34; glass. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Staining and painting glass are identical except as to difference in material used.. A pigment is burned into glass in painting. A stain is burned into glass in &#34; staining.&#34; The burning in of a stain occupies longer time than burning in in painting. Stained or painted glass windows fall under item 249, &#34; Panes and all glass framed with metal,&#34; 30 per cent. and 25 per cent. It seems to me that this sort of glass can be, and is, manufactured in the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- Why cannot it be made here? At any rate, it can be imported in pieces and assembled here in the form of the required design. Such work as this is, to my mind, quite distinct from a picture or a statue, which is a single original work of art, quite distinct from any replica. All that is required is to obtain the particular glass in colours, and the glass is something distinct from the design into which the parts may be subsequently assembled. There may be some originality in the design, but there is no originality whatever in the texture or the material which is used to give expression to. the design. </para>

            <para>- The only thing with which I am now dealing is heraldic glass as it appears in item 249. I should be as willing as any one to admit free any article which we could not produce here. I have gone into this matter most carefully, f have read the reports of the debates in another place, and have received representations just as strong as has any other honorable senator, but I think that it1 would be inconsistent with the Tariff and its design to protect Australian industries if we look this particular class of glass out of the item. </para>

          <para>- These windows are not made in one great piece, but in parts. The parts cannot very well be assembled in another country and the window sent here in a completed form. That work has to be done on the building where the window is to be erected. Therefore it is no concession to say that the parts are put together here. I have the greatest respect for the industry and skill of the Australian workman. I believe that whenever he gets a reasonable show to see how a thing should be done, he is capable of turning out quite as good work as is any other workman. But to say that we, in our present state of development, are as capable of turning out works of art&#34; as is the rest of the world, is to talk a lot of arrant nonsense. In the first place, we have not the artists, for it is quite as much a matter of art to produce a window of this class as it is to paint a picture or produce a statue. In the old Tariff heraldic glass was included amongst works of art, and could be imported free. If we desire&#39; to encourage the introduction of beautiful works of art, such as stained glass &#39;windows, which will be quite as educational as the Bent Tree, the Light of the World, or other pictures - and into the production of which quite as much art is put as is. put into the painting of pictures - we shall have to omit the word &#34;heraldic&#34; from item 249. </para>

            <para>- I must confess that if there is anything dismal and dreary to be found anywhere it is in a Presbyterian church. I am referring, of course, to the Presbyterian churches which I knew as a boy, before the advent of the &#34; kist o&#39; whustles.&#34; It is a principle followed in all Tariffs, whether of protectionist or freetrade countries, that works of art should be admitted free of duty, and I appeal to honorable senators not to impose on an article hitherto admitted free a duty which might be a great burden on those who wish to beautify public buildings and churches. Such public institutions are not revenue-producing, and I think we should do what we may to encourage the very laudable public desire for ornamentation of this kind. </para>

People are glad of the opportunity to educate their minds, and indulge their aspirations towards refinement by studying the various works of art, amongst which must be included the heraldic stained glass windows to be found in the glorious cathedrals and great public buildings of the Old World. In a young country like this, especially, we should be careful to do nothing which would prevent our people from availing themselves of opportunities for the study of works of art. In the early days of a young country, the settlers struggle hard to make a living, but as time goes on they have hopes of rising to better things. As they accumulate wealth, they wish those belonging to them to be given an opportunity to study what is beautiful, not only in nature, but in art. We desire that our children in growing up should be surrounded by things of beauty, that their artistic feelings may be stimulated. We know that the names of those who have produced the greatest works of art will live for ever in the memories of the people of the whole world, whilst the tillers of the soil, however worthy they may be, are soon forgotten. I suppose we have all of us had to go through something of the drudgery of settlers in a young country, and as we become older, we have a natural desire for more cheerful and beautiful surroundings. If some attempt were made to bring to this country some great work of art, in order that our people might be given some idea of what could be done in that way, I am sure that the Government could be relied upon to assist such a movement. If we could rely upon such action to enable our people to study a work of art of world-wide reputation, why should we not afford facilities for the introduction of even humbler efforts of an artistic character ? I think we should do what we can to encourage our people to ornament their public buildings and churches with works of art. I do not think we should stop at that. I should like to see our people encouraged to embellish their private houses with such treasures that their children might grow up surrounded by the refining influences of works of this kind. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">-Colonel GOULD.</inline>- I am glad that it is proposed to admit pictures and statues free as works of art; but will any one tell me that many of the glorious stained glass windows of the cathedrals and churches in the Old World are not as truly works of art as are the finest paintings or statuary ? It has been explained that this painted and stained heraldic glass is not to be confounded with ordinary coloured glass, which no one would desire to see specially exempt from duty. &#39; It should be borne in mind that there is a master mind&#39; behind the design of many of these stained glass windows, quite as truly as behind many of the great paintings and statuary. In this case the painting, instead of being put on canvas, is put on glass, and fixed in a window, the pieces being joined together so as to make a complete harmonious whole. We ought to be very careful not to do anything that may by any possibility debar works of that kind from coming into this country. We ought to do everything possible to facilitate their importation for the beautification of our national buildings. I regard our churches as national buildings in the true sense. Certainly their influence is nationally . beneficial when they inculcate taste and refinement among the people. Whether it be a great cathedral belonging to the Anglican or the Roman Catholic Church, or a church belonging to the Presbyterians, Wesleyans, or any other religious body, a building of this character which we term a House of God, fulfils a national purpose, and. never more so than when it is beautifully embellished. </para>

            <para>- But this will make the people rich - rich in ideas, giving them an opportunity of enjoying works of beauty, and of understanding the means of refinement which are open to the public in the great cities of Europe. Any man who entertains feelings of patriotism, and desires to see Australian citizens continue to live in Australia, will wish to see our cities occupying the same position as do many of the older cities of the world, where the great public buildings are rich with all the elements of refinement and culture. We want to make our country as desirable in this respect as any country in the world. This is one of the means by which we shall not only attract people to the country, but induce them to be content to make their homes, and to spend the evening of their days, here. . 1 hope that honorable senators will be well advised in regard to this item, and will regard it as affording an opportunity of spreading feelings of refinement, and of cultivating pleasurable thoughts amongst all our people, rich and poor. </para>

            <para>- If so, it is clear that my request has been submitted in the wrong way or in the wrong place. I do not want it to cover the glass upon which a picture may be placed. All that I desire is to make free from duty works of art. It seems to me that there is another paragraph in the Tariff upon which my request might more appropriately be moved, namely, item  417,  &#34; Works of art, framed or unframed, imported for public institutions or purposes under departmental bylaws.&#34; That would cover all that I want, except for the interpretation given to the term &#34;public institutions.&#34; That term has been held not to include churches. A church is not a public institution legally. I shall withdraw my request for the time being, and, when we reach item  417,.  shall move a request to add after the word &#34;institutions&#34; the words &#34;or churches.&#34; That will enable honorable senators to give a clear vote as to whether they are willing to have works of art admitted free. </para>

          <para>. - I propose to move a request that a number of articles which are free under item  256  and subsequent items be brought within that now under consideration. For . some extraordinary reason scientific glassware, although a great deal of it is now being made in Australia, has been placed on the free list. The comparative statement circulated amongst honorable senators shows that the Tariff Commission recommended that it should be free, but I have been unable to find in the report of the protectionist section of the Commission any recommendation on the subject. The instruments to which I refer are being manufactured by the firm of Messrs. J. and W. Wilson, of Brisbane, who state that if granted sufficient protection they would also be able to open factories in Sydney and Melbourne. I see no reason why this industry should not be protected as others have been. Honorable senators have received copies of the catalogue giving a list of the scientific articles made by this firm. What is generally known as standardized glassware is manufactured by it under strict Government supervision, in order&#39; to insure accuracy, the Queensland Government having been induced to frame stringent regulations, owing to the inaccuracy of certain cheap German glassware which was being imported. It will be found that a witness who appeared before the Tariff Commission stated that his firm would have to employ only fifty men to turn out all the glass- ware of this nature necessary to meet the Australian demand. That statement was made by the representative of a firm of jewellery importers which is apparently an opponent of the manufacturers I have mentioned. My information is that no less than 8,000,000 electric light bulbs alone are required in Australia, and that a supply of something like 1,500,000 cream-testing bottles, and similar vessels, is necessary to meet the Australian demand. Those figures appear to indicate that the industry is a much larger one than was suggested bv the witness. Messrs. J. and W. Wilson, who manufacture this glassware, state that - </para>

        <quote>
          <para>If there is a protective duty imposed on those articles, we are ready to extend our works, increase our plant, and provide employment for a large number of persons. If all the scientific glassware required in the Commonwealth was manufactured in the Australian States, it would give direct employment to over 2,000 people. Provided we get sufficient protection, we are in a position to engage extensively in manufacturing, and will start factories in Sydney and Melbourne, and give employment to our own people instead of to foreigners, giving Australian boys a chance to become good artisans instead of growing up unskilled. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>There is only one other point to which I desire to allude. It will probably be said that we ought to allow scientific instruments to come in free as they are used largely for educational purposes. To that argument I would reply that there is nothing to prevent our providing that scientific instruments used for educational purposes shall be allowed, under departmental regulations, to come in free. But, as a matter of fact, many scientific glassware instruments are in common every-day use on the dairy farm, the sugar factory, and many other industries, and I base my claim for the protection of this industry on the ground that they are now being accurately and satisfactorily made in Australia, under what is practically Government supervision. It is true that the industry has been in existence for only about twelve months, but I understand that the head of the firm has had something like fifty years&#39; experience in the manufacture of scientific glassware. The firm availed themselves of the opportunity to give evidence before the Tariff Commission in support of their demand for protection. Industries in other parts of Australia are protected, and I fail to see why honorable senators should overlook this one, and neglect to give it the protection extended to others. The Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Telegraph,</inline> which is an anti -Federal, and, generally speaking, a free-trade newspaper, in its issue of 4th December, . 1907, urged that whilst industries in and around Melbourne - &#34;near the central tyranny,&#34; as they describe the Seat of Government were protected, those in more remote parts of the Commonwealth, such as the scientific glassware industry of Brisbane, were neglected. </para>

          <para>. - I listened with a good deal of interest and pleasure to the remarks which were addressed to the Committee by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway.</inline> They seem to indicate that the constant repetition of protectionist arguments by members upon this side of the Chamber has not been without effect. I have also read some of the representations which have been addressed to members of this Parliament by the Brisbane firm to which the honorable senator has alluded, lt appears to me that that firm has made out a very good case. The very excellent catalogues with which it has supplied honorable senators serve to show that it has entered upon an industry of considerable dimensions, and one which should receive encouragement at our hands, because the policy of protection should be applicable to the industries of all the States. </para>

But I would point out to him that, in order to achieve his purpose, it will not be necessary to add the articles enumerated in his request to this item, because some of them are already included in item 256, and others in item 448. Item 256 specifies as free a number of appliances which are generally regarded as scientific apparatus, and item 448 enumerates a number of similar articles which are admitted free. If these articles are eliminated from the items in question, they will cease to be admitted free, and will fall automatically under item 253, &#34;Glassware n.e.i.&#34; The Government will offer no opposition to a request being made to the House of Representatives to remove these appliances from the free list. </para>

            <para>- No. When I was requested to move that these marbles should be placed upon the free list, I consulted the largest glass manufacturer in Victoria, who told me that although he made glass-bottle marbles, the facts were as they had been represented to me by other manufacturers, adding that he had no desire to in any way curtail the use of glass-bottle marbles by the smaller glass manufacturers of the Commonwealth. &#39; I think that that was very generous conduct on his part. He added that if a duty were levied upon these marbles, and he required all that he produced, the smaller manufacturers would immediately say that he declined to supply them because he did not want them to get any business. Seeing that one factory in Great Britain or Europe could manufacture all the glass-bottle marbles required by the whole world, I think that they ought to be placed upon the free list. The manufacturers themselves are agreed upon this question- </para>

As a matter of fact, some of the glassware now imported comes into Victoria at about1s. a dozen. The Australian manufacturers cannot find a market for some of their own glassware of this kind, although they are prepared to sell it at 2s. 6d, to 2s.10d. a dozen.

            <para>- I am willing to make the duty 35 per cent, on all. The manufacturers of the glassware I have specified say that without duties of 35 per cent. (general Tariff) and 25 per cent. (United Kingdom) their industry will be seriously affected. The wages in Australia are at least 100 per cent. higher than those in Germany. The hours of work are much longer in that country, and this Australian industry, while it is not being strangled, is, at any rate, struggling. The protection I propose will give an additional impetus to industries established in two or more States, and stop the importation of a lot of glassware at such low prices that the Australian manufacturers cannot compete with it. </para>

          <para>. - Whilst, following the general design of the Tariff, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> was right, in view of his statements, in proposing to make these articles dutiable, I can only express surprise that he was not content with the same rates as he has just assented to upon articles of a similar manufacture in item 253 - 25 per cent. and 20 per cent. If the honorable senator had proposed those duties in this case I should have let the. proposal go, because it would have squared with the general design of the item, from which the Committee had not dissented. But when he proposes a 35 per cent. duty instead of 25 per cent., I must ask the Committee to. join with me in opposing the request. The honorable senator is again too grasping altogether, or, at any rate, those who are moving him are too grasping. This industry is already established, and the honorable senator ought to show us that an additional 10 per cent. is necessary ; but he has told us a very little about the matter ; and his demand is so excessive as to make opposition imperative. </para>

The first intimation I received that any request of the kind was to be proposed was a moment or two before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> rose, and it was in the form of a notification from the Department, that the desire was to have duties of 35 and 25 per cent. on globes, and chimneys for lights, and tumblers.

I have it upon the authority of two of the largest firms in Sydney that the locally-made plate, whilst excellent for ordinary purposes, lacks the clearness essential for high-class photographic work, and that therefore they have to use the imported article. </para>

So far as the local glass manufacturers are concerned, the duty cannot be worth much; but I ask honorable senators whether they think it desirable to handicap the photographic business, and to discourage a pleasant occupation like camera work, by an impost of this kind. </para>

          <para>.- The Tariff as introduced into the House of Representatives imposed duties of 5s. 6d. and 5s. per 100 superficial feet on polished and patent plate not exceeding 7 superficial feet per plate, and of 8s. 3d. and 7s. 6d. on that exceeding 7 and not exceeding 1.2 superficial feet per plate. But as it was represented that those duties would impose a severe tax on glass used for the making of photographic dry plates, they were struck out,  and  polished  and  patent plate up to 25 superficial feet made free on and after 4th December last. I have asked the Customs officials to ascertain what course the Department is following in the matter. </para>

          <para>All the above articles can  be  made here ; we are making and repairing them every day, but only of special design, as  the free  importation prevents us from manufacturing- in large numbers the stock patterns. There is no reason why this work should not be all made here; it is work that would prove congenial to Australians, being light and clean, with nothing unhealthy in the occupation. Provided we get sufficient encouragement we are in a position to engage extensively in manufacturing, and to extend our works, increase our  plant,  and give employment to our own people instead of to foreigners, giving our boys a chance to become good artisans instead of growing up unskilled, only to increase the number of casual employes, and we assume that if all the scientific glassware required in the Commonwealth was manufactured in the States it would give employment to over 2,000 hands. </para>
          <para class="block">We are of opinion that the evidence contained in the reports of the Tariff Commission is misleading where it says that fifty hands could manufacture tail the scientific glassware required in the Commonwealth. This witness could not possibly have been including the making of incandescent electric lamps, of which there are  8,000,000  required annually throughout the Commonwealth. If those lamps were made in the States it would give direct employment to 700 persons and indirect employment to many more. </para>
          <para>Another item I will select to show the importance of this industry is dairy glassware, comprising milk and cream testing bottles, pipettes, burettes, measures, &#38;c. Of the milk and cream testing bottles alone there are millions required annually by the butter and cheese factories, dairy farmers, milk vendors, technical colleges, schools, <inline font-style="italic">&#38;c,</inline> throughout the Commonwealth, and as our dairying industry develops so will the demand for dairy glassware increase. </para>

I do not wish to labour the matter any more, but when we come to the next item I shall have something else to say. I remind honorable senators that gas analysis apparatus, arsenic testing apparatus, and tubes, and evaporating basins, are all used by wealthy corporations such as gas companies. I consider that the articles which they use are just as proper subjects for protective taxes as are articles used by any other people in the Commonwealth.

          <para>.- We discussed this matter this morning at some length. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> proposed to include the articles referred to in his request in a separate item, and to make them dutiable at a certain rate. It was pointed out that the Government had no objection to this proposal, as the honorable senator . showed they were being produced in the Commonwealth, but he was advised that the best course to adopt would be simply to move their omission from item 256, when they would come automatically under 253, Glassware, n.e.i., and be dutiable at the rate provided for under that item. </para>

          <para>. - Honorable senators are necessarily under&#39; very great disabilities when called upon to deal without notice with requests referring to articles with even the names of which they are not familiar. I am not opposing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway&#39;s</inline> request, but I point out that we have been falling into the habit of adopting requests without any other information than that put forward, through a. member of the Committee, and, no doubt <inline font-style="italic">bond fide,</inline> by an individual firm. I have to-day been asked to vote for two or three requests with little or no information, and without knowledge as to how far they have been justified. I make the suggestion that it would greatly facilitate the work of considering the Tariff if honorable senators would endeavour to give the earliest possible notice of their intention to move requests, and especially such as involve the creation of new items. . </para>

          <para>. - The Minister proposes, to exempt bottles that contain goods that are not subject to <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty. Is that really what is meant? Why is this distinction drawn between <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> and specific duties? If the Minister will look into the matter he will see that the proposed amendment goes either too far or not far enough. We have agreed to the imposition of a duty on empty bottles, and it would be consistent with that to provide that bottles imported containing non-dutiable goods should bear the duty, as from the point of view of the Customs they would for all practical purposes be the same as empty bottles. The Minister now proposes the insertion of a proviso which imposes a duty on bottles imported containing goods subject to only one form of duty. Surely if there is anything in the proposal at all it should cover all bottles containing dutiable goods. For instance, assuming that we have imposed a specific duty on oil, if it is imported in bottles the duty is levied on the bottles as well as on -the oil, but under the Minister&#39;s present proposal if the duty imposed on the oil were an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty no duty would be charged on the bottles in which it was introduced. That does not appear tome to-be reasonable. I submit that the words to be inserted should be &#34; containing goods not subject to duty.&#34; </para>

          <para>. - I think the  proposed amendment, if carried, would be more consistent. Where goods subject to an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty are imported in bottles, the value upon which the duty is collected is that of the bottles and their contents. On the other hand, if a gallon of a certain kind of oil subject to a certain fixed duty were imported in a bottle, the duty would be levied on the contents, and the bottle would escape duty. </para>

            <para>- No. Suppose there are 100 separate bottles coming in, each containing a gallon of a certain oil, dutiable at a specific rate. The Customs do not estimate the value of those bottles to assess the duty. But if the duty were <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> the Customs would assess the value of the bottles as well as the contents. . It is just to equalize matters that I propose this request. In connexion&#39; with every <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty the value of the bottle is counted in. An individual bottle may be of little value, but if there are several hundred bottles the value is calculated in the value of the imports, and pays 30 or 35 per cent., as the case may be. </para>

          <para>. - I hope <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will not press his amendment on my request. Articles come into the Commonwealth in bottles, some of which are subject to <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty and some to specific duty. In order to assess the duty payable where the duty is <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> the value of the bottles will always be counted in. But my honorable friend&#39;s proposal, if carried, would mean that if goods subject to specific duty were imported the bottles would not be dutiable. But, as a matter of fact, the. bottle could not escape paying duty when it contained articles subject to <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty. It would pay duty at the particular <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate applicable to the contents. When bottles come in containing articles subject to a specific duty, why should they be exempt? Is it not much more reasonable that they shall pay duty? If my request be adopted, bottles, flasks, and jars containing goods not subject to <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty - that is, containing- no goods at all or goods taxable under specific duty would be subject to duty at this prescribed <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate. We do not propose to separate the bottle from the contents where the contents are subject to <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty and impose a uniform duty upon the bottle, but the bottle&#39;s value will still be counted in, and the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate levied on the total value. But we provide that with regard to all other bottles, including bottles containing goods subject &#34;to specific duty, these rates now before us are to be the rates. Otherwise the bottle duties would be evaded by sending in bottles containing articles subject to specific rates of duty. </para>

          <para>. - I cannot withdraw my amendment, especially after listening to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating. His</inline> contention might be a sound one if specific &#34;duties had been fixed without any regard to the value of the products <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> which they are levied. But although they are levied on each individual article, I still venture to say that these specific duties have, in theory at any rate, been fixed with some regard to the items to which they attach. Assuming that a specific duty has been fixed with some regard to the value of the article, it is to all intents and purposes an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty made a specific one for convenience of collection. That is the simple and sole reason for specific duties in most cases- the ease with which the duty may be collected. We have fixed an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty on oil. Under the Minister&#39;s proposal, when oil comes in bottled, the bottle will pay no duty. But if to-morrow we decided to convert that <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty into a specific duty, the oil and the bottle both would have to pay duty. It does not seem to me that there is any reason in that. If duty is collected upon oil upon an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> basis, the bottle comes in free, but the same bottle having the same contents would, if we charged a specific duty, pay duty. I propose to press my amendment. </para>

          <para>. - I have a request to move in respect of paragraph  a,  under which bottles up to and including a capacity of five fluid drams are free. In most cases the State laws for the regulation of trade are so lax that a bottle with a fluid capacity of only  5  or  6  drams is often foisted on the public as containing 8 drams, or, in other words,&#189; ounce of some liquid. The  5-dram   bottles, which are admitted free, so nearly approach in size the 6-dram bottles that it is probable their free admission will be availed of by many persons to practise on the public the fraud I have mentioned. I am aware that these smaller bottles can be manufactured in Australia, but the demand for them is not large enough to warrant our placing a duty upon them. But, with a view to preventing  5-dram  bottles being sold to the public as containing&#189; an ounce of fluid, I should like the capacity of bottles coming under paragraph  a  to be reduced to  4  drams. If that course were adopted, there would be no possibility of bottles containing only  4  drams of liquid being sold as containing&#189; an ounce. The State law of Victoria prevents such practices, but I do not think that there is any restriction in this regard in the other States. I, therefore, move - </para>

          <para>. - The object which my honorable friend has in view is an excellent one, but I do not think that the method by which he seeks to achieve it would be effective. His contention is that some persons practise the fraud of passing off  5-dram  bottles of medicines or other liquids as containing an ounce, and that this would be obviated by making  5-dram  bottles dutiable. If the duty were sufficiently high there might be something in his contention. At present bottles with a capacity of up to  5  drams are free, whilst the duty on bottles of a capacity of over  5  drams, and not exceeding  10  ounces, is only one-twelfth of a penny each, so far as imports from the United Kingdom are concerned. If this fraud is practised, then the vendors of liquids, in the event of the request being agreed to, could choose between saving one-twelfth of a penny on every bottle or the value of the extra dram or two which the larger one would contain. It does not seem to me that they would hesitate as to their choice. They would sooner pay the duty on the 5-dram bottles, and sell them as containing&#189; an ounce, because of the higher price which they could charge. One way of checking such a practice would be to make bottles with a fluid capacity up to  6  drams free. That would remove the temptation to use the 5-dram bottles. </para>

            <para>- If they are using 5-dram bottles for the purpose of putting  up what is foisted on the public as 8 drams of fluid - and with all due respect to the honorable senator, I have some doubt on the point - by compelling them to use 4-dram bottles we should enable the public to detect the fraud. It would be better, however, to enlarge the size of the bottles that may come in free of duty. If that were done, the fraud would be much less serious than it now is. I have, however, another suggestion to make. I do not think we should endeavour to provide by means of varying duties for regulations of this kind ; but if it is thought desirable by means of the Tariff to check such practices, it would be better to declare that these bottles should have stamped upon them their fluid capacity. That would be a more effective way of attaining <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s</inline> object. Many bottles have now stamped upon them marks, lettering, the names of manufacturers, and so forth, so that there would be no difficulty in giving effect to my suggestion. </para>

I do not think that an alteration with respect to the fluid capacity of these small bottles, which are admitted free, would effect the desired result. As has been pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> the duty on bottles exceeding a capacity of 5 drams is only1&#189;d. per dozen under the general Tariff, and1d. per dozen in respect of the United Kingdom. I hope that the honorable senator will not press his request. </para>

It is considered that the duty of 2d. per dozen on quart bottles, and of 1&#189;d. per dozen upon pint bottles, should be abolished. On still wines imported in bottles a higher duty has been imposed than upon still wines imported in bulk, so that provision has really already been made for a duty on the bottles or packages. </para>

It seems that there is such a multiplicity of excuses for getting at the pockets of the people under the Tariff that it is very little use to put forward anything like valid reasons against the imposition of a duty. In the matter of sparkling wines, which can be imported only in bottles, a still higher duty is in operation. </para>

          <para>. - The Minister of Home Affairs informed the Committee a few moments ago that the fixed duties agreed to in respect of the previous paragraph represented, approximately, <inline font-style="italic">advalorem</inline> rates of  10  per cent, and  7&#189;  per cent. If that be so, it seems strange that he should now propose duties of  25  per cent, and  20  per cent. upon bottles of a slightly larger capacity. If a  10  per cent.&#39; duty be sufficient to levy upon bottles over  10  ounces and not exceeding  20  ounces fluid capacity, surely it is not necessary to impose  25  per cent. upon bottles of two or three times that capacity. I should like the Minister to consider whether he cannot accept a lower rate in respect of the new paragraph. </para>

But if. we limit paragraph  d  to bottles of  60  ounces, bottles and flasks of a greater capacity will include stone jars, large flasks, and demijohns , which it would be ridiculous to make dutiable at  2&#189;d.  per dozen. A duty of  25  per cent, under the general Tariff, and of  20  per cent, under the Tariff for the United Kingdom has been suggested, in order that these rates, may harmonize with the duties imposed upon glassware n.e.i. and earthenware n.e.i. </para>

          <para>. - The natural protection in the shape of freights,&#38;c., on the smaller wine, beer, and spirit bottles was calculated to amount to about 130 per cent., and yet the Government would not agree to make the duty on those articles lower. But on these bigger vessels, the natural protection must reach 500, or 600, or even 1,000 per cent. Surely, then, the Government will not be so obstinate as not to yield to us to some extent in this instance? We have agreed, although unwillingly, to an enormous protection on the great bulk of the bottles that come in, and surely the Government in this case might temper the wind a little to the shorn lamb. </para>

          <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> asked me a little while ago at what rate the specific&#39; duties on paragraph c would work out. Roughly, they are equivalent to 10 per cent, (general Tariff), and 7&#189; per cent. (United Kingdom) <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem.</inline> Similarly, in the case of paragraph  b,  the fixed rates are approximately equal to per cent. and41/3 per cent., while, on paragraph  d,  they are 14 per cent. and11 per cent. Now in paragraph  e  we come to vessels containing 60 fluid ounces and upwards. Only a minimum is fixed in this paragraph. The vessels may be of unlimited capacity. There is a bigger range of contents in this case than in any of the preceding items, and so we propose duties of 25 and 20 per cent. Although the freight charges referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">&#39;Senator Gray</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger may be very heavy, those honorable senators have overlooked the fact that the vessels have costly contents. The freight charges must be debited to the contents as well as to the container. . Therefore, the natural protection on the vessels is not nearly so great as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger calculated. These duties will operate on demijohns , stone jars, and vessels of that kind. In the circumstances, in relation to the duties which have already been agreed to, the rates I now propose are not disproportionately large. </para>

          <para>- The proposal to bracket glue and gelatine is a commendable one, because the Customs Department, and business people generally, find it difficult to determine when a substance ceases to be glue and commences to be gelatine; but, unfortunately, the effect of the Minister&#39;s proposal would be to make glue dutiable at  2d.  and1&#189;d.. per lb. instead of at <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rates of  30  per cent. and  25  per cent. As some glues are worth from  30  per cent, to  100  per cent. more than others, the proposed change will largely increase the duty on the lower qualities of glue. I intend, therefore, to oppose the request, with the object, if it be defeated, of moving a reduction in the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rates. </para>

            <para>- Of course, there are other classes of gelatine of very high grade, used for confectionery and so forth; nevertheless, under an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem.</inline> duty gelatine may be imported as cheap glue, and it would be much better to have a &#39;specific duty. I am not now speaking as to the rate of the duty, but merely supporting the grouping of these similar articles, and placing a difficulty in the way of fraudulent importations by means of misrepresentation as to the nature and value of the article. The glue industry is no small one in Australia  -  I may say that it grew up in New South Wales without the aid of any duty - and it is peculiarly applicable to a country which raises such large herds of horned stock. To all intents and purposes it is a primary &#39; industry, inasmuch as it provides for the profitable use of that which would otherwise be waste products. </para>

          <para>. - I have been furnished with some information concerning the duty on glue, and it appears that there is a conflict of opinion among those interested in the industry. I have received a letter from an agent, who wants a high duty on glue, but a man who is engaged in the trade in Sydney writes - </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Glue is manufactured in South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales from raw materials obtainable entirely in the Commonwealth. Glue making is generally only a department in larger works, tanneries, &#38;c, and although such works employ lar,ge numbers of hands, yet it glue making alone there cannot be more than from fifteen to twenty hands employed throughout the Commonwealth. Glue making was firmly established in South Australia and New South Wales before the imposition of any Tariff. The cost of importing is high owing to bulk, &#39; and the &#34;natural protection &#34; therefore amounts to about 20 per cent. The duty handicaps the following trades :  - Cardboard box-makers, bookbinders, and furniture manufacturers, glue being one of their raw materials. The Barton Government imposed a duty of 2d. per lb. (equal to 60 per cent.), whereupon prices rose enormously; but when the House of Representatives reduced the duty to 20 per cent. the price of colonial glue fell from &#163;45 to&#163;34 and of imported glue from &#163;58 to &#163;38 per ton. </para>

            <para>- Considering that the writer is in the trade, I take it that he knows what he is writing about. Honorable senators on the other side often say that the imposition of a duty does not increase the price of an article, but here is a manufacturer deliberately saying that it does. He continues - </para>

        <para> When the duty of 2d. per lb. was imposed, a combine was formed and the price fixed at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4$,</inline> about&#163;13 per ton advance on previous Sydney price. The House of Representatives reduced the duty &#34; on and after the 21st February, 1902.&#34; Next day the combine collapsed, and the price fell as above mentioned. </para>
        <para class="block">That is, I think, clear evidence that if we impose a duty of 2d. per lb. users of glue will have to. pay from <inline font-style="italic">&#163;15</inline> to &#163;20 a ton more for their- supplies. I received this letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. P..</inline> J: Firth, of Darlington, near Sydney. I can only quote to the Committee the information which he has supplied to me and, I believe, to other honorable senators. He is a manufacturer, and I do not think that he is likely to make a statement which any one could refute here. </para>

          <para>If the Senate be averse to placing glue on the free list T suggest  a  duty of 20 per cent, on foreign and 10 per cent, on British glue, which would tend to help the Scotch and English glue manufacturers ; in any case at least 10 per cent, preference should bc given, .not 5 per cent, as passed by the House of Representatives. </para>

        <para class="block">He means to say, and from what I have heard I believe, that British glue is the best which can be used. If we impose a duty of so much per pound, it will force persons, to a great extent, to use an inferior glue in making furniture and other articles. In view of the small number of persons engaged in the glue-making industry, there is no necessity to impose a high duty, if we want people to get the. benefit of the best glue which can be obtained. The best&#39; class of glue which is made in England should be admitted at a lower duty than the poorer class of glue which is made on the Continent; and I should like to see the duty made high enough to keep the latter article out of our marker. I am&#39; quite prepared to support the imposition of a duty on glue, and, although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Firth</inline> wants it to be admitted free, I think that his suggestion to impose a duty of  20  per cent, in the general Tariff, and of  10  per cent, in the- preferential Tariff, should meet the views of &#39;nearly every one. </para>
