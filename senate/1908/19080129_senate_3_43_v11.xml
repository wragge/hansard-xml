          <para>- Either the Tariff is to be a sensible business-like one or it is not. In ray opinion, the Committee might very well have some explanation as to why this departure is made in the history of Australia. If there were any mischief to be remedied, or if there were any anticipation of any importations, there might be some justification for the introduction of an item of this sort into the Tariff. But at present there really is not. Therefore I would ask the Minister in charge of the Tariff to give the Committee some reason why we should have embodied in the schedule a series of duties which, in respect to the suggested importation of animals for the purposes of the food of the people, do not seem to be required. The duties are intended to apply to animals, except horses, imported for purposes of food, not to those imported for stud purposes. Why those animals which have hitherto been free should now be made subject to an import duty I cannot understand. Therefore I should like to hear from my honorable friend what the reason is. If there is any reason the Committee will be in a position to consider it, but in the absence of a reason it seems an idle thing to insert a duty of this description in a Tariff. </para>

          <para>. - In the first' place my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> memory is at fault when he says that a duty of this kind is imposed for the first time in the history of Australia. As a matter of fact we had similar duties under the old Victorian Tariff. Therefore it is not a new duty so far as Australia is concerned. I admit at once that circumstances have been altered in that connexion, but in the old State days in Victoria we had what was called a Stock Tax. As regards these particular duties I ask honorable senators to remember at the outset that animals for stud purposes are specially exempt. The duties apply to an industry that essentially pertains to Australia. </para>

          <para>. - The item itself naturally presents itself to one as very much in the nature of a chip in porridge. Looking over the return of imports, one is perhaps rather surprised to find that  11,000  sheep were imported into Australia last year. But those who have any knowledge of what has been taking place are well aware of how that came about. The animals imported were largely composed of sheep for stud purposes imported principally from New Zealand, and consisting of those breeds generally known as. British breeds, towards which the attention of Australian graziers has been largely directed of late. But I venture to say that whether the duty is imposed or not, no importations worthy of the name can take place, except for stud purposes. Consequently the item simply encumbers the Tariff. It is merely a question of whether it is worth while to remove it. It will have the same effect whether it remains or not. As to the statement of the Vice-President of the Executive Council that the duty will have the effect of giving the Government better control over imported stock - I altogether deny it. We have our quarantine laws in force in regard to all stock that is imported. Those laws should be efficacious, especially in view of the recently passed Act. It seems to me to be foolish to say that this duty is essential to give control where that control is already ample and sufficient. I can only re-affirm that it does appear to me to be immaterial whether the duty remains or not, except that it is absurd to load up a Customs Tariff with duties which must be inoperative. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON (South Australia)  [2.44].  - I am very glad to hear what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has said as to this duty.  His  observations have entirely demolished the suggestion of the Vice-President of the Executive Council that it is one that ought to be imposed by any serious minded Legislature for the purpose of securing control over imported stock. That is not the purpose for which we are framing this Tariff. Let us understand the principles upon which the Tariff is being framed. We are not here to frame regulations for the purpose of keeping out diseased or infected animals. That is not what we are doing at all. We have passed a Quarantine Act for that purpose. The Vice-President of the Executive Council was, I think, very hard driven for an argument in support of this duty when he sought to mix up the obligation which rests upon us under this Tariff to secure revenue and protection for Australian industries - as some honorable senators think - by dragging into it also matters as to securing control, by way of regulation, over the importation of cattle. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has rightly pointed out that this duty is an absurdity in every sense pf the term. It is not merely, as he put it, over-loading the Tariff, but it is putting upon the Tariff a line without rhyme pr reason. I asked my honorable friend, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, to give a reason for it. He has failed to do so, except that it is designed to meet a contingency - a contingency which, however, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has said, does not exist except in imagination. This country never can, in all human probability, be in the position of having to import its meat and live cattle. But if that situation ever arose, honorable senators must see that we should be imposing duties upon the food of the people at a time when, except for importations, they would be starving. If Australia were ever brought to the position of not having sufficient meat to feed its own people, that would be a contingency which my honorable friend is going to provide for by this duty. At such a time a section of the poor people of this country, with perhaps not one shilling to rub against another, and to  buy  meat with, are to be taxed to the extent of this duty - an amount which, of course, will by the time the meat reaches the butcher's shop be far more than that stated in the schedule - in order that the Government may secure control over importations ! I venture to say that we ought to have some regard for the purposes for which we are framing this schedule. We are framing it for two purposes. One great purpose, as many of my honorable friends think, is to encourage and assist native industries. That is protection. We are also framing it with a view to securing revenue, because this is our only source of revenue. But we are not framing it for an absurdity. We are not compelled to provide for a contingency so remote that it has not even a chance of arising. I also wish to point out that both sections of the Tariff Commission, the freetrade section and the protectionist section alike, unanimously recommended that these animals should be free. Really our Tariff, with its 949 or 1,000 lines subject to duty, might very well be spared this line, which consists of four subdivisions, in regard to an importation in respect of butchers' meat that, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, has never taken place. Because that is what it comes to. There is no suggestion that there is any possibility of  importations  taking place to interfere with the production of Australia. If there is one thing in Australia that is cheap, as a rule", it is, fortunately for us, our beef  and  mutton. Certainly Australia offers no temptation to people in other lands to  send  beef and mutton to us. In all probability theirs  would  be inferior to ours, because I believe that the beef and mutton of Australia are equal if not superior to anything to be found anywhere else in the world. Therefore there is no temptation for people abroad to come here to compete with us practically at our own game. </para>

If it is not, then it must be an attempt to secure more revenue. It would not produce much, but even if it would, why should we impose a revenue tax on sheep which may possibly form part of our meat supply? I fail to see why we should vote for a tax on sheep or cattle, and I hope we shall show that we have not a perfect mania for taxation by voting against this duty. </para>

          <para>. - Probably the amount of the duty proposed in the case of paragraph  a  was partly responsible for its acceptance by a majority of the Committee. It may have a strong fascination for the Government, who may imagine that a time will come when a duty of half-a-sovereign on horses will be valuable. But such a duty as this cannot serve anything like the same purpose. It violates the recommendations of both sections of the Tariff Commission, it has not been asked for by a single pastoralist throughout Australia, and I doubt whether the wildest imagination could suggest any useful purpose that this duty of 2s. a head on sheep will serve. We might as well impose an import duty on coals at the port of Newcastle. If there be any administrative purpose likely to be served by the imposition of these duties, we should be told what it is, but when we ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council why these duties are imposed, we get only the woman's answer " Because." It will be a reflection upon the wisdom of the Committee if honorable senators permit these duties to remain in the schedule. </para>

            <para>- I do not suggest that the Ministry have been seized with a fit of lunacy in proposing this duty, but that there must be some reason why a duty of 2s. per head should be imposed on sheep and 5s. per head on pigs , I hope that reason will be forthcoming since the difference in the duties proposed on sheep and pigs cannot, I think, be justified unless, perhaps, by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, who knows the mind of the Government on the matter. </para>

        <para class="block">I maintain that the duty upon horses is also a blot upon the Tariff, and consequently ought to be removed. If we regard any of the live stock enumerated in this item from a protective stand-point, I take it that our object is to encourage their breed in Australia. For this purpose it is proposed to allow horses for stud purposes to be imported absolutely free. There is no country in the world which requires less" coddling " in the matter of the breeding of horses than does Australia. It is the country of horses and of horsemen. There are no finer horsemen in the world than Australians, simply because Australia is the country of the horse. It is also the country of the sheep. </para>

I recognise that we are not here to discuss abstract questions of free-trade and protection, and I am not going to discuss them. But items of this kind can be introduced into the Tariff only on one or other of the grounds of revenue and protection, and surely we ought not. to make fools of ourselves". What will be said of us if we put lines of that sort in the Tariff? It would be just as absurd to put a tax on wool or, as one honorable senator suggested during one of the divisions, a tax on kangaroos. There would be more reason for that because kangaroos are becoming depleted in Australia. If we could give to the people of Australia or our outside critics any sensible reason for imposing this dutv I should at once give way. But we cannot. Let us deal with the thing rationally. </para>

            <para>- I refer to both. According to the experts at the Port Darwin Gardens, it has been demonstrated beyond doubt that that part of the Northern Territory is eminently suitable for those plants ; and, as a protectionist, I believe in encouraging industries whenever an opportunity presents itself. The fact that an industry is in its early infancy is no reason for not giving it encouragement. The Vice-President of the Executive Council pointed out that the present duty, while it gives additional revenue, holds out a hand to those who desire to enter into the industry ; but, in my opinion, the duty is not sufficient inducement. </para>

        <para>Of 25  per cent, on all the consumers of sago and tapioca. What an uproar there would be if the duty were translated into an income tax or a land tax. Those who consume sago and tapioca, and therefore pay the duty, are largely persons with small incomes, and the larger the household the greater the amount of. duty paid, because these articles are food for children as well as for adults. Even if the duty were protective, it would not be right to increase the price of articles of food by  25  per cent., and that, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley's</inline> showing, will be the effect of this duty. Whether sago and tapioca are produced in Australia or elsewhere, all who buy those articles will, under the Tariff as it stands, have to pay  25  per cent, more for them. I hope that the majority of the Committee will refuse to impose such burdensome taxation on the people of the Commonwealth as is proposed in connexion with this and other items. </para>

          <para>. - I shall oppose the request, and shall support a proposal for placing sago and tapioca on the free list. I am impelled to do this largely by the reasoning of the leader of the Senate, who, when urging <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> not to insist upon increasing the duty, said, in effect, that if he saw a prospect of the production of sago and tapioca in Australia, he would be ready to impose a high protective rate upon them. If I had the remotest hope of the production of sago and tapioca in Australia in the near future, I, too, should be prepared to vote for a higher rate. But having no such hope, I not only oppose an increase, but am ready to put these articles on the free list. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> says that the duty is not a revenue duty; but every one who looks the matter fairly in the face must see that its only effect will be to increase the revenue by taking a large amount of money out of the pockets of the consumers of sago and tapioca. Taxation upon the food of the people is not a right source of revenue. When evidence is presented to us that an effort is about to be made to produce either sago or ta.pioca in Australia, I shall be prepared to alter my attitude on this matter, but until then, I shall vote to place both articles on the free list. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON (South Australia)  [3.46].  - We are being asked now to tax one of the few luxuries of the very poor, because sago and tapioca, or, at any rate, the first-named, are used more extensively on the dinner tables' of the poor than on those of the rich. It. has been shown that the rate proposed is equal to  25  per cent, on the value of these articles, so that the effect of the duty will be that every poor struggling woman who wishes to make a sweet dish for her children will have to pay  25  per cent, more for the sago or tapioca composing it than would have to be paid if there were no duty. We are apt to view these matters in too casual a way. A duty of <inline font-style="italic">hd.</inline> per lb. may in itself not appear to be very much, but it, with similar duties, means a good deal to women who have to make their husbands' earnings go as far as possible to give food and clothing to their children; and the poor man's family is oftener larger than that of the rich man. I do not wish to enter now into an abstract controversy on the subject of protection; but I should like to know why, if the production of sago and tapioca in Australia is so imminent, provision was not made in the Bounties Bill for the encouragement of the industry. </para>

            <para>- I might have done so had the evidence adduced been satisfactory ; I supported other bounties. In any case, I would much rather support a bounty paid by contribution out of the general taxation than a duty falling chiefly on the food of the poor. I think that the views put before the Committee by Senators Lynch and Henderson are unanswerable. No attempt has yet been made to answer them. I am as much a revenue tariffist and as strong a freetrader as ever I was. There never was a mandate from Australia to impose duties of this kind.

It is a very strange thing to hear any honorable senators who never would give a helping hand to increase the direct taxation, crying out about a revenue Tariff and talking about an impost upon the poor working man and the poor woman with a number of children to support on a small income. That is really arguing the merits of taxation and not this Tariff at all. No doubt it is done for the purpose of influencing the Committee. </para>

            <para>- Apart from that, I want to point out that there is even more to consider than the actual item before the Committee. When the Tariff Commission were endeavouring to make recommendations which, in their opinion, would be of value to Parliament, they did not take every item by itself, but regarded the items as a whole, and tried to make one item fit in with another. The poor woman with a large family does not need to purchase either tapioca or sago, because for her children she can make a bread pudding, which is a very wholesome food and a very good substitute. If there -is no chance of getting tapioca or sago, surely there is a possibility of getting bread. The Tariff includes two other items which are natural products of Australia, and the production and use of which may be affected to a certain extent by a larger consumption of tapioca and sago. I hold that arrowroot and cornflour can and certainly will be produced and manufactured in the Commonwealth. senator  Trenwith. -  They are being made here. </para>

No doubt the Tariff Commission had taken all these points into consideration when they unanimously recommended that the duty should remain as it was. So far as the poor woman and her children are concerned, I have no fear but that until such time as sago and tapioca can be produced here she will use Australian articles as nourishing as the imported articles. </para>

        <para>Queensland and the Northern Territory to vote for his amendment is not one to which I shall fall a victim. I intend to support the duty as it stands. It is .not a new tax, and is recommended bv both sections of the Tariff Commission. Other industries have grown up and are growing up which might be affected very seriously if tapioca and sago were admitted free. In my opinion the duty is not excessive but reasonable. It is doing good to other industries, and in time to come it may have the effect of promoting the growth of tapioca and sago in Australia. I shall vote against an increase of the duty. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colonel NEILD</inline>(New South Wales)  [3.58].  - I feel it my duty to oppose the amendment to increase a duty which falls more directly upon the poorer classes than upon the rich. Neither of the two items can possibly be regarded as a luxury, and particularly are they consumed by young children. When we hear so much about the decline of the birth-rate,, I do not thank that we, as a branch of. the Legislature, should adopt a fiscal proposal which, though it may have no effect upon the number of children coming into the world, may have a good deal to do with the bringing up of healthy children and keeping of .them in the world. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator must have meant his statement for a joke, because he has too high a reputation for common sense for any one to suppose that he spoke then in sober earnestness. But when te emits a joke of that description, it would be kind on his part to announce the fact, so that we might know where to laugh, because we do not always know when to take him seriously. I cannot vote for the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline> I shall be very much more inclined to vote for making free of duty an article which is most unquestionably required in the diet of small children; and which, if it has any merit from an Australian stand-point, should have been included in the Bounties Bill, so that the burden might be borne by the whole community instead of by the comparatively poor. </para>

I have just looked up the importations of sago during the last five years. In  1902  we imported  15,939  centals, at a cost of  £3,779,,  or at  4s. 6d.  per cental. In  1903  we imported  12,727  centals, at a cost of  £5,012,  or at about  4s. 6d.  per cental- </para>

            <para>- Undoubtedly something caused that phenomenal rise in the price, and if my honorable friends who are so anxious that the poor and their children should get their commodities cheaply are really in earnest here is an opportunity for them. If the reason given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> for the scarcity of sago be correct, namely, that it is due to the drought in India, surely it is the duty of the people of Australia to give such encouragement to growers in our own country as will cause the local production of this commodity. In  1902  the cost of sago was  4s. 6d.  per cental. In  1906  it was  15s.  per cental. So that so far as this commodity is concerned we are evidently at the mercy of the weather in India. . </para>

            <para>- If the figures which I have quoted are not reliable what is the use of them ? What have we a Statistician for if we cannot depend upon his statistics? We pay him a good salary ; but he is evidently getting too much if we cannot rely upon his figures. In 1906 the imports were 5,150 centals, and the cost was £3,793, or about £20 more than we paid in 1902 for 15,000 centals. I wonder whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> can explain that discrepancy. So much for sago. Let us turn to tapioca. In 1902 we imported 43,000 centals, which cost £18,000; in 1903 44,000 centals, costing £17,000; in 1904 56,000 centals, costing ,£24,000; in 1905 63,000 centals, costing £28,000 ; in 1906 60,000 centals, costing £42,000. The price kept up at about the same level  until the year 1906, when it jumped up from 8s. per cental to about 14s. Last year we spent about £50,000 in importing sago and tapioca. The quantity of tapioca imported in 1906 was 60,000 centals, and of sago 5,000 centals. The import of sago evidently went down because of the price; or- probably the scarcity caused by the drought in India explains the decreased importation. In any case it appears to me that this is an industry that it is worth while for us to establish in Australia if we can. Both tapioca and sago are tropical products, which I believe can be produced in Northern Australia. Why not make an attempt? If we double the duty it will probably have the effect of causing the attempt to be made. </para>

            <para>- I do not care what the protection was. If a duty does not protect, I have no use for it. So far as I am concerned, there will be no halfhearted measures in connexion with this Tariff. If it is clear to me that a duty of 4s. per cental is purely a revenue duty, I shall vote against it, and I ask every protectionist who has faith in the policy which he supports to assist me. A duty of 4s. per cental has failed to give the industry a start in Australia. Probably a duty of 8s., or id. per lb., will give it a start. We find that we are largely dependent on India for both of these products, and India is a country liable to periodical droughts. </para>

            <para>- Charges of that Kind are bound to be made, but it really does not matter one straw what I or any one else said about any other items. We have to deal with each item as it comes before us, and to act as consistently with our principles as we can. It is perfectly true that tapioca and sago can be produced in Australia. It is possible, I suppose, to produce orchids in Iceland, but it would be very expensive to do it. And so in regard to many products that could be grown in Australia, it would be too expensive to grow them for commercial purposes. Therefore, that argument must not be pushed too far. There is no doubt that the argument as to the necessity of a cheap food for children is one that should appeal strongly to the Committee. It is one which weighs very much with me. But when we come to consider the total contribution to the Customs made by sago and tapioca, and realize that it amounts only to a little over1/4d. per head of the total population, it will be seen that it is not a very heavy contribution even from the point of view of the poorer classes. </para>

            <para>- The various States, before Federation, were accustomed to a duty, and during the last six years under Federation they have paid a duty similar to that now under consideration. I have tried to explain my general position with regard to this Tariff. I have pointed out that the requirements of the primary industries, together with our revenue needs, are two powerful considerations in determining my vote and my insistence upon certain principles. The Government require revenue. This is a convenient way of raising it. In addition to that, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> has pointed out that in Queensland the growth of certain agricultural products is being steadily pursued. Those products form a very agreeable and palatable food. The arrowroot industry is, I believe, one that is growing. It has expanded considerably under the influence of the Federal Tariff. We have to consider that also. </para>

The development of a primary industry was a powerful factor in determining my view. It cannot be disputed that in Queensland close attention is being given to the production of arrowroot, which is a substitute for sago and tapioca. </para>

            <para>- Nothing of the kind. I appeal to protectionists to remember that they should not confine their attention wholly to manufacturing industries ; the primary industries must also be considered. Another point is that strong reasons must be given for any departure from a recommendation made by both sections of the Tariff Commission. An effort will be made to reduce the duties on several important items, and since it cannot be said that the duty will impose an undue burden on those who use sago and tapioca, I intend to support the motion. The incidence of this Tariff may have some slight effect in the direction of promoting a primary industry in my own State, and also, in time to come, in the Northern Territory and South Australia. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MILLEN</inline>(New South Wales)  4.23L  - We have had two conflicting arguments in favour of the motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline> . One of them has been something in the nature of a pathetic appeal to the Committee to refrain from imposing upon, housewives in humble homes such a crushing burden as a duty of Jd. per lb. would, be ; whereas we have been assured, on the other hand, that these very housewives, groaning under such a burden, would immediately become cheerful if it were increased to id. per lb. So far as the appeal for those in lowly circumstances comes from honorable senators whose views are in the direction of low .duties we can accept their declarations at their face value as being sincere; but I cannot understand it being made by those who are Quite content to impose in connexion with other items .more crushing imposts upon the very people on whose behalf they now venture to plead. Immediately following this item are others which fall heavily on the poorer classes - items under which they will be called upon to contribute to the revenue not the £13,000 per annum which this item will yield, but in some cases up to £80,000 per annum. And yet those who ask us, in the interests of the poor, to reject this duty will make no effort to remove or lessen those- larger burdens. </para>

            <para>- I am guided by interjections that have been made. So long as it can be shown that an impost will do something to build up an industry, senators will be prepared to support it, no matter how crushing it may be. Is it any satisfaction to the struggling housewife who has to bear a heavy impost to know that some one. else is benefiting at her expense? I. am unable to follow this reasoning, coming from the quarter to which I have referred, because it does not appear to be consistent. This item must be taken in connexion with others. Are those who ask that sago and tapioca shall be free prepared to agree to rice also being placed on the free list? Are they prepared to vote for the repeal of the measure under which we have granted a bounty on the production of rice? I opposed that Bill, and am as strong a free-trader as is any one; but I recognise that in framing a Tariff some sense of proportion and balance must be exhibited. It is not only idle but foolish to attempt on the one hand to promote the production of rice by granting a bounty and imposing a duty, whilst, on the other, tapioca and sago are allowed to come in free. As a free-trader, I should like to see these and numerous other articles free of duty, and would move in that direction if I thought I should secure the support of these sudden converts to the interests of the poor housewives j but it would be foolish to shut my eyes to the facts I ha.ve enumerated. There is, therefore, only one course open to me, and that is to vote against the motion that has been moved, and also against the further ' proposition which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has indicated his intention of moving. The duty now proposed by the Government was recommended by both sections of the Tariff Commission. If it were not, the members of that Commission are open to censure for not having informed us that it was embodied in their report in only a <inline font-style="italic">pro forma</inline> way. They should have informed us that this recommendation for our guidance- </para>

            <para>- I am not laying down the doctrine that we should be bound by the recommendations of the Commission ; but it would be just as idle to ignore them as it would be to ignore the investigations of any Commission. When we find both sections in harmony upon a particular item, we are entitled to give that fact consideration. In this case, the Government have adopted the unanimous recommendation of the Commission, and the Tariff is left as it was before. As I stated in my second-reading speech, in view of my election pledges, I shall be loath to do anything to reduce duties which existed under the first Federal Tariff. Some of those who plead that this duty ought to be removed because it is a revenue tax pressing heavily upon the poorer classes would be perfectly willing to allow it to remain if they could abolish other duties. In other w=ords, if the Tariff were not likely to yield something over £11,000,000 per annum - if they could cut it down so that it would yield a revenue of £S, 000.000 or £9,000,000 - they would be willing to  allow the item to remain. That being so, we are entitled to question their sincerity when they ask us to remove it on the ground that it is a crushing impost upon the poorer housewives of the community. </para>

        <para class="block">I submit this motion because I see no possibility of the tapioca or sago industry, of which we have heard so much this evening, being established in Australia. Tapioca is the product of the cassava plant, and is obtained by washing and rubbing, carried on by the cheapest labour obtainable in the Straits Settlements and India. No evidence was given before the Tariff Commission as to its production in Australia. The same remark applies to sago. Where have we in Australia ' the palms necessary to produce half the crop of sago that we require? </para>

            <para>- The position, seems to be that the industry has not been started in Australia; that, even with the degree of protection that has been offered, no one has had the temerity to embark in it. The outlook seems as discouraging as it was five or six years ago. There is no possibility of either tapioca or sago being produced in Australia), and yet we are asked to impose a tax of 25 per cent, on these commodities, which are used by the poorer classes of the people. I urge on purely protectionist grounds that this item be made free. In connexion with other items I shall be perfectly willing to vote for imposts that will extract from the poorer classes sufficient to enable industries to thrive in Australia ; but I am not appealing for any support on the ground that this will be a heavy burden on that section of the community. I submit my motion solely on the ground that it is unwise to place a burden on the people when we have not the compensating consideration that it will lead to the establishment of an industry. </para>

        <para class="block">I should like to know whether honorable senators who have just made such an appeal on behalf of the poor are prepared to make any distinction between the poor who are consumers and the poor who are workers. The workers in the biscuit manufacturing industry in Australia are, as. a direct result of the low duty on biscuits, amongst the worst paid workers in the Commonwealth. A little time ago a determination was come to by the Tinsmiths Board acting under the Victorian Factories Act, fixing the wages of those engaged in making biscuit tins at <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 2s. per week. The biscuit manufacturers waited as a deputation on <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alexander</inline> Peacock, then Chief Secretary and Minister for Labour in the Victorian Government, and conclusively proved to him that they would be unable to pay the wages fixed by the Tinsmiths Board and continue to compete with outside biscuit manufacturers. The result was that the determination of the Wages Board increasing the wages of tinsmiths in the industry from about 30s. to <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 2s. per week was suspended. I feel confident that honorable senators who have appealed so strongly on behalf of the poor will be prepared, in this case, where it has been shown that it has been necessary to suspend the determination of a Wages Board because of the low duty imposed on his-  cuits, to so increase the duty as to enable the determination of the Board in question to be given effect. I do not think that any one who has any sympathy with the workers of this country will contend that a wage of <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 2s. per week in this industry is too high, and yet a Minister of the Crown in Victoria has determined that because of the low duty on imported biscuits, the local industry cannot afford to pay that wage. </para>

            <para>- The duty has been raised . to11/2d. per lb., as against the foreigner. Unless <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell.'s</inline> motion is followed up by a further motion dealing with the Tariff as against the United Kingdom, it can have but very little effect, because if honorable senators will look up the statistics they will find that in 1906 we imported from the United Kingdom 202,000 lbs. of biscuits, and from all other countries only 17,200 lbs. The duty under the old Tariff was1d. per lb., and that is the duty recommended by both sections of the Tariff Commission, who. in making the recommendation, no doubt had in mind the volume of importations from the Mother Country. </para>

            <para>- That I cannot say. When it is remembered that local manufacturers practically monopolize the market for biscuits in the Commonwealth, the Committee would be wise in retaining the duty as now proposed. In  1906 3,000,000  lbs. of Australian-made biscuits were exported, as against an importation of  219,200  lbs. from abroad. </para>

            <para>- They were exported from Australia, and the point is that under the old rate of duty of id. per lb. Australian manufacturers of biscuits were in a position to compete against the world. In these circumstances, I think a duty of id. per lb. must be considered- a reasonable duty. Of course we desire to give the Mother Country the benefit of supplying the  17,200  lbs. of biscuits now brought from abroad, and in order to do so we propose an increase of the duty against other countries. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON (South Australia)  [4.49].  - I admire the pathos with which the Vice-President of the Executive Council has, not in song, but in words, repeated the refrain of the old song, " Please give me a penny." He wants this penny on biscuits against the Mother Country, and in. order to secure the enormous, the immense - which I think was the word which he used on the second reading of the Bill - advantage to the Mother Country of supplying an importation of  17,000  lbs. of biscuits which last year were imported from other countries, as against the  202,000  lbs. of biscuits from the Mother Country, which practically monopolized the whole biscuit import of Australia. After the observations to which we have listened from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> and from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell, we. might well pause in dealing with this particular item. Various aspects of the Tariff, which it may be well to discuss in connexion with this concrete instance, have been raised by the remarks which have already been addressed to this Chamber. We are all anxious to complete the consideration of the Tariff before the nth of March, and I take it that some phases of it may fairly be debated upon this item, as by so doing time will be saved in discussing other items. The item opens up - as honorable senators will see from the schedule - a variety of questions. One of these, to which I shall presently refer, has been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell. Another is that this duty is a tax upon food. A third is that the general Tariff increases the tax which was previously levied upon biscuits by  50  per cent. I do not say, in strict terms, that it is a tax upon the daily bread of the people, but it is certainly a tax upon their daily biscuits. Now, the consumption of biscuits is a very large one. Proportionately, it is not so large in the cities, but in the outlying parts of Australia biscuits of a kind are much more in use than they are in the populous centres, where baker's bread is always available. </para>

            <para>- At any rate, we are asked to increase the duty levied upon biscuits under the old Tariff by50 per cent. We are also asked to increase the impost recommended by the Tariff Commission under the general Tariff to the same extent. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell evidently overlooked the fact that the schedule in the form in which it has been submitted, to the Senate increases the duty under the general Tariff from1d to11/2 per lb. The Tariff Commission recommended1. per lb. all round, but with a view to preventing the ten or twelve foreign countries which export biscuits to Australia to the tune of  17,000  lbs. annually from getting even the crumbs that fall from England's biscuit table, that amount has been increased. My next point is that this duty raises the question of preference in a concrete form, and the figures quoted by my honorable friend show what a hollow pretence and sham this so-called preference is. </para>

            <para>- If the Vice-President of the Executive Council had given us a few details, and had quoted from a few of the letters to which he has alluded - the tenor of which, by the way, differs entirely from that of the criticism which I have seen upon this question - I should have been glad. Here we have a concrete instance which lends absolute conviction to the statement of the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> - which journal has been standing behind the Tariff reformers of England ever since <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> announced his preferential trade policy - and which described this preference as " almost derisory." I now wish to say a word upon this particular item of preference. 1 shall refer to it for a moment from the point of view raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell. I can assure him that I am just as anxious that the wages of the biscuit operatives shall be maintained at a fair and proper level, as I am that the poor consumer who was referred to in connexion with the item of sago and tapioca should not be victimized by the prices of those commodities being raised for no other reason than to swell the revenue to the extent almost of frightening the Government, whose leader in this House has made an effort to show that' this Tariff will not yield a revenue of <inline font-style="italic">£is,</inline> 000,000 or £12,000,000 annually, and that it will do so this year only because, of abnormal circumstances.I am quite ready to assist in alleviating any of the conditions to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell has referred, and if he can show that mischiefs of the kind do exist, he will certainly address his remarks, so far as I am concerned, to a very sympathetic ear. But. I am afraid that the working people of this country - I am not suggesting that this idea is at the bottom of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell's</inline> desire to increase the duty upon biscuits - are likely to find themselves grievously misled if they imagine that they are going to increase these duties to a high level for the benefit of the manufacturers with a view subsequently to obtaining what is called the new protection. I do not know whether the honorable senator believes that by increasing the duty upon biscuits to 2d. per lb. he will be able to bring about the application of the new protection" to this industry. 'To the principle underlying the new protection I adhere if we are to have high duties ; but I warn him not to be induced to vote far high, and in some instances, prohibitive duties in the expectation that later on the working men of this country will be able to get the manufacturers to give them a fair share - I will not say of the "'plunder" - but of the advantages which they will enjoy. </para>

            <para>- I do not wish to discuss that question now. If what is in ray honorable friend's mind is that by raising these duties, and thereby putting greater profits in the pockets of the biscuit manufacturers, he will pave the way to the workers securing their fair share of the advantages conferred under the new protection, he is putting the cart before the horse. I say this for the reason that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> in his admirable speech - admirable for its brevity and for the way in which it kept within proper limits in relation to the Tariff - practically said, " If you do not impose high duties there will be no new protection." What does that mean ? It is not a bribe, . but it is a bait held out to the working men who may be inclining towards protection, to pile up protective duties for the benefit of the manufacturer in the vain hope that the manufacturer will let him share this benefit. </para>

            <para>- I shall finish my sentence and say no more about it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell has moved to increase the duty upon biscuits, with a view to assisting the wage earners in that particular industry. I say that if that is what is in his mind - and it is what has been put into our minds by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best's</inline> remarks, the tenor of which I have quoted - he is putting the cart before the horse. When once the duties have beer raised, you will have to fight the manufacturers, and the workers will be able to extort their share of the advantages conferred by this additional measure of protection only at the point of the bayonet. Of course, I am not prepared to institute a comparison between the wages paid by the biscuit manufacturers of Victoria with those paid by the biscuit manufacturers of Tasmania. My interjection was merely prompted by the fact that I happen to know - I have not the figures with me - that the biscuit manufacturers of Tas*mania, ever since the foundation of the Commonwealth, have been forging ahead, and that if they have not actually captured the Victorian market they have made inroads upon it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell -may be right or wrong as to the conditions which obtain in Tasmania as compared with those which prevail in Victoria; but, willing as I am to assist in any way that I can to put the workmen in as good a position as the poor consumer, I say, as a free-trader - and the remark might come with equal force from my protectionist friends opposite - that one of the monstrous features about high protective duties is that manufacturers become rich by them at the expense of the consumer and by the sweating of their workmen. I have nothing more to say upon the arguments of my honorable friend in regard to the proposed increase. But I wish to say a word or two - and perhaps it will save duplicating discussion - upon a motion which I intend to submit, if no other honorable senator does so,, in favour of reducing the duty from 1 1/2d. per lb. to id. per lb., which was the amount at which it formerly stood. Then, if we are going to give a preference to the United Kingdom, let us make it a real preference by reducing the duty which was operative under the old Tariff to a less amount in favour of British importations. I do not wish to add. to what I said previously upon another item in regard to the proposed duty being a tax upon food. A duty of this description should be kept at its lowest possible level, and I shall always be found voting to ease the taxation imposed upon the people's food as much as <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> possibly can. The next thing I wish to point out" is that, as a protective duty, this impost is not required. The figures quoted bv the Vice-President of the Executive Council at the close of his remarks show that Australia was an exporting country in relation to the manufactured article of biscuits, to the extent of nearly  3,500,000  lbs. last year. </para>

            <para>- We cannot leave the local consumption out of consideration in dealing with the question of a protective duty, lt must be measured in tons. It is folly to talk about putting a protective duty on biscuits when Ave are supplying the whole of our own consumption, and exported to other countries, which are less favoured than r,e are as to the raw material,  3,500,000  lbs. in 1906, and when the whole of the biscuit importation which is to be embarrassed by a duty of id. was from England, last year, 202,000 lbs. - barely a sixteenth of our own exports - while the general duty is to be increased by Jd., or 50 per cent., in order that we may transfer to British importations the 17,000 lbs. now competing with England. That is as against nearly  4,000,000  lbs., comprising the local production for export and the importations from England. If this were to be a revenue duty, reasons might be urged for it', but even then it is not wanted. It is not necessary to tax the consumers of 200,000 lbs. id. per lb. for the encouragement of biscuit-makers who, it is said, are not doing their duty by their workmen. Let the people have their biscuits free. If 202,000 lbs. come from England, let them come free, if we are going to give England a preference. What difference will it make? The English makers have to pay the freight on flour to England, pay for the manufacture of the flour into biscuits, pav the freight back, and a number of other expenses. Surely that is enough in regard to such an insignificant proportion of the Australian consumption of biscuits as is represented by our importations of the article. From that aspect alone, surely it is not worthy of us to put that duty on? What are we putting it on for? Whom are we putting it on against? England - the Mother Country to whom we talk about giving a preference in trade. I do not believe in preferences at all as that policy is usually represented, and, although I am going to vote for every preference that I legitimately can vote for,I shall do so simply and solely on the ground that I want duties reduced as far as I can on the commodities that are consumed here. I am going to vote for preference on that ground solely. I am not going to vote for preference because I think it is going to promote the unity of the Empire, and all that kind of cant.' It is going to do nothing of the kind. Every one of us is as loyal to the Empire as are those who talk perhaps more glibly about it. But the loyalty of Australia is not to be bought in that fashion-. If it is to be bought in that fashion, is it only to last so long as the price is paid? And when we have a little difference about some of these trade questions </para>

            <para>- I entirely respect what you say, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> but I think that, on other occasions, and certainly in another place, when any particular item that involves a departure, or an application in concrete form of a new principle, is reached, it is usual to have a general debate on that item. But I am not going to ask for that. the  CHAIRMAN.  - The honorable senator says that he is not going to ask for it, but at the same time he makes a statement which to a certain extent is a reflection on the Chair. </para>

            <para>- I think so. The honorable senator refers to what was done in another place. When we went into Committee on the Bill, I drew attention to the fact that the question of preference was involved in every item, but I said that it was my intention to confine the discussion on each separate item to the question of preference as affecting that item. If the Committee dissented from that view, it was quite within the power of the Committee by motion or otherwise to have directed that I should take some other course. There was no dissent from any member of the Committee, and therefore I take it that the Committee upheld me in my contention. I trust that the honorable senator will confine his remarks on preference to the preference on biscuits. </para>

            <para>- That was after the second reading was carried. I yield at once implicit obedience to that, as it is my duty to do. To return to the point, I had almost finished referring to the figures, and the effects of them, which had been quoted by the Vice-President of the Executive Council in regard to this item, and the preference. I intend to make my attitude perfectly clear as to why I shall vote for preference. I intend to vote for this or some preference on biscuits - I shall attempt to make them free - -hot because I believe in preference at all, but because I believe, whenever I can, in reducing taxes on food. When we come to 'taxes, upon manufactures and other products, as has been so strongly put by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> in relation to another item, other considerations come into play. I would not vote for a preference at all, except that it is a reduction of duty,  and a reduction of duty upon an article of food. I also said that I was not going to vote for it because some people said that it was to promote the unity of the Empire. In my view, none of these trade restrictions or duties, so long as we have the right to fix our own fiscal system, will, of themselves, promote the unity .of the Empire. Preferences - a preference on biscuits to begin with - will rather be a'n element of danger to the unity of the Empire instead of tending to solidification. The amount of the alleged preference is perfectly trivial and absurd. It is introduced after the old duty of id. per lb., which was also recommended by the Tariff Commission, has been raised by 50 per cent. This was done for the purpose of making the pretence of a substantial preference or gift in favour of England to the extent of id. per lb. in relation to the 17,000 lbs. of biscuits which happen to come from a number of other countries. According to the  latest Customs statistics, the United Kingdom, supplies us with 201,185 lbs., and the balance of our imports of biscuits- 17,000 lbs. - actually comes from seventeen different countries. As much as 12 lbs. comes from India, and 30 lbs. from the Netherlands, whilst Portugal has the audacity to send '100 lbs. of those biscuits which it is proposed to penalize in favour- of England to the extent of an extra Jd. per lb. ! That is the preference that is sought to be offered, and that is commended to us as a great gift to- the people of England, which will induce them to make reciprocal gifts to us bv taxing the food of their own poor people. </para>

            <para>- When the amount is put into pounds sterling, the thing is made more ludicrous. It is only by taking a concrete item like this that the absurdity of the whole thing appears. That statement applies to nearly every item, with one exception, in which preference is offered by this Tariff. I do not want to go over this ground again, but if the items are taken separately, as I am doing with this, one, the hollowness of the proposal is apparent. I intend to move that as regards England the item shall be free. I can understand the position taken  up  by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell, in relation to workmen participating in the advantages .of protection, if that is. established - and it is not established yet. But- 1 cannot understand those who advocate this preference as a gift to England, and declare, " We do not want or stipulate for any return," whilst expressing a hope for reciprocal preference, like the blind beggar at the corner who does not ask for alms, but simply holds out his tin pannikin. Does any one really think that we ought to pass this sham preference in the hope that it will gull the people of England into the belief that they are getting something substantial, and induce them to place a tax on foreign grain, cheese, meat, and other products? Biscuits afford a concrete example of the absurdity of these preferential proposals which might be discussed for a considerable time, but without entering into further reasons, I merely intimate that at the proper time I shall .move that the item be free as regards imports from the United Kingdom. </para>

          <para>.- As his main reason in support of this motion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell urged that,, some time ago, those interested in this industry waited on the Minister of Labour in Victoria, and pointed out that, in consequence of the low duty, they were not in a position to pay fair and reasonable wages. Probably those gentlemen convinced the Minister that they were not making fortunes; but were they as successful' in convincing their workmen that the wages were such as they were entitled to? But even if the biscuit manufacturers are not making fortunes, they ought by now to have established the industry on such a basis as to give them the command of the Australian market. As a matter of fact, the official figures show not only that they have the command of the Australian market but that they export annually considerably over 3,000,000 lbs. The addition proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell would, on the importation, amount approximately to £500 per annum, or less than £10 per week ; and it is suggested that this would enable the biscuit manufacturers of Australia to pay the whole of their employes wages such as have never been paid before. In my .opinion, if the manufacturers cannot pay reasonable wages with the present duty, an additional 1/2d per lb. 'will not enable them to. do so. I am a protectionist, with a view to obtaining the Australian market for Australian commodities ; and there is not a shadow of a doubt that the biscuit manufacturers already have that market. No matter how enthusiastic we may be as protectionists, we can never absolutely prohibit the importation of. goods, because there are always people who will pay fancy prices for articles they fancy. </para>

            <para>- That, of course, is what the manufacturers say ; but we must not forget that the manufacturers manage to retain the market under the present duty ; and if the men have not been paid fair wages, that is mainly due to the want of unity and organization amongst themselves. There was a time in Victoria when the average boot operator was paid less than 30s. a week, it being urged that the industry could not afford higher wages ; and the same statement has been made in regard to almost every protected industry at one time or another. We have no guarantee that the proposed increase in duty will result in any increase in the wages, while we have a guarantee on the part df the Government that legislation, providing for a living wage in every protected industry will be introduced. Most of the imported biscuits come from the United Kingdom ; and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell has told us that in this industry the conditions in Australia, from the workman's point of view, are just as bad as they are in the Old Land. I can hardly believe that such is the case. First of all, there is a duty of id. per lb., and, in addition, freight both ways, while most of the imported biscuits are tinned; and, taking all these facts into consideration, I cannot see how the conditions of work in this industry in&gt; Australia can be as bad as they are in Great Britain. Bad as the conditions are in many industries here, I think that, as a whole, Australia in this connexion can provide an object lesson .for almost every other country, and the possibilities of improvement are much greater here than elsewhere. On the case presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. .Russell, I am not disposed to vote for the proposed increase; and I cannot imagine that even the entire stoppage of importation would prove of any material advantage, seeing that the biscuit industry is already established in almost every State of the Union. </para>

            <para>- Certainly. I merely express my. own opinion. I think it a pity that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> discussed the question of preference in the way he did. He simply put arguments into the possession of the enemies of preference, both here and in Great Britain. We are only commencing to give preference to the Old Country, and we must commence in a small way. We could not carry larger concessions than are proposed. But it must npt be forgotten that the preference in connexion with biscuits is not the only preference in the Tariff. </para>

Canada has reduced her general rate from <inline font-style="italic">27 1/2</inline> per cent, to  17^  per cent, on British products. With regard to the statement that duties on food products make them dearer. I can remember when it was impossible to buy any but English biscuits here. I was " batching " in a tent at the time, and could not obtain Australian biscuits. Biscuits were not manufactured in Australia until the establishment of the industry had been encouraged by the imposition of a protective duty, the result of which has been that biscuits now cost only about one-third of what they used to cost, while the industry has been so successful that, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has shown, we now do a large export trade. </para>

            <para>- I do not wish to mention the names of individual manufacturers in these debates, but I shall privately give the honorable senator the names of the leading biscuit manufacturers of Tasmania, so that he may obtain from them particulars of the wages -which they pay, and the conditions of labour which they enforce, or, if he does not care to do so, I. shall be prepared to obtain the information for him. Furthermore, I should like to tell him, without mentioning names, that, not long ago, an enterprising person in Tasmania was importing Victorian biscuits, which were being sold at lower prices in Tasmania than in Victoria, reselling them at a profit in Victoria, after paying freight and all charges incidental to carriage, at prices lower than those at which similar biscuits were being sold here by their manufacturer. </para>

            <para>- When a member of the Tariff Commission, one of the objects which I had always in view was the ascertainment of the rates of wages paid in Australia, with- a view to their comparison with those paid in the countries which export to Australia. The price of an article depends largely on two factors : the cost of its raw materials and the wages paid to those employed to manufacture them into the finished' product. In regard to biscuits it was "shown that id. per lb.' was considerably' more than the total wages cost. </para>

            <para>- I am prepared to do so. Nowhere can manufacturers make biscuits without employing labour for which they have to pay wages. But even if foreign manufacturers had no labour to. pay for, a duty of id. per lb. would be more than sufficient to protect our manufacturers from their competition. According to the Trade and Customs returns, Australia exports about 3,500,000 lbs. of biscuits, worth about 3d. per lb., and the wages employed in making them certainly do not amount to 33^ per cent, of their cost. Furthermore, the great bulk of our exportation goes to black labour countries ; for instance, we export largely to India. </para>

            <para>- Australia exported 1:13,196 lbs. of biscuits to India; 1:35,000 lbs. to Java; 150,000 lbs. to' the New Hebrides; and 579,000 lbs. to the South Sea Islands. We exported also to Burmah, Cape Colony, Fiji, Hong Kong, Mauritius. Natal, the Straits Settlements, the Caroline Islands, and New Zealand. I regret that on such a common article of food as biscuits there should be a farthing of taxation imposed. The duty is absolutely unnecessary for the protection of our biscuit manufacturers ; at least, that is the opinion to which I came after listening to the evidence given before the Tariff Commission. If the duty' were remitted, it would not in any way interfere with the local industry, because the freights to this country from abroad are a sufficient protection, and the importations consequently paltry. There is, however, a fairly 'strong Inter-State competition, and immediately Victoria is at a disadvantage by reason of such competition, the Commonwealth Tariff is abused, and there is a clamour amongst her manufacturers for higher duties all round. The Victorian manufacturers must learn to pay good wages, and to brace themselves to withstand the healthy competition of their rivals in other States. </para>

Take for instance the argument put forward by two honorable senators. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> sneered at the idea of the' small sum of £500 having any influence. That certainly was very unfair, because, as a. matter of fact, it amounts to a little over _£t,8oo. When we are assured bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> that the cost of the labour is only about id. per lb. it will be seen that the sum of £1,800, when distributed, would make a very material difference in the wages paid to the 'men. </para>

            <para>- I did make the statement that the conditions in the biscuit industry in Australia are little if any better than the conditions existing in the Old Country. I am not inclined to defame Australia, but in my opinion it would' be better for us not to have a pennyworth of export trade in- biscuits than to have the conditions which are operating in the industry. What are they? </para>

            <para>- It has something to do with the duty. . I have had at command the figures and the facts, and whatever my limited abilities may be, I can count accurately when I have a definite sum to work out.  I was asked by the men to apply to the Chamber of Manufactures to maintain their Wages Board. But after going through the figures and considering the whole of the facts I had to confess that there was nothing else to do but to suspend the Wages Board in this State. It is because the biscuit manufacturers are sweating the men and the women that we are able to have an export trade in that article. I do not want an export trade which is built up on the sweat of the men and women of this State. In the factories women are not allowed' to do night-work. At  5  o'clock in the evening women who are engaged in packing biscuits, &amp;c, cease to work, and kiddies who ought to be at school have to my knowledge been introduced to work from  5  p.m. to  3  a.m. </para>

            <para>- Those conditions exist in Victoria, and if biscuit-makers in other States can undersell its biscuit-makers, it is because they are sacrificing the lives of their work people. In Tasmania, the biscuit-maker cannot buy flour or other ingredients more cheaply than can the Victorian biscuit-maker. I take it that if the former can undersell the latter, it is because they pay lower wages in this industry, as in most others. </para>

            <para>- I did not say so. I propose to quote an extract from the report of the Royal Commission on Wages and Wage-earners in Tasmania, which was published as recently as 1907. On page 1, <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> find this paragraph, under the head of " Biscuit Factories " - </para>

        <quote>
          <para>There were two biscuit factories visited in Hobart, and from the pay-sheets it was found that the wages for biscuit-bakers and cake-maker and pastrycook vary from 30s. per week to <inline font-style="italic">£,1</inline> 10s. ; the next branch, 11s. to 30s.; and juniors, from 5s. to 15s. The men work 53 hours weekly. A. shop is opened in conjunction with one of the establishments, the female employes in which work on an average 53 hours weekly, their pay ranging from Ss. to 125. a week ; they are also allowed nine meals during the week. The clerks (females) work 51 hours, and receive 15s. and 16s. per week, and seven meals weekly. A male clerk, with 4^ years' service, in the other establishment, is paid 25s. weekly for 47 hours' work per week, Holidays are allowed and paid for in one factory, but the employes lose time if they are away sick. In the other establishment the evidence as regards payment for any holidays and sickness is conflicting. </para>
          <para>At Launceston the Commission visited one factory, and found that, in addition to the foreman, there are assistants whose wages are 14s. and 32s. 6d., whilst boys are paid 6s. to 8s. per week. Several girls employed as packers receive 6s. to ios. a week, and the forewoman <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> is. Th"e juniors commence at 5s: and 6s. per w-eek. The females work 47^ and the males jo£ hours per week. Sick leave and holidays are both paid for. The clerk is in receipt of <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> a week. </para>
          <para>In this industry we find, that the following rates of payment made to the undermentioned employes are inadequate for the services rendered : - Clerk, aged 25 years, 4^ years' service, 25s. per week ; biscuit-baker, aged 22 years, 8 years' service, 30s. per week; general hand, aped 26, 2 years' service, ns. per week; packer, aged 22, in his fifth year of service, 20s. a week ; general hand, almost iS, just on three years' service, gs. per week. </para>

I have been quoting from the report of a Royal Commission on Wages  and Wage-earners in Tasmania, which was presented to both Houses of its Parliament, by  His Excellency  the Governor's command, in j 907, and yet the' honorable senator has the audacity to doubt t'he correctness of the quotation. </para>

            <para>- Yes. So long as workmen continue to be disorganized, if the duty were increased to even 20s. per. lb., it would not make much difference to them. I would willingly vote for any increase of the duty if I thought it would have the effect which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell seems to anticipate. But I am afraid that it would not: and that even if I did vote for the request, it would not be of any particular value to the worker. What I Would say to them is this - Form a union, stick together, try to get your wages increased in that way, and if the Legislature can help you it will do so. I believe that it could and would help. Meanwhile voluntary organization is necessary for these workers just as it is for other trades. </para>

But the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell are of such a serious character as affecting the manufacturers of biscuits throughout the- Common- wealth that I must say a word or two about them. Even as regards Victoria, I am very doubtful if such a condition of affairs as that indicated by the honorable senator exists. It is difficult to believe that after the ordinary hands have left their work little boys are induced to enter the factories and to work from 5 o'clock in the evening until 3 the following morning. </para>

I can state with regard to New South Wales - though I do not like to mention particular States - that it certainly is not the case that such a condition of affairs exists in the biscuit factories there. I happen to know the firm in New South Wales who are, I believe, the largest manufacturers of biscuits in Australia. They do a </para>

I venture to say that that firm bears. a character equal to the best in the civilized world. The conditions of employment are fair and equitable. There has never been any trouble with the employes and the heads of the firm, who have been very successful in developing their industry, have done so upon lines which I am confident would meet with the approval of every member of the Senate. I make that statement simply because otherwise the assertions which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J.

            <para>- I can only express my very deep regret that such a condition of affairs should exist in this Commonwealth. I never thought it possible that young children could be introduced into a, factory and made to work from 5 o'clock in the evening until 3 the next morning, at wages which I assume are inequitable. . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has placed the' facts of the case with regard to this industry very fairy before the Committee, and it is impossible to come to any other. conclusion than that if we were to increase the duty by Jd. per lb. it would be of no use whatever to the workers or to the industry. Australia has now attained to that position with regard to biscuit manufacture when she has become an exporter on a very large scale. With the exception, perhaps, of some of the finer classes of biscuits, I venture to say that the manufacturers of Australia produce biscuits which are equal to those manufactured in Europe or any other country. </para>

            <para>- If their biscuits were not of excellent quality they would not be able to export them, because abroad they . have to sell their goods in competition with English, American, and European manufacturers. Under these circumstances, I trust that the Committee will not increase the duty. The whole subect' has been thoroughly threshed out by a Commission consisting of some of the ablest members of the two Houses bf the Legislature who, I think, deserve the thanks of the Commonwealth Parliament for the time and ability that they devoted to their duties. I consider that the Commission has reason to be proud of its work. Arid surely after we have asked gentlemen to give their time for the performance of such duties for nearly two years, and after they, having a knowledge of the personality of the witnesses brought before them, have thoroughly sifted the evidence, we should require very strong reasons to induce us to depart from the recommendations which they have made. In this instance all the evidence, as far as I can judge, is in accord with the determinations of the Commission. Both protectionists and free-traders have agreed that a certain duty would be sufficient. Under these circumstances, and as no fresh evidence has been placed before us, we should, I consider, abide by the duty which the Commission has recommended. </para>

          <para>. - I should not have joined in the discussion had it not been for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> closing remarks in regard to the biscuit industry. I wish briefly to emphasize the point which he made in regard to the organization of the workers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell has moved that the duty be raised from11/2d. per lb. to 2d., with the desire to see improved conditions obtaining throughout the industry, and to secure better wages for the employes. I think that if the protection of11/2d. per lb. is not sufficient to enable fair and reasonable remuneration to be paid to the employes, double the amount of duty would not induce the manufacturers to pay a fair wage. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell is in hopes that the new protection, or the legislation to be proposed to Parliament by the Government, will be the means of improving the conditions of the employes. But he wishes to forestall that legislation by increasing the duty to 2d. per lb. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> however, hit the nail on the head so far as concerns the workers, when he urged that unless they organize they can never expect to reap the full benefits of the new protection. </para>

            <para>- I have emphasized this point outside - that no matter how high the protectionist duties may be, no matter how generous we may be to the manufacturers in our desire to help them, the workers themselves must organize before they can receive benefits from what is called the new protection. I am prepared to support the duty as it stands on the schedule. I consider that a duty of11/2d. per lb. is quite sufficient. So far as relates to the conditions of employment in Victoria, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell has painted an appalling picture. I know that he must have substantial proofs for his statements, otherwise he would not have made them.. But if such a condition of things obtains an increase in the duty would not prove a remedy. There is something lax in the administration of the Factories and Shops Act, either so far as the inspectors are concerned, or in the machinery of the legislation itself. We cannot remove that deplorable condition of affairs by an increase in the amount of the duty. We must appeal to the State </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para class="block">Parliament, or to those in charge of the administration of the Act. I cannot, for a moment, doubt the accuracy of the statements which the honorable senator has made, but I cannot agree with him that an extra tax of1/2d. per lb. on biscuits would remove the evil . So far as the proposed preferential duty is concerned, I may briefly say that Britain does not thank us for what we are offering to her by means of our preference policy. Indeed, she has treated our offers with contempt. I shall oppose the preference of1/2d. per lb. on biscuits, and hope to see it wiped off the schedule. Apart from Victoria, wherever I have seen the employes in the biscuit industry at work, I can say, without making invidious distinctions between States, that I am quite satisfied that the conditions under which they work are fairly satisfactory, and the remuneration which they receive is in accordance with the standards ruling in the trade. </para>

          <para>. - I should like to say a few words upon this question, because I know something of the biscuit-making industry in Tasmania. I can speak with knowledge in regard to Hobart, and say that no such condition of affairs exists in relation to the manufacture of biscuits there", as has been stated to exist in protectionist Victoria. Indeed, I can hardly understand that such a condition does exist in Victoria. The export of biscuits from Hobart to Melbourne is caused largely by the improvements which have been made in regard to manufacturing machinery in the Tasmanian factories. It must be understood that not many able-bodied men are employed in biscuit manufacturing. The principal work is done by machinery. The mixing is done by machinery ; the biscuits are put into the oven by machinery, and they are taken out by machinery - at all events, in one case that I know of. It is the packing and labelling that is done by means of cheaply-paid labour. I may say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> D. Haywood, a biscuit manufacturer in a large way of business in Tasmania, instituted proceedings for libel against those who had levelled against his firm a charge of sweating, and was awarded damages amounting to <inline font-style="italic">£300,</inline> which he distributed amongst charities. The incident shows how readily, in matters of this kind, a chimera may be raised, and that we ought to hesitate before we accept what appear to be exaggerated statements. . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell stated that he <inline font-style="italic">spoke</inline> of what had happened, within his own knowledge, in the industry in Victoria, but I am glad that such conditions do not obtain in Tasmania. The manufacturers in that State use the most up-to-date machinery, and, their baking being excellent, they are able to produce a superior article. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colonel NEILD</inline>(New South. Wales)  [6.24].  - Having listened carefully to the statements made during this debate, and read others thai) have been published, it seems to me that manufacturers in the Commonwealth have practically overtaken the local demand for biscuits, and are now devoting themselves largely, if not chiefly, to the export trade. As that export trade appears to be carried on with people who are very objectionable to a large number of honorable senators - namely, with black races - it would seem as if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell's proposal had in it an element of subsidizing trade with coloured people. It appears to be a little beyond the political professions of many very estimable senators. As the market is supplied, under the existing rates of duty, with all its wants, and we are transacting trade with other countries, what claim can there be for the imposition of an import duty which is actually an export duty ? The people of Australia are, if possible, to be compelled to subsidize, by means of a duty, a trade which is chiefly conducted with other countries. </para>

          <para>- Just so; but it is not likely that there will be further importations from foreign countries. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has said, the local manufacturers not only supply the local market, but export to countries that surround us in competition with the manufacturers of the rest of the world. I am at a loss to understand why we should be invited to impose an extra duty of id. per lb. on an import of 17,200 lbs. of biscuits. I propose now that the duty on foreign biscuits should be1d. per lb., and when we come to discuss whether there should be a preference given to manufacturers of the United Kingdom, I shall, carrying out the view I have previously expressed, submit for the consideration of the. Committee a request for a reduction of the duty proposed on importations from the United Kingdom. Having failed to carry a request that the item should be made duty free. I am now following the practice of the Vice-President of the Executive Council where he agrees with the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, and asking the Committee to follow the unanimous guidance of the Commission in this matter. I am not unwilling that the Committee should do that where I cannot have my own way in inducing honorable senators to accept a request to the House of Representatives to make the food of the people free of taxation. </para>

          <para>. - The honorable senator has quite frankly told the Committee the object of his motion. He proposes that, so far as the general Tariff is concerned, the House of Representatives should be requested to reduce the duty from11/2.d. to1d. per lb., and, should he carry that request, he intends to ask the House of Representatives to reduce the Tariff so far as it affects imports from the United Kingdom. For several reasons I ask the Committee to permit the item to remain as it stands. First of all, it really represents a compromise made in another place, and, from that stand-point, has much to recommend it. The original proposal of the Government did not make allowance for any preference at all in regard to this item, but provided for a general Tariff on biscuits of11/2d. per lb. After discussion, the right honorable the leader of the Opposition in another place, suggested a reduction of the duty to1d. per lb. on imports from the United Kingdom, having regard to the figures so freely quoted here in connexion with the item, and by way of compromise and to shorten debate, the proposal was ultimately agreed to by the Government. I say that, as a compromise, the duties at present proposed have much to recommend them. I frankly admit that the preference decided upon in this case by the House of Representatives is of a most trifling character. </para>

            <para>- So far as its operation is concerned, it is one of the few preferences proposed that may be regarded as of a 'trifling character, because the really operative duty in this case is that of1d. per lb., which is levied against imports from the United Kingdom. The total imports are not heavy, but I have explained that over 200.000 lbs. of biscuits are imported annually from the United Kingdom and only 17,200 lbs. from other countries. The preference in this case, therefore, is not worthy of very serious consideration. But ' I invite honorable senators to consider what has been the effect of the duty of id. per lb. which has been in force during the existence of the Commonwealth, and which was in operation in some of the States prior to Federation. It proved to be a very useful duty, under which there were established large factories, which employ a large number of hands, and whose operations have attained to very considerable dimensions. There are such factories in New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania. </para>

            <para>- Yes, I intended to deal with that. Honorable senators must know that, although the local industry has reached such a position that local manufacturers practically command the home market, and are in a position to export over 3,000,000 lbs. of biscuits annually to other parts, it is the fact that under the duty of id. per lb. they have been enabled to command the home market that has enabled them successfully to export their surplus production. We are not justified in exposing this important industry to the risk of the operations of much more colossal industries abroad. We are not justified in reducing what has been recognised as a reasonable Tariff* for its protection, and exposing it to the operations of those who, bv joining together, might dump their surplus productions- here, and thereby destroy the local industry. That has been the result in other cases, where Tariff protection has been removed. I point out that in 1903 the imports of biscuits from abroad reached 263,900 lbs., and in 1904 the quantity imported was 250,000 lbs. In 1905 it was 212,500 lbs., and in 1906 it was 219,200 lbs. Honorable senators will see from these figures that the duty of id. per lb., has not been a prohibitive duty, but has permitted a certain amount of com&gt;petition from abroad. And it is the duty of id. per lb., which I admit to be the really operative duty <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> the Tariff now before honorable senators, which is intended to be attacked by the other side. It has proved to be of substantial value to the local industry. I, therefore, ask. honorable senators to permit the protection given under the Tariff of 1902, and recommended by both sections of the Tariff Commission to be retained as the really operative duty in this item, and as it was thought desirable in another place to increase the duty against the foreigner, I ask that the additional protection against foreign importations should be maintained, and that the item, as it stands, representing a valuable compromise, should be agreed to. </para>

The honorable senator asserted that a duty of id. per lb. had been of substantial benefit, not merely in enabling local makers of biscuits to overtake the local demand, but in promoting the export of biscuits, to which reference has been made. If this duty of id. per ib., under the Commonwealth Tariff, which was passed in October, 1902, and which remained in existence until that now before the Committee came into tentative force, is what led to an export of 3,500,000 lbs. of Australian-made biscuits in 1906, will it be believed that the export of biscuits from Australia for 1902 was 3,297,711 lbs., or very nearly as much as it was in 1906 ? What then becomes of the contention that it was the duty of id. per lb. imposed upon biscuits under the first Commonwealth Tariff which led to the enormous development of the industry in Australia? </para>

            <para>- Then industries are not merely to be encouraged and developed at the expense of the consumer till they have become established, but after our manufacturers have obtained the whole of the trade, and are dumping their goods into neutral markets we are to continue to subsidize them, so that they may be able to dispose of their surplus stocks there at a lower price than they charge for them in the Commonwealth. That kind of argument must recoil upon the leader of the Government in this Chamber. The honorable gentleman also commended the proposed duty to the Senate as a compromise. What compromise? The duty of11/2d. per lb. was the Government proposal. This was one of those instances in which they ignored the unanimous recommendation of the Tariff Commission, and in which they increased the old rate of duty and that recommended by the Tariff Commission, to the extent of 50 per cent. They desired to increase it against Great Britain, to whom they now wish to extend all these signs and tokens of affection. I have no concern for the moment with the proposal contained in the next column. . </para>

            <para>- If. in spite of all the protestations of the Government in regard to the unity of the Empire, and the encouragement of trade with the Mother Country, the Vice-President of the Executive Council does not wish to extend a preference to the United Kingdom, I have no desire to force him to do so. But at the present moment we have no concern with what is contained in the next column. My honorable friend has stated that the leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives suggested this preferential concession. That is to say, that finding that a duty of11/2d.. per lb. was proposed upon biscuits, and that there was no hope of securing its reduction, he did the next best thing, namely, sought to restore the duty in respect of British goods to the rate which was formerly operative. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has' urged that action as a reason why the duty of11/2d. per lb. should be retained. It is the very reason why we should reduce it to1d. per lb. The concession of1/2d. per lb. will apply only to the 17,000 lbs. of biscuits imported from foreign countries, and not to the 200,000 lbs. imported from Great Britain. Why should we not make the duty uniform? This so-called preference is a sham, and one for which the British people will not thank us. We might extend a preference to the United Kingdom by reducing the duty which has always been levied upon biscuits entering the Commonwealth, but certainly we cannot do so by adding1/2d. per lb. to the old rate. If the Vice-President of the Executive Council does not care to make the duty a uniform one, I Shall give him an opportunity to vote in favour of extending a real preference to Great Britain by reducing the old rate of duty. </para>

          <para>. - If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> intentions had not been so explicitly stated it would still have been evident to the Senate that his only anxiety is to reduce the rate of duty proposed. It is amusing, in the circumstances, to hear him talk about extending a preference to Great Britain. Honorable senators will recognise that in another place all the efforts of those of the same way of thinking as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> were directed towards securing a reduction of the duties levied under this Tariff irrespective of the effect which their action might have. That is the reason why so many anomalies are contained in the schedule. We all know that the States have benefited by the protection which has always existed in respect of biscuits. Both sections of the Tariff Commission recommended the imposition of a duty of1d. per lb. upon this item. But that duty was not recommended with a view to shutting out the smallest competitor with Australia, but every competitor, and particularly our greatest competitor. The Commission had nothing" else in view but a desire to keep out the products of every country, Great Britain included. </para>

If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> were honestly desirous of knocking off the additional Jd. per lb., there might be some sense in his appeal, but seeing that his declared intention is to secure a reduction of the duty in the next column by £d. per lb., I warn those who wish to preserve the biscuit industry against countenancing his proposal. I trust that the Committee will adhere to the item as it stands. </para>

          <para>. - I do not wish to discuss the question of preference. My chief object is to secure a reduction of the burden of. taxation. With that end in view, if I cannot secure the remission of any particular duty. I shall certainly endeavour to obtain a reduction in favour of British importations. But I shall do so only because I cannot secure a lower duty for the rest of the world. Upon this item I would just as soon see an all-round duty of id. per lb. imposed. Great Britain does not want us to assist her in the matter of the export of biscuits. She is not afraid of the competition of the rest of the world, and it is nonsense for us to say that we can help her by giving her a preference of J-d. per lb. in respect of 17,000 lbs. of biscuits imported annually. -The thing is more than farcical. For the credit of the Commonwealth, it would 'be infinitely better for us to make the duty upon biscuits a uniform one. I would just like to answer one or two ludicrous arguments -advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> who stated that the industry had been established in Australia as the result of the operation of a protective duty. He might just as logically argue that a duty -is required to establish the industry of flour-making or- of baking. </para>

          <para>. - Apparently the only reason why the duty on this item has been increased in the general Tariff by £d. is to impose a preferential rate of id. on the small amount of biscuits imported from Great Britain. I ventured on the second reading to hint that the whole scheme of preference was largely devised for the purpose of increasing duties under the false pretence of solicitude for the interests of Great Britain. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> pointed out, and it is a matter of history, Great Britain has not asked for preference on a single item. Preference and reciprocity were talked about, and she rejected in the most dignified and precise terms any proposal for either preference or reciprocity so far as she was concerned. During the whole of this debate not a single valid argument has been advanced for the duty of 1 1/2d. I will not say that the ' arguments of the Vice-President of the Executive Council were ludicrous. Probably from his and the Government's point of view they are sufficient, but it has been made as clear as daylight - and the Minister practically admits it - that the increase from id. to 1½d. will be an inoperative tax. All this bears out strongly what I indicated on the second reading, that the preferential rates in the second column were a mere trap and a bait for increased duties. Both sections of the Tariff Commission were satisfied with the id. duty as quite sufficient for all practical purposes. That was the old protective duty. As no reason has been given for the <inline font-style="italic">hd.</inline> increase except that it is for the purpose of doing something with regard to the preferential Tariff, I shall not vote for it. Biscuits are one of the most agreeable articles of food obtainable. We produce the article in abundance for our own people, and actually export it. If this is to be. an inoperative duty, I can see no reason why it should be increased. I shall be glad if the Government and other honorable senators opposite can show that my suspicion as to the reason for the increase is unfounded. Unless otherwise advised, I intend to vote for a uniform duty of id. all round. </para>

          <para>.- I do not think that this item should pass in its present form. It is not necessary to enlarge upon the many purposes for which blue is used, and the class who generally use it very largely in their business. The old duty' was1d. It is now proposed to double it. It is true that that is recommended by the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, but the free-trade section advised the retention of the old duty. From the reports of the Commission, it is clear that the blue business is getting along fairly well. In Victoria the only complaint was that the New South Wales factories were cutting into the trade of the Victorian makers. The total value of the blue produced in Victoria at present is £15,000, whereas the total quantity imported into the Commonwealth last year was worth only £5,000 odd. The imports of blue into Victoria from other countries decreased from 100,000 lbs. in 3902 to 16,000 lbs. in 1904, while those from other States into Victoria increased from 25,000 lbs. to 71,381 lbs. in the same period. That bears out the statement that the blue industry is getting on all right except that Victoria is rather suffering at the hands of other States. The imports into the Commonwealth in 1902 were 488,000 lbs. ; they fell in the following year to 196,000 lbs. ; in 1904 they rose again to 282,000 lbs. j in 1905 they fell again to 190,000 lbs.; and in 1906 they reached 237,000 lbs. Consequently, since the imposition of the Commonwealth Tariff of 1902 the imports of blue into the Commonwealth have fallen by 251,000 lbs. If, following the lines adopted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell, we turn to the question whether the wages and labour conditions in the industry are reasonable, I have here a circular - it was not sent for this purpose - from Messrs. Harper and Company, claiming that in their starch factory the wages they are paying are quite satisfactory - and I take it that that will apply equally to their blue factory. </para>

            <para>- At any rate the business generally appears to be. fairly satisfactory. The duty is certainly not a revenue one. The total collected last year on this item was only £979 I take it, therefore, that the object of the duty is protection. A protection of double the old rate is not necessary. It is true that a certain amount of blue is still coming into the country. Possibly a slightly increased protection may further increase the production of blue in Australia. Still, as was said just now with regard to biscuits, any duty imposed on this article is a duty against the United Kingdom, because practically the whole of the blue imported now comes from there. I therefore propose to move - </para>

          <para>. - I challenge the suggestion that the consumer has had to pay more for blue by reason of the imposition of the duty. Prior to Federation, in four of the States, the duty was 2d. per lb., while in Western Australia it was 15 per cent. In Canada it is something like 25 per cent. </para>

            <para>- As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> says, that was the position in South Australia, and, I think, also in Queensland ; and the representation, which resulted from the elections, speaks for itself. The attitude I take in regard to this Tariff is dictated by my election pledges. In regard to blue, we are told that the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended that it was' necessary that the duty should be increased ; and, therefore, the Vice-President of the Executive Council proposes to increase it accordingly. Of course, the Vice-President of the Executive Council is quite justified, as a protectionist, in taking that step; but I ask whether the facts show any necessity for an increase? We are told that before the Federal Tariff of 1902 the duty was 2d. in a majority of the States. </para>

            <para>.- I will admit that, but it does not touch the present argument. In 1901 the duty was reduced to id. ; and I ask my protectionist friends whether they can show that the local production of blue fell, off in consequence of that reduction? If they cannot, is there not abundance of evidence that the reduction did not interfere with an industry that had prospered fairly well in certain States? The figures show that at present scarcely any blue is introduced from abroad; and it is apparent that, so far as preventing importation is concerned, there is no justification for an increased duty. The Vice-President of the Executive Council goes further and says that an increase in the duty will not cause any increase in the price charged to the consumer. </para>

            <para>.- If that be so, <inline font-style="italic">cui bono</inline> ? What is the use of in creasing the duty by a penny, if it will not increase the price, and enable the manufacturer to pay better wages? If the duty will not increase the price, why not make this duty 2s. or 3s. ? In any case, only about 100 tons of. blue can be affected by increased protection; and I ask whether that would make any great addition to the profits of the manufacturer ? Directly this Tariff was introduced in another place, every storekeeper put up the price of his goods to a corresponding extent. </para>

Do not we know that wherever duties are imposed prices are increased by the local manufacturers? Honorable senators may contend that if prices are increased better wages will be paid to workmen who are now insufficiently remunerated; tut the history of the Commonwealth shows that manufacturers are not inclined to increase, wages very largely, except under compulsion. </para>

            <para>.- If we can regulate wages, and those now paid are not. fair and reasonable, we should do what is possible to increase them, and, having done so, we could, if necessary, impose higher duties to enable our manufacturers to obtain adequate prices for their commodities. The imposition of duties must mean the increase of prices to consumers, for' a very long period, if not for all time to come. It may, of course, happen, where a manufacturer's output is doubled, that he can make larger profits without increasing his prices, but I ask whether the manufacture of another 100 tons of blue throughout the Commonwealth will create such an enlargement of output as to materially affect the profits of the industry. In my opinion, it would be unreasonable to think so. My attitude on this item will be adhered to in regard <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> all proposed increases, unless it can be shown that they are necessary to rectify anomalies, or special circumstances exist which justify a departure from the principles which I have laid down. </para>

            <para>- The year before last the importation of blue was considerable, although it has been demonstrated that blue can be, and is, produced in Australia. I differ from those who say that the effect of the duty has been to increase the price of this article. The difference between certain honorable senators on the abstract question of free-trade or protection will never be settled, and therefore I think that we shall be wasting time if we discuss it. I hope that Ministers will see their way to accept the proposal that the duty against Great Britain be11/2d., an increase of 50 per cent. on the old rate. </para>

Lewis and Whitty, and was the only person in Australia who thought that he had a grievance because the duty  on  blue was1d. per lb. This man, who, I' suppose, considers himself one of the largest manufacturers of blue in Australia, told the Commission that he employed only twenty adult hands ill itsmanufac- ture Is it worth while to even run the risk of increasing the price of blue to .benefit such a- small industry? </para>

            <para>- We are not dealing with an important industry, giving a tremendous amount of employment, but with an industry in which the largest manufacturer employs only twenty adults. To double the duty for the benefit of such an industry must seem, even to protectionists, a mad proposition. </para>

            <para>- I am not responsible for that. I leave the members of the protectionist section of the Commission to speak for themselves. In these matters the cost of labour is always very relevant, and this particular manufacturer stated that only one-third of the cost of making blue is represented by the wages paid for labour. No doubt in that statement he exaggerated, the probability being that the wages paid for labour do not represent one-third of the cost of the article. </para>

            <para>- At any rate, I assert that  30  per cent, is more than the average cost, though in some cases it exceeds that percentage. The question at the present time is to what extent by the duty are we going to compensate the manufacturer for the extra cost in labour? I have always considered that even protectionists recognise that as the salient feature in their doctrine ; if they do not, they ought to do so. </para>

            <para>- Protectionists have to admit that the labour cost of an article is higher, because they desire the manufacturers to pay better wages than are paid elsewhere - and that is what I should prefer to hear them say - or they have to admit what I should be sorry to' hoar any one say, and that is that Australian labour is more inefficient than other labour. There is no reason why any given article should not' be produced at the same rate in Australia as it is produced in any country, unless our manufacturers pav higher wages. </para>

            <para>- There is only one which he can with any decency adopt when it comes to a question of securing to the workmen in an industry a proper rate of wages, and that is to give fair and ample consideration to the rate of duty. In the Commonwealth there are many free-traders who are prepared to adhere to that view. If we apply that criterion to the blue industry, a duty of id. per lb. is much more than ample to cover all the difference in wages. If protectionists want to cover anything else with regard to the blue industry, what is it? Is it desired to cover inefficiency, or maladministration, or lack of initiative on the part of the manufacturers, or to add to their profits ? In this case, I can come to only one conclusion, and that is that a, duty of id. per lb. is far more than ample to cover all the difference in wages. It is sufficient to enable the manufacturers to give to every workman a fair and reasonable rate of wages. And if the duty is increased, my honorable friends will simply swell the 'profit's of the manufacturers and increase the cost to the consumers. </para>

          <para>. - So far as the Tariff is concerned, I have set myself a guiding rule, and that is to vote for effective protection wherever I see the slightest chance of an article being made in Australia. On the question of the duty on blue, I have listened with great interest to the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons.</inline> While he was very assiduous in proclaiming that only one manufacturer who gave evidence before the Tariff Commission had a grievance and desired the duty to be increased from id. to  2d.  per lb., he did not mention that there was only one witness on the other side. </para>

            <para>- I can adduce proof of that statement. A great deal of anxiety has been expressed on account of the washerwoman. The quantity of blue which is used in a household is almost infinitesimal. A knob of blue will last the washerwoman for a considerable time, and I think that she has only been trotted out by the free-traders in order to play upon the sentiment of the people. Another argument which has been advanced against the proposed increase of the duty is the fact that only twenty adults, are employed in the industry in Melbourne. </para>

            <para>- I deny that there is any taxing of the whole community. Originally blue was exclusively imported, and then it was dearer than it is now. The competition established in Australia had the effect of reducing the price. That is the very reason why I believe that the duty of  2d.  per lb. should be retained. That duty is imposed so that the manufacturer may be protected, not altogether from the cheap labour and adverse conditions existing in other parts of the world, but from what is generally known as unfair trade. </para>

            <para>- I am not taking into consideration altogether what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lewis</inline> said. He, like many other witnesses who appeared before the Tariff Commission, was a simple man who knew his own business well and knew very little about anything else. We found that many witnesses, when they were taken beyond the scope of their own business and began to talk about fiscal matters generally, knew nothing about them. But nevertheless they gave their evidence fairly. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lewis</inline> was a fair witness. When the protectionist section of the Commission came to the conclusion that a duty of  2d.  was necessary they believed that it would not increase the price to the consumer, but that it would be, a protection to the manufacturer against unfair trade, which is of far more importance in many instances as an element of competition than are the wages and conditions prevailing in competing; countries. </para>

            <para>- Most decidedly it could be done with blue just as easily as with biscuits or anything else. Another consideration is that the mere value of the article manufactured is not the whole consideration. If the washerwoman could go to the factory where the blue is manufactured with a bag, a box, or a coal scuttle, and take a shovel full of blue away with her, the value of it would be very small. But blue has to be packed in certain forms and labelled in a certain manner for distribution throughout the Commonwealth. It is this system of distribution which makes it necessary that some consideration should be given to those who are engaged in the industry. When we consider not only those who are actually engaged in the manufacture of blue but those employed in printing the labels, packing and distributing, we must certainly recognise that a great deal more labour is involved than appears from the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lewis.</inline> He stated that he employed about twenty hands in making blue. I know, as a member of the Commission, that he was very hard pressed to make a distinct statement with respect to the actual number of hands employed. The number twenty was merely his estimate. </para>

            <para>- I do not know But at all events the figure could only be an estimate, because many of the hands employed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lewis</inline> are engaged in various industries in the same factory. But whether the estimate exaggerated the employment or not honorable senators cannot but recognise, if they look at the question seriously and honestly, that twenty would be a very small proportion of the actual number employed in Australia from the time the blue entered into its manufacturing stage until it came into the hands of the washerwoman whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> is so anxious to assist. When we consider the matter in that light we shall agree that the duty proposed is not unreasonable. </para>

        <para> <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colonel NEILD</inline> (New South Wales)  [9.18].  - I think . it probable that a considerable number of honorable senators have been much interested in listening to the clamourous demand for protection for an industry more approximating to a monopoly than perhaps any other which is to be found in Australia. For the sake of a very small number of mem, women, and children - twenty at the outside - employed in making blue, the honorable senator who has just addressed the Committee clamours for an impost upon thousands of honest and hardworking, and probably very poor women, many of them seeking to support the little ones around them. It is of no use for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> to try to get away from the simple fact that I am stating. It is absolutely outside the limits of contradiction that a very large number of those engaged in laundry work are widows and poor women endeavouring to support not only children, but in the latter case, sometimes sick husbands. </para>

We have been told tonight that this is only a partial charge, and the extra expense to which the washerwoman is put in connexion with blue is a subject of jocularity. The same unfortunate under this tariff is penalized in respect of a number of other' items. The duties on blue, starch, soap, clothes-pegs, clothes-lines, mangles, washing machines, and washing boards, all press heavily upon her. The champions of labour - who are not champions of labour - occupy tonight the unpleasant position of champions of a monopoly for one or two manufacturers. I doubt whether there is one other class of labour in the community that is hit so. hard under the Tariff. as is the class on whom this duty presses. </para>

In stating that by reason of the increased duty on blue, sons of washerwomen have obtained work that they could never obtain before, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> is asking me to believe something which, in his sober moments, he would not ask me to accept. I know that he believes that his statement is true; he is supporting the Government proposal, and believes anything and everything that will assist, in his estimate, to back it up. I have made up my mind in dealing with the items in the schedule, which are really' matters of detail and not of principle, to be as brief as possible, and I am not going to lengthen my remarks on this question. I most sincerely hope not only that the general Tariff will be reduced, but that if there is any reality in the principle of preference the duty on blue imported from Great Britain will also be reduced. </para>

According to some honorable senators, our duty is to deal only, with anomalies, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has made a proposal that would give rise to the greatest anomaly of all ; I refer to the proposal that the poor washerwoman should bear the whole burden of this tax without passing on any portion of it. It is a recognised tenet of the doctrine of free-trade that every duty is, as a rule, passed on to the consumer. That being so, I do not understand why the duty on blue is to stop short at the poor washerwoman - why she in contradistinction to all others is to bear the whole burden. </para>

            <para>- I dealt from a protectionist stand-point with the duty on tapioca, and referred to the remote possibility of the industry being established here. In this case, however, the industry of manufacturing blue has been started in the Commonwealth, and we have it on the authority of a witness before the Tariff Commission that but for the imposition of a duty it would not be a live industry in New South Wales to-day. </para>

            <para>- The industry was. established in New South Wales as the result of the duty under the first Federal Tariff, and entered into competition with the industry in this State. On the authority of the witness to whom I have referred, the necessary result is that the price of blue in Victoria has been considerably reduced. The average price of blue of British manufacture is something like 3 old. per lb., whereas that of the locally-produced article is about 7d. per lb. I am still referring to the evidence of the only authority who, according to the freetrade section, is worth quoting. In the first place, the industry was started under the shelter of a duty of id. per lb.- </para>

            <para>- That is so,' because, as the honorable senator has said, and he is more of an expert in the matter than I can profess to foe, there is only an infinitesimal quantity of blue used for each shirt, and a single knob of blue will last an indefinite time. In these circumstances, though I make no appeal on her behalf any more than on behalf of any one else, it is. clear that the entire incidence of this tax falls upon the washerwoman. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> that protectionists now assent to the contention that these taxes increase the price of the commodity to the consumer. Those who advocate the new protection- and I think rightly from one point of view, though I do not commit myself finally on the point - rest their advocacy on the fact that the profits of the manufacturer are increased by means of protective duties, and that the workers in the industry have, therefore, a right to share in them. On that point, it is unnecessary to say anything further than that those who advocate the new protection, equally with those who entertain the fiscal views which I and some of my friends on this side of the Chamber ho!d, agree that that is the result. The next point clearly made out is that the duty of id. hitherto existing has led to the successful establishment of the industry in Australia. It is not merely established ; it is also a thriving industry. The figures quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> show that the imports from England have fallen off to the extent of  50  per cent. From that fact we may infer, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> evidently intended, that the industry has been sufficiently established here under a duty of id. per lb., and, therefore, by increasing the duty to  2d.  per lb. we shall either be imposing an unfair and cruel tax upon those whose livelihood depends  in part upon the use of this article, or we shall be prohibiting importations from a country whose trade we profess a desire to encourage. We profess to be anxious to encourage trade with England. </para>

        <para class="block">Chataway informed the Committee that in 1906 we imported from the United Kingdom 237,008 lbs. of blue, valued at £5,483, and I say that if we intend to make any reduction in this duty we should do so directly and honestly, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has suggested. It would be a pretence and a sham to make the reduction as a concession to the United Kingdom and as an encouragement to her trade, when she already has the whole of it. The total importations from other countries for 1906 represented a value of only £10 as against importations from the United Kingdom valued at £5,483. Practically the whole import of blue is from the United Kingdom, and I say, therefore, that if we intend to reduce this duty we should request the House of Representatives to make the duty what it was before, giving the industry ' in Australia the same measure of protection as that under which it has been successfully established. I shall, therefore, be found supporting the request moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> to make the duty on this article1d. per lib., as it was before. </para>

I do not disguise the fact that the first desire of the Government is to protect our industries against the world, the United Kingdom included. But if we are to trade with other communities in connexion with our leading lines of industry, we desire that that trade shall be with the United Kingdom. </para>

        </quote>
        <para>To show that the industry is really fairly on its feet, and that the loss of1/2d. per lb. would not be a serious matter, I should like to add that last year we exported 71/2 tons of blue. Although tons of that was evidently imported to send away again, 4 tons of it was the Australian product. It has been said that a United Kingdom duty of11/2d., seeing that nearly the whole of the imports come from that country, would be in the nature of a farce. Some honorable senators may consider the whole idea of preference within the Empire or towards the Old Country a farce, but I do not, and I am only sorry that the Tariff is not framed, like that of Canada, with a distinct percentage with regard to the United Kingdom all through. Seeing that that has not been done, I prefer, wherever I can obtain a decrease of duty, to have that decrease put in the United Kingdom column, so that the Old Country may get the benefit of it. </para>

          <para>- - I acknowledge the fairness with which the position has been put by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway.</inline> But at the same time, as I intimated at the outset, the policy of the Government is to go for protection every time against every country, so far as our industries need it. We have come to the conclusion that this industry does require additional protection, and in these circumstances I think, especially having regard to the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, that the Committee would be well advised to maintain the duty as proposed by the Government. </para>

We have had columns, nay pages,' of the press of Australia and England filled with assertions about Australia holding out the hand of friendship, and the helping hand, to the struggling industries of the Old Country. I am not sure that we have not been likened to the dove carrying an olive branch. I think the Prime Minister was depicted as the dove out of the ark of Australia carrying the olive branch of preference to the benighted land on the other side of the sea. Now, after all these professions of enduring affection and every kind of goodwill, the Minister stands up here, and says that the policy of the Government is not preference to. England at all, but red-hot protection - the nearest possible thing to prohibition that he and his astute colleagues can devise. If a Minister's declaration amounts to anything, the declaration of the Vice-President of the Executive Council to-night is a formal Ministerial assertion that there is not one iota of reality in the Government's assertion of preference, and that after all we come back to the bed-rock of solid Victorian protection, now extended to all parts of the Commonwealth, as the Minister says, against the world. I think the honorable senator has made an utterance to-night which, when he is a few days older, and has had an opportunity of seeing what other people think and say about it, will cause him a spasm of regret. </para>

            <para>- Yes. This is an industry where preference to Great Britain would be of very little value, but There are some large items in the Tariff in regard to which I have no doubt that it can be shown that a substantial benefit can be given to Great Britain. We should therefore not waste time in trifling with a  small  item like this, when it has been clearly shown that 2d. is necessary even against Great Britain. If honorable senators opposite had really wished to give a preference, they could have made the duty higher against other parts of the world. </para>

          <para>. - We can all frankly admit that the preference on this item exists only in name. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> that if would have been better to adopt some general principle in regard to preference as applied to all the items ; but I am not going to vote for this amendment. The question before us is whether a duty of i1/2d. per lb. is sufficient to give Australia a fair and reasonable protection in the manufacture of blue; and the figures show that the importations, with a duty of1d., amounted to a little over 100 tons. That, to some honorable senators, appears a small quantity, while others regard it as considerable. But it must be borne in mind that a duty of11/2d. represents an increase of 50 per cent. on the previous duty, and that, therefore, a considerable advantage is given to an industry which was fairly prosperous with a duty of1d. The Vice-President of the. Executive Council, as leader of the Senate, has, of course, to support the Tariff as nearly as possible in its present shape, but I hope he will not adhere to it too strictly in regard to the present item. </para>

          <para>. - It is a very strange kind of preference that is proposed. Last year, when there was a duty of1d. per lb., Great Britain managed to send us £5,000 worth of blue, and now, in order to show the Old Country a preference, we are asked to make the duty11/2d. Personally, I find myself in a difficult position. So far as the proposal represents preference, I should not dream of voting for it, but. as it represents some sort of relief to the Australian taxpayer, I feel compelled to support it. My one object is to reduce the burden of taxation, and, if I cannot reduce it all round, I may find myself occasionally obliged to lend myself to an absolute farce in order to do something small, but real, for the Australian consumer. </para>

The proposal before the Committee is to reduce the duty on butter and cheese. While I, as a free-trader, would welcome a reduction of the duty, still, in view of the pledge I gave to the electors when seeking their support, it is absolutely impossible for me to do anything else than to vote against a proposal to reduce any duty which stood in the old Tariff. </para>

            <para>- It was encouraged by a bonus, and a good deal of the money went undoubtedly into the wrong pockets. But the result of the bonus or duty, or both, has been that the industry in Australia has become an established fact which can never be shaken. In 1906 we exported 75,765,536 lbs. of Australian-made butter to the value of . £3,238,304. Whether it existed in the old Tariff or not, it is farcical for us to sit here and impose a duty such as is proposed. Either it is perfectly nonsensical, and will be entirely inoperative, or it is simply kept in the Tariff when there is absolutely no colour or reason for its retention. </para>

            <para>- On what possible principle are we going to act in dealing with these duties? Is this duty wanted for the purpose of encouraging the production of butter? Nobody can say that it is. Is it wanted for the purpose of maintaining the production of butter ? Nobody can say that it is, because we have the command of practically the English market. We know that owing to the quality of our butter we can compete with the finest Danish butter. I have no objection to some duty being imposed on cheese which may suit particular palates. Some persons may desire special French or Swiss cheeses. But when we are talking so much about preference, and encouraging the unity of the Empire, would it not be a good thing for us to consider the question of preference nearer home? Should we not reflect for a moment that the greater proportion of our imported cheese comes from New Zealand? Why should we impose a duty to keep out New Zealand cheese, or a duty to such an extent as this? I notice that in 1906 we exported 246,631 lbs. of Australian-made cheese. The imports of cheese from New Zealand in 1906 were 51,205 lbs. Pretty well half the quantity imported came from British Possessions. But we export nearly as much as we import. We export butter in millions of pounds weight, and over three millions and a quarter sterling in value annually. It is perfectly absurd to impose such a duty as this. </para>

We could just as well put a duty on wool as on butter, because the price of wool in London rules the price of wool in Australia precisely as the price of butter in London rules the price of butter out here. I should be glad if the two items, butter and cheese, could be dealt with separately, because we do import some cheese, whereas the butter imports amount practically to nothing. The duty on butter has positively no influence whatever on the price the people have to pay. But I suppose that like that blessed word " Mesopotamia," in the old story, the duty of 3d. has a soothing influence on the bucolic mind ; and if it gives them pleasure to see a duty of 3d. per- lb., I can see no harm in retaining it. When we come to deal with cheese, however, I trust that some honorable senator will propose a preference in. favour of the United Kingdom. </para>
