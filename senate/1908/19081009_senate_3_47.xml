            <para>-  I beg to ask the Minister of Home Affairs, without notice, a question regarding stationery requisites, which I think axe looked after in his Department. I have received an envelope of so unusual a character that I want him to tell me about it if he can. Hitherto, Senate printing on  His  Majesty&#39;s Service has always had the Royal coat of arms on the flap of the envelope. That practice has been departed from, and an impressed stamp of Victoria has been substituted. I should like to know if my honorable friend can give any information about the matter ? . </para>

            <para>- I think that the honorable senator hid better give notice of the question. The stationery to which he has referred is possibly stationery of the Parliament, and not stationery of the Department. From time to time the Department has forwarded to the offices reserved to members of Parliament in the State capitals stationery of the Parliament, but it is in no sense responsible for the get up of the stationery. It merely obtains a supply from the Parliament, and has it forwarded through its offices for the use of members of Parliament in the places reserved to them. </para>

Importers and agents in various parts of the Commonwealth are very much interested in this matter, and I desire to know why the provision on the subject in the last Bill was not included in the present Bill, and what are the intentions of the Government in that regard? </para>

          <para>- Unfortunately, I have nota copy of the Bill of  1904  at the present moment, but I remember the clause to which my honorable.f riend has referred, and which was included under the heading of &#34;Goods.&#34; After full consideration, and having regard to the fact that each State had a law with regard to the delivery of goods, and that if we attempted to deal with that big subject it should be dealt with in a comprehensive measure, so as to have a uniform law for the Commonwealth, it was considered desirable to delete the clause, especially so as we wanted to in- clude within the four corners of the Bill only matters relating to navigation and shipping. As the subject of goods was outside that category, it was thought desirable that it should not be partially dealt with in the Navigation Bill, but that on a future occasion it should be dealt &#39;with in a comprehensive measure. </para>

            <para>- I am aware that in the New Zealand Tariff, a difference in duty does exist as between Commonwealth and South African produce. I am also aware that last year, the imports of South African wines into the Dominion were valued at &#163;20, and those of Australian wines at  &#163;22, 000.  So far, the latter has not felt very seriously the competition of the former. This, of course, is a matter over; which, we have no control. It will be remembered that we did negotiate with the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seddon,</inline> and entered into an arrangement with &#34;him for a reciprocal treaty. That treaty, as my honorable friend knows, was not accepted by New Zealand. We shall be glad to enter into a mutually satisfactory arrangement with the Dominion, and in any future negotiations the subject mentioned by ray honorable friend will receive consideration. </para>

Instructions to bring New South Wales into line with the other States in this respect are in abeyance pending the result of a trial now in progress of a new system of distributing these lists which, if satisfactory, will remove a serious objection raised to the adoption of such lists in Sydney. </para>

          <para>. - Now that the heat which was engendered by yesterday&#39;s debate has probably evaporated, it may be well for us to get back to the bed-rock of the question under consideration. It is of very little importance whether or not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith&#39;s</inline> statement that most Boards of which he has any knowledge consist of &#34; disappointed politicians and bank wreckers &#34; is correct or otherwise. It would be well for us to confine ourselves to determining the simple question of whether in matters of this kind it is desirable that a certain amount of management should be undertaken by an independent Board. Of course the Ministry will always be responsible for questions of policy, but personally T am of opinion that the administrative portion of the Act should be vested in an effective Board. I thoroughly appreciate the position of those who urge that we ought not to create an independent Board to administer this measure, but that the Minister himself should personally attend to all matters in his Department, and be responsible for every detail in administration. But I would remind my honorable friends that if they take up that attitude upon this subject, they must adopt a similar attitude in respect of all other matters. If the argument that Parliament must be in a position to criticise and discuss every point of Government administration is to have any  weight,  then the Government must always be responsible directly to Parliament. My own view is that a certain amount of power should be delegated to an independent Board. If that were done, the Minister would not be open to criticism if certain actions of the Board did  not  meet with parliamentary approval. I quite recognise that at the present moment it is not our function to discuss certain proposals which are likely to claim our attention before long. But I&#39; understand that the Government contemplate handing over very definite powers to a Board which they intend to appoint. Should that Board be established will it be composed- - as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has suggested - of &#34; disappointed politicians and bank wreckers?&#34; That was the strongest argument which was advanced by the very versatile Government whip. Indeed, it is the principal argument which has been adduced against the appointment of an independent Board such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> proposes. I need scarcely point out that the more the Commonwealth takes over duties for the community as a whole, the more it will be found necessary to delegate certain of its powers to independent bodies. For instance, if we nationalize industries, how can every detail in their management be discussed upon the floor of Parliament ? The necessity  for creating such bodies has already been recognised in connexion with the construction of roads and bridge&#39;s. Parliament, has deliberately delegated the power to make roads, bridges, and harbors to independent bodies. The only power which Parliament can exercise over these bodies is that of controlling their  borrowings. </para>

            <para>- Some of them are elected by the ship-owners. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has not stated that the Board which he proposes should not be elected partly by the ship-owners and partly by the seamen. Indeed, I think that he had some idea of that kind in his mind. The point at issue is not whether the Archbishop of Canterbury is a member of the Board of Trade which was established some  300  years ago. All the nonsense that was talked in that connexion, yesterday was quite beside the question. The issue which we have to determine is : Are we prepared to affirm that in the management of such an immense business as that of navigation, Parliament should delegate certain powers to a Board specially constituted for the purpose - a Board which will be independent of the Ministry of the day, but not independent of Parliament?- </para>

          <para>. - I entirely disagree with the amendment submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> One of the chief reasons why he advocates the creation of a Board to administer the Act is that the Minister of Trade and Customs will probably be amenable to back-door influence. He fears that members of Parliament might buttonhole the Minister in his back parlour, with the result that for the time being he might administer the Act in a way that would not be in the public interest. But I would point out that all his fears in this connexion apply with much stronger force to any Board which might be created. Under such a system we should have the ship-owners and persons interested in shipping buttonholing the members of the Board at their club table every clay in the week. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> has pointed out that certain powers have been delegated by Parliament to various bodies.*&#39; In that connexion I would remind him that the experience of Queensland has been a1 very lamentable one. That is the conclusion at which the public of that State have long since arrived. In order to control Government advertising in  that State, a Board was created. With what result? When the party of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> is a member was in Ministerial office, that honorable senator&#39;s newspaper always received fat advertisements, whilst the unfortunate Labour newspaper could not secure a solitary advertisement. That is absolutely solid fact. In the same State a Public Service Board was appointed, which proved the veriest of dead letters. It merely served as a rampart behind which Ministers were able to shelter themselves whenever it suited their purpose to do so. That Board had neither power nor authority, or if it had, it had. not the courage to exercise it. Eventually it had to be wiped out, because of the scandalous condition of things which  developed under it. The representatives of Queensland in this Chamber must be aware of these facts. There is no analogy whatever between the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and the creation of bodies charged with the control of Roads and Bridges and Harbor Boards. The vesting of such bodies with certain powers merely involves an extension of local government. They are thus rendered more directly responsible to the persons immediately concerned than they would be if the control of such matters remained with Parliament. </para>

But if we retain Ministerial control, the administration of the Act, even down to the minutest detail, wilt always be open to full discussion in Parliament. I repeat that we could not secure that discussion under a Board system. </para>

            <para>- It is not the reverse that I am advocating. There can be control by the people&#39;s representatives over the persons chosen. From the point of view of honorable senators opposite, a Board under this Bill would be absolutely useless unless it occupied the position of a Judge, who cannot be removed except upon an address from both Houses of the Parliament. Otherwise the Board would not be independent. A member of it would have to be so situated as to be irremovable, unless he was guilty of something outrageously wrong. The control of a Minister is a much simpler matter. The history of Australia furnishes many instances of the removal of Ministers for breach of trust. That fact shows that Parliament can and does exercise control over Ministers. There have been times in Australia when Governments have been exceedingly short-lived. It has only been when Conservatives have got into power that, by means of machinations, and by resort to all sorts of dodges to retain office, the practices to which I refer have been perpetrated. </para>

            <para>- The report of the proceedings of the Navigation Conference shows that over and over again the  President  said that he would consult with the Board of Trade to obtain their opinion. It is quite distinct from a mere committee or a -set of officials directive under the control of the Minister. It act&#39;s.. as Boards usually do, and has become at  very influential instrument for the administration of commerce within the ambit of itsauthority. It is in this respect the most, authoritative body in the world. It is useless for honorable senators opposite to depreciate the Board of Trade in that respect, because the Navigation Conference report shows that our delegates, as well asthe English representatives, consulted it frequently. </para>

            <para>- It is simplyjuggling with terms to call such a body a myth, and to say that it does not exercisegreat authority. One justification forSenator Mil len &#39;s amendment is that the railways of this country have practically been taken out of the hands of Ministersand put under the control of Commissioners. The former practice was to have the railways directly under Ministerial control. Owing to political weakness, orcorruption, which arose in connexion with that administration, and formed an impediment to the development of thecountry, the Australian States took out of the hands of the Minister the control of therailways, and intrusted it to Commissioners. </para>

            <para>- Just so, and Committees may be appointed under this Bill for other purposes. We shall be entitled when we come to those provisions to ask how those Committees are to be constituted, and what are to be their functions, powers, and limitations. Will, for instance, the Advisory Committee referred to consist of independent men, or of officials of the Public Service? Will it consist of experts taking independent action, or of officials under the control of a Minister? If this Committee and the other Committees contemplated under the Bill are to consist of officials under the control of the Minister, we may be sure that, if he is a strong man, he will sooner or later bend them to his will. If, on the other hand, we established a Board to administer the law, and set out its powers plainly in the Bill, it would not be possible for any Minister to influence its members. </para>

            <para>- Certainly. A great deal of the work performed by the Board of Trade is laid down in the Merchant Shipping Act, and there is such a thing as common law and maritime law, portions of which are included in the Merchant Shipping Act, and some portions of which are not included in that measure. If the administration of this Bill is placed in the hands of officials coming directly under the control of the Minister, they will sooner or later, if he is a strong man, be brought under his heel. On the other hand, if we appoint a Board to administer the measure, and define its limits and powers, we shall have a body of men who will, in the interests of the people, be in the fortunate position of being able to meet the Minister, however strong he may be, with the well-known quotation from <inline font-style="italic">Shakspeare, &#34;</inline> Go to.&#34; It would not be so with a Committee, advisory or otherwise, composed of men taken from the Public Service. Honorable senators must be aware from their knowledge of the history of government in every State in Australia, that a strong Minister, sooner or later, is able to make the officials under him come round to his way of thinking. </para>

          <para>. - If instead of quoting <inline font-style="italic">Shakspeare</inline> on matters which have no bearing upon this Bill, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger had quoted that authority on navigation, his remarks would have been more to the purpose. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has declined to submit any tangible reason for his amendment. Seeing that the honorable senator has proposed so radical an alteration of the principle of the Bill, we might very well have expected him to submit his proposal in some definite form. The honorable senator has adopted a very unfair course in springing upon the Committee an amendment involving so important an alteration of the measure, without letting honorable senators know anything definite about what he really intends. He was asked whether such a body as the Board of Trade would fit in with his idea of the control of the administration of the measure. So far as I could gather the honorable senator appeared to agree that it would. May I remind the Committee that the Board of Trade represents probably the most comprehensive department of government in the Old Country. It is intrusted with nearly every function of government in the sphere of industry and shipping. It deals with harbor and marine work, under the Shipping and Navigation laws ; and it controls the railways of the United Kingdom, so far as the Imperial Government exercises any jurisdiction over them. It deals with matters of finance; it administers the whole of the labour laws, and collects information affecting industrial conditions, which is distributed in a circular published every month; it has to deal with almost every matter connected with commerce; it has a statistical department of its own, and it deals withquestions of bankruptcy. If there is any intention on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to establish such a Board here, to control the administration of this measure, it is only fair that we should ask the honorable senator to give the Committee some clear indication of what his proposal involves. </para>

            <para>- I have certainly criticised the honorable senator for not having submitted something definite: Last week the Vice-President of the Executive Council invited honorable senators who had amendments to propose to have them printed. That would be only fair to the Minister, and to honorable senators generally, as they would then be given an opportunity to consider the proposals made. and would be able to discuss them. At the present time, it is not too much to say, that the Committee does not know what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has put before it. He has certainly submitted an amendment which. involves so radical an alteration of the principle of the measure that he ought to have dealt with it on the second reading. </para>

            <para>- Parliament cannot criticise a Board of officials as readily as it can criticise a Minister. As a case in point, I refer honorable senators to the Public Service Commissioner. We are loath to criticise him, no matter what he does, because he cannot be here to defend himself. It is wrong in principle to place an important Department of government under officials so far removed from parliamentary control. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> in discussing the matter, made some reference to the Inter-State Commission, saying that possibly the Board which he suggested might take over the work of the Inter-State Commission when created. </para>

            <para>- I have not the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report before me, but I under stood the honorable senator to say that the Board which he suggested would do the work of the Inter-State Commission and administer this measure. If it is to be intrusted with all these functions, there are other branches of government which might just as reasonably be handed over to it. This is too big a question for us to deal with in Committee. From the latest files of English newspapers to hand I learn that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd-George,</inline> the  President  of the Board of Trade, has returned from a trip to the Continent, where he had gone to do official work. That reminds me that that Board has the power to arrange treaties with foreign Powers. Accompanied by Captain Chalmers, who is, I think, the leading officer of the Board in regard to navigation and shipping matters, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd-George</inline> proceeded to the Continent, where he arranged with Germany a treaty regarding the load line. To show the enormous ramifications of the Board of Trade I may mention that while he was in Germany <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd-George</inline> also inquired into the working of the oldage pensions system and other industrial matters, which in the Old Country are controlled by that Board. From those facts it will be recognised, I think, that this is too big a proposal for us to consider in Committee and on such short notice. </para>

          <para>. - No doubt if honorable senators were to make an earnest attempt to thoroughly understand each other they would ultimately come to the same conclusion. I believe that every honorable  senator is endeavouring, from his point of view, to make the Bill as effective as possible with respect to navigation and shipping. I agree to a very considerable extent with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that ultimately it may be found necessary to create another Department to deal with Customs and other matters of a kindred character. But if we adopt the principle which he advocates we might as well throw out the Bill, because it would require to be amended from beginning to end. </para>

            <para>- It is necessary to pass a Bill in order to bring into existence Commissioners and officers, and invest them with the necessary powers. Let us consider the difference between a Bill dealing with navigation and shipping and a Bill dealing with the railways or the Public Service, or anything which is owned and controlled by the Government. I do not wish to discuss whether it was wise to place the railways in Commission-, but merely to point out that in each State the railways are owned by the Government, and are worked as a business concern. It was for that reason that in practically all the States the railways were intrusted to the management of Commissioners. But in this Bill we are dealing with ships which for the most part are owned by private companies, some being registered in Australia, and others in foreign parts. The object of this legislation is to control the relations between those private companies and the general public. That is an entirely different thing from dealing with our own ships. Suppose that the Commonwealth had assumed the entire control of the Inter  state  trade, and was running its own ships. Then there would be something in the argument that they should.be placed under the control of Commissioners in order that they might be on exactly the same footing as the railways of the States. There is no analogy between the control of public railways and the control of privatelyowned ships. We are piling on to the different Ministers function . after function. The Minister of Trade and Customs has to deal with many things other than Customs matters, and his Department is to be intrusted by this Bill with the control of the navigation and shipping affairs of Australia. The administration of trade marks, patents, and industrial affairs would probably be intrusted to the Board of Trade, if such a body were instituted here. But if we followed the example of the Old Country, I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and his friends must admit that our Board of Trade would be a Government Department. In the Old Country the Board of Trade is as much a Government Department and as much under political influence and parliamentary control as is our own Trade and Customs Department. </para>

            <para>- That is what I am endeavouring to point out. When any or all of the existing Departments are found to be overburdened with matters of an entirely different character from those which they were originally intended to administer, it may be found necessary to create another Department. When that time arrives, a Bill can be introduced and properly discussed, and such questions as navigation and shipping, patents, and industrial matters can be handed over to the new Department, and so relieve the others. I think that it would be unwise and injudicious to take that step at the present time. It will be seen that the next clause of the Bill empowers the Minister to delegate his powers. </para>

            <para>- Yes, he can form a Marine Board in almost every part in the Commonwealth. He can form Boards or appoint Commissioners to represent him in almost every port. But that power is given to the Minister on the understanding that it is to be judiciously exercised. If it is not exercised judiciously, he can be brought to book in Parliament for any act of mal-administration either by himself or by any Commissioner whom he appointed to discharge certain duties. Something has been said regarding the appointment of the Inter-State Commission. Notwithstanding that under the Constitution that body has specified functions, there is. nothing to prevent this Parliament decreeing that its services shall be at the disposal of the Minister to assist him in matters of this kind. But in order that such a body might be placed on all fours with the British Board of Trade it would require to be created a separate Department. I hope that the clause in its present form will be retained with a view to giving it a fair trial. I am sure that should the necessity arise, every honorable senator will be only too willing to assist in the appointment of special Boards or Commissioners for the purpose of assisting the Minister to carry out the functions vested in him. </para>

          <para>. - I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> ought to be blamed in any way for having raised the very grave issue of whether the administration of this measure should be in the hands of the Minister of Trade and Customs, or be vested&#34; in some kind of Marine Board. That is a very fair issue to raise, and I do not agree that its discussion has involved a waste of time. Under this Bill very great powers are vested in the Minister, and the point we have to consider is whether it would not be better to vest those powers in a Board. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has admitted that by our legislation we are continually multiplying the Departments under the control of Ministers. Already the Minister of Trade and &#39; Customs is charged with the administration of fifteen or sixteen Acts of Parliament. How is it possible for any Minister to thoroughly master all the details connected with the working of so many Departments ? </para>

            <para>- Exactly. This will be the case more and more if we continue to pile up the number of Departments in the charge of individual Ministers. It is impossible for the Minister of Trade and Customs to grasp the whole of the details connected with the administration of so many different Acts of Parliament, and he must necessarily depend upon .his chief officer in each case. Now, I doubt whether that course is a wise one. Very great powers must be conferred in connexion with the administration of this Act, and very great interests - commercial and industrial - have to be considered in its working. To my mind, that is another reason why we should appoint a Board of experts consisting of men who possess knowledge, both of the commercial and industrial aspects of navigation, to superin tend its administration. It has been said that we have already adopted the system of allowing our State railways to ,be controlled by Commissioners. I recognise, however, that the two things are scarcely analogous. For all questions of policy connected with the working of our railways the Ministry of the day accepts responsibility. The Commissioners are appointed merely to administer the Act as they find it, and they cannot frame a regulation unless it has first been approved by Parliament. I take it that the position of a Board such as is contemplated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> would be an exactly similar one. My own impression is that this measure would be better administered by an expert Board than by the Minister. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has left the composition of* the Board entirely open. At this stage he merely desires to affirm a principle. </para>

            <para>- It may be. But we have to remember that Ministers are only human. If I were Minister o&#39;f Trade and Customs I might possibly be disposed to administer this measure in a way, that would please my political supporters, but if a- Board were appointed to administer it I should be relieved from that temptation. It has been admitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> that the time may come when Boards of this kind will have to be created, and it is for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to consider whether he will recognise that fact or press his amendment at the present stage. Personally I believe that we should secure more efficient administration of this measure by the appointment of a Board thoroughly familiar with the interests affected by it, than we shall by leaving  its administration entirely to the Minister. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> decides to press his amendment I shall be found voting for it; but, perhaps, in view of what has been stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> he will deem it wise to withdraw it. I quite recognise that the appointment of an independent Board would necessitate the passing of a special Act of Parliament. But such a body, I contend, would be free from all political influence, and would be able to discharge its functions without fear of the consequence of its acts. </para>

            <para>- They might know infinitely less. History shows us that it is not always the capable men who are appointed to such Boards. But Parliament would always have control over the Minister. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie put the matter admirably when he said that we always have the Minister before us. He always feels his responsibility to Parliament just as does the  President  of the Board of Trade. But the member of a Board may be a woodenhead,  so far as much of the business that he has to do is concerned. Place the responsibility upon such a body, and Parliament can do nothing but criticise. The Minister will then be in. a position to answer any criticism with the remark - &#34; What you say may be perfectly true, but I am not responsible for it. It has been done by the Board appointed under the Act.&#34; If we pass <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Mullen&#39;s  amendment, we shall establish a principle that will alter the construction of the Bill absolutely. It will involve the application of a system of which we have absolutely no knowledge in Australia in matters of this kind. Therefore, I shall- vote against the amendment. </para>

          <para>. - The attention that honorable senators have directed to my amendment affords full warrant for my action in proposing it. The criticism directed to  it may be divided into two. classes. One kind of criticism had relation to the principle which I have sought to bring under review, namely, that we should establish a Board removed from political influence rather than have control by a Minister. I am rather sorry that so little of the criticism of honorable senators has been directed to that main principle. With the exception of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley, Senator Givens,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> most honorable senators have not directed attention to it. The Minister himself led off by saying very little about it, and by attacking the character of the Board which he was good enough to construct, as the one which he said I had suggested. &#187; </para>

            <para>- The Minister attacked the Board of Trade, and suggested that I had  advocated that a similar body should be established here. I am going to quote my own speech from the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report, to show what it was that I did advocate. But let me first point out what a nice muddle I should have been in if I had really advocated any particular form of Board. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie and others have said that I should have suggested in my amendment a scheme to take the place of that proposed by the Government. If I had done so, the Minister would have attacked the details of the scheme, and would have said nothing about the principle. I took a course which I thought would be convenient to the Committee, and which was, in fact, the only course which would enable every honorable senator to give a vote on the question of whether he was in favour of leaving the administration under political control or not. Now let me quote from what I said yesterday. My words were - </para>

          <para>I have no desire to multiply officers and offices, and increase the demands upon the public  Treaosury.  It would be idle to suggest the creation of a body specially for this Act if there is in the minds of the Government a fixed intention to call into being some such Board as I have indicated. I cannot say whether the Government intend to appoint a Board of Trade or an Inter-State Commission, or both, or neither, and, until the Minister makes the position of the Government clear, I am not in a position to advocate one or the other. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>That made my position abundantly clear ; and I felt a &#39;little bit hurt and disappointed that honorable senators should have sought to make out that I was neglecting my responsibility in not coming forward with a scheme to take the place of that of the Bill. I wish to refer only to one other matter. The Minister said that if we adopted the amendment we should have to recast the whole Bill. That is entirely incorrect. All that would be necessary would be to substitute the word &#34; Board &#34;&#39;for the word &#34;Minister&#34; wherever it occurred. For the most part, the powers conferred on the Minister could be conferred on the Board, and the necessary functions could be discharged by it without reference to him. The Minister is given power 10 do certain things &#34; as prescribed.&#34; They would be just the same, whether prescribed by the Minister or by the Board. There need not be five minutes of time spent in altering the Bill if my amendment is carried. </para>

            <para>- Nothing of the kind would be required. But even if it were, is that a serious reason for objecting to the principle of my amendment? There are honorable senators who have not merely hesitated to propose the passing of Bills but have asked that the Constitution should be altered, when something which they thought desirable was prevented by a provision in it. tOn the same ground, I say, that the mere fact that we should have to pass another Bill is no argument against my amendment. If it is desirable to do&#39; something, anc! we have to amend the Constitution to enable it to be done, the mere fact that a fresh Bill would be required is no reason for not doing it. I have submitted the amendment with a recognition of the fact that it is not likely to be carried. But still it seemed to me to enunciate a principle that is not merely important so far as this Bill is concerned, but also in relation to the discharge of the functions of government in this country. </para>

          <para>. - I have great difficulty in discovering the reason for this apprehension on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie.</inline> The honorable senator should know that this is the usual clause introduced in all similar legislation since the commencement of the Commonwealth. A similar provision will be found in the Customs Act, Post and Telegraph Act, Quarantine Act, Patents Act, and other Acts. It is essential for the purposes of administration. It would be impossible to administer this measure, or any of the Acts I have mentioned, unless this power were provided. The clause would enable the Minister, if he thought proper, to appoint a chief navigation officer in each of the States, who would be responsible for the administration of the Act in that State. But the Minister, as head of the Department, would, of course, still be responsible for everything that was done. The Bill provides for the appointment of advisory Committees for certain specified purposes. The appointment of such a Board as was involved in the amendment on clause  6,  submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> is quite a different matter. Such a Board would require to be a corporate body. </para>

If it was desired to create Boards such as that involved in the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> in the last clause, we should have to come to Parliament to provide the necessary machinery. Were it not for a clause of this kind, the centralization of the administration would be intolerable, and the Act would be unworkable.

I assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> that there is no room for apprehension. To strike out the clause would be to render the Bill absolutely unworkable. </para>

I endeavoured to show that the clause appears in its present form merely because of the necessity the draftsmen were under to insert the words &#34; of the Commonwealth &#34; in following a provision of a State enactment. If the Minister objects to the amendment, I shall not bother about it. </para>

          <para>- - In the face of the section which the Minister quoted, and which I believe applies to the interpretation of all Acts, I want to know where is the necessity for enacting clause 7 of this Bill. If there is a necessity, is the power contained in the Acts Interpretation Act enlarged or curtailed by clause 7? In that Act Parliament gave very wide powers in regard to delegating and appointing on the part of a Minister when he has the right to do certain things. In view of that fact at first sight it would seem that clause 7 of this Bill is unnecessary. </para>

          <para>. We are now invited to consider the first clause of Division 1. The. division is headed &#34; General&#39;&#34; and the clause provides that the provisions of this part of the law shall apply to only British ships, but clause 12 deals with &#34;a ship registered in Australia.&#34; Does it differentiate between ships registered in Great Britain and ships registered in Australia? Is one ship British and one not, or are both ships British ? </para>

          <para>. - It is desirable to notice the alteration which has been made in the wording of this clause. In the original Bill the provision was drafted so as to apply only to British ships registered in Australia or carrying passengers or cargo. But in this Bill it is made to include British ships that trade everywhere, and of course it excludes foreign ships. To the extent to which it restricts the operations of British ships it is helping the foreigner against the Britisher. </para>

I need scarcely remind the Committee that in replying to the criticisms of honorable senators upon the motion for the second reading of the Bill I dealt with this very question at great length. I showed that British legislation did not attempt to interfere with foreign ships in matters of this kind. I also showed that by the terms &#39; of the Merchant Shipping Act - by sections 735 and 736 - we are invited to deal as we think proper with this class of matter. I pointed out that we are merely legislating in the way that the States were accustomed to legislate prior to Federation, and in the way that New Zealand legislated in the Act of 1903, which was assented to by the British Government. As to the altered form of this provision, that is substantially a matter of draftsmanship. </para>

        <para>As a result of that amendment, foreign passenger steamers calling at ports in England for passengers are now subject to the whole of the regulations of the British Board of Trade.

          <para>. - Of course, the question asked by the honorable senator is a very big one, but, speaking generally, I do not think that the Merchant Shipping Act of 1906 has altered any  of the matters referred to in Part II. of the principal Act, so far as foreign ships are concerned. I make that statement subject to correction. Part II. refers amongst other things to contracts entered into by masters and foreign owners with their own people. The whole trend of British legislation is in the direction of noninterference with those contracts. But under the legislation enacted by the Imperial Parliament in 1906, a foreign vessel which is deemed to be unseaworthy may be detained and the same penalty may be imposed in case of overloading or undermanning. It is only in respect of these matters that British legislation attempts to interfere with foreign ships. </para>

        <para>Sentor GUTHRIE- That is not my objection to this provision.

            <para>- But the VicePresident of the Executive Council knows the meaning of this provision perfectly well. It means that if a dispute takes place, and ship-owners are obliged to scour crimping boarding-houses, the seamen secured there will not be signed on at the shipping office, but will be taken elsewhere. Only a few months ago men were signed on in a tobacconist&#39;s shop in King-street, Sydney, before a Government official. </para>

            <para>- If honorable senators are sincere in their declarations that they intend to deal stringently with crimping and desertion, they will support my amendment; because this is the first step that should be taken to put down such offences. If every man who signs ships articles, or who is discharged from a ship, has to go to a shipping office, there is a means of checking where he comes from. But to pass the clause as it stands means leaving a loophole to crimps and others to carry on their nefarious traffic. The present practice is absolutely accountable for crimping and desertion. Say that a ship&#39;s master has promised an engagement to some man who he knows has deserted from another ship. He goes to the superintendent and says, &#34; Will you oblige me by coming to some other place than your own office to sign on some members of my crew.&#34; The superintendent answers, &#34;I cannot come now, because I am busy.&#34; Then the master says, &#34; Come at 5 o&#39;clock, and I will pay your overtime.&#34; That overtime is not paid into the Treasury, but goes into the pocket of the superintendent, who is only too glad of such an opportunity to make a few shillings. But what is the result? If one of the men who signed on has deserted from another ship, the superintendent, not having his office records with him, knows nothing about it. If honorable senators say, &#34; Let us abolish the office of . superintendent, and give the seaman the right to engage where he likes, leaving the shipowner to get his men where he can,&#34; I reply that it would be far better to do that than to perpetuate the present practice. We should not offer encouragement to Government officials to make additions to their salaries. When the Electoral Act was under consideration - a measure in which honorable senators were directly interested - they strongly objected to a justice of the peace visiting houses and taking the declarations of absent voters. The same principle applies here. We supply the superintendent with offices for the transaction of his business.  His  business ought to be done at the office, and not elsewhere. This &#34; elsewhere &#34; provision has been the greatest curse that seamen have had to put up with under our maritime laws. Some honorable senators may say that this is a trifling detail. But, as a matter of fact, it is a loop-hole for invading the intention of the law. The seamen are asking for nothing that is unjust, because it has to be remembered that they pay for the service rendered. Every time a sailor signs on a ship&#39;s articles he pays is., and every time he is discharged he pays another is. </para>

            <para>- Not necessarily. For many years, in the port of London, where shipping offices are established at Poplar and Tower Hill, the whole of this work was done for the coasting trade at a low public- house in Lower Thamesstreet. There is nothing to prevent anything of the same kind occurring here. Matters are not so bad in Australia as they are in England, but during the last few months men have been engaged in tobacconists&#39; shops in King-street, Sydney. There could not be anything worse than the Lower Thames-street business in London. It has led to. practices as bad as the old Fleet marriages. </para>

          <para>.- I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has made out a good case for the alteration of the clause. Every member of the Committee 0 is in favour of minimizing crimping. We desire to protect the sailor against cruelty and injustice in every way. But, at the same time, we must preserve a due sense of proportion, and because 4 or 5 per cent, of sailors who go on board vessels are subjected to practices such as have been described, are we to interfere with the convenience of the other 95 per cent. ? Cannot we have some remedy for crimping, without taking away the privilege which the Bill proposes tq confer? If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> amendment were carried, a great deal of needless loss would be inflicted, whilst no good would be done. He talks about men being engaged at tobacconists&#39; shops in Sydney. Is there any harm in that? He speaks of an enormous amount of business being done at a public house in London. I have no sympathy with business being done at public houses. </para>

            <para>- Yes, because it affords a temptation to drink. Probably men are there induced to sign when they are in a state of drunkenness. I am decidedly opposed to official business, whether under this measure or under the Electoral Act, being conducted at public houses. But my honorable friend considers only one side of the question. We all admit that he has done magnificent work as  President  of the Seamen&#39;s Union. But he should surely remember that he is here as a legislator, to make laws for all classes of the community ; and he should help us to make this the best Bill that we can possibly devise. If a vessel happens to be a mile or two from the shipping office, and there are fifty or a hundred sailors to sign on, for the convenience of all concerned, it has been a common practice for the superintendent or  deputy  superintendent to go on board the vessel at meal times, or after office hours, to witness the signing on. </para>

            <para>- Where is the harm in their being paid overtime? If they give up their meal time to do this work, it shows a desire to facilitate business. By their attendance on board a vessel, fifty or a hundred seamen can be signed on in a few minutes. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> proposes that if the shipping office is distant one mile or five miles from the ship, men must still attend at the office to be signed on.

            <para>- I do not know why it should not be left to the superintendent or  deputy  superintendent  to transact this business, where and when it will be most convenient to himself and to the men who are to be signed on. I do not think that sailors will thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> if they are obliged to lose half a day&#39;s pay in attending at a shipping office to sign on. I have not the slightest doubt that they would like to have a run on shore, and be idle for half a day at the expense of the owners. We have heard something about desertion and crimping, but has <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> considered the opportunities for desertion which his proposal would afford ? If a hundred men had at the very last moment to be taken to. a shipping office to sign on, it is possible some of them might desert. </para>

          <para>- - I have a great deal of sympathy with the position taken up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> in this matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> magnifies the convenience of the&#39; practice of signing on on board ship. As a rule, a man is looking for employment when he signs on, and could attend a shipping office for the purpose without inconvenience. For what purpose is a shipping office established, if it is not to carry out this kind of work? That is one of the reasons why it is provided for in the Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has mentioned many objections to permitting sailors to sign on &#34;elsewhere,&#34; 01 anywhere, because that is what &#34; elsewhere &#34; means. When those who had the framing of measures of this kind in the past, provided for the signing on of sailors &#34; elsewhere &#34; than at the shipping office, they had no idea that advantage would be taken of the provision to take sailors into low public houses, tobacco shops, and places of that kind to sign on. I think that Senators Guthrie and Turley would achieve all they desire, and would prevent the signing on of seamen in low public houses and tobacco shops, by the insertion of a proviso that where no shipping office is established, the work might be transacted elsewhere. Where ft shipping office i&#39;s established, signing on at the office should be compulsory; but where nol shipping office is established, or where it would be very inconvenient to require the signing on to be done at the shipping office, permission might be given to transact the work elsewhere. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has said that there is a shipping office everywhere. </para>

If they do so, they can look for the support of all who object to men signing on 1 at low public houses or tobacconists&#39; shops, and who would like to see the work transacted in a proper manner. </para>

As a member of the Navigation Commission, I am able to say that the evidence taken showed that that was the only port in Australia in which crimping was practised to any great extent. It may be said that it scarcely exists in such ports as Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, or Fremantle. </para>

            <para>- I am stating the opinion of every witness who appeared before the Navigation Commission at Newcastle. So much were the members .of the majority of that Commission impressed by the evidence received there, that they recommended that, in the framing of the Navigation Bill, the clause now before the Committee should be left out. They came to the conclusion that there was only one way to put an end to crimping, and that was to compel seamen to sign on at a shipping office, and at a shipping office only. We shall not put an end to the practice if we permit men to be taken on board a ship at the last moment in perhaps a drugged and drunken condition. </para>

A superintendent should certainly be under Ministerial control, but what control can the Minister exercise upon a superintendent who goes on board a ship to transact this business ? Am I to be told that these officers will, in every case, be above taking a bribe? Suspicion was cast upon shipping officers in the port of Newcastle, and it was suggested that some of them were mixed up with the crimping traffic carried on there. We had direct charges of lawyers and doctors assisting in the traffic, and it was said that there was scarcely any man in official life in the port who was not to some extent connected with it. Why should we assume that nothing of that kind will take place in the future, when there is more than a suspicion that it is taking place at the present time-? I repeat that the only way to put an end to crimping is to see that seamen sign on only at a shipping office. </para>

          <para>. - I hope that no undue heat will be introduced into the consideration of an important matter of this kind. There is involved in this clause the more or less successful working of the law in regard to a very important branch. The provision is contained in -the Merchant Shipping Act, and it has been the law of, I think, nearly every State in the Commonwealth. While, of course, most provisions ih an Act of Parliament may be open to abuse, stilly on the whole, this provision, if honestly administered, works well. It offers excellent facilities to both master and men. It is a sort of emergency clause, to meet cases such as I propose to indicate. For instance, a ship, 0while bound to another place, may enter Port Philip Heads with a member of the crew invalided. It is contended that, instead of requiring the ship to come up to the port, and possibly to pay heavy fees, it would be only reasonable to allow the new man to be sent down to Queenscliff and to sign on there. As a matter of fact, there is no Customs officer at Queenscliff. </para>

            <para>- In clause 10 we have provided that a  deputy  superintendent may be appointed to perform those duties. Even if this clause were omitted, it would be possible under clause 10 practically to carry out the same practice. This is the working clause, and it has been recognised as a good and reasonable one. It is said that it has been abused. It is said, for instance, that men have been engaged in a tobacconist&#39;s shop. I cannot pretend to know the circumstances under which any men were engaged in a tobacconist&#39;s shop; but I know that if a responsible official did the work, no serious injury was done to either party. If any person is appointed to do this work, the onus is cast upon him to do exactly what the superintendent has to do. That is set  Out  in clause 39. After providing for an agreement to be entered into, it says - </para>

            <para>- The man is intrusted with a responsibility, and is liable to a penalty if he fails in his duty. What we have to do is to see that a trustworthy person is appointed. The Minister will be responsible for every appointment which he makes. If he appoints a worthless, or unfit, or dishonest, man, he will have to answer for his act. But the desire of the Minister will be to select a person who will act <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> between the parties, and faithfully carry out the terms of the law. A fair and reasonable protection is assured in the responsibility of the Minister. But, recognising this to be the kernel of the whole thing, I would go further, and, if it is so desired, substitute &#34;official&#34; for &#34;person.&#34; That would meet every argument which has been adduced against the clause, because under clause5  - &#34; Official &#34; includes all persons in the service of the Commonwealth employed under this Act for any purpose or duty in relation to which the term is used. </para>

        <para class="block">That clause deals with a different class of emergency - the case where a man has signed on, but has not turned up at the last moment.

The amendment which is urged by my honorable friends would, if made, simply emasculate the clause, but the amendment I have suggested would meet all their objections. </para>

          <para>. - The Minister, in stating his case, relied greatly upon clause 39, and told us what a shipping master has to do when he is signing on a. crew. He pointed out that an agreement has to be read over and explained by the superintendent to each seaman before he signs on. I wonder if the honorable senator has ever been in a shipping office when a crew was signing on ? I wonder if he would be able to understand two words of an agreement which was being gabbled ever by a shipping master? I have heard agreements read a number of times in different shipping offices, but knew practically nothing of what the shipping master was reading. He was merely complying with a formula, and no one was able to understand what he was talking about. </para>

            <para>- The VicePresident of the Executive Council declared that this is an emergency clause. He then proceeded to quote another provision which is an emergency clause, and which practically destroyed all his previous arguments. The very clausewhich the honorable senator quoted gives the master of a vessel power to sign on men in cases of emergency, but provides that their agreement must be indorsed by the shipping superintendent at the next port of call. We have been urged to trust the officials. But we must recollect that it is possible for officials to make a considerable addition to their income by winking at crimping.Some honorable senators have expressed a desire to exclude seamen from signing articles in a public house. But what is to prevent them from being made drunk in an hotel and signed on next door? </para>

            <para>- Not with the same facility. The evidence taken before the Navigation Commission shows that nearly all the crimping that has taken place in Australia has been rendered possible only by reason of the superintendent having power to sign men on in the masters cabins on board ship. If we allow seamen to be signed on outside the shipping office, we shall play into the hands of agents who gain their livelihood by crimping. </para>

            <para>- No. If all the work had to be done at that office we should always find a crowd of men congregated around it. The office of the superintendent would be open to the public, and as a result we should put an end to a system which everybody deplores. What can be urged against the transaction of Government work in a Government  office? The seaman is required to pay his fees each time that he signs articles and obtains his discharge. So long as the work is being paid for, surely there is no reason why it should not be done at the proper place. How - would it have been possible for all the crimping which has taken place in Newcastle to &#39; have been carried on without the aid of Government officials?  </para>

            <para>- If they had been compelled by law to transact their business in the shipping office crimping would have been rendered impossible. In this connexion I am reminded of what occurred in Queensland some time ago, when Commissioners were appointed for the purpose of dividing runs. What happened ? These officers were the guests of the very men whose runs they were called upon to divide, and in more than one case it was publicly stated that they had been the recipients of presents, with a view to inducing them to do whatever they could in. the interests of those who held the land. In the same way this clause makes it possible for the master of a vessel to visit a shipping superintendent, and say, &#34; I want to sign on a crew. They will be on board at 7 o&#39;clock this evening.&#34; He is not required to say whether that crew will be taken on board by a crimping agent. If the shipping master inquired,  1 Why do you not bring them here &#39; &#39; ? his reply would probably be, &#34;I could not get them here before the office closed, and I wish to sail earl v in the morning. I will send a cab for you at any time you may choose to appoint, and I will also pay you for yOur overtime.&#34; In such circumstances, I contend that the shipping superintendent is practically the guest of the master. Is it likely, then, that he will trouble himself about the seamen? </para>

            <para>- Then why create conditions which render it possible for such a state of things to continue? I desire to see the light of day let in upon the whole business. This can best be accomplished by providing that the engaging and discharging of seamen shall take place at the shipping office. Some honorable senators have declared that they do not believe in such work being undertaken in a low public house. At the same time, they see no objection to its being done upon board ship. They say, &#34; Do not let it be done in. an hotel,&#34; although it may be done next door. We want the whole business to be transacted in the light of day. What happens in the coasting trade? Men who want to be engaged go down and get a ship. The master says, &#34;Be at the shipping office at n o&#39;clock and we will sign you on.&#34; There is no crimping in the coastal business. It is in connexion with the foreign trade that the evil takes place. No objection is raised by local ship-owners to the work being done at the shipping office. Page after page in the evidence taken by the Navigation Commission shows how great an evil crimping is. We want to insure that men shall not be taken in a drunken condition and induced to sign on to a ship. </para>

That is, so far as the crew is concerned when they intend going in the ship. For instance, if it were decided that they should sign on articles, say, at 2 p.m., when they go down to do so the chances are that they do not get back to the vessel that afternoon; the ship-owner loses the benefit of their work and the men probably, I do not say necessarily, get into bad company. . . . </para>

          <para>- I should have no objection to inserting a fair distance. Without such a provision there is no doubt that men will be engaged in hotels and in the by-places of large cities. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray&#39;s.</inline> amendment is not sufficient, because it would leave the road open to crimpers to resort to other places than hotels. They could carry on their unlawful traffic at fruit shops without interference. It would be impossible to enumerate all the places that would lend themselves to the tricks of the crimper. It is easy to imagine that there may be many ports in the Commonwealth where there will be no mercantile marine office established for some time, and&#39; it would not be unreasonable to permit a shipmaster in such ports to engage his crew where and when he pleases. But I remind the Committee that, if the clause is permitted to pass in its present form, the shipmaster, in engaging his crew, will be at liberty to ignore the shipping office every time. That, I am sure, is not the intention of honorable senators. We may discount some of the evidence of crimping: given before the Navigation Commission, or may, at least, regard some of it as highly coloured. </para>

            <para>- Decidedly. But if the honorable senator will read the clause, he will find that die Minister may permit -any matters required by this Act to be transacted in a mercantile marine office to be transacted elsewhere, and one of these matters is the signing of agreements by a ship&#39;s crew. We might possibly &#39;have Ministers who would be an improvement upon those at present holding office, though, judging by the last division, &#39; that does not appear to be the- opinion of honorable senators opposite. My point is that this clause leaves it open to the Minister to permit a shipmaster to have his crew signed on anywhere he pleases. </para>

            <para>- I am not disposed to give the Minister power to enable a crew to be signed on wherever a shipmaster pleases. The chief objection to the proposal made from this side is that it might <inline font-style="italic">&#34;be</inline> injurious to the interests of ship-owners, since, whilst men were taken from a ship &#34;to the shipping office to sign on, the owner would lose the benefit of their services. That is an argument which was submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane.</inline> But how would the ship-owner be injured when he would not have to pay the men for the time they were away ? If the honorable senator employed a man to work for him at 8s. a day, and the man did not turn up, the <inline font-style="italic">honorable</inline> senator would not have <inline font-style="italic">to pay</inline> him and would be at no loss. </para>

            <para>- As they do now. If honorable senators are prepared to put an end to the infamous practice of crimping carried on -by the harpies in Newcastle and in other important ports of the Commonwealth, they will support my amendment I ask merely that the shipmaster shall get his crew to sign on at a mercantile marine office wherever such an office is established, and where there is no such office, I leave&#39; him free to sign on his crew wherever he pleases. </para>

          <para>. - The amendment opens up, perhaps, a bigger discussion than we have yet had on the clause. A number of honorable senators wish to get away to Tasmania, and, as the discussion is likely to extend beyond the time when they must leave, I suggest that the&#39; Minister might consent to report progress at this stage. </para>
