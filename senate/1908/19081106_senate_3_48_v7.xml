                        <para>- Some time ago I called the attention of the Minister of Home Affairs to the fact that certain tradesmen and other persons at Petersburg had applied for telephonic convenience, and paid their money, and that the work had not been completed, and he assured me that it would be done as early as possible. As the busy season is approaching I desire to know whether the work has been done or is likely to be done quickly ? </para>

He said that at the last Federal elections in South Australia little or no mention was made of that subject, and that, therefore, he came to the conclusion that he was given a free hand in regard to any sites which might be suggested. </para>

                                <para>- Prior to making that journey the honorable senator had had many talks with his fellow-senators belonging to the Labour Party of South Australia, and they pointed out to him in graphic language the magnificence of the Dalgety site, the never-failing Snowy River, the advantages to be derived from an inexhaustible water supply, and the suitability of that spot from all aspects for the purpose for which it was sec apart two or three years ago. The honorable senator said that when he undertook the journey he was moved by no other motive or consideration than to give a conscientious vote in favour of what in his judgment, was the most suitable site not for New South Wales, but for the whole of Australia. </para>

                                <para>- As the honorable senator journeyed onwards I expect that he was making complaints to the driver of the waggonette in which he was riding that it was unlike the days he experienced in the State which he represents. We know the tall tarradiddles which drivers relate to new chums. Recognising at a glance that the honorable senator was a new chum to Dalgety, the driver at once told him a tarradiddle. &#34; True,&#34; he said, &#34; it is windy, but a few days ago it blew so hard that it knocked over a coach and its driver.&#34; But he did not mention whether they were destroyed or blown into the Snowy River. </para>

Then the honorable senator saw the Snowy River. He was struck with the magnificence of that stream, but in a hurry-scurry manner he looked hither and thither and could not see any land suitable, in his opinion, for closer settlement, . or for village blockers. He said, &#34;As a farmer, I speak to the members of the Senate, because I know that they are all friends of the farmer.&#34; Are we to understand that the population of the Federal Territory is to be composed wholly of farmers or village settlers and blockers? That the honorable senator is not a judge of land is evidenced by the fact that his opinion is in total contradistinction to the opinions of experts in regard to the land, its possibility and its producing power. He had no opportunities of closely examining the land which is suggested for the site. He talked of the farmer. He said, &#34; I have had fifty-five years&#39; experience of farming, but I do not pose as an expert.&#34; </para>

                                <para>- I do not give the honorable senator credit for it, because his statements to the Senate go to prove that he knows little or nothing about the possibilities of the Dalgety site in regard to land cultivation. Let us consider those possibilities as they are outlined in a supplement to the report of the Royal Commission on the sites for the Seat of Government. I hope that the honorable senator will remain whilst I make a few remarks in that regard. The report says - </para>

I expect that, in the future Federal Territory, we shall adopt scientific and up-to-date methods, and shall demonstrate the fact that what are regarded as poor soils can be made to produce very much better crops than are expected from them to-day. To continue, let me say that the yield of oats is given at  18  bushels to the acre, and of potatoes at  3.1tons  per acre. </para>

                                <para>- That is so; the very low yield was no doubt largely due to the drought. In  1903-4,  with an exceptional season, and one of the best we have ever experienced in this State, the average yield of wheat per acre was 14.49 bushels. In 1904-5, the average yield was 9.26 bushels; in 1905-6, 11.31 bushels; and in 1906-7, 11.13 bushels. So that, with only one exception, the average yield of wheat per acre during the years referred to was lower in &#34;Victoria than at Dalgety, the district which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell invites us to believe is unsuitable for wheat cultivation, for closer settlement, and, in fact, for any purpose, and particularly for a Capital site. </para>

In 1901-2, the average yield of wheat per acre was 10.64 bushels; in 1902-3, when there was a very severe drought, it was 1.24 bushels; in 1903-4, the yield was 17.51 bushels; in 1904-5, 9.27 bushels; in 1905-6, 10.69 bushels; and in 1906-7, 11.69 bushels. So that, during the years mentioned, the average yield for the State of New South Wales was less than the yield at Dalgety, with the exception of that for 1903-4, when there was an exceptional season and a magnificent harvest. In Queensland, during the same years, . with the exception of 1901-2- </para>

I can understand the honorable senator comparing the yields for the whole of New South Wales with those of Dalgety, Canberra, or any other proposed site, but I should like to know how he proposes to connect his references to the wheat production of Queensland with the question now before the Senate? </para>

                                <para>- One year, 1902-3. That was a bad year, in all the States, and the average yield was exceptionally low. The seasons were so bad during that year that honorable senators will remember that many persons interested in agriculture and commerce were driven to the Insolvency Court, and yet in that year Dalgety had an average yield of wheat per acre of 12.3 bushels, as against an average yield of less than 2 bushels to the acre in most of the States. The average quoted for Dalgety is higher than that of Queensland, except in two years during the period I have referred to. I take now the wheat yield of South Australia. In 190 1-2 the average yield per acre in that State from .which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell comes was 4.60 bushels; in 1902-3, 3.64 bushels; in 1903-4, 7.72 bushels; in 1904-5, 6.53 bushels; in 1905-6, 11.43 bushels; and in 1906-7, 10.19 bushels. So that, according to <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan,</inline> in no year during the period quoted was the average wheat yield of South Australia, which is supposed to be the harvest State of the Commonwealth, anything like that I have quoted for Dalgety in the worst year of the period. In the worst year the average yield of wheat was higher at Dalgety than the average yield in the best year in South Australia. </para>

                                <para>- If there be anything in that suggestion, it is an unanswerable argument in favour of the contention that Dalgety is favoured with good . seasons. When nearly every other part of Australia was stricken with drought, Dalgety had a better harvest than that experienced in most other parts of the Commonwealth, even in good seasons. In Western Australia the average yield of wheat per acre, in 1901-2, was 10.10 bushels; in 1902-3, 10.67 bushels; in 1903-4, 13.6 bushels; in 1904-5, 11. 6 bushels; in 1905-6, 11.83 bushels; and in 1906-7, 11.02 bushels. During the last few years there have been good yields in Western Australia, but in only one year &#39; during the period quoted was the average higher than that of Dalgety. In Tasmania the average yield for any year of the period quoted was higher than that quoted for Dalgety. I propose now to deal with the average yield per acre of oats. I have stated that at Dalgety in the year mentioned it was 1 8 bushels to the acre - j 902-3. </para>

                                <para>- In 1902-3 the average yield of oats per acre in New South Wales was 8.18 bushels. In 1903-4, 24.26 bushels; in 1904-5, 16.13 bushels, in 1905-6, 22.91 bushels; in 1906-7, 24.89 bushels. Comparing the yield at Dalgety with the yield in the State as a whole, it will be admitted that it was a very high one. These figures prove that unless <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell was blinded by prejudice, or had no opportunity to make a minute examination of the country, he did not thoroughly understand the question he was discussing when he condemned the Dalgety site as unsuitable on the ground of unproductiveness. </para>

                        <para class="block">I have already pointed that the average yield of oats per acre at Dalgety compares very favorably with the average for the whole of New South Wales. As a matter of fact, the yield per acre in Victoria during two or three years was lower than that at Dalgety. In Queensland during  1902-3,  the yield of oats per acre was  6.67  bushels, and in  1905-6,  it was  10.99  bushels. In this connexion it is interesting to note the average yield of South Australia, and this fact, I think, should have some weight with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell. </para>

                                <para>-  I regret his sudden exit. Evidently he cannot stand criticism. Why he should be so supersensitive upon this matter is to me inexplicable. According to <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan,</inline> the average yield of oats in South Australia is not anything like the average obtained at Dalgety. During  1901-2  the average yield per acre in South Australia was  13.54  bushels, in  1902-3  it was  12.34  bushels, in  1903-4 15.69  bushels, in  1904-5 10.98  bushels, in  1905-6 15.26  bushels, and in  1906-7 15.72  bushels. So that the average yield in that State does not approach the average yield at Dalgety. With the exception of the year  1905-6,  when the average was  18.07  bushels per acre - almost the same as that at Dalgety - the same remark is applicable to Western Australia. If my remarks are unpalatable to the advocates of Yass-Canberra., I have a certain amount of sympathy for them. I am not making this speech with the idea of converting any of those who have already made up their minds upon this question, but with a view to placing before the Senate certain facts regarding the quality of the land in the vicinity of Dalgety. I am told that in this Chamber there are nineteen Cotter Creekers who are absolutely immovable. </para>

                                <para>- If they are relying upon a flood at Cotter Creek, I am afraid they will be disappointed. They will have to wait until the crack of doom, because a flood has never yet occurred there. For many months of the year that miserable trickle, in some parts, is so polluted that its water is undrinkable. At any rate, those who partake of it run very great risks. In New South Wales the average yield of potatoes for  1901-2  was  1.50  tons per acre, in  1902-3  it was  1.58  tons, in  1903-4 2.72  tons, in  1904-5 2.04 tons,  in  1905-6 1.89  tons, and in  1906-7 3.12  tons. So that in only one year was the average return in New South Wales greater than the average at Dalgety, which was  3.1  tons per acre. In Victoria in  1901-2  it was  3.13; 1902-3, 3.40;  in  1903-4, 3.43; 1904-5, 1.98; 1905-6, 2.58; 1906-7, 3.01.  Even in Victoria, which is considered by some people in New South Wales to be a cabbage garden, better adapted than most States for the growing of potatoes, the average yield is only a little higher than the average per acre at Dalgety. </para>

                                <para>- If an old man was seen chopping wood and doing it vigorously, it was a splendid advertisement for Dalgety. The prices paid for land in the different States vary widely. But I do not suppose that in any State higher prices have been paid than in some portion of the Western District of Victoria. Land has been sold there at as much as&#163;130 per acre. Land adjacent to Lancefield and in some portions of the Western District is largely utilized for potato growing. When we remember that some of the best land in this State is used for that purpose, and that, nevertheless, the average yield is only a little higher than the average at Dalgety, that in itself is a strong reason for regretting that when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell visited the place he should so quickly have arrived at the conclusion that he did as to its unsuitability in respect of cultivation. It seems remarkable that he, above all others - and I understand that it is his vote that is going to settle this question - should have come to a wrong conclusion, drawn from a hasty visit to Dalgety. I have now dealt with wheat, oats, and potatoes. The supplement to the report of the Royal Commission shows that one of the witnesses stated that twenty or twenty -five years ago he used to grow a great deal of wheat, obtaining an average of about  12  bushels to the acre. He stated that the yield of oats was from  25  to  30  bushels to the acre. Barley was grown in small patches up to and above  40  bushels, and potatoes to the extent of  3  to  4  tons per acre. The report goes on to say that vegetables grow well, and fruits of various kinds, particularly apples, pears, cherries, apricots and peaches, though late frosts sometimes do considerable damage to the fruit crops. It is not unusual for late frosts to damage the fruit in other parts of Australia. </para>

                                <para>- We have late frosts which damage the fruit in many parts of Victoria. The report also states that the temperature at night is frequently as low as  26  to  30  degrees, but the sunny days which follow frosty nights in winter are warm and pleasant. I think that I have amply demonstrated that the reasons which actuate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell in condemning this site are inconclusive. But we ought not to be seriously concerned about its suitability from a farming aspect. We ought to take a comprehensive view and vision of the future Federal city, which ought to embrace something beyond village settlements and homestead blocks. Dalgety affords better opportunities for demonstrating the possibilities of what a great city can be than does any other site that has been considered. We shall have to erect buildings, and they should not be jerry- built. They should be buildings like the Capital itself, capable of enduring for many years. Facilities for the erection of such buildings are in abundance at Dalgety. The reports show that there is an abundance of clay suitable for making bricks, and that hand-made bricks of an excellent quality have been produced. There is plenty of good sand and other material for making concrete. All the facilities for building are within measurable distance, and easy of access. They can be obtained at a very small cost. It has been said that Dalgety is a bleak, barren place, and destitute of timber. All sorts of misrepresentations have been made on that subject with a view of producing a false impression in the mind of the people in regard to the timber potentialities of the country.

There are some persons who say that they would not touch Australian timbers with a forty-feet pole. Yet we have had evidence from men who have been engaged in the timber industry for a considerable period, and therefore are highly qualified to express an opinion, that some of the best timbers in the wide world are grown in different parts of Australia, particularly in Queensland. </para>

                                <para>- In regard to the two sites - Dalgety and Yass-Canberra - the water supply is an all-important consideration. There can be no two opinions in regard to the cost of the one scheme as compared with the cost of the other scheme. The probable cost of a gravitation scheme at Yass-Canberra and a water scheme at Dalgety has been mentioned. Referring to the storage of water at Dalgety this report says - </para>

                        <para class="block">A water scheme to supply a population of 50,000 persons at Dalgety is estimated to cost ,&#163;318,000. But according to the estimate submitted in respect to Yass-Canberra a gravitation scheme, estimated to supply 5,000,000 gallons per day, as at Dalgety, will cost &#163;853,922. Is no weight to be attached to the disparity between those estimates ? Surely honorable senators can have no consideration for the interest of the taxpayers, if they ask the Senate to seriously entertain a proposal, even from a business aspect, which will penalize the people of the whole of the Commonwealth to the extent of nearly half-a-million. Although they could get a natural water supply for &#163;300,000 odd, they propose to go in for an expensive gravitation scheme, as they must if they adopt the Yass-Canberra site, which is to cost nearly &#163;1,000,000, and there is no guarantee that it will be a satisfactory one. This aspect of the Capital site question is important not only to those who favour Dalgety as against Yass-Canberra, but to the citizens of Australia generally. Why should they be saddled with an unnecessary extravagance? I know that whilst this gravitation scheme will, if adopted, cost considerably more than the scheme suggested for Dalgety, there is an answer given. &#34; Compare the gravitation scheme with the suggested pumping scheme.&#34; And then they say that the pumping scheme at Yass-Canberra, which is an alternative one, will not cost any more than the scheme at Dalgety. It is perfectly true that a pumping scheme for Yass-Canberra, estimated to supply 5,000,000 gallons per day, will cost &#163;339,000, as against ,&#163;318,000 for a gravitation scheme at Dalgety. But there is an alternative scheme in respect of Dalgety. When honorable senators urged that Yass-&#39;Canberra should be adopted, because, amongst other reasons, a water scheme will be no more costly there than at Dalgety, they forgot - whether intentionally or unintentionally, I do not know - to tell the Senate that there is also an alternative scheme for Dalgety. A pumping scheme for Dalgety is estimated to cost  ^167,000,  as against &#163;339,000 f&#176;r a- pumping scheme at Yass-Canberra, providing the same quantity of water for the same population. So far as the cost is concerned, there is a considerable difference in favour of Dalgety. I am as anxious as, perhaps more anxious than, some honorable senators that the decision shall be im favour of a site which will meat with the approbation of not the people of one State only, but the people of all the States in the Union. If this question is settled to-day, the decision will probably be binding upon the people of Australia for all time. No time or attention devoted to it will be given in vain. Why should Victorians above all yield to the clamour of New South Wales in order that the Federal city may be situated contiguous to Sydney ? I say we shall never have a true national spirit, or a Federal sentiment, in Australia if Yass-Canberra is selected as the site for the Federal Capital. In all seriousness, I repeat that that site is altogether too adjacent to Sydney. Should the Federal Capital be established there, a New South Wales atmosphere will surround it for all time. We know that distance is every day being annihilated. Locomotives travel to-day at greater speed than they did a few years ago. On some of the railways of the world they travel at the rate of  100  miles an hour. The mono-rail has passed out of the realms of theory. It is in actual use in some countries, and it is claimed for it that trains can be run on it at the rate of t20 miles an hour. Then the experiments made in connexion with flying machines have shown that they can travel at from  50  to  60  miles an hour, and with favorable currents may reach&#39; a speed of 100 miles an hour. With the use of flying machines, Sydney members of the Federal Parliament would be able to take a flying visit to Yass-Canberra, up in the clouds, &#34;up in the sky, ever so high,&#34; and ever so far removed from &#34;beastly Melbourne.&#34; Then the commercial world of Sydney and the two great thunderers, the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> would, no doubt, be satisfied. These newspapers have whipped&#39; some honorable senators into submission. I know of no instance in political history in which the whip has been used so effectively by newspaperdom to influence votes as it has been in connexion with this question of the Federal Capital site. When the Labour Party is charged with being a &#39; &#39; machine &#39; r party, let me ask honorable senators to compare the attitude of the Sydneyites. Members of the Labour Party on this question, as well as on every other outside the platform they were pledged to support when before the electors, have an absolutely free hand. But we know that there are some honorable senators on the other side who, when this matter was under discussion on a former occasion, were not perhaps enthusiastic about the potentialities of thf beautiful country in the Snowy River district ; but by their votes and speeches showed plainly that they favoured the Dalgety site above all others suggested. Who has been blazing the track, and pioneering the bush? Who are these intrepid explorers who have suddenly discovered a site that was unknown three or four years ago? It was on the map. Was it so small as to be invisible, or to be treated with such disrespect that no friend could be found to speak in its behalf? Honorable senators in discussing the question now ask: &#34; Will it satisfy New South Wales? What does New South Wales think of this site? &#34; Some disposition has been exhibited to placate these people in New South Wales. I am not going to placate them. If the attitude assumed by New South Wales is to be that we are not to select a site until it is approved by the New South Wales Parliament, then Melbourne is good enough for me, and I believe for a majority of the members of both Houses of this Parliament. I speak as a Victorian representative, but I am not unmindful of the interests of Australia. I view the question from an Australian stand-point, as well as through Victorian spectacles. The selection of the Dalgety site would be of immense advantage to Victoria. It would open up a new province in Victoria, and&#39; would make the Seat of Government easier of access, not only to representatives fromVictoria, but from South Australia, Western Australia, and Queensland. I believe that if a referendum were taken tomorrow, in New South Wales, as to whether Dalgety or Yass-Canberra should be selected, and the newspapers were kept, T shall not say altogether silent, but prevented from exercising undue influence, the people of that State would be found&#39; to be in favour of the site originally chosen. I have a mass of literature on the subject before me, and would require  the day to present it properly to the Senate, but I am not going to do so. An understanding was arrived at, not by the whole Senate, but by the leaders of the Senate, that no obstacle would be placed in the way of having a vote taken on a certain day. Owing to unforeseen circumstances, that arrangement could not be carried out. There has been a sort of understanding that the vote should be taken at some time during to day. I have no desire to block that vote.I do not wish the false impression to be created that, because I have talked here for an hour or so this morning, and engaged the time of the Senate last evening, I have not done so with any desire to prevent the taking of a ballot to see which site honorable senators favour. But I must again say that I feel very keenly the possibility that the original choice of a site may be departed from. It is because I am satisfied that that site is the best that I have occupied the time of the Senate this morning to a large extent in replying to statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell ; answering, as far as I was able, the reasons which induced him to come to the conclusion that Yass-Canberra is a more suitable site than is Dalgety. In the circumstances, I feel that I shall not be justified in occupying the time of the Senate any longer. I have had my say. I have endeavoured to prove that from every aspect Dalgety would be a more suitable site than Yass-Canberra, and that it possesses all the advantages required. I am satisfied that the votes of honorable senators will be recorded only for Yass-Canberra and Dalgety. It may be that the numbers are up in favour of Yass-Canberra; I greatly regret it, and I feel that the people of Australia, should we proceed with the erection at that site of the buildings necessary for the Federal Capital, will deplore for all time the action of the Yass-Canberrites in rejecting the site originally agreed upon. </para>

Those essentials will have to be observed to prevent papers being treated as informal. </para>

                    <para>This Bill was received from the House of Representatives yesterday. It makes provision for the appropriation for works and buildings of the sum of &#163;720,541 for the current year 1908-9. It is a measure such as is always passed as early as possible in the financial year in order to enable works to be carried out in connexion with the different Departments. The longer the passing of such a Bill is deferred, the greater is the difficulty of spending the  money authorized by Parliament during the year in which it is appropriated. It is unnecessary for me to remind the Senate that after this Bill is passed every item in it becomes a matter in respect of which expenditure may be incurred up to the amount indicated, but only during the period between1st July last and 30th June next. If, therefore, there is any undue delay in the passage of the Bill by Parliament, and the Executive be not authorized until late in the year to expend the money, it is quite possible in respect of many items that time will not be afforded to complete the works, and that Parliament will again have to be asked to re-authorize the expenditure. That is the case in this instance, because although Parliament is asked to authorize the expenditure during 1908-9 of &#163;720,541, much of that was authorized last year. For various reasons it was found impossible to expend the money in accordance with the authorization. One reason was that the Supplementary Estimates for Works and Buildings were passed when practically eleven months of the financial year had gone by. It was impossible to act upon the authorizations except within the remaining weeks of that year. Another difficulty that presents itself is that after parliamentary approval has been obtained for new works, efforts have to be exerted to obtain suitable sites, and it is often very difficult to obtain a suitable site for our purposes. After sites have been obtained perhaps a very small portion of the amount authorized may be expended during the financial year. Another difficulty is that, except in Victoria, and to a limited extent in New South Wales, the Commonwealth Public Works branch of the Home Affairs Department does not carry out its own works directly. It utilizes the Public Works Departments of the States. But those Departments are already concerned with a great deal of State work, and their having to take on Commonwealth work as well as their own, leads to the result that it is not always possible to obtain for our work that expedition that is desirable. In order to achieve such expedition we might have to adopt the very costly procedure of establishing a Public Works Department of our own. Honorable senators will appreciate the fact that when the States Public Works Departments have not only their own works to attend to, but also, superadded, the works for the Commonwealth, it must often happen that our works are not proceeded with as expeditiously as we should like, and as those interested in particular districts would certainly desire. That fact also has to be taken into consideration as explaining why in a measure of this kind Parliament is asked to re-vote sums that it had previously voted. It will, therefore, be understood that, though this Bill asks Parliament to authorize the expenditure of &#163;720,000, a few hundred thousand pounds of that sum was authorized to be expended last session. I may mention, as illustrating the difficulties sometimes met with in expending money during the authorized period, that provision was made for the construction of a metropolitan rifle range at Enoggera, near Brisbane. It was estimated that the cost would come to something like &#163;12,000 or , &#163;13,000. Authorization was given under the Appropriation (Works and Buildings) Act last year. But although a start was made immediately, not a single claim has yet been settled, and not all have been received. I may mention another work of an analogous character in the vicinity of Melbourne, namely, the construction of a cordite factory at Maribyrnong. Parliament authorized the expenditure, but we have not yet received a single claim in respect of the work. Consequently it was impossible to spend the money last year, and it is necessary for the amount to reappear in the form of a re-vote. These re- votes must appear in similar measures so long as the present financial system obtains. I commend to honorable senators the desirableness of passing the Bill with as little delay as possible, in order that it may become law and the works be proceeded with. </para>

But at present there are only two sites in the. running, so that if we leave one of them out there can be no further ballot. Therefore, I submit that your ruling as to course of procedure which should be adopted is not applicable to the present circumstances.

                        <para>-  I am amazed at the position which has been taken up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> and I am particularly astonished that he should suggest that this is a  case in which - owing to an equal number of votes having been cast for two sites - the question should, in accordance with our Standing Orders, be resolved in the negative. I am thinking of the dignity of the Senate and of out adherence to the rules governing our procedure on this occasion, for which the Ministry are responsible. I was sorry to hear the Vice-President of the Executive Council cheer when it was suggested that the motion contained no provision for overcoming the present difficulty. To my mind, there is no escape from the ruling which you, sir, have given, and I desire to point out that the object of the motion submitted by the Vice-President of the Executive Council in respect of the nomination of sites, is that some site shall be chosen by an- absolute majority. That is its whole purpose. Of course, we may be able to pick out isolated paragraphs from that motion, subject them to a technical criticism  - just as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> did - and say that they do not apply. But I submit that we have to pay some regard to the very object for which the motion was framed. That object clearly was to insure a continuance of balloting until one site had secured an absolute majority of votes. Sub-paragraph <inline font-style="italic">e</inline> reads - </para>

                    <para>If, on the first examination, any site proves to have received an absolute majority of votes, the  President  shall report the name of such site to the Senate, and such site shall be deemed to be the one preferred by honorable senators. </para>
                    <para class="block">That position has not yet arisen, because there are still two sites upon the list. Sub- paragraph f reads - </para>
                    <para>If no site receives an absolute majority of votes, then the name of the site receiving the smallest number of votes shall be reported to the Senate, and shall be struck out. </para>
                    <para class="block">Neither has the situation arisen which is contemplated by that provision. Clearly the object of the motion is that we shall continue to ballot until one site has received an absolute majority of votes. Subparagraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> is applicable only if three sites still remain upon the list, one possessing a majority over the other two, and the other two having an equal number of supporters. In that case sub-paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> provides that one of those sites shall be again balloted for. But sub-paragraph <inline font-style="italic">h</inline> makes it clear that if any sites have obtained a small number of votes, and we have eliminated one of them, and if there are sites still remaining upon the list - </para>
                    <para>Further ballots shall then be taken on the names of the remaining sites - </para>
                    <para>The remaining sites still upon the list are Yass-Canberra and Tumut. It is not necessary, therefore, to apply the provisions of sub-paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g,</inline> because there are no two sites with the smallest number of votes. But there are still two sites upon the ballot-paper, and we have to dispose of them. </para>

                        <para>- I do not propose to hear any further argument at&#39; the present stage. I think it very desirable that a decision should be arrived at as early as possible. I therefore propose to take upon myself the responsibility of giving a ruling which, of course, will stand, unless the Senate sees fit to dissent from it. In the first place, I point out that it is perfectly true, as indicated by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, that, in the case of an equality of votes upon any ordinary matter, the question, under the procedure of the Senate, passes in the negative. That is perfectly true as applicable to any motion upon which the Senate has to say &#34;yea&#34; or &#34;nay.&#34; But I wish to direct attention to a determination of the Standing Orders Committee, which was reported to and adopted by the Senate - </para>

                <para class="block">Those standing orders lay down the procedure to be adopted in case of an equality of votes in connexion with the election of a  President.  Now, the Senate has been engaged for something like a week upon the consideration of the question of the selection of a site for the Federal Capital. I consider that it is the duty of the  President,  as far as he &#34;can, to see that the time that has been given to the question is not wasted. It is always desirable when any question is submitted to  the Senate, to obtain a decision if that be possible. So far as concerns an ordinary motion for the second reading of a Bill, or affirming any particular proposition, it is laid down by Statute what rule we shall follow. But that rule does not apply to a case like the present. In these circumstances, we should rather be guided by our own Standing Orders, which, in the case of an equality of votes for an election to the position of  President,  contemplate certain procedure. Proceeding a step further, I point out the procedure that was adopted in the other Chamber. Possibly I am open to blame for not having adopted that procedure here in the first instance. But to have done so would have occupied a good deal of time that might otherwise have been saved. I find that when the first ballot was taken in another place, one site, Lake George, received no votes whatever. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> said - </para>

                    <para>As there are two names lowest on the list, I shall put them to the House in alphabetical order. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>It will be seen that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> did not determine to eliminate the two names, but put it to the House as to whether either of them should be voted on again. The question that Albury be further balloted for, was resolved in the negative. The question that Orange be further balloted for, was also resolved in the negative. So that it was &#39;determined that neither of those places should be put to the House again. It was considered necessary that their names should be removed from the ballot-paper before the next ballot was taken. When I refer to the paper handed to me by the  Clerk,  I find that the decision of honorable senators was as follows - Armidale, no votes ; Dalgety, none; Dalgety-Tooma, none; Lyndhurst, none; and then come the names of Tumut and Yass-Canberra with eighteen votes each. I shall now submit the name of Armidale, and take the sense of the Senate as to whether it is to be included in the next ballot. Then I shall take the sense of the Senate as to whether Dalgety, Dalgety-Tooma and Lyndhurst are to Be submitted to the Senate. Of course, whatever sites the Senate may determine shall be left on the paper for further ballot, will be left; and then it will be perfectly competent Tor honorable senators who have already voted for Tumut or Yass-Canberra to cast their votes for any other place that may be left on the ballot paper. </para>

Whether it is the proper way to proceed or not, the taking of a ballot on these sites is the easiest way out of this difficulty. According to your own statement, sir, the drawing of lots would be the best way and most in accord with the procedure laid down by the Standing Orders which you have quoted. But I think that if honorable senators would only look at the question reasonably, they would recognise that it would be better to take a ballot on Tumut and Yass-Canberra. </para>

                        <para>-  I desire to ask a question, sir. I understand from your ruling that you are going to put to the Senate first, the question whether Armidale shall be further balloted for, and next, the question whether Dalgety shall be further balloted for. I desire to ask whether you propose to put to a vote, not to a ballot, the question whether Tumut shall be further balloted for, or whether you intend when those sites are reached to submit both Tumut and Yass-Canberra to a ballot. I believe that if that point were cleared up it would allay a good deal of the present irritation. </para>

                    <para>. - When dealing with this clause this day week we were discussing the form in which a certificate should be returned&#39; to an officer after it had been retained as the result of an inquiry into a charge made against him. We decided that the word&#39; &#34; physically &#34; as it appeared before the word &#34; unfit &#34; in the clause should be left out, so that if for any reason it were held that an officer was unfit the Minister might have the power to retain his certificate. In dealing with a later portion of the clause, I moved that the words indorsed upon the certificate &#34; be left out with the object of providing that the certificate should not bear on its face for all time the record of any offence of which the officer had been found guilty. I agreed that there should be some record kept in the Marine Court, but I felt that it should not be indorsed on the certificate. That, I think, is an eminently reasonable proposition. I do not think that any member of the Committee desires to permanently brand an officer with the record of any charge which he might have been called upon_to answer in the Marine Court.  His  certificate might have been retained because he suffered from some physical defect from which he afterwards recovered. In such circumstances, honorable senators would not desire that he should be compelled to seek employment with a certificate branded with a record of the fact that he had suffered from that defect. I am sure that I can appeal to honorable senators&#39; sense of fair-play to support the amendment I have moved. </para>

                    <para>. - I am sorry that there were so few members present in the Chamber when this matter was last dealt with, because I believe there is a misunderstanding as to the intention of the clause. I pointed out that the omission of the word &#34; physically &#34; completely alters its effect and renders it quite unnecessary. The object originally was to provide for unfitness and mainly for cases of colour-blindness. In Victoria the practice was to make an indorsement on a certificate if a man suffered from colourblindness or any similar physical defect. An appeal was made to the Court, and it was discovered that the Marine Board had no power to enforce such a practice, and, consequently, it was mulcted in damages. After that case had been decided, the Board of Trade altered its practice, and adopted that of calling upon an officer, under such circumstances, to deliver up his certificate. If he refused to do so, he was then charged before the Board. In this Bill we have attempted to adopt what was formerly the practice of the Board of Trade, and the practice which had obtained in at least one of the States. But I would point out that having eliminated the word &#34; physically,&#34; the clause has become entirely unnecessary, because everything else is provided for in clauses 357 and 3&#176;5- </para>

The Minister could require that man to undergo a medical examination, and after that examination, a charge might be laid against him. After an inquiry has taken place, an indorsement might be made upon his certificate that he was suffering from colour-blindness. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. But the object of this clause is to provide for the indorsement, upon a man&#39;s certificate, of any disqualification from which he may be suffering. Its aim is quite different from that of clause 357. Having left out the word &#34; physically,&#34; the provision is not properly, applicable. Take the case of a dipsomaniac </para>

Having struck out the word &#34; physically,&#34; I ask the Committee to omit the entire clause. By enlarging it in the way that is suggested, we shall alter its whole purpose. For instance, a dipsomaniac might recover in a week or two. A week&#39;s sobriety might thoroughly restore him.

                    <para>. - Two questions are involved in this clause. The first is whether in addition to the tribunal provided for under clause 357, there should be some authority to inquire into cases of physical unfitness. The second is as to whether it is desirable in the public interest that an indorsement of any disqualification should be placed upon a man&#39;s certificate. I recognise that there is some force in the argument of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, and I suggest that instead of abandoning the whole clause, it would be better for him to agree to its recommittal. </para>

                    <para>. - I trust that the clause, with the amendment which has been made in it, will be allowed to stand, and that when it is recommitted, we shall be afforded an opportunity to inquire into the whole of the questions which are involved in it. It seems to me that its scope is by no means limited to persons who may be afflicted with colourblindness. It may include a hundred and one other disqualifications. My own experience is that more danger is to be apprehended by the crew and passengers from the master of a vessel, who is mentally affected, than is to be feared from a master who is suffering from physical infirmity. I would suggest that the Vice-President of the Executive Council should report progress, with a view to allow the matter to be threshed out at a later stage. </para>

                        <para class="block">This morning, while the motion with reference to the Capital site ballot was under consideration, I sat in my place throughout the discussion. I had not opened my mouth until I made the small interjection to which I have referred. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> was speaking. He quoted . some figures. He had not requested that no senator should interject. In fact, he made the statement that he did not mind interjections, as he would be able to answer them. While he was quoting figures - I think one set amounted to 850,000 and another to 300,000 - I made the simple remark &#34; Half-a-million.&#34; I said only those three words. But I was suddenly called to order. I suppose that under the Standing Orders it was quite proper to call me to order. I quite understand that, as a general rule, interjections are disorderly. &#39; But I frequently hear interjections flung around, and honorable senators are not called to order for making them. I do not wish to cast any reflection upon the Chair, but there is an old saying, which is much used in country districts, that one person may steal a horse with impunity, whilst another gets three months for looking over the fence. I do not think that you have any intention to deal unfairly with honorable senators, but, at the same time, we should feel quite sure as to what our privileges are in &#34;reference to interjections. As I have said, I seldom interject. The words that I have quoted were all that I uttered to-day. But I heard others interject frequently, and no notice was taken from the Chair. I feel that if one honorable senator can interject, and no notice is taken of him, while another is instantly pulled up when he says three words, there is not an equality of treatment. If one interjects others should be able to do the same, or there will arise a feeling that those who are pulled up constantly are not getting what may be termed &#34; a fair deal.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- I quite recognise that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> does not frequently Interject. I also recognise that his inter-&#39; jection this morning was a very small one. But he will bear in mind that, during the course of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley&#39;s</inline> speech, I had called several honorable senators to order before his interjection. I assure the honorable senator that, while in the chair, I have no favorites. I desire to act justly to all. If at any time it is considered that an honorable senator is not treated quite fairly, he may be quite certain that I have acted unwittingly, because I realize that all honorable senators have the same rights, and that it is the duty of the Chair to extend equal justice and consideration to all. A sena&#62;ror would not be worthy to occupy the position that I hold if he did not act in that spirit. I also wish to assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> that I had no desire to cast any reflection upon him. But he will remember that honorable&#39; senators were very anxious to bring the debate to a close. It had been very protracted, and, as we all know, interjections tend to prolong debate. I am quite sure that the honorable senator will realize that I bad no feeling in calling him to order, any more than I had in calling honorable senators on either side of the Chamber to order. </para>
