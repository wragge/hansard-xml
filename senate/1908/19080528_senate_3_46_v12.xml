A suit of uniform should last a cadet three years. It would then be fully paid for by the Government. The present uniform worn by cadets, I may say, was approved by the Education Departments concerned, which bodies would require to be consulted if any alteration is contemplated. The question of the initial cost, and the fact that only portion of that cost is paid by the Department, is receiving the attention of the Minister. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire at the outset to draw the attention of honorable senators to a somewhat unusual, if not unnecessary paragraph, in the message. I refer to the statement regarding the action of another place in refraining from the determination of its constitutional rights or obligations in respect of the . Senate's message. No one in this Chamber could take exception to another place availing itself of any opportunity to assert what it claims to be its rights, powers and privileges under the Constitution, but when a message is sent to us with such a clause as I have just indicated, incorporated in it, it becomes the duty of the Senate to have some regard also to what it claims to be its undoubted rights, powers and privileges under the Constitution. In this connexion I desire to follow the precedent that was established in1902. at the instance of my honorable and learned friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline> On that occasion a similar message came to the Senate, and when the Order of the Day was called on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> .moved an amendment, which was ultimately carried, in these words <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> XII., 15836) - ; . </para>

                <para>That Message No. 59 of the House of Representatives in reference to the Senate's requests on the Customs Tariff Bill be printed and taken into consideration on Tuesday, 9th September; this House- affirming that the motion of the House of Representatives in receiving and dealing with the reiterated requests of the Senate is in compliance with the undoubted constitutional position and rights of the Senate. </para>
                <para>Now, sir., I propose to invite the Senate, before we proceed with the consideration of the message of the House of Representatives, to re-affirm that resolution. The object of so doing is to make it quite clear that we give not even a tacit assent to the suggestion which appears in the message that has been remitted to us, as to the claims made by the other place. The Constitution no doubt speaks for itself, and there is a possibility that it is open to more than one interpretation. But I think that so far as our rights are concerned they are clear and undoubted that this Chamber has the power and authority to reiterate its requests  at any stage and at any time when it thinks proper. </para>

                        <para>- I have said so ; as often as necessary. In saying so much I am appealing to honorable senators to realize that this is no party matter. It is a matter that to some extent may be claimed to affect and does affect the rights and powers of the Senate. I quite admit that, while we claim the right to reiterate our requests as frequently as we like, the other Chamber has the right to say yea or nay as to whether it will make the amendments requested. To some extent, I thought that this matter had been disposed of, because on subsequent occasions since 1902, in regard to the class of Bills which we have not the power to amend, but in reference to which we have the power to make requests, in the terms of section 53 of the Constitution, we have exercised that power. In 1906 we had before, us an Excise Spirits Bill. In regard to that measure, requests were made by the Senate to the House of Representatives. The House agreed to some and disagreed with others. The' Senate twice pressed two requests, and the amendments were finally made by the House of Representatives. On that occasion no question of privilege was raised. On the 25th September, 1906, the same Bill was returned, to the House of Representatives With requests.  Consideration of the Senate's requests then took place, and -some were adopted. On 8th October, consideration of the House of Representatives' message took place, on which occasion three requests, Nos. 4, 5, and 6, were pressed. On 10th October, on the Bill being returned to the House of Representatives, with a message pressing requested amendments, two requests ' modified in certain particulars were adopted, and one requested amendment was made. On 10th October the Bill was returned from the Senate with a message intimating that it again pressed its requests, and the House of Representatives agreed to the requested amendments. Now, I have said that that Bill was practically of the same character as the one with which we are dealing on the present occasion. The requests of the Senate were dealt with, and iri some cases the amendments were made without any protest ; in fact, I think the words ot the message were that the House of Representatives had " now made " the amendments. Later on, I find that in reference to the Appropriation Bill of 1903-4 requests were made by the Senate in regard to certain items. I believe that the other place had reduced the salaries of one clerk and two messengers. This Chamber insisted, by request, on the re-instatement of those, . salaries. The Bill was returned from the House of Representatives. The Senate adhered to its decision, and sent back the Bill pressing its requests. On that occasion the form of procedure that was adopted elsewhere - I  will not set forth the reasons for adopting that ] procedure, but it was stated that any constitutional question was thereby . avoided was for the Prime Minister to move to lay aside the Bill, and. to introduce a new Appropriation Bill, with the items in dispute inserted as requested by the Senate. So that the effect of pressing our requests in regard to that Bill was that the amendments were ultimately made. Now, I do not think that any good purpose is likely to. be served by any undue enlargement  on what our rights and privileges are. We have a clear knowledge and certainty -in our own minds as to what they are. It behoves us on every occasion to see that' the Constitution is loyally carried' out, and that whatever powers are given to us by its  terms are firmly and strictly adhered to. I therefore consider that, as the leader of the Senate for the time being, it is my duty to move, as I now  do - </para>

                    <para>. - There is only one word that has been used by the Vice-  President  of the Executive. Council which I am unable to indorse cordially. I think that he has expressed generally the sentiments of every one who has .the honour of a seat in the Senate. The word to which I wish to .refer was used) I am sure, by my honorable friend from force of habit. It was the word "(privilege." The phrase "our rights and privileges " is a common one ; and I have no doubt that the honorable senator used it because it is an old phrase with which he and the rest of us are familiar. But that which we are now asserting is not a privilege at all, and I think that if we wish to achieve a proper' understanding in relation to our position it  is a word which should not be used. To my mind, the matter presents itself not at all as one of privilege, but as one of solemn duty ; a duty placed upon us of seeing to it that the powers intrusted to the Senate by the Constitution are strictly adhered to. Now, sir, I should like, . in cordially approving of the motion submitted by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, to suggest to him - and if necessary, to move an amendment - that, seeing that our experience in connexion with this Customs Tariff Bill is a repetition of a similar experience some six years ago, we ought to communicate to the House of Representatives, by message, the motion which we are now invited to adopt. On the previous occasion <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> who moved the corresponding motion to that now submitted by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, added to it the words "and that this resolution be communicated to the House of Representatives by message." </para>

                        <para>- I admit that. Perhaps nothing is more indicative of the uncertainty in another place on this question than is the phraseology of the resolution which has been conveyed to the Senate. It speaks of 'the matter being left in abeyance until joint Standing Orders can be framed. Do honorable members- in another .place think for a moment that joint Standing Orders can in any way undermine or take away one jot or tittle of the powers conferred by the Constitution upon this or the other branch of the Federal Legislature?. All the joint Standing Orders in the world could not settle a question of this kind. It  must be settled by the two Houses by procedure to which I shall not further refer. I am suggesting to the Vice-President of the Executive Council, and in no spirit hostile "to his motion, that it might be an advantage if we were to " convey to another place, by exactly the same method as that which they have adopted in conveying their views to lis, the decision at which we have arrived on this question As we can take no possible, exception to the action of another place in conveying to us the resolution passed by honorable members, they cannot object to bur following their lead, and conveying to them in the same way an expression of the view we take on this matter. I felt disposed to move an amendment in that direction, but I quite recognise that it is extremely desirable that if we take any action of the kind it should1 be taken unanimously. . Perhaps, in the circumstances, it would be better to postpone' the moving of such an amendment as I have indicated in order that further discussion may take place, and honorable senators be given a better opportunity to understand each other's minds on this question. We shall be able to judge in the course of the debate whether the Senate indorses the views I. hold, and, if so, we can follow the course I have suggested ; but I should certainly not like the Senate to be divided upon the matter. </para>

                        <para>- I shall probably . submit an amendment, and if it should be the wish of the Senate later I can withdraw it. Perhaps I ought now say a word or two on a question which is at all times, attractive to any one who has given consideration to the peculiar constitution of this Chamber. I wish to point out to honorable senators, and especially those representing what are called the smaller States - and which, as an honorable senator reminds me, are, in some instances, geographically the larger States - that the question raised here, although perhaps in a. tentative way, aims at the principle which we know as -equality of representation. It was utterly useless to constitute this Chamber in. such a way as to give to the States comprising smaller populations equal representation here if the power which they thought was conferred upon them is to be taken, away from their representatives. It has greatly interested me in reading the criticisms directed against the action of the Senate to find that, particularly in mv own  State  public men and public journals who invitee1, the electors to reject the Commonwealth Bill on the ground that the Constitution gave the Senate this power, now turn round and  deny  that the Senate has this power at all. That seems to me to be not merely contradictory, but to savour very much of a breach of faith. The smaller States were invited to enter the Federation under the Constitution on the assurance that their interests would be absolutely safeguarded by  this principle of equal representation and power in. the Senate, and now to  deny  that that power exists in the Senate is to tell the smaller States that, while they were invited to join the Federation on one basis, an attempt is now being made to twist the Constitution in such a way as to take from them that protection which the constitution of the Senate was supposed to insure. I should like, in this matter, to quote an authority which I am sure honorable senators will receive with the respect . I have for it myself. It is a statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr., now Mr. Justice,</inline> Higgins, during the time he was fighting strenuously against the acceptance of the Constitution ;in its present form.

                        <para>- It was given during the time the Commonwealth Bill was before the electors at the referendum. If the power of the Senate in this matter is limited to one presentation of its requests it has absolutely no more power than an ordinary public journal or a public meeting. A public journal or a public meeting can make requests, and I say that if our power is to be limited ' merely to one presentation of our requests, and after that we ait: impotent, they can have no more weight than if they were (presented by a public journal or a public meeting. </para>

                        <para>- It is perfectly true that a public journal could not throw out the Bill. But before so extreme a course is taken, we must ' assume that another place, bv a determined refusal' of our requests, forces the Senate into such an extreme position that there is nothing left for it but to reject the Bill. I venture to say that, on this occasion, we have not vet arrived at that stage. . If the view I take is correct, that the Senate, representing the States in equal proportion, has cast upon it a certain duty, and is now carrying out functions imposed upon it by the Constitution; if it be the intention of the Constitution that it should exercise these powers, no member of it ought, and I am sure none will, do anything which would abrogate the powers, duties, and responsibilities which the Constitution, places upon us. If there is to be an amendment of the Constitution ; if the people are dissatisfied with the Senate as at present constituted, the proper way to proceed is not by permitting any encroachment upon its duties - and I prefer that word to all others in this connexion - but by direct appeal to the people to say to what extent the duties of the Senate should be limited. On this matter, may I quote one sentence from, the Prime Minister, uttered "on an occasion similar to this, six or seven years ago - </para>

I have had no desire to say anything which might be regarded as militant in itself. Whether I have succeeded or not, I have at least attempted to put forward a defence of what I regard as the duties of the Senate, and to indorse the appeal of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, that it will not in any way allow its powers to be dulled, or to drift into a position- of impotence, because if ever that stage did arrive, I am sure that every one will agree with me that the death-knell of the Senate would have been sounded, and we should have made a great stride towards unification, an event for which, whatever the future may hold in store for us, I venture to think we are not yet ripe. After thinking the matter over, I propose to submit an amendment, with a view to inviting discussion, and frankly intimate that, should it appear that a consensus of opinion is against me, I shall not press it, because I recognise the great value of unanimity.

                    the resolution which was unanimously carried by the Senate in 1902, when exactly the same question arose in connexion with the then Tariff. I had the honour of moving that proposition in opposition ,fo the then Government and -its leader here,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor.</inline>
                    But, as a result of the debate, in which the whole constitutional position was very fully reviewed, it' was the unanimous conclusion that these reiterated requests were in pursuance of and conformity with- our undoubted rights, and the constitutional position of the Senate, and that we ought to affirm that on its records. Accordingly, the amendment which I had moved in the form of the proposed resolution on this occasion was unanimously adopted ; and I feel sure that there cannot be two opinions as to the existence of. these rights and powers of the Senate under the Constitution, and as to its being our undoubted duty to exercise them when the occasion arises. We should be failing in the exercise' of our constitutional functions if we refrained from doing so, and we should also be equally failing in our constitutional duty if we abstained, for any reason, from placing on record our clear opinion as to the powers and rights which we possess. If on a Bill of this description we made a request to the other House, we should be placed in a most humiliating position if, on that request being rejected, we could not repeat it as often as we thought necessary in the discharge of our duty. Why, sir, we should be in a worse position than the importunate widow, the essence of whose offence was the reiteration of her request. If we were to be debarred from giving effect to that importunity by the reiteration of our request with adequate reasons, we should be in a more humiliating position than any Legislative Council which ever existed in this or any other country. I feel sure, as
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline>
                    has said, that the unanimous judgment of the Senate in 1902 will be unanimously indorsed on this occasion. But I am afraid that I cannot agree with the suggestion that we should communicate to the other House that our re-affirmance of the resolution of' that year. I think that it is undesirable to do that. In 1902, I did add those 'words to roy amendment, but it was pointed out, I thought then, and still think with very great force, that the effect of that would be to challenge the other House to come on, so to speak, and fight. What impressed my mind then and impresses it now is, that the language which the- other House has embodied in its message amounts to merely an intimation that it has refrained from determining its rights- and obligations, whatever they may be.

                        <para>- No. By this motion we pronounce our clear and deliberate judgment that the House of Representatives in doing what it did, acted in strict accordance with its duty, and in 'conformity with" the rights of the Senate under the Constitution. Having done that, it seems to me that we have done all that we are called upon to do, and if ever the question should arise for discussion in the other House, or between the Houses, our position will be abundantly protected and confirmed, and the <inline font-style="italic">Journals.</inline> can be searched by the other House if it desires to know what our views on the subject are. That is the attitude which 1 take on the matter, and I think that my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will be well ;advised&gt; if he does: not press his amendment. The first occasion on which this question arose was in 1902, when ] submitted.- my amendment. Since then, the incidents . which are well within our recollection, and which have been referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> - a story of precedent passing down through the intervening years in relation to absolutely identical' matters in respect of which no protest of any sort or description was made by the other House - led me to suppose that it had abandoned, not the position, but the attitude, which it then seemed to entertain, and had practically solved it in favour <inline font-style="italic">of,</inline> what I think is the more constitutional view as to the position and rights of the Senate. I thought so. When this incident occurred the other day., it seemed to jue that it was rather a belated revival of an attitude- which I thought we had good reason to suppose had been absolutely abandoned, or the reasons . for which had been swept away. My recollection is that only some of the minor lights in another place gave utterance to the view that our powers were restricted,  as though they were tracking a whip over the heads of the Senate, and that it was not joined in bv the leaders of parties, or  men of responsibility in connexion with questions' of this kind. I am sure that the Senate will have done all that it is. called upon to do if it passes the motion in the form in which it has been moved. By so doing we shall have emphatically asserted, not merely our rights under the Constitution, which are so clear almost that he who runs may read, but also our judgment that the action of the House of Representatives is in conformity with our rights. </para>

                    <para>. - It is impossible to over-estimate the importance of the issue now raised. The misfortune, to some extent, is that we cannot now settle it. Another place have, I think, wisely, decided not to express .their view conclusively, but have declared that this is not an opportune time to decide their rights. </para>

                        <para>- We ought not to discuss this in any but the most perfectly calm and judicial way. We should try to avoid, if we can, imputing intentions or desires. We were seeking to form, a Constitution that would, in the clearest possible manner, give effect to the people's will. Some members of the Convention consistently and earnestly thought that the Senate should have absolutely coordinate powers with another place in all matters. Others thought that the Senate should have co-ordinate powers in all matters of ordinary legislation, but that the fundamental . principle of the British Constitution of recent' years - that only one House should have control of finance - should be maintained. Between those two. there was a compromise. It was pointed out with great force that with the best intentions in the world the House of Representatives might easily arrive at a decision in which there was an oversight, or. which, was based on incomplete knowledge, and that . this might be indicated by the Senate, without any infringement of the right of the House of Representatives to control the people's purse. It was therefore suggested, and, ultimately, adopted; that the Senate should have power to, request amendments in financial measures. There is one word in the motion to which  1  .cannot quite .sub scribe. At present, I am in favour of the Senate proceeding, as it has been in the habit of doing, and, if it considers desirable, re-preferring its requests, but it is not at all undoubted that that is within its powers. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator ought not to say that, because he knows that we have not the time to discuss the issue now in all its bearings. Whatever we say now ought [therefore to be considered as tentative. At any rate that is  the desire that I have taken this- opportunity to express. The Senate is in some respects extremely undemocratic in its basis. It gives to a handful of people in one State- 250,000 or so - as much power as is given to the largest State. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend is right, and hence the power to make amendments was refused to the Senate and a compromise was arrived at. 1 do not want to express a definite opinion on this issue now. I wish the 'Senate to go on as it has been going, but there will come a time when we shall .have to express an opinion definitely. I desire to be free then to do what is the very best for the Commonwealth. That time may never arrive, and probably will not arrive in my time, but it may come, and the issue is so important that I decline to have my hands tied. I intend to have, when, that time arrives, the right to exercise my fullest judgment in the light of all the circumstances. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has properly put it, we are  interpreting . the Constitution, but in so doing we must be quite clear that we are not putting upon ' it an interpretation that is contrary to its clearly outlined spirit. </para>

It has merely said that this is not the time to declare its view, and therefore has waived a' possible - it does not say even a positive - right. It has agreed that it will not raise the- issue now, but will assume that we are right and will .go on, for the purposes of this Bill, in the direction that we desire.

                    (Victoria - Vice-President of the Executive Council [3.40]. - I desire at the outset to inform honorable senators that the result of the consideration of the Senate's message by the House of Representatives has been that of the forty-one requests made by us eighteen have been accepted outright, fifteen requested amendments have not been made, and eight requested amendments have been adopted with modifications. The only commentary that I desire ' to make in regard to those figures is that the House of Representatives have endeavoured to meet us in a very fair and reasonable way. I also desire to direct attention to the fact that the schedule is divided into three parts. The items do not follow each other in numerical order as they did in the schedule which we considered on a former occasion. The first part ' deals with original requested amendments of the Senate which the House of Representatives, though again requested to do so, has not made. The second part of the schedule shows the original requested amendments of the Senate which the House of Representatives at first did not make, but has now made with modifications. The third part is what' may be called the n.e.i. division. It shows how the House of Representatives has dealt with certain of the Senate's original requests for amendments, which amendments the House of Representatives st first either did not make, or made in part only, or with modifications. It is  necessary for honorable senators to understand the plan upon which the schedule has been prepared, because it will be necessary for me, when dealing with certain items, to  jump from one part of the schedule to another. The first item has relation to sheet lead and lead piping. Originally the Government proposed a duty of 50s. per ton. The House of Representatives made the item free. The Senate requested that a duty of 20s. per ton should be imposed. The House of Representatives again finds itself unable to accept our request. Under the circumstances I move -

                        <para>. - It will be remembered that the original proposal of the Government was that the duty on marble unwrought should be 10 per cent. The Senate requested that the commodity should be made duty free. I submit that a duty of 10 per cent. on the unwrought stone is not an unreasonable impost when it is borne in mind that we have most excellent deposits of marble in New South Wales. Tasmania and South Australia. On wrought marble there is already a duty of 30 per cent. So that there is a very fair margin between the duties on wrought and unwrought stone. I move - </para>

In the circumstances, we decided to request that it should be left out.

Honorable members in another place have agreed to reduce the capacity of dynamos from 500 to 200 horsepower. Dynamos of the capacity, now provided for would be a popular type of machine, and would suffice for all purposes in many of our industrial enterprises.

                        <para>- They are. free if intended to be coupled' with dynamos. If a dynamo is imported not to be coupled with a high-speed engine, it is liable to duty at from 20 to 12 <inline font-style="italic">\</inline> per cent., according to its capacity. This, in my opinion, makes an unreasonable distinction between the motive power on the one hand and the .dynamo, on the other. The proposal of the Government in the first instance was that dynamos of any capacity, from 1 to 1,000 horsepower, so long as they were for direct coupling to a steam turbine, the latest form of steam engine, should be admitted duty free. My proposal is to place high-speed reciprocating engines on the same plane as turbines. ' They are used quite- as often as turbines, and it is -a moot question in engineering which of 'these two types of steam engine is the more economical. In the circumstances, it would, in- my opinion, be unreasonable to exclude from this item dynamos for direct coupling with high-speed reciprocating engines. </para>

I am glad to be able to acknowledge that the State from which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> comes is as prosperous from a mining point of view as perhaps any State in the Commonwealth. No other State can compare with it so far as coal mining is concerned. I was acting quite as much in the interests of New South 'Wales as in those of any other State. I urge this amendment "on the favorable consideration of the Committee. I believe it will carry out the original intention of the Government. It will also be in keeping with the intention of the other House when it sent forward' the proposal iri its present naked shape. </para>

                        <para>- No; I want the duties on generators which come in to be coupled to high-speed reciprocating steam! engines to be made 5 per cent, and free; that is, to make no difference between turbines and high-speed reciprocating steam engines. I ask the Committee to favorably consider my amendment, not only for the sake of the consistency of the Tariff, but also to give a wider choice to those who prefer a high-speed steam engine to a turbine. On inquiry I have found that some of the leading manufacturers in Melbourne and in another city in the Commonwealth admit that up to the present time they have not made a solitary high-speed reciprocating steam engine such as I am dealing with. Consequently, while there are industries still in full swing and still in need of encouragement so far as it can be given by the Tariff, I believe that it would be the height of folly to ask for a duty on that type of engine, which, so "far, has not been made in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I can assure my honorable friend, reluctantly, that if there were any .prospect of putting his proposal- through there might be some encouragement to make the attempt, but I am certain that there is no such prospect. The other House has sought to meet us in a fair and reasonable way. The position is that these genera-' tors for direct  coupling  to steam engines were included in the item against the wish of the Government, and the duties were made 5 per cent, and free. Originally the Government proposed a very substantial protection, because we thought that there was no reason why the articles should not be made in Australia. However, a proposal was carried against the Government here. I have loyally sought to keep it alive in conjunction with other items. This item forms practically part and parcel of a compromise which has been made, and which, I think, should be recognised. 1 have not sought at any time to get rid of my honorable friend's proposal, but have kept it alive, and it has formed an important factor in the compromise. He now seeks to make a very substantial extension, and that is to include generators for not only turbines but also high-speed reciprocating steam engines. This is not the time to make such an important and far-reaching amendment. It should have been proposed when we' were dealing with the other items. Having regard to the spirit of compromise which pervades the Chamber, I ask honorable senators, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> will not give way, to support my motion. </para>

                    <para>. - I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> to remember that the other House has given a very reasonable consideration to our requests, and to that extent it has, I think, placed an obligation upon the Senate wherever it can possibly be done to meet that House- in a like spirit. On this item it has certainly offered us a fair compromise. The difference as regards horse-power was the difference between10 and 500. The other House has suggested that the limit should be made 200. That appeals to me as a reasonable compromise between men wishing to make practical progress. </para>

                        <para>- It appears to me to be not an unfair compromise between the divergent views of the Houses. We cannot run theory to too fine a point. We have to be practical, and even in the case of a horse deal it is necessary to split the difference. The other House has practically come nearly half way to meet our view. It would lead to no good purpose if we were to adopt an amendment which would nullify the effect of that compromise. I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> that, having made his protest and assured his Western Australian 'friends that he is still loyal to their interests, he should withdraw his proposal. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the Senate adopted a most logical attitude when the item, .was first dealt with. We passed high duties of 30 and 20 per cent, on the coarser kinds of gloves, which include gardeners' gloves, driving gloves, and harvesting gloves. But when we reached this item dealing with the finer kinds of gloves we were told by the Ministry and assured all round that they were not made in Australia. The Committee rightly came to the conclusion that in those circumstances these were mere revenue duties. Many ardent protectionists who were prepared to give the highest protection were opposed to all revenue duties, and so requested that the item should be made free. That request was sent to another place. </para>

When I could not get the item free, I voted for the highest duty I could get, in order to try to induce the manufacture of the goods in Australia. I would sooner make the item free now than have duties of 15 and  jo  per cent., which can have no other effect than to take money out of the people's pockets. The Senate assumed not only an easily comprehensible, but an eminently logical position in its request, and it would have been a good thing if another place had acceded to it. </para>

                        <para>- The item has come back to us now in the way in which it ought to have been introduced at the first. It is a perfectly legitimate revenue item. The manufacture of gloves in Australia is at present that of the coarsest, and the industry for a long while to come will not be large enough to call for a protective duty. Gloves are articles which can very well afford to pay an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty, by which those who wear expensive gloves will pay more than those who buy cheaper gloves. </para>

                    <para>. - I think a great mistake was made in the beginning by another place in inserting this paragraph, by which women's and children's dress goods not weighing over 5 ozs. per square yard were brought under duties of 15 and 10 per cent., instead of protective duties of 30 and 25 per cent. It was done under the impression that those lighter goods were not made in Australia. As a matter of fact, samples have been exhibited both of flannels and tweeds which are actually made here, and which in warm climates would be most freely used. </para>

After fuller thought and experience of the Tariff, in the light of the importations that have come under this particular item, the other place have determined to terminate it as from yesterday. The effect will be to throw these goods under paragraph a of item 123 with duties of 30 and 25 per cent. In view of the spirit of compromise that has animated us, I move - </para>

                        <para>- Although technically such a thing is possible, it is and will be impossible in practice for scores of years to come. We shall' continue to import largely certain kinds of dress materials so long as we have a comparatively small population, and great varieties of climate. We shall not have the market to enable us to produce them. An effort was made to provide that such materials as were not likely to be manufactured in Australia should be admitted at a lower rate of duty than those manufactured here, or those which there was a near prospect of manufacturing. It was known by all who knew anything of the trade that' the great variety of women's dress fabrics would not be likely to be produced in Australia for many years to come, and it was urged that a high duty on them would be of no avail from a protective stand-point, but would become a tax on a necessary of life - ordinary decent clothing for women and children. The difficulty presented itself as to how to discriminate between women's and children's dress materials, and materials for men's wear. How could the Department ascertain what was going to be done with a certain fabric after it left the Customs House? The material could not be followed up, and might be worn by man, woman, or child. One warehouse was actually importing a material said to be for one purpose, at one rate of duty, whilst another warehouse was importing exactly the same kind of material, which, however, they could not claim was for the same purpose, at another rate of duty. When the first warehouse had the material, there was nothing to stop them from selling it for any purpose to which people wished to apply it. The principle of discrimination by weight, as adopted in Canada, was. then introduced. I endeavoured, and thought that I had the support of the Government, to get the weight limit increased to6Â½ oz. per square yard. The Government were well informed by people who manufactured these goods that 61/2 oz. would effectively discriminate between dress fabrics and fabrics worn by men, the heavier fabrics being such as we might make here, although it would be many years before we could possibly make them in any great variety. </para>

                        <para>- I contradict that statement, with authority. I have handled more of these goods than the honorable senator has any idea of, and know the weight of them.I am assured that  7  oz. per running yard of material 28 inches in width is the lightest fabric made for women's dress material in Australia. That is equivalent to about 9 oz. per square yard. Manufacturers of men's clothing inform me that the lightest fabric they handle, either imported or locally made is 10 or 11 oz. per running yard of 28 inches in width, which is equivalent to 12 or 13 oz. per square yard. The proposal now before us is to bring; all piece goods, woollen, or containing wool, under duties of 30 and 25 per cent., regardless of weight, or of the purpose for which they are to be used. If that is done, there will be no necessity to insert any discriminating words regarding women's and children's dress goods, or regarding the weight per square yard. They would only cause confusion and difficulty at every Customs House in Australia. I wish to protest against common dress fabrics, which must, and will, be imported, being subjected to this heavy revenue duty. Of course, it does not matter very much how we tax the rich people. They can afford it. But this will be a heavy impost upon the middle and poorer classes. I do not think that the members of the Labour Party would consent to it if they thoroughly understood the question. But I have been defeated in reference to the matter on several occasions, and, although I consider it my duty to protest still, I recognise that the effect will be to increase the revenue by a considerable amount. The Flinders-lane merchants also are glad to have dress goods dealt with in a simple manner, rather than have the Tariff complicated. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope that the Committee will press the request once more. I cannot understand a protectionist Government not making a better fight with respect to a matter that concerns a considerable number of working men in the Commonwealth. In view of the fact that the majority of the people of Australia have proclaimed themselves in favour of the policy of' protection, it is, I repeat, regrettable that the Government should not stand up for their principles in reference to such an item. In the first instance, the Government opposed the imposition of any duty upon gas meters. But in spite of that opposition, the Committee requested a duty of  25  per cent. Our request went to the House of Representatives, but was not acceded to. On reconsideration the Committee again insisted that there should be a duty of  25  per cent. on the complete meters, and that parts separate and distinct should come in duty free. That was a moderate request, and I thought that it would meet with the approbation of even the free-trade members of another place. In two States particularly - Victoria and New South Wales: - -a considerable number of men are engaged wholly and solely in the assembling of gas-meter parts. In what position will they be if the Government will not stand by them? Many of those men helped by their votes to secure the return of Victorian protectionists to this Parliament. Under the 1902 Tariff there was a duty of 12J per cent, on gas-meters. It was a very moderate protectionist duty, although inadequate in amount. The men were hopeful that on the introduction of a new Tariff they would secure the measure of relief that they claimed, and to which they were entitled. But instead of getting relief they are to be subjected to absolute "tree-trade conditions. </para>

The matter is a serious one, not only to the manufacturers but to the employes, because as soon as this Tariff comes into operation a large number of men will be thrown  out of employment. As a protectionist I will not willingly allow gas meters to come in absolutely free when they are being made in the country. The working men themselves have been up here day after day urging and pleading with protectionist members of Parliament to see that justice is done to them. </para>

We' are in politics because we hold various opinions with regard to fiscalism, and the Government, being a protectionist Government, it is up to them to see that a duty is imposed on gas meters. If they do not do so, there will, in a very few weeks, be a number of men out of employment in every one of the States. </para>

                        <para>- I claim the support of Labour members in this matter, whether they belong to the free-trade or to the protectionist school, because it seriously concerns working men in every one of the States. In trying to prevent injustice to them it is my duty to ask for the support of every member of the party to which I belong, and of all who have been returned to the Senate on protectionist principles. In another place last night, this duty was lost only by one vote, and I believe that if the matter is again submitted to honorable members, and the case for both sides is presented in a calm judicial way, one or two votes will be turned, and there will be little or no struggle between the Houses in connexion with our request.' I am surprised that the Government in the circumstances should not make a further fight for a duty of 25 per cent, on the completed meters, allowing parts separate and distinct to be admitted free. I ask honorable senators to .stand by their request in. this matter. If they do, I am satisfied that one or two votes in another place will be changed, and the people engaged in this industry will receive the' protection to which they are entitled. </para>

                    <para>. - My difficulty in dealing with this matter before, was that we have two commercial companies, and the meters required by one are admitted free, whilst it is proposed that a duty should be imposed on the meters required by the other. This must result in the handicapping" of one company in a way which I think is not fair. I made inquiries last week in Adelaide of the officials of these companies, and I' find that a ten- light electric meter is valued at from  40s.  to  60s.,  whilst a ten-light gas meter is valued at from  45s.  to  48s.  The values of the articles being so nearly the same, it does not appear to me  to  be right that the company requiring to use one should be fined by the imposition of a duty. whilst the other should be allowed to go scot free. If a duty had been imposed on electric meters, I should have been quite prepared to put gas meters on the same footing. </para>

In view of the fact that electric meters are free, it is a matter of simple justice that gas meters should also be free. </para>

                        <para>- I find that there is one exception. Under the old Victorian Tariff this industry enjoyed a measure of protection which made it a flourishing industry-. A reduction  of  the protection afforded to it caused it to languish,' but it did not cease  to  exist. Now we are asked to close it up altogether. This industry will absolutely cease to exist if gas meters are admitted free. We have in these matters dealt with another place most generously, and it is about time that the protectionist Government in this protectionist Chamber insisted upon retaining at least the protection which this industry previously enjoyed. </para>

                <para class="block">I do so for this reason : If is suggested that' linseed oil is a raw material of the paint industry ; but I wish to point out that in the present Tariff, that industry has been most generously considered. Under the old Tariff, paints ground in liquid were dutiable at 2s., and under this Tariff the duty has been increased to 4s. and the duty on paints prepared for us has been increased from 4s. to 6s.per cwt. I want honorable senators to realize that the most generous consideration has been extended by Parliament on other items to the paint industry. It is true that linseed oil is the painters' raw material, but under the old Tariff they had to pay a duty of 6d. per gallon, and enjoyed infinitely less protection than they now do. I think that it is unreasonable on the part of their representatives to complain now because we want to give a reasonable protection - equal to that given in 1902 - to the linseed industry. That must be obvious when I remind honorable senators that we have offered a bounty upon the production of linseed, from which, of course, oil will be duly made. </para>

                        <para>. - It will be remembered that under this item, as it was first submitted here, insecticides, sheep washes, and disinfectants were free. It was thought desirable, however, that insecticides and disinfectants n.e.i. should be taken out of the item and subjected to protective duties of . 25 and 15 per cent. Subsequently, the Senate requested the insertion of a new paragraph, providing for the free admission of pure pyrethrum flowers in packages containing not less than 28 lbs. The other House has endeavoured to meet us by recasting the item as it appears in the printed schedule. The effect of that alteration is to allow the free introduction of bulk disinfectants and insecticides, . and to insure that the bottling and tinning - which is a very considerable industry - shall be done here. Bottled and tinned packages will, of course, be subjected to duties of 15 and 10 per cent. I move - </para>

                    <para>. - This is a request that the Committee ought to press. We showed a very fair spirit of compromise before. Our original request was that all timber  1  inch or less in thickness should be counted as an inch in the calculation of a superficial foot: But when another place disagreed with that, we came down to1/2 an inch. That was going a full half-way towards meeting the desires of another place. I am credibly informed that our very moderate request was disagreed with in another place last night under somewhat of a misapprehension, and because of a mistake. I do not want to go into the matter, but I will casually observe that I understand that when the division was taken in another place, two members who were in favour of our amendment were paired with one man who was against it. We thus lost one vote. </para>

                        <para>- It was not. I do not put it down to anything more than a mistake. I am willing to let it go at that. Another member voted against our request under a misapprehension. The voting was extremely close, and we ought to send the matter back for reconsideration, in view of its importance. Some honorable senators have contended that this matter concerns only the industry of cutting up and working Australian timber. It means a great deal more. A large proportion of the timber used in Australia is imported, and is cut up by the local mills. I want as much of that work" as possible to be done in Australia. If this definition is adopted, it will not increase the price of timber at all. Its effect will be to cause the timber to be imported in larger sizes and cut up in Australian mills. We should do everything possible to encourage so desirable  ;t  result. I shall vote against the motion of the Vice-President of the Executive Council. </para>

                    I made inquiry when in Adelaide recently. I was told that whether Queensland timber was good enough or not was not the question; orders had been sent from there to Queensland two years in advance, but the Adelaide people could not depend on getting the timber. In the meantime, why should people who want to use timber be deprived of the opportunity of getting it from somewhere else? I have stated these facts, and whether we are protectionists or not, we must always submit to reason and commonsense. I shall therefore support the Government.

I do not accept those statements as correct. I believe they come, not from those who are anxious for the  progress of Australia and Australian industries, but from those who are ever ready to decry Australia and its possibilities. There is in Queensland timber of the highest and best qualities, and I cannot imagine that a demand for it would not be satisfied within a reasonable time. </para>

                        <para>- The statements made by honorable senators regarding the failure to supply Queensland timber come probably from the man in the street and not from reliable authorities. I appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell not to be carried 'away by such assertions regarding Australian industries. If timber suitable for building can be obtained in Queensland it is the honorable senator's duty to vote for the encouragement of the industry of that State, and not to be misled by any statement that orders cannot be fulfilled within a period of two years.  1  am satisfied, that, if the orders were forwarded to Queensland, the people there, who are just as businesslike as any in the Commonwealth, would be prepared to meet them. It is almost unthinkable that the demand cannot be supplied till two years after orders are sent. </para>

                    <para>As fully 80 per cent, of our hardwood is used in connexion with the softwoods for cheap buildings, it will be (if the Senate's recommendation is accepted) the means of closing down a number of the mills in Victoria, as if the. duty on the softwoods is increased, building will become more expensive, and, naturally, the demand for our hardwoods will fall off. To give you an illustration, Baltic timbers are used almost exclusively for floorings and linings, even in the districts where the hardwood is produced. We do not know the- number of hands employed, but feel certain there are as many in Victoria as in Queensland, and why should these men not be considered. </para>

                    <para>We are also agents for a mill in Queensland, which is not in the association, and can assure you that Queensland timber does not and cannot come into competition. There is no better timber than this Queensland pine for special work. It does not split nor shrink the same as others, and if supplies could be kept up, and the demand fully supplied, there would be no need to trouble <inline font-style="italic">re</inline> duties. Architects have been and are afraid to specify Queensland timber, as the long delay in securing delivery simply means that the timber cannot be properly seasoned. </para>
                    <para>As we are deeply interested in hardwood milling in this State, we would ask you to use your best endeavour to prevent an injustice being done to the people in Victoria who are dependent upon hardwood milling for their living, and repeat, if the Senate's recommendation is carried, it would practically ruin many of the hardwood mills in Victoria, -and, naturally, throw -a number of men out of employment. </para>

                <para class="block">I think that that evidence is clear enough. In addition, it has to be remembered that a large number of men are engaged in connexion with the hardwood trade, and that many of them would be thrown out of employment if the desire of the Queensland senators were carried out. In many of the weatherboard buildings of Western Australia and South Australia hardwood is used for the uprights and the heavy pm portions of the work, whilst the remainder of the buildings are. completed with soft wood. Soft woods like Baltic do not come into competition with any timber produced in Australia. The writer of the letter which I have quoted has a better opinion of Queensland timber than have one or two other gentlemen of my acquaintance. When I was in Adelaide last. week I called upon the foreman of a- large boot and clothing factory which does its own carpentering. He assured me that in his opinion Queensland timber was the worst possible timber for his purposes. In addition to the difficulty of getting it, he said that when it was obtained it was in such an unseasoned condition as to be practically useless. It is undoubtedly on account of the Queensland timber being sent out in an unseasoned condition that this gentleman was of opinion that Queensland hoop pine was only fit for making the bodies of drays and waggons, ( and was quite useless for shelving or shop fittings of any character ; because, he said, it shrinks in every way, even at the ends. </para>

                        <para>- I have been quoting the testimony of a practical man, who has endeavoured to use Queensland timber for various purposes, but found it to be useless. Although he contradicts the evidence of the saw-millers whose letter I have quoted, still, considerable weight must attach to that letter, because the firm, in addition to being interested in Victorian timber, are also agents for Queensland timber when it is possible to get it sent down to be disposed of in this State. I trust that the Committee will not press the request, the carrying of which would injure the whole of Australia, whilst it would not be of much use to Queensland. </para>

                    <para>. - The debate has entered upon lines which might properly be followed if we were initiating the discussion of this question. I dp not think that the assertion that Queensland timber is difficult to get is a reason why we should not be justified in imposing a heavy duty. The fact that Queensland timber is unseasoned, also, is merely an evidence that up to the present time the industry has not had much encouragement, and that the timber is sent from the forest green. That is a disadvantage that the extension of business will cure. But after all, that is not the point with which we have, to deal. We have already emphatically expressed our opinion that there ought to be such a duty as we have proposed and pressed upon the House of Representatives. But it appears that it is not practicable at this stage to secure what we desire. That is the only consideration that weighs with me. I do not believe that the adoption of the amendment requested by the Senate would injure any industry in Victoria. . I do not believe that fewer houses would be erected. But as we have strongly endeavoured to obtain what we conceived to be the' right thing in the interests of the Commonwealth, and as there must be some time limit to the discussion upon the Tariff, I venture to submit that it is not wise to press the request again. We have done our best, and there does not seem to be a reasonable hope of securing what we want. That is the ground upon which I say that the request should not be pressed. </para>

                    <para>. - I shall not attempt to reply to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story,</inline> who has given us one more evidence that he is what has been termed a " geographical " protectionist. So far as that matter is concerned - and I speak 1 think not only for myself, but for other Queenslanders- we have in dealing with this Tariff endeavoured to bear in mind that there are such places as the Northern Territory and Western Australia, and that Tasmania also is very much interested in the timber industry. But I wish to enter an emphatic protest against the manner in which the Vice-President of the Executive Council introduced his motion,, that we should not press our requested modification. I say deliberately that in the manner in which he dealt with the question he treated myself and other Queenslanders with great discourtesy. He repeated, in spite of the interjection that I made, the statement that  1  ft. x  1  ft. x  1  in. thick is the recognised standard measurement of " superficial -foot." Where does the honorable senator look for his recognised standard . measurement? Does he look to the Customs regulations of his own State, or does he look abroad ? It has been said., over and over again, - and has been proved " from the Statutes and regulations of Queensland, that, in that State - which is admitted to be the great timber State of Australia - another form of definition of " superficial foot " has been in existence' for a number of years, probably ever since  there  .was any Customs legislation in Queensland at all. </para>

When I make a statement definitely on such a point, I think that I am entitled to have it accepted, and "the Minister ought not to ignore my statement later on. I have been looking for an authoritative definition, and I have discovered a copy of the <inline font-style="italic">Civil Engineers'' Pocket-book,</inline> published by John Wy ley and Sons, for the year  1904.  Under the heading of " Timber Measurement," I find this line - </para>

                </quote>
                <para>Consequently, we -find from that definition that the mere fact that timber is  1  inch thick, or of any other thickness, is not recognised; but it is the cubic contents that make the "superficial foi.it." I admit that something may be said against the original proposal sent from the Senate - that is, that the duty should be charged on all timber, even if it were less than  1  inch, as if it were  1  inch thick. It is quite clear that if we wanted to get the best possible definition of "superficial foot," we should stick to the cubic inch idea, and charge so much per  100  cubic inches. But it is perfectly well known that in Australia timber is not sold' at so much per  .100  cubic inches. </para>

                        <para>- What the honorable senator says may be true, but my broad point is, that so far as the selling value of timber is. concerned, people, when they buy, do not pay half the cost or half the value for J-in. boards as for -i-in. boards. Whether the timber goes .into the country as J-in. or i-in. boards, it is proposed under the present Tariff that if a man buys  too  feet of J-in. boards, he shall only pay duty on 50 feet. I say that that is an unreasonable stretch of liberality on the part of Parliament towards the people who are introducing timber to this country, and it imposes an unreasonable handicap upon those engaged in the timber industry in Australia, whether as employes or as proprietors of mills. I  am not much exercised about the matter of pressing our request once more. We shall be sending other requests down to the House, of Representatives, and I cannot see that any serious difficulty will arise from renewing this particular request. . If it be a desirable thing in itself, it is right that we should do it. It is quite a proper thing to reiterate requests. I shall therefore vote in that direction. </para>

                    <para>. - Two questions have to be considered in relation to this matter.. It has been said that Queensland timber is not suitable for certain purposes. I do not say anything on that point, but I was certainly under the impression from the magnificent exhibits of Queensland timber which we have had in Melbourne and elsewhere that timber for all purposes was obtainable from Queensland equal in quality to any obtainable in Australia, and in many respects to any obtainable in any part of the world. I venture to suggest, even to those who are remarkably critical, that Queensland timbers of all kinds will stand trade tests very satisfactorily. Another factor which  is being considered is, that while it is admitted that Queensland timber is -suitable for the purposes for which it is required in the other States, there is such a difficulty in getting a sufficient supply- of it from Queensland .that it is suggested that by this request we are practically asking the people of the other States to pay an unreasonable price for their timber. I do not admit that statement. But even if it be true that the proposal would result in some slight increase in the cost of timber, it is my duty to point out that the Queensland Government is spending hundreds of thousands of pounds to open up the timber districts of the State by railways, and the objection raised would therefore gradually disappear. </para>

                        <para>- I say that assuming that the effect of the proposal would be to slightly increase the price of timber, and giving all that in, the Queensland Government is now spending so much money in opening up timber districts in order to meet the demand for timber in the other States, that the difficulty referred to will gradually disappear. If there be anything in the argument for protection, the course which is being adopted in Queensland to meet the difficulty raised is one which should be encouraged. I hope that the request will be pressed. </para>

                    <para>. - In dealing with this matter on a previous occasion I mentioned that parties in Adelaide had given orders for Queensland timber, and had had to wait a year or two before they could get the timber they ordered. As some doubt was thrown on my statement, I wish now to give the name of my informant, and to cast upon him the responsibility for the accuracy of the statement.

If the Queensland people,  do  that they are the only people in Australia who rio it. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. It appears to me that, the Queensland grievances in this matter can be remedied only by the application of some law, which would compel honesty in business in that State. A person who purchases Â§-in. timber in New South Wales would get it for half the price which he would be asked for. f-in. timber; but assuming figures,  which  may or may not be correct, if he buys f-in. timber at 5s. 3d. per 100 running feet, he can buy J-in. timber at 6s. 9d. or 7s. ; f-in. at 8s. 6d. or 8s. 9d. ; and i-in. timber at from '12s. to 12s. 6d. per .100 running feet. That is in accordance with the practice in every State of the Commonwealth, with the exception of Queensland. It would, therefore, appear that, no matter what we do in this Tariff, we cannot make Queenslanders honest. </para>

                        <para>- Then the Queensland Parliament must have had a dishonest intent in doing it. I do not think that the question involved is worth a struggle-. Honorable senators have admitted that,  no matter what we do with this Tariff, we cannot shut out Baltic timber or the lighter pines. Even in Western Australia, where, in the jarrah timber, we have as good a hardwood as, perhaps, any to be found in Queensland for certain building purposes, and which can be used for lining and flooring, there is a large number of people who prefer to stud their buildings more closely and use the lighter pines in preference to using jarrah for these purposes. This does not interfere in any way with the sale of jarrah, and, in the circumstances, to impose a duty on the other timbers would be merely to impose an unnecessary burden on the people who will continue to use them. I am not prepared to vote for pressing the request. </para>

                    <para>.- I think that the principal object of the request is being lost sight of. The .  question  is not whether the saw-millers of Queensland are honest or dishonest. They sell their timber in accordance with a recognised trade practice as to measurement and price. As I understand the matter, the proposal is that timber measuring_ 12 x 12 x 1 inch shall be reckoned as that size. The object of the proposal appears to me not to be to specially favour Queensland timber, but, so far as possible, to insure that the work of dressing the timber which, for a considerable time, will continue to be imported, shall be done in Australia. I do not believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell, in saying that orders sent to Queensland could not be fulfilled, misrepresented the position for a moment. I am satisfied that some time ago orders sent to Queensland could not be fulfilled. The Queensland Director of Forests, when in Melbourne, made the statement that if large orders poured into the Queensland millers before railways were extended into the timber districts, it would be some time before they could be fulfilled. But it seems to me that the interjection of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> supplies exactly what was required. When he was asked if he would have to pay as much for 100 running feet of |.-inch. board as he would for 100 feet of i-inch board, he said " No," and that he would have to pay one-half plus the cost of handling the timber in the saw-mills. We want that cost, which he says is plus, to be distributed amongst our workers. At the present time we import from America and the Baltic a large quantity of timber, which comes in under i inch thick, 6 inches wide, planed on both sides, arid tongued and grooved. All that work is done outside Australia at wages which, at any rate in some instances, are considerably lower than the rates paid in any portion of Australia where that sort of work is done. The only argument which I can understand in this matter is that, if possible, that work should be done here. With that object in view, we define a foot of timber for Customs purposes as an\&gt; thing between 1/2-inch and an inch. How much does it add to the cost of the timber ? </para>

                        <para>- If this _ timber is imported over 1/2-inch thick, it will simply pay double the duty on the lowest estimate that wel have here. Therefore, it seems to me that if we have two of them, it will only make the difference of a double duty. If that is sufficient to compel the importers of the timber to get all that work done here, it will satisfy us. I do not think that it is likely to prevent the importation of a lot of this timber. At the same time I believe that it will have the effect of compelling a good deal of the work which is now done outside at low rates of wages to be done here. </para>

                    <para>. - I rise to correct a mistake which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> made. He stated that the duty on this timber is only 6d. per 100 super, feet. I knew that it was more, and I have just' ascertained from the Customs officer that it is 3s. The only difference would be that every user of matchboard and flooringboard would pay 3s. extra on every 100 super, feet, that he used, and as 100 super, feet equal only 10 feet square, honorable senators can easily imagine that it will increase very considerably the cost of buildings, even a very small house. </para>

                        <para>- That is not the question. It is admitted by every one who knows anything about the subject that it will not cause any extra work to be done here, and that it will be merely a heavy revenue duty. If I felt that there was any chance of getting the work done here, and, of using Australian timber instead of imported timber, I should be found battling just as earnestly in that- direction as is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley.</inline></para>

                        <para>- On a previous ocaSion, I pointed out that one of the objections 1 to using hardwood for the purposes for which the imported wood is used is, that when seasoned, it is so hard that it costs twice as much to work it. In addition to the increased cost of the timber, there is the increased cost of the labour used in . dressing the timber and building the house. I feel quite satisfied that if this request were agreed to by the other House, it would only mean that on <inline font-style="italic">ill</inline> J-inch timber there would be an increased cost of 3s. per 100 super, feet, which would make, a difference of, at any rate,, several pounds' in the cost of the smallest house. It will be the man who most needs  assistance - the man who goes into the backblocks, takes up a selection and erects  a  little two-roomed house until he can afford to build a substantial stone house- .who will have to pay the piper. I urge the Committee not to press the request simply because it will not benefit any one in Australia, not even the saw-millers in Queensland. </para>

There is a great difference between this modified request and the original request, which I confess I did not like. Originally the idea was that any thickness less than an inch should be reckoned as an inch. That, I think, was hardly fair. . But the modification to which we agreed the other night, on the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> is that any thickness below half an inch shall be treated as an inch. </para>

                        <para>- You, sir, know that what is called1/2inch stuff does not run one half-inch thick, and that what is called3/8inch stuff is very little more than 5/16-inch thick. . Every one knows that the alteration requested by the Senate will allow most of the ceiling stuff to come in as it did before - that is without any increase of duty. The only effect which I think it will have will be to afford some protection to hardwood flooring boards. It is very rarely that any timber thicker than 1/2-inch. is used for lining houses. But there is a great deal of stuff which is imported to be used for flooring, and which, from a proper protectionist stand- point, ought not to be allowed to come in because, in nearly every State, sufficient good flooring boards could be produced to satisfy local wants. It seems to me that we might reasonably accept the modification of our request. </para>

Another place by way of compromise proposed that stained glass windows should be dutiable at 20 per cent. That compromise was most reasonable. I move - </para>

                    <para>. - We have listened to a number of more or less interesting speeches on the first reading of this measure. One was extremely interesting from an antiquarian point of view. I refer to that delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford.</inline> He appears to be the " Rip Van Winkle " of politics. After falling asleep for. about half a century, he suddenly wakes up and finds that everything is out of gear. He is dissatisfied because the Federation has sent away the kanakas. He is displeased because Japanese and other Asiatics are not permitted to invade our territory and destroy our racial and industrial system. Nothing that Australia has done in the past, is doing now, or is likely to do in the future, meets with his approbation. He looks upon Australia as the Ishmael of the nations, with its hand against every other country and every other country's hand against it. I had hoped that his visit to England would give him a clearer impression of the beauties and glories of Australia, and that, coming fresh from the leaden skies of Great Britain to the sunny atmosphere of this southern Commonwealth, he would have a keener appreciation of the many advantages, climatic, social, political, and industrial, that we enjoy. But he appears to persist in playing the <inline font-style="italic">role</inline> of the Knight of the Rueful Countenance. ' Nothing that is being done pleases him; nothing that is likely to be done in the future will please him. Everything has gone wrong, and apparently he has given up all hope of setting it right. I think Australia has gained a great deal from Federation, notwithstanding what the honorable senator said. She has dealt with the Asiatic question, given every man and woman in the continent the franchise, and is now laying the foundation of an industrial and social system which will, 1 hope, exceed in its fairness to the great masses of her people any that is in operation in any other country. Indeed. I look upon Australia as the flower of the nations. My only hope is that she will continue! in the path which she has outlined for herself and take no heed of Jeremiahs like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Pulsford. The honorable senator was anxious that our Defence system should be put into proper shape. We have been a nation for only seven years. We have had a great deal of preliminary work to do, and, up to date, Defence has not been an exceedingly pressing matter. But we are now preparing to set our house in order from a Defence, point of view, and I trust that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> will give the Federal Parliament the benefit of his research in that direction. The honorable senator was also dissatisfied with our postal service. He stated that the Post and Telegraph Department is in a much more disorganized condition than ever it was under the States. I doubt that very much. I notice - and  I  have made some inquiries on the subject - that Australia has absolutely the best post and telegraph system on the face of the globe. There is no other country that I know of or have read about or heard of that provides such facilities for a spars; population scattered over vast distances as Australia does in connexion with its post and telegraph service. </para>

                <para>SenatorSTEWART.- I know that, and I propose to allude to one or two of them before I finish. I merely start with the assertion, which I think any one who has any knowledge of the subject will at once admit, that when we take all the circumstances into account the Australian post and telegraph system stands pre-eminent amongst the systems of the world. There are spots on the sun. We know perfectly well that there are many complaints from particular portions of the continent about lack of services. I say deliberately - although I may be, perhaps, accused, as I was once before, of making a kind of King Charles' head of the subject - that our system of land monopoly, which has grown up and which is flourishing so luxuriously in Australia, is responsible for a great deal of the expense which we are compelled to incur. Vast areas of good land are held by monopolists along our railway lines. People who want to use that land are compelled to go farther afield. The post-office must follow them. The telegraph must follow them. The telephone must follow them. The school must follow them. The policeman must follow them. The road builder must follow them. Every adjunct of civilization is compelled to follow these pioneers of ours, who are, as I have said, driven so much farther afield than they ought to be by the evil of land monopoly.- That is only by the way, however. Now, with regard to the complaints which are being made against the Post and Telegraph Department, one reason for the general clamour which the capitalistic press of Australia is making against the Post' Office is this : that the Government is supposed to be under the heel of the Labour Party ; and the Labour Party, as every one knows, is a party which advocates and believes in a system of collectivism. "Look at your Post Office!" say the great dailies; "Look at this example of socialism ! Look at the disorganization which prevails within it !" When the complaints of the public are boiled down we find that in 90 cases out of 100 people themselves are to blame, and not the Department. But I know that in many cases there have been real grounds of complaint. Why? Simply because the various Treasurers of the Commonwealth have been starving the Post and Telegraph Department in order that they might be able to hand back more and more money to the States.- That is the sole reason, to my mind, for the present disorganization in our postal and telegraphic system. It has been absolutely starved. Look at the expansion which has taken place in this Department since Federation was established - an expansion beyond example. We have had a number of the most prosperous years that Australia has ever been blessed with. Our business, private .and public, has .gone up by leaps and bounds. The business of the Post' Office has increased in a like proportion. But, unfortunately, owing to the starvation policy of our Governments, the hands in the Post Office have not kept pace with trie new business. New telegraph lines have not been erected where they ought to have been. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator probably knows that even in Heaven, which is supposed to be a place where perfection reigns, there has been something wrong. One occupant of 'those realms became discontented and was kicked out of doors because he became an agitator. If things do not go right even in, a place' where perfection is supposed to have reigned, we cannot expect that they will go altogether right here. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> himself is very largely to blame for the position of the Post and Telegraph Department. He is one of those who have been, continually crying out for more and more money for the States. " Look after the poor States ; see that they are not placed in a position of disadvantage so far as their finances are concerned." Last night he told us what he would do with the States' debts, and how he would dispose of the " Braddon blot." But he spoke, not as a member of the Commonwealth Parliament, but very much as a member of a State Parliament might have done. He did not propose to find funds for the Commonwealth. All his efforts were exhausted in showing members of the Commonwealth Parliament how they might find money for the States. I am here, and the honorable senator is here, not to finance the States, but to finance the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- I repeat, that for the trouble in the Post Office the people who are continually crying out that more and more money should be kept for the States are largely responsible. The policy which has been pursued in that direction has been a starvation policy. It does not matter how good a horse you may have, if you do not feed the animal he can do no work for you. The same thing applies to a public department. As far as I can see, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> there is really no occasion whatever for a Royal Commission to inquire into the. condition of the Post Office. I believe that what has been complained of can be remedied without .the matter being referred to a body which may report two or three years hence, and whose report may ultimately be placed in the pigeon-holes of the Department. What the Post Office wants is more money now, and a good deal of it. Is the Government prepared to give it more money ? That . seems to me to be the whole question at issue. If the Government is not so prepared, the present state of disorganization must continue. . </para>

What does the Public Service Commissioner know about it? He is not brought into contact with the. Department. What can the Treasurer know ? All that he looks at is the total of his figures. If he finds that more money is being spent than he is inclined to see spent, the Treasurer, ashe told the House of Representatives, simply draws his pen through the amount. But that is not the way to manage a great public Department. That sort of thing would not last twenty-four hours in a large private business. </para>

                        <para>- I say that if these officers are fit to hold the positions which they occupy, wo ought to give them more men if they say that they want more. If the honorable senator had a manager who wrote down to him and said, " <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Millen,</inline> I want two more men," what would the honorable senator do? If he had confidence in the manager he would send him two additional men. If he had not confidence in the manager, he not only would not give him the two men, but would request him to resign or dismiss him. I say that if the Commonwealth has confidence in its manager - and if it has not, he ought not to be there - we must take his advice upon these matters. He is the only person who is in a position to say whether he requires more assistants or not. A proposal has been mooted to place the Post Office in commission. That appears to me to be simply a device of weakness. The Post Office is a public Department, no doubt, but it is not to be compared for a single moment with our railways. The system of political management in connexion with the railways did produce a crop of evils. But we have not got away from those evils yet. I do not think that we ever shall. Indeed, I am not very sure that it is desirable that we should get away from them, because, when all is said and done, our railways are the property of the people, and the people are entitled to have their own property managed in the way they like best. Our Post Office has been established, and is being run for the convenience of the people of Australia. The man who lives  500  miles away from Melbourne is as much entitled to the benefits of the Post Office, or to such benefits as can be bestowed upon him in his isolated situation, as is the man who lives in Bourke-street ; and it ought to be the 'object of our Post and' Telegraph Department, and of the Government, and of Parliament, and of the people of Australia, to see that a citizen, wherever he lives, gets the benefits arising from the work of this institution. A proposal has been made to hand the Post Office over to Commissioners, so that it may be run on business lines. What do the advocates of that policy mean by !' business lines " ? What do they want with three Commissioners? We have sir Commissioners now. We have the  Deputy  Postmasters-General, one in each State They stand in the place of Commissioners. We have also the Secretary to the Postmaster-General, who is in the position of a general manager, and at the apex of the whole system we have the Postmaster-General. We have the Public Service Commissioner also, and it is now suggested that in addition to all these we should have three Commissioners. I do not care if we have  103  Commissioners if we do not find enough money for the Department it cannot be worked smoothly or effectively. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know what honorable senators may call political influence. If the people of a certain district come to me and say, ' ' We want a post office," is it not my duty to submit their request to the Postmaster-General ? If not, what am I here for ? If a good case is made out ought not the post office asked for to be established ? Do honorable senators say that that would be using political influence? If they do, I say that in my judgment that is one of the purposes for which they are here. They are here not only to see that the Department is managed effectively, but also that every citizen gets the benefit of it. With regard to appointments, I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger that members of the Federal Parliament, so far as I know, have no more influence than the man in the moon. Personally I do not desire to have any such influence. I thank. Heaven every day that I have no earthly influence in getting people appointments under the Government, because if I had I know that I should be pestered morning, noon, and night, and that if I devoted myself to that kind of thing I should not have time for any other duties. 1 am therefore profoundly grateful that I have nothing to do with it. That being the case, where does the political influence come in? Surely Parliament should have some control over the people's Post Office? We are a board of managers appointed by the people to look after the Post Office. Yet some people seem to think that although we have been specially appointed for that purpose we ought to have nothing to do with it. So far as I am concerned I may say at once that the proposal to hand the Post and Telegraph Department over to Commissioners will get no support from me unless very much stronger reasons are submitted in its favour than any that have yet Been brought forward. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> complained that we have not a uniform stamp throughout the Commonwealth. I think it is very desirable that we should have a uniform stamp, and the sooner that reform is established the better. I believe with the honorable senator also that there is a great deal of room for improvement, not only in connexion with the Postal Department, but with the telegraph, and especially with the telephone service. Going to the telephone here I sometimes have the greatest difficulty in getting on or getting off. or in carrying on a conversation. Something seems to be radically wrong. </para>

                        <para>- Just so. I say that that ought not to be. If our telephone system is to be of use to the community, any one desiring to communicate with another by its means should be able to do so almost instantaneously, and the instruments should be perfectly isolated. As every one knows they are not, and when you put your ear to the receiver, you can hear a very babel of sound. These are matters to which the Government might very well direct their attention. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> last night quoted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lecky</inline> as pleading for sound finance above everything. That is what 1 am here to plead for tonight. Have we got it? Is our present system of taxation a sound one? Is it founded on common sense or is it not rather built up on a series of absurdities? Just imagine the position we are in here in regard to the government of Australia. Let us ask ourselves why Governments are instituted. Are they not established for the protection of life and property ? Might we not say that they are in effect the large insurance societies inasmuch as they insure to every citizen, so far. as it is possible for any human power to do so, the full and peaceful possession of his life and property ? If we look . upon Government as a vast insurance society, it will be admitted that the contributions to Government should be regulated exactly on the same principle as that which regulates the contributions to insurance companies. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> had property worth Â£2,000, and wished to insure it with some company, he would have to pay a very much larger premium than I should have to pay if I was to insure a property worth onlyÂ£200. He would have to pay a premium corresponding to. the risk of Â£2,000, whilst I would have to pay a premium corresponding to my risk of Â£200. </para>

                        <para>- That I think would be a sound and wise principle to adopt with regard to our finances. A man should contribute to the revenue of the country in proportion to the benefits which he enjoys under the Government of the country. If one man has , Â£10.000 he should pay a very much larger contribution to the revenue than one who has only Â£100, and the man who hasÂ£100 should pay more than the man who has nothing but his bare hands. But what is the system in operation at the present moment ? It takes no heed whatever of a man's possessions. It simply says : " If you smoke tobacco, you must contribute to the cost of government." Why should the man who smokes tobacco contribute more to the revenue than the man who does not. The man who does not smoke is protected equally by Government with the man who does, and enjoys the benefits which flow from good government as much as the man who does smoke. Suppose our people stopped smoking, what would become of the revenue? Where would our sound finance come in then ? It would disappear utterly. Then, again, we have taxation of stimulants and revenue duties- hundreds of them. So that men do not, under our present sytem, contribute to the cost of government according to their means, but in proportion as they eat, drink, wear, or in some other fashion consume goods on which revenue duties have been imposed. So that the man to whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell referred a. moment ago, the poor man with the large family, and the small wages, pays proportionately very much more in taxation than any other man in the community. Instead of being rewarded as he should be for being a good citizen, replenishing the earth, adding to the population of the Commonwealth, and doing away with the necessity for expenditure on immigration, he is by our vicious system of taxation actually penalized. I claim that an intelligent people, represented by an intelligent Parliament, would at the veryearliestopportunity,layvoilent hands on this foolish system of taxation, and substitute for it something sound and wise. There is another aspect of the question which should be considered. We hear a great deal about our States debt's. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> last night referred to the fact that the total debts of the fifty members of the United States Confederation were onlyÂ£50,000,000, whereas ours are Â£250,000,000. A population of  80,000,000  is in debt to the tune ofÂ£50,000,000, and our population of  4,000,000  is up to its neck in debt to the tune of Â£250,000,000.But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> did not tell us what we know, and what he knows, and should have stated, that the money, or a very large proportion of it which has been borrowed by Australia has been used for development purposes, and that, so far as that matter is concerned, Australia to-day, stands in a position that is unparalleled on the face of the earth. </para>

I point out to the honorable senator and others who are fond of prating about the glories of private enterprize that, notwithstanding Australia's great debt and her huge interest bill, and notwithstanding the fact that she has built railways in many places where they ought not to have been built, she has still been able to borrow money and develop her resources at a cheaper rate than any other country I know of. Take Canada, for instance, the money required to build the railways of the Dominion was borrowed at  5  per cent. and 6 per cent. We have one example of a private railway in Queensland. I refer to the Chillagoe railway. It is a very good railway, and it ought to have been built by the State. The promoters of that enterprise had to borrow money at <inline font-style="italic">6</inline> per cent. ? </para>

                        <para>- Only a few years ago, and I am in a position to say that their  , Â£100  debentures were sold in the open market for less than  Â£50.  That is an example of private enterprise. I could tell honorable senators something more about other private railway enterprises which are in a somewhat similar position. Our system of public ownership of railways has been a Godsend, as it has permitted Australia to be developed much more rapidly and effectually than ever could have been the case under a system of private railway ownership. I wish to direct the attention of honorable gentlemen to the fact that we have borrowed Â£250,000,000, of which we have spent  Â£200,000,000  in building railways, that their construction has increased the value of our lands by at least as enormous a sum, at the very lowest estimate, that those  Â£200,000,000  are yielding, at the lowest computation,  5  per cent, per annum, which makes an annual crop of community- created increment of  ^10,000,000.  Where does it go? Into the public Treasury? No fear ! The public Treasury does not handle a single farthing of it. .. Every sovereign of that sum passes into the pockets of private individuals. We hear a great deal about the tremendous burdens of taxation which the people of the Commonwealth are called upon to bear; but the whole tale is never unfolded to us. We are told that we pay  ,Â£12,000,000  in Customs duties to the public tax-gatherer, but not a word is said about the private tax-gatherer who operates under cover, but none the less effectually, and robs the people of from  ,Â£10,000,000  to  Â£12,000,000  annually that has been produced by the use of money which has been borrowed on their credit, and which they will have to pay. Until the. Commonwealth can seize- a portion of this community created increment, and place it' in the public Treasury - either of the States or of the Commonwealth - we shall never have anything approaching to a system of sound finance. But even the whole tale has not yet been told. The ulterior effects of the system of taxation are even worse than the direct burdens which they place upon the people. But for this vicious system, we could never have had the immense land monopoly that we have in Australia to-day. If taxation had proceeded on proper lines from the institution of Australia, or from very shortly afterwards, it would have been impossible for any one to aggrandize to himself huge areas of country, and to hold it up, dog-in-the-manger like, against settlement, because if there had been no Customs taxation, or comparatively little of it, then the people would have been compelled to turn to the community-created increment for income to meet current expenditure. That being the case, no man, or company, would have been in a position to monopolize land which he or it was not prepared to put to its best use. I think it must be apparent to every one that this evil of land monopoly is the most dangerous foe to progress that we have at the present time within the Commonwealth. We hear a great deal about the English capitalist withdrawing his capital. We are told that the Labour Party is frightening the capitalist, that we will not permit immigrants to enter, that' we have erected a ring fence round the continent, and are keeping, everybody out. But what about the men who have erected ring fences round millions of acres .of our most fertile country, and. are holding those lands without making a single contribution to the State? Through those lands, railways have been built which in many cases have doubled, trebled, quadrupled their values, and yet the monopolists hang on. Until this problem is solved, Australia will never be in the position which it ought to occupy. We are talking about defence. We have a population of only 4,000,000. Victoria itself could support 4,000,000 people easily, and yet millions of acres of its land - and its best land too - are lying absolutely idle because it is held by these dog-in-the-manger monopolists. What becomes of our legitimate settlers ? They are. driven out to the wilderness of the Mallee, or to the wilds of Gippsland. They have to eat the stones for bread, .and to drink the barrenness of the situation, while within easy distance of Melbourne, and along the railway lines, millions of acres, rolling with fatness, are held out of occupancy by these men, who are robbing the community of its just rights. That is a problem which must be solved. We want more people to defend our continent, and if we have to choose between the monopolists and its progress we must choose the latter. </para>

                        <para>- No, I would let him dig his own ground, and make him raise something from it instead of holding it back for the community-created increment. . I emphasize this point : that until we have a sound system of taxation, until we attack, and very largely destroy, the system of raising revenue by means of Customs, duties, and so become enabled to substitute for it direct land value taxation, Australia will not make any progress worth talking about. I do not wish to say any more on that head. I believe that the great political battle of the future will be fought on this question of land monopoly, and I ask every one who has faith in Australia - every one who desires to see her prosper, and to lift her out of the rut - to rally round the banner of anti-land monopoly. </para>

                <para class="block">Now, a number of the financial experts have dealt at great length with the position as between the Commonwealth and the States. Without posing for a moment as one who has an expert knowledge of finance, I, as a member of this Parliament, claim the right to make a few remarks on what is, no doubt, one of the most important subjects - after the one I have just been attempting to deal with -which can occupy the minds of our people. The Federal Treasurer has outlined a scheme, and I ask honorable senators to consider for a few moments what it is like.  His  proposal is to pay the States a fixed sum of Â£6, 000,000 per annum for five years, and then, for a period of thirty years, an additional sum, so that at the end of thirty-five years the whole of the present State debts will have been wiped out. Thirty-five years from the date when this system of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne begins to operate, if it ever does, the Commonwealth will have to find nearly , Â£9.000,000 per annum for the States, in addition to sufficient money to carry on its own business. That is exactly the position which the Commonwealth will find itself in if it adopts his policy. With regard to the fixed sum', at present the arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States is that we hand over to them three-fourths of whatever sum we collect from Customs and Excise duties, less the cost of collection. It does not matter whether that sum is Â£1, 000,000 or Â£10, 000, 000, the States claim three-fourths of it, and can claim no more. That is the utmost of our liability so far as the States are concerned. But if we agree to hand over to them a fixed sum, no matter what it may be, we shall alter the situation completely ; we shall tie our hands, so to speak, financially ; we shall bind ourselves to raise a certain sum every year for the States in addition to what we need for our own purposes. We are not bound, at the present moment, to raise a farthing for the States. Under the Braddon section, as it exists now, this Parliament can sweep away the Customs duties entirely. </para>

                        <para>- No, now. We could go in for an absolutely free-trade policy, which would mean no revenue from the Customs House. Of course, we would collect nothing, and the States would get three-fourths of it.

                <para class="block">In any case, that is the position at the present moment. It will be seen that, so far as its finances and policy of taxation are concerned, the Commonwealth is in a much better position now than <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne's policy would place it in. To my mind, it is extremely desirable that the authority on which rests the obligation of raising money should also have the responsibility of spending it. If the States spend Â£10,000,000 between them, they, and not the Commonwealth, should be responsible for raising that money. And if the Commonwealth raises Â£12,000,000 it should be responsible for the spending of that money, and the States ought to have nothing to do with it. It is, I think, a highly immoral and injudicious position that one authority should be charged with the levying of taxation while another should have the responsibility of spending the money. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. While that state of affairs continues, while the Commonwealth raises either a fixed sum or any other sum for the States, we never can have a complete severance of State and Federal finance. The one will always be bound up with the other. Take <inline font-weight="bold">Sir WilliamLyne's</inline> fixed payment idea. That honorable gentleman claims as one of the good points of his scheme that in thirty-five years it absolutely severs State and Federal finance. It does nothing of the kind. At the end of that period, the Commonwealth will be raising nearly Â£9,000,000 per annum for the States, to pay interest upon the debts of the States. Of course, they will be Commonwealth debts in name, but in reality they will be State debts, incurred for the building of railways and other public utilities, and, although the Commonwealth will be responsible for the principal and interest, it will have no control over the railways. When the Commonwealth takes over their present responsibilities, the States desire that they shall have complete freedom to borrow as much as they please - that when the Commonwealth Parliament relieves them of the obligation of Â£250,000,000, which now rests upon them, they shall be free to at once pile up other obligations. Is that a business proposition? Would not any man who became guarantor for another for Â£1,000 require some security that the latter would not 'incur fresh obligations without his consent, while the original obligation continued? That would be only business. If it is a fair business proposition in private life it is also a fair business proposition in public life. </para>

                        <para>- My experience of life is that communities in their management of finance are much more immoral than are private individuals. Unless we can put the financial affairs of the Commonwealth and of the States upon a proper business footing, the result will be a great deal of dissatisfaction. The States are now, so to speak, between the devil and the deep sea. If the debts are handed over to the Commonwealth, every State will be liable, not only for its own debts, but for those of every other State. Victoria, in addition to being liable for its own debts, will be liable for those of New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania. If that is so, would it not be fair and reasonable to stipulate that Western Australia, for instance, which is at present in an undeveloped condition, should ask the consent of Victoria and the other States before borrowing money for additional expenditure? I admit at once that it would be putting the States in an unenviable position. The people of Victoria and New South Wales, both of which States have complete railway systems, might decide that Western  Australia  did not need a railway, and might, therefore, vote against it. The people of one State might even become envious of the development of other States, and might use their utmost endeavours to prevent that development, so that the whole question bristles with difficulties. If the States hand the debts over to the Commonwealth, there is difficulty. If they do not hand them over to the Commonwealth, there is difficulty. There is no doubt a great deal of advantage to be gained by the consolidation of the debts. I believe a very large saving in interest could be made, but if that is the case the States ought, in return for those benefits, to be prepared to give something away. They cannot, or ought not, to expect to get all the fat of the bargain. I wish to examine <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne's proposal a little more in detail. It is to make a fixed payment to the States after 19 10 of Â£6,000,000 a year for five years, and increase the payment thereafter by about 5 per cent. per annum. Let us see how that would pan out according to our present revenue. Our total expenditure for the present year will be approximately Â£6,115,000. Our estimated revenue is Â£15,315,000. The balance is , Â£9,200,000, and, if the Surplus Revenue Bill is passed, the sum to be handed back to the States will be about Â£8,750,000. Our expenditure this year is well over , Â£6,000,000, but next year we shall have to face an additional expenditure of Â£1,500,000 for old-age pensions, , Â£300,000 for defence, Â£500,000 for the Post Office, if that institution is to be placed in anything like an efficient condition, and about Â£30,000 for a High Commissioner - and it is high time a High Commissioner was appointed to represent Australia at the heart of the Empire. The Capital Site question cannot be indefinitely staved off, and I believe that Â£150,000 will have to be spent in connexion with it. During the next year we have in those directions an expenditure of at least Â£2,500,000 foreshadowed over and above the Â£6,115,000. incurred during the present financial year, so that for the year 1908-9, the Commonwealth, instead of expending a little over Â£6,000,000, will spend Â£8,650,000. </para>

                        <para>- We must, as the honorable senator interjects, take over the lighthouses, and a number of other Departments. There is some talk of establishing a Commonwealth Agricultural Bureau. We are almost bound to take over the Northern Territory, which will cost us anything from Â£150,000 to Â£200,000 a year. I am sure our friends from Western Australia live in hope that their railway will be built, and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne pointed out, there will inevitably be a deficiency on that line for a number of years of, say, Â£50,000 per annum. There will also be the deficiency on the railway through the heart of Australia between Oodnadatta and </para>

                <para class="block">Pine Creek; ,Â£210,000 is the sum estimated by the financial experts of the Government on that, undertaking, with Â£93,000 for interest and sinking fund. There is Â£450,000 for interest and sinking fund on the cost of transferred properties, Â£50,000 for advertising and immigration, and. Â£50,000 for miscellaneous, or a still further addition to our expenditure of Â£1,060,000; making the expenditure of the 'Commonwealth in 1910-11, by the time the " Braddon blot" expires, Â£9,700,000, or approximately Â£^10,000,000, as against <inline font-style="italic">jÂ£6,</inline> 1 15,000 in 1907-8. If <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne's proposal is adopted, our revenue in 191 1, to meet that expenditure, should be Â£16,000,000. What is the estimate of the experts in that . regard ? This year, our revenue from the Customs is over Â£12,000,000 ; but the experts calculate, and I believe they are right, especially if the Tariff works as it is intended to work, by having a protective incidence, that our revenue from that source, instead of becoming greater, will inevitably become less. The experts estimate the total revenue for 191 1 at Â£13,625,000, to meet an expenditure, taking the Government's own figures, of Â£16,000,000, showing a deficit of Â£2,375,000. We know that these estimates always err on the wrong side. The expenditure is usually "very much larger than was expected, and the revenue is often much less. There is another .aspect of this question which ought to be considered. Not only will the Tariff, if its incidence is protective, yield much less in 1911 than during the current or next year, but our revenue from other sources cannot continue at its present level. Australia for the past few years has been riding on the crest of a wave of prosperity. There never has been a' time in the history of Australia when such prosperity reigned. During the past few years, the prices of metals, such as copper, tin, and silver, have been at boom figures, wool ditto, butter ditto. In every department of industry during the past few years, the greatest prosperity has existed; but that boom time has passed, or is rapidly passing. The price of metals has fallen by 50 per cent., and there is very little hope of recovery. There is a drought in Victoria and several other portions of the Commonwealth. The probability is that before long we shall have a renewal - I hope only a partial one - of the state of drought which unfortunately existed in other parts of Australia until a very recent date. I hope we shall never have a drought like the last one. But we can never tell. The normal course of things in Australia is a succession of good seasons and then a succession of bad ones. The same applies with regard to prices. .Wheat is at a good price now, 'but very probably within a year or two the price will fall just as the price of wool has gone down. Our prosperity depends very largely upon the seasons, and a number of other considerations into which I need not enter. Now, every one of these circumstances tends to this conclusion - that we cannot expect during the next few years to have the overflowing revenue with which we have recently been favoured. Let me revert for a moment to our protectionist Tariff. At the present time, I think we get about Â£2 6s. per head of the population from Customs and Excise. In the United States, the Tariff is what is known as a highly scientific protectionist one, and yields only about Â£1 4s. or Â£1 5s. per head per annum of the population. Now that, I think, is the point to which we are gradually coming in Australia. The more protective we make our Tariff, the less revenue shall we derive from it. So that in the very near future, I hops our revenue from that source will be, comparatively speaking, very much less per . head of the population than it is at present. I do not know how the Government propose to make up the deficit which I have outlined, and of which I an sure the members 'of the Ministry are at least as cognisant as I am. But I know  that on one occasion the present Government itself proposed to ask the people of Australia whether they would consent to the imposition of special Customs goods. I read recently, in one of the most powerful newspaper organs in the Commonwealth, a suggestion that it would be an easy matter to make up . this deficit of over Â£2,000,000 by imposing special duties on such articles as tea, kerosene, and other commodities used by the poorest people in the country. There was not a word about taxing the rich land monopolist. I hope that the Labour Party will say, "Not another sixpence shall you extort from the poor people of this Commonwealth. No taxation upon tea ! No taxation upon the necessaries of life for revenue purposes ! " So far as 1 am concerned, the Tariff has only one use, and that is to assist in creating industries. I do not look upon the Tariff as a revenue-producing machine at all, except with re-  gard to narcotics and spirits. No doubt I have made mistakes, just as other honorable senators have, and very probably during the recent Tariff discussions I have voted for revenue duties. But if so, I so voted in the hope that they would have a protective incidence, and be the means of creating industries within the Commonwealth. I should like the Government, in addition to giving us this forecast of our financial position some years hence, also to tell us how they propose to make up the deficiency which will inevitably arise if the scheme outlined by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne is carried out. There is one other thing which I desire to say before sitting down. I conceive it to be the duty of every Parliament to provide for its own expenditure out of its own revenue. It is not the dutv of any Parliament to provide for the expenditure of some other public body. If it does so, it should only do it as a secondary consideration. I am quite well aware of the fact that whatever arrangement is made between the States and the Commonwealth, the people of the Commonwealth will have to pay. It does not matter very much, when all is said and done, whether they pay through the Commonwealth or through the States Parliaments. It is desirable, no doubt, that the Commonwealth should know exactly how far togo, and that the States' should be placed in the same position. But, when all.'is said and done, the people of the Commonwealth will have to pay the piper. There appears to be a contest between the States of the Commonwealth as to which of them shall shoulder upon the other the responsibility of levying direct taxation. To that end, I think we are rapidly drifting. The sooner we arrive there, the better it will be for the people of Australia. Their continent will then have an opportunity of developing, which has hitherto been denied to it ; the land monopoly will be broken up ; and, with the protectionist policy that is now being launched, and with the new protection, we may expect an industrial era so prosperous and so happy as to be almost without parallel in the history of any other country. </para>

                    <para>. - Answering the last question put by the honorable senator first, I may say that a house-to-house canvass is not being made at the present time. So far as the striking of names off a roll is concerned, the procedure followed is that laid down by the Electoral Act. It will be remembered that when the Electoral Act was last before Parliament for amendment, the system that had previously prevailed iri several of the States of altering rolls by revision courts was abolished and power was given to the officer in charge of a roll to strike off names. It was provided that if, after having given to the person whose name he proposed to strike off, a notice of his intention, which was to be sent through the post, the person notified did not reply within sufficient time, the duty was cast upon the officer of striking his name off the roll. If the elector found that his name had been wrongfully removed from the roll by reason of the fact that he had not received the notice, had not time to object, or some other rea-  son, it was competent for him to apply to a court of summary jurisdiction  to have his name restored to the roll. This procedure was provided in order to do away with the cumbersome method of revision courts previously existing, which required attendance on the part of persons applying to have their names put on the roll, and on the part of officers before the Justices who were called upon to revise the rolls. The. system of which Parliament approved is that which is now being followed, but I shall be glad- to receive information with respect to any specific instances of persons having been wrongfully struck off the roll, or not having received the notification for which the Act provides, and to have inquiries made into them. So far as putting new names on  a roll is concerned, when any elector removes from one district to another the officer of the district from which he removes, if he is cognisant of the district to which he goes, must apprise the officer of that district. Every facility is afforded to enable electors who desire to transfer their names, from one district roll to another to do so. I have been going into the matter with the Chief Electoral Officer, and propose certain matters, which are at present before the Attorney-General, for the. purpose of advising us whether we 'can legally do them. We propose, amongst other things, to simplify the procedure for the elector by having one form, and one only, which will do either for an application for original enrolment or for the transfer of a name from one roll tq another. The form will be printed in such a way that it can be used, at any rate, for a dual purpose. Of course, periodically and annually, we propose to have the rolls properly kept up. </para>

                <para class="block">I have under consideration also a scheme for subdividing each electoral district into groups or subdivisions, and providing more  simple machinery for registration, so that any elector registered ,in any portion of one of the groups will be able to vote within that group without his name being on the particular roll for the particular portion or area in which he actually re-' sides. That is to say, the elector will be able to move anywhere within the same subdivisional area without, losing his right to vote in it. I repeat that I shall be glad to receive information of any specific 'instances in which there is reason for complaint, with a view to ascertaining whether  any departure from the proper procedure has been taken by any responsible officer. </para>

Are we to understand that the rolls on which the last elections were contested are in the several States being revised by various officers, who simply take the old rolls and. strike off any names which they think ought not to be on them if, after sending out notifications to the persons concerned, they receive no reply to those notifications? Are there no other methods adopted? For instance, in the first place, how do the electoral officers obtain their information concerning the removal of aft elector from one street to another? From what source is the information obtained on which the electoral officer sends out a notification of his' intention to strike a name off a roll ? </para>

                        <para>- At all events, it is satisfactory to know that new legislation dealing with the subject is to be introduced. In some instances, electors moving from one place to another put in what may be called original applications for enrolment instead of applications to have their names transferred from one roll to another. The result is that their names remain on the roll for the division which they have left, and appear also on the roll for the division to which they have removed. That may not be a matter of very much consequence, because an elector can only vote once, but honorable senators are aware that it is exceedingly inconvenient, especially in the case of a. Senate election to find 20,000 names on various rolls, which are really duplicates of names on other rolls. I may mention that on the Brisbane roll we found the name of one well-known man appearing no less than three times. That, it appears to ' me, is a very inconvenient state of affairs, and I hope that when the new Bill is introduced, the Minister" will provide some remedy for a condition of affairs which is not only inconvenient for those seeking the suffrages of the electors, but, at the same time, most undesirable. I feel sure that the members of the Government are as anxious as any one else to prevent the name of the same elector appearing three  times on the one roll. I believe that in the case to which I refer, the name of the elector appeared three times on the Brisbane roll, because the elector was put on once for the address of his business place, again for the address of his private residence, which happened to be within the same division and a third time for a third address, due to the fact that he had changed his private residence or his place of business. It is an extraordinary instance, perhaps, and it is likely that we should not have noticed it if the elector had not been a well-known business resident of Brisbane. </para>

                    <para>. - It is no doubt a very grievous thing that an elector should have his name two or three times on the same roll, but it would be far worse if his name were not on any roll at all. Some difficulty may arise from the fact that a man's name is on two rolls, or twice on the same roll, but I know a case where, at the same address, there were two or three persons of the same name. In such a case, should one remove from the district, it is probable that the name of another, which should have been allowed to remain there, would be struck off the roll. A great deal of care should be exercised before the name of any elector is removed from a roll. At the last election, a man called at a polling-place to vote.  His  name was on the roll, and he was permitted to vote. Later on, another elector of the same name, who lived at the same address, came to the poll, and was refused a vote because a person of the same name and address had voted. The numbers of these electors ' had not been sufficiently considered, and it was found that the father had voted, and that a son of the same name was told that he had already voted, because his number was the number opposite to the name that had been marked off. As difficulties of this kind have arisen, and will arise again I direct the attention of the Minister of Home Affairs to the matter, so that in any future amendment of our electoral law, it may receive consideration as well as the case of electors registered on more than one roll. </para>

                <para>SenatorTURLEY (Queensland)  [9.25].  - I think that I spoke to the Minister of Home Affairs the other day about this matter. I pointed out that when in Brisbane for a couple of days at the beginning of the month, it was brought under my notice that a number of notices were being sent out at the time to persons whose names the electoral registrars believed should not be on the rolls. I think that the Minister would have no trouble in ascertaining the number of notices which have been sent out during the last two or three months in one or two districts round Brisbane. In two cases objection was taken to names. Although to my knowledge the persons concerned had been living in the same house for eighteen years, yet each received a notice that an objection had been made to the retention of his name on the roll, and consequently they had each to go to the returning officer or registrar to get the matter straightened up. A friend who has been living in the one place for over five years told me that when he received the notice he went to the registrar, and that, as soon as he spoke to that officer, the matter was adjusted. If a large number of notices were sent out to persons who had lived for a considerable time in the one place, and against whose names no objection could be taken, probably they would hardly know what to do with the notices, and would not pay particular attention to them. The other day the Minister asked me if I could obtain a copy of the notice. I have written to Brisbane to see if I could get some notices which have been sent out to persons with whom I am acquainted, and who I know have been living in the same residence for a number of years. If my application is complied with, the Minister will then be in a position to see the sort of notice that has been sent out. At the same time, I think it would be useful to ascertain how many notices have been sent out during the last three months in the Brisbane and Oxley electorates, which are the most thickly populated. </para>

                <para>I must admit that I do not understand the item, but probably the Minister can state how it has arisen. While I am on my feet I wish to draw attention to the fact that the interest is  Â£5,000  on a capital sum of  Â£25,000.  If it is for a period of only one year it seems to me that the interest is, to say the least of it, fairly satisfactory from the lender's point of view. </para>

                        <para>- That is a period of six years. If I understand the position aright, at the time of its transfer the Department had some till money for doing the business of the Money Order Office. The State Government naturally assumed that an honorable and upright Federal Government would take the earliest opportunity of handing it over to them. But finding that the Federal Government were not built in that way, the State Government naturally thought that in the interests of the taxpayers who had found the money it was necessary to ask that it should be repaid. After some delay it was repaid. What I want to find out is what period is covered by this interest of Â£5,018 ? </para>

                    <para>. - The Standing Orders are suspended only when it is imperatively necessary to proceed without the ordinary precaution of allowing honorable senators opportunities to look into a Bill. Does that urgency exist to-night? Is it necessary, at a quarter to 10, to suspend the Standing Orders in order to pass through another Bill for the appropriation of a large sum? If the Minister can assure us that there is ample work for the Senate to do tomorrow, it may be advisable to adopt the motion, but we ought not to get into a habit of too lightly suspending the Standing Orders - a habit likely to grow, perhaps with evil consequences. If the course proposed by the Minister will expedite the business of the session, and is. necessary, I shall not utter a word of protest, but I am unable, on looking at the business-paper, to see the slightest justification for suspending the Standing Orders at' this time of night to take up a fresh Bill. I ask the Senate to agree with me that there is no justification for the course now proposed.. </para>

                    <para>. - I am surprised at the honorable senator taking exception to the motion. This Bill, and the last, have been divided for mere constitutional purposes. They are, to all intents and purposes, one Bill. I referred to them together yesterday, and they have been discussed together. They cover the votes known as the Additional Estimates. This is practically the works and buildings portion of the Additional Appropriation Bill. </para>

                <para>I would point out that, according to the document originally circulated, there appeared, in regard to works and buildings, provision for a sum of Â£411,282. It was subsequently arranged that the proposed vote of Â£250,000 for special defence purposes should be dealt with in a separate Bill. That leaves a sum of Â£161,282 to be provided by the Bill now before the Senate. As I dealt somewhat fully with the figures yesterday, it is not necessary that I should go into the matter further. </para>

The Bill now before the Chamber provides for the. expenditure of Â£161,282. Unfortunately a wrong copy of the Bill has got into honorable senators' hands. If honorable senators are desirous of looking further into the matter, I have no objection to the adjournment of the debate until to-morrow. In the meantime honorable senators will, I think, find the item quite satisfactory. </para>

                        <para>- I see items in the schedule for the payment of the salaries of clerks and caretakers. In the ordinary Appropriation Act, Parliament makes provision for such services. While I can quite understand that the Treasurer is sometimes called upon to meet demands before the ordinary Appropriation Bill for the year is dealt with, it appears to me that if we pass this measure we shall be voting the same amount of money twice over. I take as an illustration, the payment made to a caretaker of Â£126, as mentioned on page 17 of the Bill. I assume that the salary of that caretaker figured on the ordinary Estimates for the year? </para>

I am at a loss to understand how, therefore, this can be called an appropriation for the ordinary services of the year. If we provided money for these services in ordinary Appropriation Acts, there is no necessity to provide for them again by means of this Bill. If, on the other hand, these are extraordinary claims which the Treasurer has had to meet, they are outside the ordinary services. </para>

                <para>I hope that there is no confusion, in the minds of honorable senators in regard to these Appropriation Bills. There is  no  reason why there should be. Yesterday, I was very careful to intimate that a portion of the total amount to be voted represented ordinary services, and that another portion represented additions, works, and buildings. I pointed out that there were two of these Bills. One Bill appropriates the Treasurer's advance for ordinary services for the year ending  30th  June,  1906,  and the year ending  30th  June,1907. Now I am dealing with the complement of that Bill. It is a measure providing for additional works and buildings. The Bill with which we last dealt, and the second  reading of which will be considered tomorrow, represented the ordinary services for the years  1906-7.  The present Bill is for additions, new works, and buildings for the same years. I point out, once more, that the money has already been spent, and that both Bills are really formal, and specify the items in connexion with which the Treasurer's advance has been expended. </para>
