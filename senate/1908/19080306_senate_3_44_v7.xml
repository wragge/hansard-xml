I propose, one clay next week - I cannot say exactly when - to lay the information on the table in the form of a return. I hope that that will meet with the wishes of the honorable senator. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the fans used for the ventilation of mines, which are now subject to very heavy duties, will be placed on the free list, because they are not made in Australia, and I have not heard it alleged that they can be made here. The death-rate amongst the men working  in  our deep mines is so appalling that all possessing any spark of humanity must wish to do everything possible to prevent it. The effect of working  in  badly-ventilated mines is to produce phthisis or miners&#39; complaint, a lung disease clue to the accumulation of impure air and foreign substances. Although the question of mine ventilation comes within the jurisdiction of the State Parliament, still we can help by allowing the free admission of machinery for the purpose. If we placed an embargo upon the mines obtaining such machinery, which as honorable senators know, is not made  in  this country, we could be justly charged with doing something to hinder the achievement of a very desirable object. So far as the statistics show, the death-rate in the deep mines of Victoria is the highest in the world. I have not yet come across any return approaching the appallingly high death-rate from phthisis in the deep mines in this State, and the appalling increase which is continually going on calls for urgent action. In  1906  - the latest year for which any statistics are available - the death-rate was  29  per  1,000  miners employed per annum. </para>

                        <para>-I know that the death-rate is very high. I thought that, perhaps, the death-rate from causes other than phthisis was included. But be that as it may, we know that there is an appalling and increasing death-rate from this cause in our deep mines. There is only one way in which it can be reduced, and that is by better ventilation. It cannot be lessened or prevented unless we give miners fresher air than they have been getting. If anything approaching that state of affairs prevailed in any other part of the world, public men and newspapers would continually make reference to the fact. This evil has not cropped up here suddenly. It has existed during the last seven years, since I have resided in Melbourne, and perhaps it had existed for a very long time previously. During my residence here, nothing has been done to effect a remedy. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so, but it could not then be said that -we had increased the cost of the imported articles, and so deterred the mine-owners from taking advantage of them. There is no escaping from the position that if we were foolish enough to place a high duty on the articles, it would make them more costly to the mine-owners who wished to utilize them in order to reduce an evil, which, I am sure, every one must deplore. But to say that it cannot be remedied is, in my opinion as a practical miner, to utter a lot of nonsense. I dare say that on no question agitating the public mind in Melbourne during the last seven years, has so much nonsense been uttered. Public men who are, to a certain extent, responsible for the working of the Mines Department, have declared that because twenty years ago an English Commission reported unfavorably against a certain apparatus, known as Root&#39;s blower, nothing could be done. .The fans I am referring to are in use in the coal mining districts of Illawarra, Newcastle, and other places in New South Wales. Victoria is there furnished with an example that by the use of mechanical means, the problem of ventilating, a mine can be solved in a very satisfactory way. It is simply owing to the want of legislation compelling mine-owners to provide fans, that they have not been utilized in the deep mines of Victoria. In New South Wales the law compels the owner of a coal mine to supply 100 cubic feet of air per minute to each miner. If that quantity of air cannot be measured in any part of the mine where miners are working, he is subject to prosecution. If Victoria had a similar law in force here it would very quickly get over the difficulty. An amending Act recently passed in Victoria provides for the supply of 75 cubic feet of air per minute to each miner. </para>

                        <para>- I am making these remarks, sir, in order to illustrate the point that unless we enable the mine-owners^ to obtain mechanical means of ventilations at a reasonable price, the Victorian law will be inoperative. We have no right to pass a duty which would prevent such, humane legislation from being applied. I understand that it cannot be put in operation simply because the mine-owners do not. know of any existing appliances which can be utilized for the purpose of ventilating; mines. </para>

                        <para>- I quite agree with my honorable friend that they are in the dark in this matter. It is really astonishing to notice the amount of ignorance that prevails on this simple question, which was solved more than a generation ago in other parts of the world. To my knowledge, the fans I am referring to have been&#39; used for over a generation in deep mines and mines which it was difficult to ventilate. It is pretty hard to understand why the fact should not be known in Victoria. The fans I am referring to are of a nature which brings them under this heading. When a fan was recently imported for * new mine in New South Wales, a duty of&#34; 20 per cent, was imposed. I have here ar communication which will prove my statement. </para>

                        <para>- I speak of the cost of the fan as placed on board the vessel for importation, but honorable senators will &#39; recognise that its erection and? fitting for use in the mine would involve a&#62;. very great additional expense. A large chamber, known as the exhaust chamber, into which the vitiated air from the mine; is drawn, must be erected, and this is. of course, only part and parcel of the system, of ventilation in connexion with which, these fans are used. They have a very large diameter, and the one to&#39; which <inline font-style="italic">Y</inline> refer, though by no means the largest fan? of the kind in use, has a diameter of 70- feet. I may say that the system of ventilation by fans in the way I have described is the only satisfactory system, adopted. I have heard of attempts to ventilate mines by means of 12-inch tubes run down the shaft, but that, to me, appears to be the height of foolishness- </para>

                    <para class="block">Mines can only be properly ventilated by utilizing the whole volume of air that finds its way down the shaft, and it is only by exhausting the  vitiated air in the mines by the use of fans placed on the surface at a second shaft, and used for this purpose only, that an adequate and satisfactory system of ventilation can be provided. I hope that the Committee, in the interests of the health of the poor fellows who are obliged to work in deep mines, will see their way to agree to a request to remit this duty. Five years ago a pamphlet was issued by the <inline font-style="italic">Bendigo Advertiser,</inline> comprising a series of articles contributed to that newspaper on the subject of the ventilation&#39; of mines, and it would scarcely be possible to find a more graphic account of the horrors of work in deep mines than is given in this pamphlet. We have heard a great deal from time to time of the white slaves of England, and the dreadful effects of  phossy-jaw  on girls who are obliged in the Old Country to work in match factories, but in the pamphlet to which I refer are to be found passages quite as sensational as are any descriptions of the conditions under which people have to work in other parts of the world- I propose to make a quotation from the pamphlet, in order that honorable senators may be seized with the&#39; importance of the subject, and the necessity of doing what is possible in dealing .with this Tariff to assist the poor fellows who :are obliged to get a living in the very deep mines of Victoria. I have said that the articles contained in the pamphlet were written some five years ago, but as nothing has since been done to remedy the conditions described, we cannot be charged with acting hastily, or with interfering with the work which should be done by another Parliament. The articles were written by a journalist who visited a number of mines in order to secure information on this very important subject at first hand. He visited the 3,175-feet level of a mine in the Bendigo district, which I shall not name. 1 may say that mining is carried on at such a depth in very few places, but in the particular mine referred to work is now carried on at a level 1,000 feet lower. If the conditions were so bad as the writer describes at the 3,175-feet level, we can imagine what they must be at a level over 4,000 feet from the surface. The writer says -  </para>
                    <para>My mate and I signalled for the 3,175 feet level*, and an easy descent through a current of &#171;ool air soon brought me below the 180. Thence forward there was a gradual change in the conditions, until at last the air became stifling. A slackening of the speed of the cage, and a shadowy vision of blackened, sodden, shaft timber, betokened our approach to the plat at which we were to emerge. The mouth of the plat appeared, and simultaneously a glimmer  of  light revealed part of the naked body of a man splashing in apparently deep water, for only his head and shoulders were visible. &#34; Hallo, there, feeling it warm?&#34; was his greeting, as the cage splashed into water, and we experienced the unpleasant feeling of water creeping up our legs inch by inch as the cage sought the bearers. We splashed out of the cage on to the plat sets and looked around wonderingly on a scene which was dreadful, even for the bowels of the earth. A gloomy chamber, illuminated by candles, with its floor covered by water which reached over our knees, and inhabited bv men clothed only in trousers and boots, who squatted up to their necks in water to cool themselves, as they enjoyed, or rather suffered, a brief respite &#34;from work. The water was warm, but the air above it was hot. Our bodies steamed, perspiration ian down our faces, instead of dripped; it trickled down our bodies, and fell from our wrists and hands to the water. We felt like being steamed to death. It required no effort  for  us to imagine that we were the prisoners of some subterranean people, and were undergoing a steaming process in order that we might be the better able to play a prominent part in some weird orgie. I remember experiencing a feeling of satisfaction at the thought that there would be little left of me after the process if it was of long duration. The noise of a coming truck reached us, and I looked out with interest for the newcomer. On the truck came, raising, like a miniature liner, a swell on the water, while the chest and face of the trucker glistened in the candle-light. It was with a sigh of relief that he gave the truck a final push, and sinking down into the dirty water, which was greasy with the drippings of many candles and smelt as &#34; underground &#34; as it could smell, enjoyed its apparent coolness after his exertions in the drive. We made our way along the drive, and had not left the water more than half-a-dozen feet behind when we felt more forcibly than before the vapour bath into which we had plunged. If we sat or stood still we perspired more than freely, but the slightest movement caused us to be drenched with sweat.- To our legs the water was warm when it. closed round them first, but when we left the water and the atmosphere encircled them they felt hotter still, the atmosphere being much higher in temperature than the water. The drive was suffocating, but we succeeded in making our way to the face, which was slightly more endurable, a compressed air pipe bringing along some air, and an exhaust pipe taking away a little of the vitiated air; not much, for a candle at its mouth did not flicker much. How men work there at all licks creation, but at the same time it is absolutely certain that they can do but little - they cannot do a half-day&#39;s work under such conditions. This level is being driven in order to connect the mine with the 1S0 at 3,17; feet. It will be about 450 feet in length, and there are between 50 feet and 60 feet to be driven yet, and a rise of 25 feet to be put up. God help the men who have the work of putting up the rise unless the ventilation is improved. One of the men stated that  the thermometer once registered 104 degrees in the level,&#39; but .1 think he must be mistaken, for I have never heard of  any  mine being hotter than 40 degrees, which, it must be remembered, is equivalent to a very much higher temperature on the surface. Back to the pint we went, to find the water cool in comparison with our heated bodies. We steamed away for another ten minutes, . and then regained the cage. The knocker line was pulled, the cage slowly drew out of the water. &#34;Good-bye, old chap,&#34; our guide waved his hand to us, the plat disappeared from view, and we were  going  up 3,000 feet for a breath of fresh air and a gleam of sunshine. Past the 2,500-feet level we went, and the air whistled around us again. I buttoned my coat about me, for the air seemed keen to my body, and my legs felt wet and chilled. Another couple of minutes and a light, like the light at dawn, appeared on the frame sets, the noises of the upper world fell on our ears, and then our journey ended. Never had the sky seemed so blue, and never had the air appeared so bracing. Such were the conditions under which we found men working. </para>

                    <para>. - There is not a member of the Committee who is not moved by some of the facts stated by my honorable friend who has just resumed his seat. . There is not one of us who would deny the necessity for the ventilation of mines and the desirableness  of offering every facility in that direction. But what we are considering at present is not the ventilation- of mines <inline font-style="italic">per se,</inline> but whether machinery for the ventilation of mines is made, or can be made, in the Commonwealth. It is possible that in some instances particular fans are imported from abroad. Those fans may be preferred by certain companies. But it is equally certain that we have in our midst iron industries and machinery industries by which fans equal to those to which my honorable friend refers are made. </para>

                        <para>- I do not want to name the individual companies, but my- honorable friend must know of some. Suppose we attempted to mention, one particular class of fan which may be preferred by some mining companies and to provide that it should be free. That would be grossly unfair to other fan makers, and would be a most undesirable feature to introduce in the Tariff. It would also be unfair to our own fan makers. How is it possible for &#39; our people to compete in the manufacture of fans, and how can Australian, conditions of labour be observed if one particular class of fan can be introduced duty free? The whole question of protection is involved in this issue. </para>

                        <para>- That is not the class of fan we are referring to at all. Lara informed that both in Sydney and Melbourne fans for the ventilation of mines of a similar character to those referred to by my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, and equally effective are made. If it were possible to prove that a particular class of fan used for the ventilation of .mines was not, and could not, be made in Australia, my honorable friend would have made out an irrefutable case, to which we should have to listen in the interests of humanity. Of course, it is for  honorable senators to say whether under the circumstances stated t&#39;hey prefer that our own industries should suffer, and that these fans for mine ventilation should be introduced duty free in the interests of the community. </para>

                    <para>- - Whether or not the whole question of protection is involved in this matter, as stated by die Vice-President of the Executive Council, there is certainly an infinitely greater question involved, and that is the preservation of human life. We who have had some experience in this matter have rubbed shoulders with very many ventilating fans used for the ventilating of mines in Australia. It is a strange thing that within the wide range of that experience we have not come across any of those Australian made mine ventilating fans to which <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator Best</inline> has referred. I admit at once that fans are made in Australia. I have seen them myself - fans made with a bit of wood and a lining of galvanized iron, and worked with a little wheel for small boys to  twirl round. But that is not the kind of fan that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has been talking about. It is not the kind of fan that is going to bring about civilized conditions in the mines throughout Australia. I feel so keenly about this matter that if there was but one fan. that would be prevented from being imported, and if it were an advantageous, useful, and effective fan for the ventilation of mines, 1 say that it would be an act of cruelty to place any obstacle in the way of its importation. </para>

                        <para>- I  am not talking now about tanks, bur about something to which I am afraid my honorable friend is an entire stranger. Miners in Victoria, at all events, unless they have seen them at work in other States, are strangers to them. For many years we have been endeavouring in Australia, by means of humane legislation, to improve the conditions under which miners labour ; but, unfortunately, Victoria in this respect is still, so to speak, groping in the darkness of the middle ages, and it would be absolutely wrong for us to place any barrier in the way of the introduction of the most effective fans for the ventilation of mines. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has asked us to particularize, to name the best fan that is introduced. I presume that he has in mind the Waddell fan, which is made abroad, and was regarded for many years as the most useful of all. Recently, however, there have been invented fans of equal value, for which there is just as large a demand among the mining companies of Australia. Why should we say that the imposition of a protective duty is more important than is the preservation of human life? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has placed before the Committee abundant information as to the deplorable results of working in ill-ventilated mines. He has told us of the long death-roll, the ruined lives, and the desolate homes, due to defective ventilation in mines. The friendly societies of Bendigo for years have been playing the part of charitable institutions to&#39; the mine-owners in that part of this State. The mine-owners, by reason of their failure to provide a proper system of ventilation, have been sapping the miners of their vitality- robbing them of their health. The statistics of the work of friendly societies in Bendigo disclose a state of affairs the like of which is not to be found in any other part of the Commonwealth. </para>

I have worked in mines, have had a good deal to do with the mining industry, and, as one who has suffered from what is known amongst miners as the &#34;dust complaint,&#34; can speak feelingly on this subject. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has referred to the construction of fans in Australia. I may tell him that, there has been invented, at Charters Towers, a water-spray, for laying the dust in mines. </para>

                        <para>- I am prepared to pay great respect to the honorable senator&#39;s opinion on a question of law, but I certainly do not accept his views on such a question as this, of which, I think he knows nothing. I saw the model of the appliance to which I have referred, and know that it has been patented in the Commonwealth. Experts who inspected the working model predicted that it would be a success, but whether we can or cannot invent in Australia effective ventilating, fans, I contend that we should not shut out the best that the inventive genius of the world can give us. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has put forward a contention that is simply ridiculous. Surely we should not place a heavy impost on appliances designed to save human life? Many mining companies have quite enough difficulties to contend with without being called upon to pay a high duty on fans. If the Minister knew anything about the work of a miner, he would not &#39; take &#39; up the position that he does. I have had something to do with a mine 2,500 feet deep, and know that there is always great difficulty in securing perfect ventilation at a depth of even 1,000 feet. I listened with interest to the pamphlet read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, and have no hesitation in saying that too much stress could not be laid on the point which the writer sought to make. The presence of a little water or sludge in a mine is nothing, provided that a supply of fresh air is available. But one of the most unhealthy jobs that a miner could have is that of working in &#39; a rise. Compressed air has to be carried to the face to work the drill, and there is generally a jet for ventilating purposes ; but until the miner &#34; breaks through,&#34; and thus obtains ventilation, he finds the air very bad. On the ground &#34;that it will be fbr the good of humanity, we ought to adopt the course proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson&#39;s</inline> picture of the miners&#39; lot . in Bendigo is not one whit overdrawn. We know that &#39;even in the best ventilated mines the health of a large percentage of miners is broken down by reason of the presence of foul air and dust. Consequently the man who can invent a fan which will avert this danger to health must be regarded as a public benefactor. For that reason I intend to support the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. I hope that within, the&#39; Commonwealth a fan will be invented!; which will be superior to that produced by the inventive genius of any other part of&#34; the world. But until we can produce such a fan, from a humanitarian stand-point I do not think that we ought to block the introduction of a superior . article from any other country. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that the Australian inventor will be able 10 produce a fan superior to that produced in any other part of the world. But I do not wish to adopt a selfish attitude by affirming that if any other country can produce a better fan than we can, we ought not <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> admit it without the payment of a heavy duty. I implore honorable senators to allow these articles to be admitted free. IF we can secure the installation in our mines of a fan which will save the lives of a few hundred miners each year, we shall have conferred a great boon upon the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> asked in what part of the Common-  wealth fans of a similar character to those used in the Bendigo mines are being manufactured, the&#34; Vice-President of the Executive Council was unable to answer. Surely we ought to recognise that if our mine-owners could secure an equally good fan of local -manufacture they would not be prepared to expend&#39; hundreds of pounds additional upon the purchase of imported fans. The miners recognise, as well as do the masters, the practical results which flow from the installation of the best machinery in our mines. Neither <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie nor <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> has exaggerated the conditions under which our miners work. It is our bounden duty to see that those conditions are such as are most conducive to health. The evolution which is taking place in connexion with science and machinery means that conditions which exist to-day will be altered to-morrow. If machinery, the use of which is more conducive to health, should be patented in any other country, I say that instead of placing a handicap upon the introduction of that machinery we should do all that we can to enable it to be imported as expeditiously and economically as possible. </para>

                        <para>- There was no Tariff impediment at one time in Victoria, and there has been a duty of only 12&#189; per cent, for the last seven years. But under the compulsion of law, mine-owners were using the fans in other places, while in Victoria they were not. That shows that the duty, whether it was 12&#189; per cent, or 100 per cent., had nothing to do with the conditions regarding which honorable senators have been appealing to the Committee for sympathy. If fans were free, or even if a premium was offered for their use, the Bendigo mines would not have been ventilated at all, and will not be until the law compels the mine-owners to do it. </para>

                        <para>- I will take the honorable senator to Martin&#39;s next week, or the week after, and show him. I cannot bring a ventilating fan into the Chamber. The honorable senator is worse than Thomas. Unless the wings of the fan hit him in the face, he would not believe its existence. He has endeavoured to create a great deal of sympathy for the miner. I do not know whether he has been successful,  but I know that the side from which the cheers came is not the side from which he usually receives encouragement. I know that fans are being manufactured in Australia, and that the genius of the Australian inventor is as great as that of the people of any other country. If they are protected sufficiently, they will invent as good fans as can be produced anywhere. That is as much in the interests of suffering humanity as anything that has been mentioned in this debate up to the present. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers,</inline> as well as other honorable senators on the other side, continually talk about certain patents, and argue that we cannot manufacture different things on account of those patents. Are they aware that if anything is patented in Australia, if the patentees do not, after the lapse of two years, manufacture it in Australia, any one can apply for a licence to manufacture it, and, if that licence is granted, can manufacture it on his own account? That is true under our patent laws, and also under the patent laws of most other parts of the world. In fact, some countries will not allow their own inventions to be manufactured anywhere else and imported. Our patent law is not so stringent, but the interests of our own people are amply protected. </para>

There is nothing in the construction of a fan, or in the material used in it, or in its application, that we cannot effectively manage in Australia. Knowing that we have as good workmen and as good machinery as any other country has, and that the genius of our people is equal to all the emergencies of our country, and being all through an Australian, and not an advocate of any other part of the world, I hope the request will not be carried. </para>

                        <para>- It is urged that these articles should be admitted free only for use in mines for the health of the miners, but the health of other people might well be considered. I should vote for the request with far more pleasure if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie would add to it the words &#34; and in the Houses of Parliament.&#34; I think that the health of members of Parliament is quite as valuable as the health of miners. For years we have been struggling to secure good ventilation within these walls, and we have not yet achieved our object. The suggestion conveyed in these few remarks I commend to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline></para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has made a statement which I cannot allow to go unchallenged. The honorable senator has told us that these ventilating fans are made in Australia ; and he has gone so far as to particularize the establishment of Messrs. Martin, in South Australia, as the place. That these fans are made in Australia is news to me, because I find no reference whatever to them, either in the evidence or in the reports of the Tariff Commission. </para>

                        <para>- That sort of extravagant statement will not assist <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor.</inline> It has been suggested that we are seeking the introduction of some particular kind of fan, but, as a matter of fact, I have purposely refrained from mentioning any names, and have endeavoured to speak generally of appliances suitable for mine ventilation. We have been told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> that it is not the duty, but the absence of industrial laws, which has prevented the ventilation of Victorian mines. That cause, however, no longer operates, because towards the end of last session of the Victorian Parliament an Act was passed making it compulsory to supply a certain amount of air in mines. If we now, in the case of an article which has hitherto been free, impose a duty of 20 or 25 per cent., we shall decidedly be assisting in defeating the object of that Act. These fans are not imported for private profit, but wholly in the interests of the miners, whose health in this connexion has been too long neglected. </para>

Does any honorable senator imagine for one moment that if these fans were made free, the lot of the miner - which has been pictured very graphically by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, on the authority of a local newspaper - will be one whit improved ? The mine-owner is no different from the ordinary employer who is to be met with every day in every part of the Commonwealth; the average employer, whether he be mine-owner or manufacturer, desires to reap as much profit as possible from the labour of those whom he employs. </para>

I am satisfied, however, that not a day would be added to the life of any miner if these fans were admitted free. The result, on the other hand, of the free admission of these fans would be to throw out of employment a number of men whose lives would be shortened thereby. </para>

Our workmen and inventors are, on the whole, as good as those of most other places. Evidence, given on oath before the Tariff Commission, shows that some of the best machinery in the Broken Hill Proprietary Company&#39;s mine is covered by patents taken out by Australians. </para>

                        <para>- Does the honorable senator suggest that, because Australian fans are in use at Broken Hill, the death rate there is higher than where imported fans are used? I intend to give effect to the principles for the advocacy of which I was returned. I maintain, without fear of contradiction, that these fans can be made in Australia, that they are being made here, and that if sufficient protection is given, many of the imported fans now in use will in time be superseded by fans made by Australian workmen, under conditions better &#39; than those obtaining abroad. </para>

                    <para>.- This matter may be viewed from two aspects, the fiscal and the humanitarian. In regard to the former, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has not a leg to stand on, because I am advised that these fans can be made by the Austral Otis Company, by the Mort&#39;s Dock Company, and by a third company, whose name I have forgotten; while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> says that they are also made by Martin, of Gawler. The making of fans for driving air is a simple engineering matter. The fans made in Victoria are equal to any made elsewhere. But some honorable senators are proving themselves efficient advocates of the interests of wealthy English mine-owners and manufacturers. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator said that the death rate from miners&#39; complaint in Victoria is twenty-nine in 1,000, a statement so alarming that I at once rang up the Statist&#39;s office and asked for information on the subject. The Department prepared a statement for <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Summons,</inline> who last year made an elaborate report on the subject, at the instance of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> proprietary, according to which, in Victoria, the death rate from phthisis is only 10.78 in 10,000. It seems to me that this is a case in which we might very well agree to the duty, with the provision that it should not operate until both Houses of Parliament had declared themselves satisfied that suitable fans are being made here. </para>

The mining men  there are as good as any in the world, and thousands of pounds have been spent in driving levels and making connexions from other mines to allow cool air to pass through the workings.

                        <para>- For some time past an attempt has been made to get the Victorian Minister of Mines to instal a blower. He has sent experts there, and they have reported to him that these blowers would not be effective in that district. Whether effective or not, I am sorry that he does not see his way clear to try them. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> that if we yield on an item of this kind, we shall give away the whole policy of protection. We need not take off the duty. We can meet the whole position by putting in a proviso for the issue of a proclamation, so that those implements which are required can come in free for the next few years, and, in fact, for ever, unless some person steps into the breach and is prepared to make blowers as good and effective as any imported. The whole position can be met by that method, and without frittering away the policy of protection, as must be done if the request be carried. </para>

                    <para>. - I intend to vote against the request, and as on that account I may be accused of indifference to the well-being of a large number of miners, I wish to state very shortly my reasons for taking up the position I do. We have set out a national policy for Australia, that is, a policy by means of which we intend to establish a large number of industries. The reasons for adopting that policy are so obvious that I need not go into them, and, so far as I have been able to discover, no argument has yet been adduced sufficiently strong to induce me to make an exception even in connexion with the mining industry. No one sympathizes more deeply than I do with the men who work in deep mines, indeed, in any mine, and who suffer in their health on that account. But I do not think the remedy for that sort of thing lies in free-trade in machinery. I think that it lies in compelling the owners of mines to ventilate them or to close them, just as a man is compelled to keep his factory, workshop, or shop clean and properly ventilated, or to suffer the penalty. It may be advanced - and has been advanced, I believe - that the mining companies are not financially strong enough to take that step. That may be the case in some, probably in a great many, instances. But I know that in numerous cases the additional expenditure which would be incurred by putting in locally-manufactured machinery would be so little as not to be felt by the companies concerned. We know that mining is probably the most speculative of all industries, that very much more capital is embarked in the industry than ever finds its way into the mines. That is the point where a tax on mining comes in. It is a continual gambling with the shares, watering of the capital, and so on. It is not the money that is expended in actual development of the mines themselves. I believe that if this Parliament does something to discourage that sort of gambling, it will have done at least one good thing. The reason why a large number of persons are willing to put their money into mining ventures is because the business is so speculative. If it were put on a more substantial footing, I believe that the returns from the industry would be very much larger, a much greater amount of capital would be available for investment therein, while the condition of both the shareholders and the miners would be very much improved. That is how I look at the matter from that particular point of view. Whether fans can be manufactured in Australia is a question which I think has been answered in the affirmative. Some time ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> told me that in the township of Charters Towers persons were manufacturing fans with which mines nearly 3,000 feet deep were ventilated. If that can be done on the Towers, where the appliances, I presume, are of the most primitive character, surely it can be done in other portions of Australia, and as I am assured not only that it can be done, but that it is being done, I intend to vote against the request. </para>

                    <para>. - The debate on this item has proved very instructive to me. On. earlier items we have always been assured that the effect of a duty is to lower the price of an article, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, who has moved this request, has been persistent in voting for the imposition of duties. If the effect of imposing duties be to lower prices, how can he now object to the imposition of a duty on fans which he desires to cheapen in the interests of the working of mines? </para>

                        <para>- That brings me to another point. There have been several articles in exactly the same position as these fans. That some manufacturer may claim that he is able to make them I am&#39; prepared to admit. I am also prepared to accept the statement of the honorable senator that as a matter of practical business they are not being made here. But that applies to thousands of other articles, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has always been assuring us that they never will be made here unless we give the local manufacturers, some encouragement. I believe in making the acquisition of fans as reasonable and easy as possible to those who want them. But I also believe that with regard to hundreds of other articles which are included in the &#34;n.e.i.&#34; item - the next one to be dealt with. . We are asked to pick out one thing, as the honorable senator and his associates did yesterday, used by a particular section of the community, and to place that on a different level from commodities used by other persons.Ideclineto do that. I am prepared to go with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie to secure a reduction of these duties generally. But I decline to help him to take one item out of the &#34;n.e.i.&#34; line, and so leave him in a position to vote against a reduction of the duty on an item containing the multiplicity of articles covered by those mysterious initials. </para>

                        <para>- Who is to judge whether it is a similar article or not? The honorable senator! &#39;It &#39;is quite evident from his having selected this article that, in his judgment, it is the only one which ought to be made free. I cannot make a difference between a mechanical appliance used in one form of industry and a mechanical appliance used elsewhere. I am, therefore, going to vote against the request the effect of which will be to leave the article still under the &#34;n.e.i.&#34; item. And in connexion with that I ask the honorable senator if he is not prepared to proceed with the request to join with me in trying to get the duty on the whole of the articles reduced. </para>

That is the only safe road I see before me.&#39; Not being able to determine exactly to what extent the multiplicity of things covered by the letters &#34; n.e.i.&#34; can or cannot be made here all I can do is to endeavour to reduce the duty equally, and with some regard for fair treatment to every one whose industry requires the assistance and the facilities afforded by these particular mechanical appliances. But I decline, altogether to single out special matters - for that is what it means - for favoured treatment. If there be anything in this protectionist policy at all let honorable senators distribute their legislative favours equally all round. </para>

                        <para>- The idea in the honorable senator&#39;s mind when he made the interjection shows that he is viewing the matter entirely from a State point of  view. That may sway him, but I decline to allow it to sway me. Just as on the oil duties I refused to consider my State, so on this item I shall act with equal impartiality. Whatever measure of relief is to be conveyed to a particular section of the mining industry should be neither more nor less than that conveyed by the items covered by the letters &#34;n.e.i.&#34; to other sections of the community. </para>

                    <para>. - I am quite in accord with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie as to the desirability of admitting these fans free of duty, but I cannot help saying that I think the honorable senator is making a great mistake in attempting to separate them from the general item  162B,  &#34; Machines and Machinery n.e.i.&#34; First of all, because the value of these fans imported must represent but an infinitesimal portion of the total value of the imports under the item; and, secondly, because, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie must admit, the use of these fans in mining depends very largely on the progress of the mining industry. It is quite conceivable that if, by reason of the duties we impose under this Tariff, we interfered with the progress of the mining industry, the necessity for these fans would disappear, since all over Australia at the present time the progress of the industry has become a question of the profits to be obtained from the working of low-grade ores.. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator should know quite as well as I do that mining at great depths in Australia depends very largely upon the freedom of the industry from any sort of handicap by means of a Tariff or otherwise, which would add to the cost of working. We shall not, in Australia, continue mining at great depths, or, generally speaking, continue the development of low-grade propositions, unless, on the one hand, we are able to free the mining industry from every possible handicap and unnecessary charge, or, on the other; we reduce the wages of the men employed in the industry. I have no need to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie which of these alternatives he would prefer. The honorable senator must be aware that in Western Australia this question is rapidly reaching a climax, and that either the total mining cost must be reduced by every fair means, or the men employed in the industry must accept lower wages. In view of this fact, I am astonished at the honorable senator&#39;s attitude. </para>

                        <para>- I should -be glad if the honorable senator could give the Committee some particulars of the machinery on which the balance of the revenue was collected. The Tariff&#39; Commission discussed this matter exhaustively. I admit that the Government might easily deceive a member of the Tariff Commission or any member of the Committee by their classification of these items, and they might, as they have already done in connexion with these n.e.i. provisions, mislead honorable senators into voting for duties on some items on which they would never agree to impose duties if they knew what the items covered. </para>

                    LEDGER (Queensland) &#163;2.15&#93;. - I must confess that I have no extensive practical acquaintance with mining machinery. But I have listened carefully to the debate, and have read a great deal upon the subject. I hope

                    Largie will pardon me for saying that I hardly understand his position. Possibly, that is my misfortune rather than his fault. But I cannot forget what occurred yesterday. It strikes me that the Government are amusing themselves by playing off one senator against another, whilst their thoroughgoing protectionist supporters sit down smiling, and &#34; await the result. A school-boy could very soon fathom the game that is going on at present.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline>
                    Largie wishes to get out of the Tariff bag a particular article of mining machinery, and to allow it to be imported duty free. On a previous occasion, some of us on this side of the chamber helped him with regard to another article affecting&#39; Western Australia.

In the matter before the Committee, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie wishes certain mining machinery to be admitted duty free. The Government are going to resist his proposal. I remind the Western Australian representatives that when they were asking for the free importation of other mining machinery, they did not assist us in making free machinery which is equally necessary for the development of agricultural and other industries in other States. </para>

                        <para>- I am not opposing it. But I am skilful enough to know that some birdlime is being spread about,  and that the Government wish to know exactly who are going to be caught. I again express my regret that the Western Australian senators did not help us when we wished to secure the benefit of free machinery to other industries than the mining industry. I should like to know distinctly from the Government whether they are going to allow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie to go as far as he likes and not to allow any one else to go a step farther than the proposals in the Tariff. As I said at the commencement of my speech, I do not profess to have expert knowledge regarding mining, but I do know what is going on. I am sorry that the Government are not strong enough to enforce their own position. The game that is being played is as plain as a pikestaff. They should clearly define their position. I wish to know also from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie whether if we help him to get in this machinery free he is going to help us to get in more machinery free. If he will, we shall possibly help him ; but I do not think that at present I am inclined to help him. I do not feel disposed to assist in repeating the game that was played yesterday. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> chief complaint against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie was that he took the particular article under discussion out of the drag-net item in which&#39; it is placed in the Tariff, and sought to make it free. He intimated his willingness to oppose him in doing so. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> spoke while the memory of his own action on a previous item was fresh in our minds. On item 160 <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> singled out a special sawing apparatus and asked to make it free. The good sense of the Committee recognised the need for doing so, and accordingly his view was adopted. On similar grounds, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has moved that mining fans be made free. On the general question of ventilating machinery I am sure that honorable senators will recognise the need for making means of ventilation according to scientific methods as easy of adoption as possible. At Parliament House at the present time splendid means are being taken to improve the ventilation of the building. The Government, with unlimited funds at their disposal, have secured scientific advice and are coping with the problem of the ventilation of this and the other chamber. What must be the position of mine-owners who have to overcome much greater difficulties than are encountered with respect to the ventilation of this building. There are greater difficulties in the way of the ventilation of some mines, and we should not add to them by shutting out improved machines manufactured in old-world centres. . In Germany, where at present mines are being sunk to a depth of between 3,000 and 4,000 feet, sanitation and ventilation are carried out on scientific lines. I question whether any other country pays greater attention to the protection of the health of miners. Having regard to our comparatively small population, there is no warrant for erecting here the plant necessary for the manufacture of these machines. That being so, it is unwise to bar their introduction from abroad. </para>

                        <para>- The difficulty is to obtain a sufficiently economical system of ventilation. We have seen the evolution of the bicycle; in the first place, we had the old wooden velocipede without pneumatic tyres; but improvement followed improvement, until to-day we have a perfect machine. That is an illustration of what is possible in respect of the ventilation of mines. Humanitarian considerations should induce us to deal specially with these machines. Medicines, surgical appliances, and other things for the alleviation of pain and suffering have been placed on the free list, and I fail to see why we should not. go a step further by refusing to shut out machines whose use in mines would reduce the percentage of death and suffering amongst our working miners. I am surprised that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> who succeeded in inducing the Committee to request that saws be specially dealt with, should oppose this request. </para>

The value of an effective system of ventilation is shown by what has been done in the West Berry Consols No. 1 shaft. A small ventilating appliance installed in the mine has been the means of reducing, from 45s. to 1 8s. 9d., the cost of breaking ore in the face.

                        <para>- I think so. It has been repeatedly stated that the cost of these fans is the sole reason for the failure to introduce, them in our deep mines. I understand that in Victoria mines have been successfully ventilated to a depth of something like 1,600 yards - or nearly a mile - at a cost of &#163;2,000. Of that expenditure the outlay on the fans amounted to about ^400. Assuming that a duty of 25 per cent, is imposed, the additional cost of installing such a system will be only ^100. Will any honorable senator assert that a mine-owner who is prepared from humanitarian or business considerations to expend ^2,000 upon the introduction of an effective system of ventilation in his mine would withhold its installation if the cost were increased by &#163;100? We have absolute proof that an effective system of ventilation reduces the cost of working a rhine, since it enables the men below to do more work. </para>

                        B. Squire, mining manager of the West Berry Consols Co., . . . may be allowed to tell his own story : - Until September, i8g4, it did not occur to any one in this district or the State to increase the carrying capacity of rile pipes to keep pace with the ever- increasing magnitude of the great alluvial mines. The Madame Berry West Co. had bv this time started to open the great deep gaseous lead known as the Australasian. There was great difficulty and? loss of time through the presence of gas. The Madame Berry, Berry Consols, and other companies could stand this loss of time because of the great richness of their mines, but I recognise that in the case of the Madame Berry West, with the lower average value of its wash, it would be fatal. I made several small experiments by increasing the size of the brandh ventilation pipes to the faces and rises from 6 to
                        <inline font-style="italic">S</inline>
                        inches, and&#39; always found an improvement. What a vast improvement would be made then by increasing the size of the main artery from the blowers. After Carefully weighing the matter, I decided that 16-in. pipes were the most suitable size for the main drive ; would give twice the capacity of one ii-inch and one-third less friction than two n-inch, thus actually equalling three n-inch. Then I fixed a second blower. The result was a complete abolition of all difficulties resulting from the bad air.

It has been said that- the question of cost is at the bottom of the failure to instal proper ventilation in the mines of Australia. The real reason, so far as Victoria is concerned, is that the Minister of Mines will not avail himself of the administrative powers that he possesses in this regard. In&#39; support of this contention, I quote the following paragraph from a special article which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of 18th ultimo. </para>

At the same time <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLeod</inline> - the Victorian Minister of Mines -  has stubbornly set his face against a fair trial of a ventilation system that has given perfect satisfaction wherever it has been installed.

                        <para>-Colonel GOULD (New South Wales)  &#91;2.45&#93;.  - The whole debate appears to have centred round the desirability of permitting the introduction of these machines into our mines at the lowest possible cost and to the detriment of other industries. Perhaps it is not quite correct for me to say &#34;to the detriment of other industries,&#34; but certainly the proposal under consideration constitutes an attempt to place the mining industry in a more favoured position than that occupied by any other industry. The first difficulty in connexion with it which occurs to my mind is, &#34; How are we going to differentiate between fans intended for use in the ventilation of mines and fans intended to be used for other purposes?&#34; I take it that a fan which can be used for ventilating a mine can also be used for ventilating a. factory, and whilst it is eminently desirable that we should insure a good supply of fresh air to miners working underground, it is equally desirable that we should insure a good supply of fresh air to the employes of factories. Seeing that we can confer this advantage upon every person working in a factory as well as upon the underground employes in mines, it would be very unjust if we confined it to mines. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has urged that in endeavouring to&#39; obtain an advantage for the mining industry he is merely following the example of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> who attempted to secure the free admission of saws used in the sawmilling industry. As a matter of fact, the cases are by no means parallel. The particular saw which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> desired to have admitted free is used only by one trade, but in the present instance the fans which are employed for ventilating mines are not confined to the mining industry, but may be used in other industries. If they could be used only in the mining industry the cases would be parallel, and no doubt a majority of the Committee would then be prepared to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie&#39;s request. But my objection is that we are asked to confer this advantage upon one industry only. Of course, everybody recognises that the mining industry as a primary industry is worthy of every possible consideration. But that consideration ought not to be extended to it at the expense of other industries. We violate every principle of justice when we attempt to deprive one section of the community of benefits that we are willing to bestow upon other sections. How, I ask, are we to differentiate between the uses to which these fans are to be put? We all know that they are employed for the purpose of providing for forced draughts on steamers and to insure a supply of fresh air to men working in the stoke-holds. We also know that these men labour under far more unfavorable conditions than do the miners of Australia. I understand that notice has been given of a proposal to admit machinery n.e.i., under paragraph  b,  free. I am assured that if ventilating fans are placed upon the free list the rest of the machinery covered by that paragraph may go hang so far as the efforts of a number of honorable senators to relieve it of the present impost of  25  per cent: are concerned. If that be so the advocates of the proposal under consideration are affording those who may be anxious to assist them very substantial grounds for refusing to do so. I ask honorable senators whether it is not desirable, not only in the interests of the mine owners but also of the men, to admit machinery used in connexion with mines free? If we cannot do that, would it not be wise to bring about a reduction of the duty proposed to, say,  121/2  per cent. ? We must not regard this matter merely from the stand-point of the wealthy mining companies, who can show good balance-sheets and pay fat dividends. The majority of the mines of the Commonwealth are low-grade propositions in connexion with which the saving of every penny is a matter of importance. </para>

                        <para>.- It would be a very good thing indeed if mining in Collins-street - which means speculation in the buying and selling of shares - could be abolished. But the present proposal does not touch that evil, even in the most remote way. Every country in the world has innumerable low-grade propositions, which can be profitably worked only by the exercise of the most rigid economy. Many of these are being carried on for the benefit of the men employed upon them, whom the proprietors keep going in the hope that brighter days will dawn, and that they will be able to make money for themselves. . But when we are dealing with matters of this kind, we must recollect that there are other industries in the country besides that of mining, whose interests must be considered. </para>

I urge the author of this proposal and his friends to take a broader view of the question, and not to limit the free admission of ventilating fans to any particular industry. Let us say that fans of a certain diameter shall either be admitted free, or at a lower rate of duty. Then&#39; if no industry other than that of mining requires to use these fans, no harm will result, whilst if they do need them we shall have conferred some good upon them. By agreeing to the re quest in its present form we shall be penalizing other industries. </para>

                    <para>. - If I thought that the adoption of this proposal would have the effect of improving the health of miners underground, I might feel disposed, from a humanitarian stand-point,&#39; to support the admission of ventilating fans free. But if this machinery were admitted free, there would be no obligation on the part of employers to use it, and I do not think that mine-owners would use any particular appliance simply to benefit their employes. In other words, if they could obtain cheaper machinery, the use of which would enable them to comply with the law, they would decline to purchase expensive ventilating fans. It has been said that if we admit these fans free we shall enable a large number of low-grade propositions in the Commonwealth to be developed. I have heard it suggested that a proposal is to be submitted in favour of admitting hat-making machinery free upon the ground that by so doing we shall enable our Australian manufacturers to successfully compete with the foreigner. To my mind, it would be exceedingly dangerous to make any exception of that kind. I am thoroughly convinced that our Australian manufacturers can produce practically any article that may be required by our people. It has been pointed out that ventilating appliances are already being made in Australia. If they are not large enough, we have men here with sufficient enterprise to make larger ones. I read only a few week&#39;s ago of some company - I am not sure whether it was a mining or a dock <inline font-style="italic">company</inline> - which required a very large auger for boring for pile-driving, and could not get the size they wanted in any part of the world. An Australian manufacturer made the machine, and it answered satisfactorily. I am convinced that Australian manufacturers are equal to any emergency. I shall vote, with a certain amount of reluctance, against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie&#39;s request. </para>

                        <para>- I am quite prepared to consider every article in this dragnet paragraph on its merits. It is because I do not know what articles do come under it that I wish to have them itemized, so that we may be able to examine the claims of each. If the members of the Opposition are anxious to extend the use of the ventilating fan, which I desire to free from duty, I am prepared to see it applied to workshops and any other industries where it may be useful. I hope the time is not far distant when the stoke-holds and engine-rooms of deep-sea ships will be better ventilated. I am prepared to have this fan applied to them also. I merely wished to restrict it to mining, because I did n6t know  of any other industry which had the same claims. But, whilst I am prepared to have these fans applied to work-shops, stoke-holds of vessels, or used for any other similar purposes, there are at present being made in little electrical shops - not factories, because, unfortunately, we have none yet in Australia - little fans similar to those now in use in this chamber. If we free all fans from duty, a lot of that sort of work will come in which I and other protectionists do not want to see brought in. But mining ventilation fans are not made in Australia. I cannot understand the attitude of the Government towards my request. A system of ventilation is about to be installed in this chamber. It would be much easier to ventilate this room than a chamber 4,000 feet down in the bowels of the earth, like the Bendigo deep mines. Yet this protectionist Government are not patronizing the fan-makers who, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> are working in South Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> also said that fans are made in Australia, although he was not able to mention any individual maker, while other honorable senators have referred in a shadowy way to fan-makers living in some part or&#39; other of the Commonwealth. But how is it that this protectionist Government are not patronizing those Australian manufacturers? I have looked at the machinery in the basement of the building, and find that the fan to be used is an imported Sirocco fan, made by Davidson and Company, of Belfast. Where are our protectionist friends now? Why is not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> looking after the interests of the Australian fan-makers? How comes <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> to be supporting a Government who import fans ? Here  is a Sirocco fan - a small- one, I admit - being imported for the ventilation of the chamber. Fans on the same principle, but of double the diameter, are necessary . for coal or gold mines. Yet I am told by the same protectionist Government that they will not allow those fans to be brought in free. Surely honorable senators must see the hollowness of the whole claim. How will the great protectionists - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith, Senator. Findley, Senator McGregor,</inline> and all the &#39; rest of them - face a charge that they refused to allow the miners of Bendigo to get a fan in to ventilate their mines? </para>

                        <para>- The only excuse I can hold out for him is that he does not know any better. This morning I referred to some figures which had been published in one of the daily papers. I thought I made it clear that I was not quite sure of their accuracy, as I did not&#39; have them with me. Since then I have turned up the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> - I thought at first that I saw them in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> - and I find that the figures I gave were very far wide of the mark. Still those given in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> article are so appalling that any one who reads them, and also the other articles which have appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> in the last week or two upon the subject, can come to no other conclusion than that machinery of this kind is most urgently required: The writer singles out the Bendigo mines. I propose to read for the edification of those who oppose my request a short extract from an article which appeared on 3rd March last, in order that they may understand the position a little better than they do at present. </para>

                    <para>In 1906 it was 129 per 10,000, showing that it has almost trebled in the last quarter of a century. And science has left us in no uncertainty as to . the cause. The increase is directly and solely attributable to the poisonous atmospheric conditions obtaining at the working faces of the deep mines. The men toil half naked in a temperature that frequently exceeds 90 degrees. The dust from the drills enters their lungs and sets up a state of inflammation which renders these vital organs helpless to contend for long against the omnipresent tubercle bacillus. . . . The weaker miners are dying off like flies. </para>

Under the circumstances, I suggest that the consideration of the paragraph should be postponed. Before we vote on a duty, which is so comprehensive that it brings in a revenue of &#163;80,000, we should know what is included, and I suggest that before next Tuesday the Vice-President of the Executive Council should obtain &#39;information from the Customs to enable honorable senators to know, in regard to this and other similar items, the exact articles involved. The Vice-President of the Executive Council tells&#39; us every now and then that the paragraph does, or does not, include some particular item mentioned by an honorable senator ; but we should have further information in regard to an agglomeration of things, the duties on which, in : some cases, represent a desire for protection, and, in other cases, a desire merely for revenue. </para>

                        <para>- We are by no means discussing a line of this kind for the first time. If I am asked what the paragraph includes, 1 am able to give some idea: but it would be absolutely impossible for any set of officers to set out all the articles; the list would extend from here to Tasmania. I desire honorable senators to understand the scheme of the Tariff. First of ail, in item 160, we deal with motive-power machinery and all appliances except electric appliances, electric appliances being classified separately. Then, in item 176, we go on to deal with mining machinery, the leading agricultural items being kept distinct. We have now arrived at item 162, and I can give honorable senators some idea as to what is included in paragraph b, showing that it is almost completely a protective item. In this paragraph, speaking only of classes, there are included refrigerating machinery and conveying machinery, both of which are made in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I am not picking out any particular machinery, but merely giving the classes. &#39; The paragraph includes elevating machinery, lifting machinery - both of which are made here - and also hoisting hydraulic machinery, grinding machinery. saw-milling. machinery, flour-milling machinery, and machinery for the treatment of bones, soap-making, wood-working, and so forth. Honorable senators are also aware that we have taken the precaution to circulate a proposed by-law, which contains a lengthy list of exempted articles. If honorable senators look at items 160A,162A, 163, and 164, they will see how we recognise the things that are made in Australia and the things that are not made here ; and having regard to the whole scheme of the Tariff, I submit that there could not be, and never was, fuller information afforded to a Legislature. </para>

                        <para>- I am of opinion that if the rate be doubled the revenue will be doubled, unless, of course, the imposition weighs so heavily on the mining industry as to check the use of this machinery: That, undoubtedly, will happen in regard to low-grade propositions. But, assuming the progress of our mining and other primary industries to be as great next year as it has been during the last&#39; few years, the revenue collected under a 25 per cent. duty will be twice as great as that collected under a 12&#189; per cent. &#39;duty. Although the Government wishes for this heavy impost on mining machinery, it has agreed to allow linotypes, monotypes, and other expensive machinery for the printing of newspapers to come in free. In one case, of course, a country industry is affected, and in the other a town industry, and we know that there is no limit to &#39;the imagination of the Minister when an opportunity occurs for imposing heavy taxation on a country industry. In my opinion, this item should be made free, and I shall move in that direction if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will be good enough to withdraw his request. </para>

                        <para>- I think not. When paragraph  b  is disposed of, I take it that the whole item will be finally dealt with. If an honorable senator wishes to move the addition of a new paragraph dealing with some article already in the item, he should do so before the item has been disposed of. When we have dealt with the duty under the general Tariff, and the preferential duty only remains to be considered, it will be too late to move the addition of a new paragraph, unless that new paragraph refers to some article now included in a subsequent item. If it deals with an article already in this item, it cannot be moved at that stage. </para>

                    <para>- I want to say that the game of poker has been played on this item quite long enough. Honorable senators are piling up duties now on mining machinery. The game has been played openly and palpably, and the Government have see-sawed between honorable senators holding different views as to what these duties ought to be. I wish to accentuate the fact that a low-down game of political poker has been going on. </para>

                    <para>. - I find that I cannot vote for a higher duty than  20  per cent. on this item. I recognise that the country has spoken in the direction of higher protection generally, but the Committee has already agreed to a duty of  20  per cent. on the machinery employed in another primary industry the agricultural industry, and if that is a fair duty as applied to the agricultural industry it is also a fair duty as applied to the mining industry. </para>

                        <para>. - There is a matter of some importance which I should like to bring under the notice of the Minister of Home Affairs. Unfortunately, the people in the chief centres of Western Australia are at present suffering from a rather severe depression, with the consequence that a large number of men are out of work. Of course, the  depression is only temporary. Were these men in Melbourne it would be possible for them to form a deputation to the Minister and put their requests before him. They have not that opportunity. I, therefore, ask the Minister if he  will  be good enough to cause inquiries to be made as to whether  it is  possible to push on with all the available work for which money has been voted by Parliament to be spent in the chief centres of Western Australia. I refer chiefly to painting arid building work, which will give employment during this temporary period of depression. That it can be no more than temporary honorable senators will recognise, because the vast possibilities of Western Australia guarantee that it cannot last long. </para>

I shall make inquiries in the direction indicated by the honorable senator. If it is possible to put in hand expeditiously any work which has been authorized by Parliament, and so to relieve the distress of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> speaks, I shall be glad to do so. I may also say that if the authorization of any needed works in Western Australia can be expedited,I shall take steps to secure that sanction as soon as possible. </para>
