                    (New South Wales &#91;3.9&#93;. - I desire to congratulate the honorable gentlemen who have assumed office, and I trust that they may meet with the success which their merits and their principles entitle them&#39; to. There are one or two questions which I desire- to put to Ministers, and to which they may or may not reply as they see fit. To-day, the
                    <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline>
                    announces that it is the intention of Ministers to press forward the consideration of the Navigation Bill as far as possible this session. I should like to know whether that is a fact. If the journal in question has been authorized to publish the statement, I presume that Ministers will have no hesitation in giving the desired information to the Senate. A few&#34; days ago, the
                    <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline>
                    also announced that Ministers intended to at once appoint Judge Murray as Lieutenant-Governor of Papua, and
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Staniforth</inline>
                    Smith as Administrator of that Territory. If the statement has been authorized, I think that the Government might say so to-day. I also desire to direct the attention of the Vice-President of the Executive Council to the statement which he made in this_ Chamber about ten days ago regarding the industrial dispute which exists at Broken Hill. Upon that occasion, he declared - I think with some show of anger - that the New South Wales Government had despatched a quantity of arms and ammunition to Broken Hill. The accuracy of his statement has since been denied in the New South Wales Parliament, and I presume that he is acquainted with that fact. I think, therefore, that he might well explain to the Senate how the information which he gave it - I am quite sure in perfect good faith - came into his possession.

I can only say that I hope the same generous feeling will be extended to them which was extended to the late Government. No doubt the policy which they will announce to this Chamber when we re-assemble will be such as will commend itself to us, and as will meet with the approval of the country.

With <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> I sincerely hope that the Ministry will be treated with all the courtesy and consideration - especially the consideration - which they deserve. In reply to both honorable senators, I merely wish to say that I have no authority to make a policy speech on this occasion, and I have already announced that the brief space of time which has been at our disposal has rendered it impossible for us to familiarize ourselves with the work of the different Departments. But in respect of the statements which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> alleges have been made in a local newspaper, I can assure honorable senators that when the Government have determined the course of action which they intend to pursue during the present session, their announcement will be made in Parliament, and not in the press or elsewhere. That announcement will be made as soon as Parliament reassembles on the 25th inst. I hope then to be in a position to make a statement which, if not satisfying to honorable senators, will certainly enlighten them as to the course of action which we intend to follow. The only other matter to which I need reply is the request which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> - with his usual desire for knowledge - has preferred regarding the statement which I made in this Chamber that arms and ammunition had been forwarded to Broken Hill. I made that statement in good faith, and acting upon reliable information. I am aware that the statement has been subjected to a kind of contradiction - a contradiction that does not affect its accuracy in the slightest degree - because arms and ammunition have been sent to Broken Hill. I am quite sure that if the question be fairly put to the Commissioner of Police of New South Wales, he will not deny the truth of my statement. But, of course, if it be put in a certain way he can reply that &#34; certain accoutrements have been despatched for a certain purpose.&#34; That, however, is a mere evasion of the question. Arms and ammunition were forwarded. As to my authority for the statement which I made- </para>
