                            (New' South Wales) [11.15]. - I should like to refer honorable senators to what took place when the Tariff of 1902 was under consideration by the Senate. At that time, I believe both solar and residual oils were being produced in the Commonwealth. These oils are used, not only for lubricating, but also for heating purposes. At that time, the proposal was that the duty should be £d. per gallon.
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline>
                            who had made a considerable study of the whole subject, then stated that a duty of Jd. per gallon upon solar oil was equal to about 30 per cent., whilst upon residual oil, which is better known as liquid fuel, the duty was equal to 50 per cent. So that it would appear that even a duty of Jd. is an immense amount as compared with, the intrinsic value of the article. But the question arises as to whether there is any reason why these goods should practically be excluded from the Commonwealth by charging a duty of 3d., which would be 180 per cent, upon the value of one article, and 300 per cent, upon the value of the other, if the statements- of

                    <para>I am a manufacturer of horseshoe nails, resident in Brunswick, Victoria, Australia. Some years ago I invented a machine for the manufacture of nails, but never saw my way clear to use it until I had been to America, and had seen the application of liquid fuel to similar purposes, as it is possible to get a- greater, more continuous, 'and cleaner heat <inline font-style="italic">{i.e.,</inline> that is free from smoke and cinder) from oil than from coke or coal when applied to many lines of manufacture. I have recently obtained two machines from America made on my principle, fitted with furnaces for burning  liquid  fuel, it being my desire to use the most modern methods in the manufacture, of nails, in order to turn them out at the lowest possible .price, to compete with those imported from Europe. If a  heavy duty, such  as the present one, is put on liquid fuel, it will, bv increasing the cost of the oil, deprive me of all the advantages I expected to obtain from this, the most modern method of  heating  iron, in order to decrease the cost of  production,  so as to better meet foreign competition. </para>

                <para class="block">If that statement be correct- and it has never been challenged - it is evident that the Committee will be making a very serious mistake if they impose a duty of 3d. per gallon on these oils. I hope that honorable senators will realize that liquid fuel is playing, and will play, more and more an important part in reducing the cost of manufactures. The cost of fuel isa very serious one in  connexion with new manufactures which are being, introduced, and will continue to be introduced from time to time. The proposed duty will be but of little value: for revenue purposes, and if it tends to exclude liquid fuel, it will certainly be: of no service to the people of the Commonwealth. It may be that, as the result of it, one or two local companies will secure a market for solar and residual oil, but the probabilities are undoubtedly against an increased duty being of any value to the community. I am prepared to vote for the old duty, although it may be that even that impost is undesirable; and I would urge honorable senators to do all in their power to reduce the cost of production in Australia.- </para>

Solar and residual oils are used mainly as fuels. In the far north, the farmers are taking more and more to the use of machinery, but what they need is cheap motive power. In order to make a success of farming in the semi-arid districts, our settlers require to have their cultivation paddocks turned over as early as. possible. They may have plenty of grass in the dry season, but, owing to lack of- water, they are unable to use . horsepower for this purpose. They require some motive power such as that supplied by liquid fuel to get their ground broken up in time to be benefited by the first rains. As it is, those dependent upon horse-power have to wait until the first rainfall before they commence operation, and sometimes no further rain falls in time to mature their crops. </para>

Had the honorable senator made inquiries regarding the supply of fuel oils in Australia he would know that the two companies which were supposed to be in a position to meet our requirements in that respect have failed utterly to do so. I know of a manufacturer who incurred considerable expense in visiting the United States of America for the purpose of inquiring into the use of liquid fuels, and who after purchasing the very best oil sprays had to allow his furnaces in Melbourne and Sydney to remain idle because neither of the companies in question was prepared to supply him with the oil he required.- We have before us an opportunity to develop an Australian industry. It has been shown that the Commonwealth Oil Corporation is a substantial company. Surely the shareholders who have subscribed a capital of ,£950,000 have not rushed blindfolded into the venture. No one can deny that we have in Australia deposits of shale from .which this oil can be obtained. On Friday, I received from the representatives of the Standard Oil Company a circular condemning the local shale oil as an illuminant. I at once told the representatives of . the Commonwealth Oil Corporation thai: if they could not disprove the statements contained in that circular, I should vote against any duty to protect them.

                        <para>- The honorable senator said that he would not blindly support a proposal of this kind, and I am endeavouring to show that he is not asked to do so. I have proof that the companies upon which our manufacturers have relied for a supply of fuel oils have absolutely failed to meet the demand. My own opinion is that, for the purpose of keeping up prices, they limited the Australian supply. I believe that, if the request be agreed to', we shall be absolutely assured of sufficient fuel to enable us to carry on not only our manufacturing, but also our agricultural pursuits. I know just as well as does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> that, in connexion with the running of their machinery, our agriculturists are going in largely for the consumption of fuel oil, and I am anxious that they should . be able to procure that article at a cheap rate, and that they shall be assured of a regular supply,- which they cannot obtain under existing conditions. For. these reasons I shall support the imposition of a high duty. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> has stated that he will not support the proposed duty upon the ground that he is extremely anxious that our primary producers shall be able to obtain fuel oil as cheaply as possible, and that he is not disposed to register a vote blindly in favour of a local product. When a representative Australian makes a statement of that kind he makes a very damaging admission, because, if there is one thing in which he should interest himself it is in matters Australian.  His  declaration that he will not vote blindly in favour of a local product evidences either that he has not made inquiries into the possibilities of this Australian industry, or that he has made them with a biased mind. </para>

                        <para>- I am very sorry that the honorable senator is not acquainted with the events which have occurred during the past few months. When the Tariff was introduced into another place, the Standard Oil Company at once raised the price of kerosene by 3d. per gallon, notwithstanding that it had not paid a single penny in duty upon its product. Recently, as the result of an agitation which was got up against the company, an announcement appeared in the newspapers to the effect that it intends to refund to the traders the£20,000 which had been charged them in this connexion. That announcement is merely so much fudge. Why should the traders obtain this refund, seeing that it was paid, not by them, but by the consumers ? The traders are not entitled to it, and of course it is impossible to hand it back, to the consumers. This, however, is by the way. I fail to see that any true protectionist can vote in opposition to the proposed duty, which will afford encouragement to an Australian industry and insure the employment of Australian workmen. May I remind the Committee that it will also assure a cheaper supply of fuel oil to those who may require it in the prosecution of manufacturing or agricultural pursuits. </para>

                        <para>- I have seen oil for fuel produced about nine years ago in Tasmania., in little phials of about an ounce weight, demonstrating that its production was practicable, but whether it can be made an economic success remains to be shown. I admit that it is desirable that we should encourage the production of this material. The Australian Parliament has adopted different means for encouraging different kinds of production, directly by means of bounties, and indirectly by protective duties. The' whole question now is which method it is advisable to adopt in this instance. I strongly favour encouraging the industry by the bounty system. We have voted a sum of £33,000 payable over several years, in order directly to encourage the production1 of oil-bearing materials. Having committed ourselves to that definite policy, why not apply it in this case? The encouragement of the production of oil-bearing materials amounts to the same thing as encouraging the production of oil itself. There is no reason why we should not grant a bounty for that purpose. If, on the other hand, we impose <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> duty, we shall be hampering other industries. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell is seriously con&lt;cer'ned as to whether the farming industry will be immediately affected by the imposition of a duty that will have to be paid by the consumers, inasmuch as the Australian production is not nearly equal to the consumption. As I said last night, we are in various instances pulling down with one hand what we build up with the other. We try to encourage the increase of production, and to provide work, for our own people, and at once we proceed to the other end of the machine and start to pull down, by placing heavier restrictions on. and creating greater difficulties for, our manufacturing and agricultural industries. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that. But the question which ought now to be discussed, without heat, amongst the protectionist members of this Chamber, whose views differ generally only on matters of detail, is which of the two ways is the better to accomplish what we desire. By offering a bounty for the production of oil, we shall much less seriously disturb existing industries, and at the same time give to the people who invest their money in the undertaking a direct and positive assurance that they will receive a tangible encouragement from the. State. Lubricating oils, fuel oils, and other oils used for industrial purposes stand upon a totally different plane from other articles with which. we have dealt, because they are so closely related to other industries which we have tried to encourage by protective duties. </para>

                            (Tasmania) [11.45]. - I have not intervened very often in the discussion of this schedule. I wish to point out that the raising of the duty in this case from Jd. tb 3d. , as proposed, is a very serious matter, not only because of the extremely high protection which it will represent, but because of its effect upon men who are now using oil for fuel in many of the primary industries of the Commonwealth. The small farmers in particular are now entering upon new conditions of agricultural development. We are unquestionably on the eve of a great expansion of the cultivation of smaller holdings. If we make it impossible or unlikely for men to obtain a fair margin of profit from their work, the industries which we are now building up by means of protection will fall to the ground, and we shall have a worse condition of affairs than would obtain under extreme free-trade. It is on this ground alone that I ask the Committee to pause. No one will accuse me of being a free-trader. I am- a protectionist pure and simple, but not a prohibitionist. I want the people of this country to be given opportunities to exercise their talents in every direction, both on the land and in manufacture. The Committee last night pledged itself to the principle that until the company which is at the bottom of the present agitation can fulfil the promises which it makes, it is not to get the benefit of the increased duties. As
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline>
                            Largie proposed, the increase of duty is not to operate until both Houses, by resolution, determine that the time has arrived to give the company the benefit of it. The sense of the Committee on that point was perfectly clear, yet now we are asked, practically, to cut away the ground from under the feet of those who are striving to establish primary industries, and to develop vast manufacturing enterprises. I, therefore, ask the Committee to consider seriously and earnestly that this is not the time to, allow the undigested statements and proposals of this particular company to guide us  in deciding a great question.

                        <para>- That is a very pertinent question, but I am now dealing with the statement that the action of this company is indecent. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron's</inline> desire is always to be courteous and kindly, rather than unfair or cruel; and I do not think that his statement is one which, on reflection, he would make. This company have done nothing that any decent man might not do. We are now dealing with an industrial question, and affirming that it is desirable, where practicable, to encourage Australian industries by means 'of Customs duties. The representatives of this company are here to present such information as they have, in order that Parliament may know what step in the way of duties it is desirable to take. Obviously, there is nothing indecent in that. </para>

                        <para>- I sometimes interject when honorable senators are speaking, and I invariably receive a petulant reply. May I be permitted to proceed? I rather like pertinent interjections, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> is repeating the - same question over and over again. I am now dealing with the important question put by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell. How can the Standard Oil Company affect the Commonwealth Oil Corporation? It is true that there is another rather powerful company, but practically the Standard Oil Company controls the world's supply of illuminant oil in the shape of kerosene. </para>

                        <para>- So far as I have been able I have read what has been written, both in favour of and against the Standard Oil Company, and I feel certain that I know as much about its operations as does the honorable senator. The American Beef Trust dictates to the agriculturist to a penny what he shall get for his products, and it dictates to the retailer what he shall charge the consumer. That same influence controls in Australia every lubricant or illuminant that the Australian agriculturist uses, and experience teaches us that it raises, without any question, and without any outside necessity, the price of  illuminants.  We have seen the price of kerosene raised by £d., id., and so on, per gallon, while the cost of production, instead of being increased, has been reduced. While the combine method, which, <inline font-style="italic">per se,</inline> if there were no baneful influences, is the best method, as it eliminates the hundred and one expenses which competitive concerns must mean - while the Combine has been reducing the cost of production, .and all managerial expenses, it has been increasing the cost of the article it sells to the world. Unless we can create in Australia some shield against the aggressiveness of this enormous power, we shall continually be at its mercy. In self defence, even though, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> implies, the company which has been described as "indecent" does not absolutely require for its preservation and maintenance this duty, it will be a wise and judicious thing to erect a barrier against the exploitation of a .company that has been described in its own country as an institution which makes a reference to the Law Courts in connexion therewith, a by-word amongst the American people. To mention .law in connexion with that company; said one officer, is to make the initiated laugh. </para>

If there is in our minds a doubt as to whether the protection we have given is adequate, it will be a wise precaution on our part to proceed at once tq make it adequate. If we are to err at all in connexion with the principle which we have affirmed, we had better err on the side of carrying that principle to a fuller rather than to a lesser issue. Suppose that for argument's sake, we admit that there is not ample evidence that this protection is a necessity, which, of course, I do not admit. </para>

                        <para>- I have shown, I think very clearly, that we want an impregnable barrier against the awful power to which I have been referring. If there is a doubt- as to whether we have a sufficient barrier, then as wise men who believe that a certain principle is right, we had. better err on the side of' the fuller application of that principle. It is wise, therefore, for us to take the fullest possible precautions. I  have not the remotest doubt as to the protectionist character of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell's mind, and I am confident that if  he were convinced that this -is a protectionist proposal  likely to achieve industrial results, and to lead to the- employment of more people in Australia, the honorable senator would be prepared, as a protectionist, to take any risk that the price to the consumer would be raised. I' am satisfied that every protectionist is prepared to take that risk, because all past experience teaches that when a protectionist duty becomes effective, as we hope this will, the result is not an increase in the cost of the protected product, but very frequently, and almost invariably, a reduction in the cost, accompanied by a continuous and easily accessible source of supply. If we do not develop this industry, which is obviously natural to Australia, and easily within our power to develop, and some day we come to be at war with America - a very undesirable contingency, and one that I think almost impossible; and I hope quite impossible - or even at war with some other country which might lead to the cutting off of our communication by sea, or render it uncertain, what would be the price of these articles then? We should then, in the midst of difficulties, have to establish their local production, whereas we can now, by a  judicious  application of the protectionist principle, create in Australia in the near future, and almost at once, an absolutely certain, continuous, and easily accessible  supply  of articles that are necessary for almost every- industry in the country. </para>

He appears to think that no solar or residual oils, or equivalents for them, are produced in the Commonwealth.. I have  here two credentials received bv the New South Wales Shale and Oil Company from manufacturers in Victoria as to the merits of an equivalent for a residual oil. The first is from the Northcote Brick Co. Ltd., and is addressed to W. C. Ashton, Esq., New South Wales Oil Shale Co. It is as follows : - </para>

                        <para>- The company's shale waste oil is a residual oil, in fact and in substance. It is certainly the .exact equivalent of a residual oil. It may suit <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson's</inline> purpose to deny that it is a residual oil, but the very term indicates that a residual oil is the residue of some other substance, and the credentials, which I have quoted, refer to shale waste oils. They sufficiently prove that we have at all events the beginnings of an oil-producing industry in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> asks a very pertinent question when he wishes to know what wrong the Standard Oil Company has done in Australia. In the first place, they raised the price of kerosene in New South Wales when they found that it was impossible for the local company to compete with them. </para>

                        <para>- It is not necessary that I should draw a distinction between the legality and the justice of the practice, even for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline> The company make no apology for the practice, but rather justify it, and we know that the object is to' tie every small distributor of oil in the Commonwealth to the. distribution of the product supplied by the Stan- . dard Oil Company. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> is prepared to contend that that is not an injustice, I can only say that the honorable senator's sense of justice must have been very much blunted. He has asked what the Standard Oil Company has done wrong in Australia, and I have told him what they are doing to-day in Melbourne and elsewhere, and what the consumers of oil are suffering from. By tying up the small distributors of oil under a system of deferred rebates, they hope to destroy their independence, with ' the ultimate object of securing the market for themselves. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell, in common with every other member of the Committee, wishes to do all he can to advance the interests of the people of the Commonwealth. The honorable senator has expressed a wish to know what the local company has done, and appeared to be in some doubt as to the progress which the Commonwealth Oil Corporation has made, in New South Wales. Let me tell the honorable senator that it controls a very active form of industrial enterprise in that State. The company has at present a capital of £860,000, and lately a call made for a  further addition to the capital of £150,000 was over subscribed. The best indication of the thoroughness and enterprise of this company is to be found in its expenditure on plant and buildings, on railways, and experimental works. I find in the last balance-sheet that no less than £94,000 has been spent on railways and rolling-stock alone, £38,000 on plant, machinery, buildings, and fittings, and £35,000 on development, prospecting,- and surveying. These figures should be sufficient to convince <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell or  any one else of the genuineness of this particular company, and of the fact that they mean business in New South Wales. With respect to the present supply of these oils in Australia, I do not think that very much weight need be attached to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl's</inline> fear that the primary industries of the country will be very much handicapped if we are unable to obtain a cheap oil for motive power. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> appeared to hold a somewhat similar view, but both these honorable senators must be aware that wherever agriculture is pursued with intelligence and skill in Australia at the present time, firewood can be obtained for the purposes of fuel. </para>

                        <para>- I could sympathize with the honorable senator's view if the method of supplying Australia's requirements were normal; but 76 per cent, of our importations of residual and solar oils come from the United States of America, our total importation in 1906 being valued at  /r^.182,  of which £2,423 came from the United States, and I assume that the Standard Oil Company supplied most of it. </para>

Without the proposed protection, there will be a lack of competition, and the prices of American oil will not be kept within reasonable bounds. </para>

                <para class="block">The effect of the amendment will be to make it easier for the Customs officials to distinguish bet wen residual and lubricating oils. At the present time, residual oils which have been slightly refined, are occasionally imported as residual oils, but used for lubricating. I understand that the true residual oil is the thick residuum which remains after the light oils and spirits have been extracted, and is properly classed as a fuel oil. That is the information which I have received from the .Customs officials. I do not know anything about the matter myself. The definition of fuel oil which has been given to me, is crude residual oil. The paragraph deals with residual oil, treating it as fuel, and it is necessary that it should be made as clear and definite as possible. </para>

                        <para>- Then the proposal, is to make dutiable at 6d. what is now dutiable at Jd. Even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> must consider that an excessive increase, and I hope that honorable senators will have little hesitation about negativing the request. If, to simplify administration, a definition is required, the matter should be thought out and the proper wording submitted ; but the facts show that, either <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> does not understand the information placed before him, or the Customs Department has not seen the effect of the suggestion which it has placed in his hands. There seems a danger of this Chamber appearing in the public eye as the battle-ground .of - rival oil companies, which honorable senators will agree is not desirable. I have not met the representatives of any oil company or syndicate, and do not wish to do so. The question is, not whether we should further the interests of one company against another, but whether the rate of duty already provided is sufficient to enable the local company to continue its operations. No attempt has been made to prove that the duty is insufficient, though <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> and others have said that a higher duty is desirable in the interests of the Commonwealth Oil Corporation. Of course, the corporation "wishes to get as high a duty as possible. But there is an obligation upon us to regard the requirements of the Commonwealth, and I shall submit evidence to show that the present duty is ample to enable the corporation to make this particular kind of oil. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> adroitly avoided the real point at issue by referring to what the Standard Oil Trust has done elsewhere, and said that, even though the duty may be sufficient for the purposes of the Commonwealth Oil Corporation, it is advisable to increase it to prevent the Standard Oil Company from doing in Australia what it has done abroad:. My answer is that the Standard Oil Company has done what it has done in America because of the excessive protection given to it there, and we are being invited to place the Commonwealth Oil Corporation in the same position in regard to Australia as the Standard Oil Company holds in regard to America. I am prepared to give the local company the protection necessary to enable it to carry on its undertakings. We ought not to be asked to do more. If a duty of £d. is shown to be insufficient, I shall vote for Jd., or whatever may be necessary; but I should not be asked to increase the duty merely because of possible foreign importations in the future. I have every desire to assist the Commonwealth Oil Corporation in its grand enterprize; but it has itself to blame if its position is not rightly understood. I see that a prospectus  was  published by the Commonwealth Oil Corporation, when they recently asked  for a further subscription of- £150,000. This document states that the company was incorporated on 8th  December, 1905. Clearly it was in existence long before the Tariff Commission ceased to take evidence. But suppose that the company missed its opportunity of going before the Tariff Commission, what was to prevent its managers from approaching Parliament, and putting their case for an increased duty before us? But so far as I am aware they have done nothing of the kind. They have waited until the last moment, and then have attempted, by lobbying .individual members, to secure their object. The proper course was to address Parliament collectively, with a full statement of their case - not merely with a request for higher ' duties, "but with a statement of the facts such as would have enabled Parliament itself to arrive at its own judgment on the matter. But the corporation have done nothing of the kind. Owing to the method bv which they are moving individual senators to propose increases in. particular items, it is utterly impossible for any of us to know what the true position of the Corporation is, and what measure of protection is necessary, having regard to their operations as a whole. I do not know whether residual oil forms a large proportion of their business. I know nothing  about the cost of working, and nothing about the proportion .which the proposed duty bears to the labour involved in the production of the oil. Surely Parliament should have been afforded an opportunity to look into all these matters. Instead of that we find that an effort is made to increase the duty on each individual item. Now I want to say two things. One is that the present duty, as shown by the company itself, is ample <inline font-style="italic">*o</inline> enable it to carry on its business properly, and next, that any duty which we impose,  at  least for  some years to come, and until the Corporation is in a position to supply oil to the extent of our requirements, must necessarily be a serious handicap upon every one who is likely to require oil as fuel. I shall apply my remarks on that ' point by reference to the increasing tendency on the part of farmers - which is' rapidly becoming a necessity - to employ motor power for their agricultural work. The first thing we should do in ascertaining whether the present duty is sufficient, is to see whether the company is a profitable undertaking. In 1907, the balance-sheet issued on the 30th June, stated that the directors desired to point out that the shale works were already yielding substantial profits, and other large sources of income were approaching realization. I should like to explain that although the New South Wales shale undertaking is carried on as a separate trading concern, the controlling force, that is to say the directorate, is the same. It is, however, as I have said, carried on as a 'separate concern, and its accounts' are kept separately. We have the assurance of the directors that the undertaking is showing substantial profits. It is no meagre concern. There is no evidence here of a struggling industry. The fact that it is showing substantial profits is proof of that. So that no case has been made out for increased protection on that ground. The evidence which I have quoted comes from no biased source, but is the directors' own statement. At the meeting in December last year, held in London, the shareholders were told that the refinery in New South Wales would not be completed and ready for operations for eighteen months, but at the same meeting, the  chairman  said that the directors hoped some day to have an output of 3,000,000 gallons of kerosene per annum. An honorable senator said last night that the company was already turning out 3,000,000 gallons. </para>

                        <para>- Of any oil. ' It appears to me that there has been some confusion, arising out of that statement of the  chairman  of the Corporation last December, that they hoped one day to turn out 3.000,000 gallons of kerosene, and that that has been assumed to mean that 3,000.000 gallons of some sort of oil were actually being turned out. Just a word more about the operations of the Trust,, which is supposed to control the oil business, and which we are told will crush out any competing company. From a newspaper called <inline font-style="italic">The Petroleum Review,</inline> I find that the Pumpherston Oil Company in Scotland has declared a dividend of 5a  per cent. Well now, where was the Standard Oil Trust there? Here is a company which has to obtain the oil it sells, not by collecting it from wells, but by making it out of shale - admittedly a more expensive process. But this company is enabled, alongside the big  depots  of the Standard Oil Company in England, to carry on business and pay dividends of 50 per cent. Surely this Standard Oil Trust cannot be such an alarming concern as many of my honorable friends seem to fear? There are many other companies which are also doing well, and which are enabled to carry on in an open market like that of Great Britain. Apparently, they are not frightened by the bogy of the Trust. I have before me an extract, from which I propose to quote, in furtherance of my contention that the Commonwealth Oil Corporation is already doing exceedingly well. The paragraph is taken from the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of the 15th January of this year, and it appeared in the commercial column of that journal. Apparently, the commercial editor is here reviewing the report of the meeting held in London, when £150,000 worth of debentures were offered to the public. </para>

                <para>The accounts show that expenditure on development, &amp;c, including the construction of the railway, now amounts to over ^187,000. The railway has cost <inline font-style="italic">£04,300.</inline> The New South Wales Shale and Oil Company, which the Commonwealth Corporation bought up for ^42,000, but retains as a separate trading venture, shows that even with the low  price  of oil at which, by reason of their long contract with the Australian. Gas Light Company, the oil has had to be sold, a large margin of profit can be made without the production of refined oils. </para>
                <para class="block">There is a point to which I direct the attention of honorable senators - the fact that this company is making a large margin of profit upon residual oils, without any reference to refined oils at all. I have already shown, on the admission of the directors, that the New South Wales Shale and Oil Company is making substantial profits. Here is the contention put forward at their meeting of shareholders when they were inviting the investing public of Great Britain to subscribe further capital. But even without that oil they can carry on the industry well. Surely the facts clearly prove that the existence of the Corporation is not at stake, and that whether ' we increase the duty or not the fact will not materially affect their operations. </para>

                        <para>- That was not the reason ; and so far as that goes, I may as well mention that the Commonwealth Corporation itself has expressed its inability to meet orders. I do not put that forward as any reason against the duty, because any company, big or small, might be unable to meet a particular order. If I were to go to some of the hat makers of Melbourne they would decline to sell me a hat, but that would be no reason for removing or decreasing a duty in this Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- If my honorable friend has that information from an authoritative source I will accept it literally, and point out that it shows how groundless' is the dread of the Standard Oil Company. If this corporation is able to turn out 3,000,000 gallons of oil per annum, what becomes of the Standard Oil bogy ? Where does the Standard Oil Trust come in at all? The fact is that the Standard Oil Trust imported less than £3,000 of  these particular oils last year, and we now have the admission put forward that the Commonwealth Corporation last year manufactured 3,000,000 gallons.  It is to be assumed that they sold it. Are we to suppose that they are keeping it in their works? Are they locking it up in reservoirs? No; it has gone into consumption. The fact that they have been able to dispose of 3,000,000 gallons of residual oil is the best possible proof that there is no necessity to make the duty 3d. per gallon. </para>

It is, however, evident that this corporation is making and selling a very considerable quantity of oil under the existing duty. Is there, then, any evidence that a ' higher duty is necessary to enable the Corporation to carry on? And remember that the Corporation have not really got to work yet. It is admitted that they are only in their infancy. </para>

On their own showing they are doing remarkably well on that duty. What is the increased duty wanted for? It is only to enable the Corporation to raise prices, and to do better still. The Corporation themselves are to blame for not putting forward a clear and distinct statement, showing that the old duty was inadequate. They have not declared that they will have to close down operations if the duty be. not increased.. </para>

I am taking the Corporation's own statements, and I have done that because I take them to be genuine.- These statements have been made by business people, and they show that the Corporation is doing fairly well under the existing duty. The only effect of a higher duty, and the only reason for a change, must be to enable the Corporation to charge a higher price for the  commodity which they sell. The effect will be to enable them to levy a toll on every gallon of each of these oils that they sell. </para>

                        <para>- I have already read that they supply a great deal to the. company under contract, and that but for the low price at which they tendered their substantial profits would be still more substantial. Seeing that the company is doing well under the present duty, and that when it is thoroughly established it must do still better, why should a higher duty be imposed, particularly when the only result must be to increase the cost of these oils to the multiplicity of manufacturers and others who use, or will be called upon within the next few years to use, liquid fuel? It is reckless, perhaps, to predict anything, but if I can foresee any development of the near future it is in the substitution of motive power for the horses and bullocks now used in farming operations. If there is one class in the community whose productions we ought to encourage, it is our grain farmers. Do what we will, having reached the export point, wheat farmers have to come face to face with the competition of the lowest paid labour in the world - the cheap labour of India and Egypt, to say nothing of that of Russia. There is only one way in which we can enable them to successfully meet that competition. </para>

To my mind the only way in which we can enable them to meet this competition is by abstaining from doing anything that will make their work more expensive. I firmly believe that within the next few years we shall see the motor on the farm just as often as we see it to-day in the streets of Melbourne - machines worked in the same way. but for different purposes. </para>

                        <para>- I firmly believe that we shall. I have seen one or two small agricultural machines worked by motor, and do not think it will be long before the difficulty of applying motive power to agricultural machinery will be overcome. The difficulties which farmers to-day encounter by reason of a drought are accentuated by their having to pay a high price for fodder for the horses which they use to plough their land in readiness for the next crop. But by the introduction of motive power they will be able to carry on this work during a drought just as economically as they can in the good seasons. That is something to look forward to, and we should do nothing to retard it. The question before us is practically that which we discussed last night - whether the duty is sufficient to give the industry reasonable protection. The Committee decided in respect of one of these paragraphs last night that it was, and no reasons have been advanced why we should give, in respect to this line, more protection than was originally proposed. I should welcome any substantial reason for an increased duty, and would be willing to support it in such circumstances, more particularly as the industry is likely to be of some prominence in the State of which I am a representative. But in the absence of that information, I should show not only a want of common sense, but a reckless disregard of my duty to the electors, if I voted for a request to increase this duty from¼d. per gallon to 3d. per gallon - the largest increase that has yet been suggested. </para>

                    <para>. - For something like two hours this morning this debate has been carried on upon the assumption that solar and residual oils are used as liquid fuel. I am credibly informed, however, that they are not used for that purpose, so that much of the criticism directed against this request is altogether unwarranted. The crude petroleum used as a fuel comes under an entirely different heading. Solar oil is used principally for gas-making purposes, whilst residual oil is used in the brick-making industry to mix with clay in order to impart a certain quality to bricks. It will thus be seen that the paragraph we are now discussing has no bearing on the use of fuel for motors. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that the few remarks' which I made prior to the suspension of the sitting in regard to the uses to which residual and solar oils are put will serve to show honorable senators that in debating this paragraph from the standpoint of liquid fuel we are, to an extent, "barking up the wrong tree." The question of the duty which ought to be levied upon liquid fuel will properly come up for consideration under the next item. To my mind much of the criticism which has been directed against the Standard Oil Company has been altogether beside the mark, because whatever may be the sins of that company - and I dare say they are many - it does not  import residual oils into the Commonwealth. As a matter of fact, these residual oils are brought into Australia by the Borneo Company, which supplies a very superior article. . Whilst I do not for a moment champion the Standard Oil' Company, I wish to see it get a fair deal, though if any favours are to be bestowed, I should prefer to see them go to an Australian rather than to a foreign company. Naturally I desire the Commonwealth Oil Corporation to be successful, but I cannot disguise the fact that the day may come when the party with which I am associated may be compelled to fight it. I regret that such a large industry should be controlled by any company. To my mind it should be nationalized. Seeing that the duty upon liquid fuel - in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell takes so much interest on account of the primary producers - is not raised by this paragraph, I hope that he will extend a fair measure pf protection to the oil industry, which has been established in our midst. I shall not support the higher duty proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline> It is quite unnecessary to increase the impost upon residual oils from Jd. per gallon to 3d. per gallon, but there is a happy medium between the two which I shall be ready to support. </para>

                        <para>- At any rate that is the information which has been supplied to me. The Standard Oil Company does not import residual oils into Australia. ' I do not know whether honorable senators realize the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate represented by a duty of 3d. per gallon upon this class of oil . At the present time, the price of residual oil in Melbourne is only 2 1/2 d. per gallon. </para>

                        <para>- That is one reason why I regard the proposed duty as excessive. In the second place it is not required to support the industry. Why should the whole community be subjected to this impost for the benefit of one particular corporation, which does not need it, and which is doing very well without it? A few years ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> who is regarded as an authority upon these matters, pointed out the enormous duty which it was proposed to levy upon solar and residual oils. It worked out, I think, at 5s. id. upon 250 gallons - the assumption being that there are 250 gallons in a ton of oil. It has been said that the Standard Oil Company is a monopoly. But I find that in the United States and elsewhere there are just as large companies as the Standard Oil Company - companies with an aggregate capital of .£100,000,000. The Asiatic Company itself controls all Burmah and the East Indies, where a very large portion of these residual oils are produced. It has also been stated that a Scotch Petroleum Oil Company was making a profit of 50 per cent. I wish to point out that that profit was not made from the production of oil for illuminating purposes. As a matter of fact, the kerosene which is produced from shale is a dark, smoky, and inferior article. I hold in my hand the abridged prospectus of the Commonwealth Oil Corporation, which was published in London on 4th January last, when, the company sought to increase its capital by the issue of further debentures. The prospectus  states that the corporation acquired the property in October, 1905, and was registered on the 9th October, 1906. A capital of £800,000 was subscribed in England upon the assumption that the industry would be a very profitable one under the old rate of duty. </para>

                    <para>. - I believe that the financial standing of the Commonwealth Oil Corporation is so strong that in London its shares are the most favoured stock offered by any Australian industry. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> incontestably proved last night, this company was formed in December, 1905, whilst the Tariff Commission was prosecuting its inquiry, and its members must have known the duty which was then levied upon oils. The whole of their financial operations must have been based upon that consideration. Under such circumstances, what need is there for the additional guarantee for which we are asked? The shareholders were perfectly assured of their prospects when they subscribed the capital of the corporation, and therefore we ought not for a moment to further consider its position. I am astonished to find the Government, and their socialistic supporters, persisting in the  statement that we must consider this company for the sake of promoting an Australian industry. In this connexion I wish to embrace the present opportunity of accentuating what I regard as a remarkable reversal of socialistic form. The Commonwealth Oil Corporation required no assistance from the Government in the beginning, nor does it need any now. However, it is quite evident that the Ministry intend to climb down upon this paragraph just as they climbed down last night. They will climb down because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie - who, I dare say, expresses socialistic ideals just about as well as does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart-</inline></para>

                <para class="block">I have no very strong convictions on the matter. I have listened attentively to the speakers on both sides of the Chamber, unprejudiced, and desiring only to gain information. I admit that I do not know as much about the subject as I should like. But when I saw honorable senators sitting on the left hand side of the Chair, squirming under the remarks of the speakers on the other side, I came to the conclusion that there was danger in the path. Although I shall not vote for a duty of 3d., I feel, that I can with safety vote for a duty of id. If I had been in any doubt, the squirming on this side - on the part of the conservative element, which is continually denouncing labour - including the sweet familiar voice of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> - would almost have compelled me to vote with honorable senators opposite. But I like a medium course. I believe in moderation. In order to prevent that abominable trust, of which we read and hear so much, from sending its agents here to play the deuce with' the business of Australia, I think we can easily afford to raise the duty to id. Even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> might well come to the- rescue on this occasion by voting with me, because, if we cannot go that length, -we cannot be true protectionists. When I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> moving for- a duty of 6d., I, as a cautious Scotchman, said, "Go a bit slow. Keep on safe lines. Do not trample more  than you can help upon the primary producers." But when, it is a question of raising the duty to id., in order to keep out those rogues from the United States of </para>
                <para>America, we should have no hesitation. The way in which honorable senators, on this side, received some of the statements from the other side, all but convinced me that I should have voted for an even higher duty. I hope that the Committee, in its. wisdom, will agree to my moderate proposal. </para>

On the other hand, if the higher amount were put first, and the Committee rejected it, some other honorable senator would be able to move a request for a duty of 2d. Then, if the Committee regarded that as still too high, the proposal for a duty of id. could be put forward. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell's request is put first, of course <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> and others who desire to have a still higher duty, will naturally vote for a duty of id., because they prefer it to the duty of <inline font-style="italic">\d.</inline> But, having carried' it, they will not then be able to move for any higher amount. </para>

                        <para>- I do not intend to submit an amendment at the present time, but merely to give the Committee a few reasons why the duty should be higher than id. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell seems to miss the principle which lay at the root of my original proposal, namely, that the duty should be 3d. What I ' desired was a duty sufficiently high to encourage the production of oils, of all kinds within the Commonwealth, it being accepted that within the borders of Australia there are the raw materials in abundance. That being the case, I see no reason why the Committee, in pursuing the policy of protection laid down by the Commonwealth, should not do something to encourage and promote this industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell apparently thinks that id. will - prove a sufficient duty ; but in submitting his amendment, he admitted practically that he knew little or nothing of the subject, merely intimating that a jump from a duty of £d. to a duty of 3d. seemed so extraordinary that he could not vote for it. I point out, however,' that in' connexion with a large number of other industries we have increased the protection in very much larger proportion. If we desire to establish industries in Australia, we must give sufficient protection ; there is not any half-way house, unless we are revenue tariffists. If an honorable senator regards the Tariff as merely an instrument by means of which revenue may be extorted from the people, he ought to vote on all occasions for low duties. But if he desires the Tariff to assist in establishing industries, he must assist in imposing duties  sufficiently high to enable the industries to live. </para>

                        <para>- Apparently the honorable senator submitted his motion blindly, and had no other reason in sup- ' port beyond the arithmetical reason. The honorable senator pleaded with myself, and others who favour high duties, not to trample on the primary producers - not to load them with heavy taxation. That is exactly what we are trying to prevent the honorable senator and his allies, the freetraders, from doing. We are trying to place the primary producers in a much better position than they will be in if they are handed over to the tender mercies of either the Standard Oil Company or the Borneo Oil Company. Has <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell ever read of the condition of the primary producers in the United States, the home of the Standard Oil Company? Has he ever read of the exactions by the railway companies or by companies similar to that I have just named? Why are these companies in the position to trample on the. primary producers? Simply because they have no competition to meet - the oil companies and the railway companies have everything their own way. The honorable senator evidently desires to create a similar state of affairs in Australia. We, who believe in high duties, are endeavouring to bring about totally different conditions. We desire to establish the oil industry within the bounds of the Commonwealth, and give primary producers a choice of markets. If this industry is not encouraged! or .permitted to grow - if it is exposed to the attacks of the Standard Oil Company, with its millions of money and its hundreds of thousands of agents all over the world - it will have a very trying time before it comes to maturity, if ever it arrives at that point. We hear a great deal about the strength and the capital of the Commonwealth Oil Company ; and ' that is given as a reason, by those who are opposed to a higher duty, why this enterprise should not be assisted. If it were a poor company without capital, and not likely to succeed, precisely the same view would be taken by those honorable senators ; it does not matter whether an industry plays high or plays low - whether it be- rich or poor, likely to succeed or fail - the free-trader is opposed all the time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> dealt very exhaustively with the present position of the Commonwealth Oil Company ; and, in this connexion, I propose to read an extract or two from a document which has been handed to honorable senators.

                    <para>In the Customs  return  for Australia for 1906, the imports show something under 185,000 gallons o£ solar and residual oils, and on which there is a duty of id. per gallon. The requirements for Australia of these oils must be at least 4,000,000 gallons per annum. One firm in Melbourne alone requires 180,000 gallons per annum. It is therefore perfectly obvious that, as kerosene is free, a very large quantity of solar, residual fuel, and crude oils must be coming in as kerosene which, in bulk, is still free. Nearly all these oils, a large proportion of which is sold under 6d. per gallon, prices which it is impossible to compete with, are the by-products of Burmah or Borneo oils, and entirely produced by black labour, which is paid for at the rate of about is. oi-d. a day. In order to check the further importation of such oils as kerosene, a  duty  might be put on all kerosene over .792 gravity, such duty to be the same as on solar, residual, crude, and fuel oils. A large quantity of kerosene has been coming to Australia from America from the Standard Oil Co., and sold under the brand of " Royal Daylight," but is really used as engine oil, and sold, tins and cases free, at  7 d.  per gallon. It is really kerosene, but is never burned for  domestic purposes. We should say seven-eighths or nine-tenths of the kerosene used for domestic purposes in Australia has a gravity of .790. Probably go per cent, of American kerosene imported into Australia has- a gravity of not more than .790 and .791. </para>

                <para>Here is an aspect of the question which I wish to place before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell. We have in Australia, as every one will admit, the raw material for a huge oil industry. We can not only produce all that we require, but, I believe, that in the very near future we shall be exporting oil, just as to-day we are exporting butter. </para>

                        <para>- We could import sugar grown by black men in various quarters of the globe, and probably could get it a little more cheaply than we obtain the locally-grown article. But our national policy is first a White Australia, and, secondly, to produce everything we possibly can within our own confines. The more articles we can produce within our own territory, the more self-contained we are, the better will our position be if we are ever assailed by a foreign power. Industrial protection is a portion of our national policy of defence. Of course, honorable senators on my right sneer at that remark. </para>

                        <para>- But have we not been fold that within the very near future the. use of coal ashore and afloat will be abandoned, and that steam will be raised by means of liquid fuel? Suppose that Australia were at war with a foreign country, that her supply of oil ran out, and that she were dependent upon the Standard Oil Company or the Borneo Oil Company, or some other company outside for a supply of that commodity, would she not be in a fine pickle ! It is just as necessary that we should produce our own oil as that we should manufacture our own arms and ammunition. The policy of free-trade as it is expounded by my honorable friends on my right is one which ought to stink in the nostrils of every man who wishes to see Australia not only prosper, but able to defend herself against foreign aggression. I do not suppose that I need appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell to agree to a higher duty on this item than id. a gallon. He apparently thinks that he has made a great step in advance when he has jumped to that amount. </para>

                        <para>- It looks very large when it is mentioned in hundreds .per cent., but to my mind an increase from Jd. to id. per gallon is not sufficient .to place the oil industry on a solid and sound foundation. Of course, if I cannot get more than id. per gallon, I shall be compelled to accept it; but I suggest to my honorable friend that, having sprung to id., he might compound with his conscience just a little more and spring to 2d. I believe that if the company got a protection- of 2d. per gallon, it would have at least a fair run for its money. If he will propose a duty of 2d., I shall vote for his proposal, if not with pleasure, with at least a little measure of satisfaction. </para>

                        <para>- Inadvertently I fell into an error just now when I gave a ruling a.; to the method of dealing with a request for an amount above the rate .in the schedule. On referring to the records I find that our practice has been, to take first the. higher amount which has been suggested. If in the present case an- honorable senator wished to move that the duty be 3d. a gallon, that! request would be taken first, and if it were not carried a request for the next highest amount would be taken and so on. That course was taken yesterday, and therefore it has become the practice of the Committee. If there is any honorable senator who wishes to move a request for a hig,her duty than that suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell, I will put his proposal first. When we get below the amount which is given in the schedule we take the lowest duty and work up. In every case the guiding point is the amount in the " schedule. </para>

                        <para>- I have no doubt that he could do so, but my reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mil</inline> len' s inquiry was, that I was not just now in a position to give that information. I am moving the request because it is considered that it .would be absolutely unsafe to permit the free admission of these oils for use as an illuminant with any lower, flash-point, however advantageous the oils, might be for use for other purposes. </para>

                        <para>- It might be, but the honorable senator will remember that our climate is very much warmer than that of Great Britain, and that kerosene oil is used in some parts of the Commonwealth where the normal temperature during many months of the year is very much higher than it is even in Melbourne and Sydney. Necessarily we require to adopt a higher standard than that found to be suitable to a comparatively 'cold country like Great Britain. </para>

In this request, provision is made for the application of a close test, which, I believe, is carried out by subjecting a certain quantity of oil in a small closed vessel, to rising degrees of temperature, to discover the point at which it would explode. </para>

                        <para>- It is not so.I am proposing the adoption of a flash point, which is suitable for all Australia. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkinson</inline> is Government Analyst of Victoria, he has been advising the Federal Government in this matter with a knowledge of that Government's responsibilities, not merely to Victoria, but to the whole of the Commonwealth. I understand from him that a flashing point of 97 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the Abel-Pensky close test, is the right point <inline font-style="italic">at</inline> which to draw the line, and I have been informed that under that test, a flash point of103 degrees is equivalent to a flash point of 150 degrees under the open test. We must adopt a high standard to meet the conditions prevailing in the warmer parts of Australia. We could not discriminate and say that oil imported into Tasmania might have a lower flash point than oil imported into Queensland, because, after its importation into Tasmania, there would be nothing to prevent its transit from that State to Queensland. I feel sure that honorable senators will agree that it is necessary that, in the interest of the safety of the people, some such standard should be adopted, and that the standard suggested, if adopted, will not interfere with the principle which Parliament has affirmed that kerosene introduced for illuminating purposes should be admitted duty free. </para>

We may be able, under the Commerce Act, or by the exercise of other powers under the Constitution, to do something in regard to the standardization of locally produced kerosene, but, generally speaking, this matter is in the hands of the States, most of which have, by legislation already provided standards for kerosene and various other commodities purchasable by the public. The Customs Act of 1902 empowers the Department to fix a standard by by-law, but we prefer to bring the matter under the notice of Parliament, so that the standard adopted may be the result of legislative, not departmental, action. </para>

The question is, what standard should be adopted? The Minister is not able to tell us whether a flash point of 97 is too high or too low. All he says is that he is advised by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkinson</inline> - for whom we all have great respect - that that is a good standard to fix. We should have a little more information on the subject. If a standard were fixed by departmental by-laws, it could easily be altered at any time, if found to be defective ; but a standard imposed by the Tariff will not be capable of alteration except by an amendment of the Customs Tariff Act. The Minister says that 97 under the test proposed is equivalent to a flashing point of 150 by the open test. </para>

I am informed that an effort was made in Great Britain to increase the standard there from 76 to 82, but that it failed, and that 7-6 is the standard now prevailing in Great Britain, throughout India, and in more than half the countries of the world. I think that the words " at' such standard as may be prescribed by by-law " should be used. The .bulk of the oil which comes here is imported bv two companies, and while the public safety is of paramount importance, we should not fix a standard which will keep out oil which is not dangerous. </para>

We have had hours of talk against legislation by regulation, and now that I ask honorable senators to agree to something which could be clone by regulation, but which we wish to be done by. legislation, they find fault. They should be a little more consistent. We wish to place the standard in the Tariff so that he who runs may read - so that when a person takes up the Tariff to know the duty on kerosene, he will know what the test is. In other circumstances, it might be that a person desiring to import kerosene would look to the Tariff, and seeing no provision with regard to the flash point test, would not know until he came in contact with the Customs that kerosene had to conform to a certain test. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister of Home Affairs has given us a lecture on what we ought to do. I think we have a perfect right to know what information <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkinson</inline> has supplied to the Department. It is admitted that we do not know the technical features in relation to the flash point of- kerosene. But surely <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkinson,</inline> who has been experimenting, can tell us the reason why he has determined upon this flash point. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> said a little while ago, if we fix this test in an Act of Parliament, and it is found to be too high, it will operate prejudicially against the people, and it cannot be easily altered. We certainly should not fix the flash point by law at 97 degrees until we have further information. I have nothing to say against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. 'Wilkinson,.</inline> but it is only fair that we should know the grounds upon which his conclusion is based. If it is shown to me that some of the kerosene that1 is imported is dangerous, I shall be prepared to vote for a still higher test. But I am not going to do that blindfold. We have not been positively assured that a lower test would be dangerous. We do not know the flash test of the oils usually imported. </para>

                    <para>. - It is surprising that, as the series of experiments of which we have been informed were undertaken some time ago, no steps were taken to insert a provision as to the flash point of kerosene in the Tariff when it was before another place. If the analyst has been experimenting for three years to ascertain the proper flash test, why was not a provision inserted in the Tariff before it came to the Senate? The whole proceeding seems to me to be suspicious. I am credibly informed that under this test several kerosenes that have hitherto come into the Commonwealth under department al by-laws will be blocked. </para>

Why should the importers of these goods be penalized to help the Standard Oil Company, which seems to be the <inline font-style="italic">bete noir</inline> of some honorable senators ? That is the company that will benefit by driving competitors out of the market, because the Standard Oil Company sends the best kerosene into our market. I am also informed that the flash test in Egypt and India, as also in South Africa, is 76 degrees Fahrenheit. I should hesitate on the <inline font-style="italic">ipse dixit</inline> of any officer to embody in the Tariff a proposal such as this without further inquiry. The Minister would be well advised in agreeing to postpone the question to allow honorable senators to make inquiries regarding it. </para>

But honorable senators have only to probe their memories to know that there have been quite a number of disasters through the use of low-grade oil, or, at any rate, through explosions that could not otherwise be explained. Some of them may have been caused by some flaw in the lamp or heater in which the oils were used, but the probability is that they were caused through low-grade oil being used: It is supposed that the regulations have not been stringent enough, or that they have not been enforced  with sufficient rigour. At any rate, it is a fact that there have been disasters of this kind. Only within the last few days a whole family was decimated through the explosion of kerosene used in a heater. </para>

                        <para>- But the disaster may also have been occasioned through the use of low-grade oil. If what is proposed is a precaution, in the interests of safety we ought to be glad to adopt it. If 97 degrees is a higher point than is absolutely necessary, it is not by any means a higher point than can easily be secured by refiners of oil. We should be wise to err on the side of precaution rather than of laxity. I believe that the oils generally imported are very much above the standard here proposed. I have been informed that the general standard is nearer to 105 than any other figure. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> will withdraw his opposition to a proposal that has been made in the interests of the people of the Commonwealth. The test proposed cannot in any way interfere with the importation of safe reliable kerosene. From the most authentic sources I have it that both the White Rose and the Silver Light kerosenes, which are. generally put upon the market here, have a flash point of over 100. I may also tell <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> that the Abel-Pensky close test of 100 is similar to the American fire test of 150. The oil tested in America and imported to Australia represents about 103 under the Abel-Pensky close test. We want to protect the public against what could not be considered to be fraudulent, but would certainly be injurious trading, and I am assured that there are lines of kerosene coming into our market which have a flash point far too low to be safe. In fact, I have been told the names of some of them. I am told that Petrolene and Royal Daylight have a flash point which is not very much above 70 degrees. The storekeeper might supply such oils quite innocently, but serious consequences might ensue. We all desire to do all we can to protect the public from any of the difficulties which have been indicated by the Minister. I therefore urge the Committee to vote for the request. </para>

                    <para>. - There was considerable ignorance in the Department on this matter three years ago. At that time, many cargoes of kerosene were refused, though they were of the same quality as had been received for years and years. In India, and in Egypt, the flash point is 74 and 76, which is considered safe. If we are going to experiment in making the flash point 97 under a close test, I do not propose to object, but I wish the Committee to understand that we are going for an extremely good article and shall have to pay the price for it. </para>

                    LARGIE (Western Australia [3.59]. -When we are informed that the Government Analyst has been experimenting with the flash point of kerosene for a lengthy period, and that as the result of his scientific researches he has advised the Government that no flash point under 97 degrees is absolutely safe for kerosene, I think we ought to take his advice. This is a scientific question, and the only safe course for us is to stand by the advice tendered to us by the public officer. If we choose to act upon our own immature knowledge on such a question, we are extremely likely to blunder, and - our legislation will not be creditable to' us. There is another aspect of this question of which we should not lose sight, * and that is that the public are nob in a position to judge of the quality of the oil which they buy. The public, like honorable senators, generally appear to be very much

                    the dark as to whether or not the test isa safe one. It is therefore our duty in the interests of the public to say that kerosene below a certain test shall not be placed upon the market. If we are not to be guided by the advice of the Government Analyst, on whom shall we rely? We could have no better authority on this subject, and I hope that we shall accept his advice. If we do not the public will hold us responsible for any deaths, caused by an explosion of inferior kerosene, a great deal of which is placed on the market. Honorable senators of- the Opposition have admitted that analyses would show that so far as the test is concerned a great deal of imported kerosene on the market is incorrectly branded. The only excuse they offer for the perpetration of such a fraud is that probably others within the Commonwealth are also resorting to it. It is our duty to suppress fraud whenever we have an opportunity to do so, &lt;md I hope that the Committee will agree to the request submitted by the Government.

According to the report of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission it is probable that in the near future deposits of barytes in New South Wales will be extensively worked. Seeing that barytes has been used for a long time in the manufacture of paint and that its use will be continued until a more honest ingredient is found, I feel that we should do an injustice to the paint manufacturers if we did not restore the duty under paragraph a to the rate originally proposed.

                    <para>. - The schedule of proposed requests circulated by the Government embodies a proposal that a new paragraph be inserted providing for a duty of 2s. per cwt. on barytes, which is used in the manufacture of paint and certainly in some of the preparations included in the earlier paragraphs of the item. I understand that the honorable senator does not propose that another place be requested to impose a duty in excess of that originally imposed by .the Government. </para>

                    <para>.- Barytes, as most honorable senators are aware, is a mineral. I have here samples of it in its crude state as well as pulverized.  Barytes is extensively used in the mixing and preparation of paints, and I believe . constitutes about 80 per cent, of the ingredients of some paints. Under the first Federal Tariff it was dutiable at is. per cwt.) and it is now proposed to increase the duty to 2s. per cwt. on the ground that it relates to an industry which ought to be encouraged. Barytes is, I believe, found in all the States. In South Australia a company recently took up a fairly extensive area and the analyses of the barytestaken from its deposits proved .it to be of high quality. I am informed that barytes is used in sugar refining, paint making, tanning, rubber goods, straw goods r paper, pottery, and sealing wax. In a memorandum on the subject from interested parties it is said that if a duty of 2s. per cwt. were imposed they would be able to supply the requirements of the Commonwealth j that the industry being essentially Australian ought to be encouraged, and that if it were established on a firm basis much employment would be found for Australian workmen. The item was considered in another place at an early hour in the morning and in. the belief that barytes was not obtainable in Australia, and because it was. admittedly one of the raw materials of the paint manufacturers, honorable members, agreed to place it on the free list. The barytes industry has passed beyond the experimental stage, and those interested hu it claim, and rightly claim, a measure of protection. It is proposed to request another place to subject this material to a duty of 2s. per cwt., and in the belief that that request will be agreed to Australian paint manufacturers have urged that additional protection should be extended to them. It was with a view . of obtaining that additional protection that  <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> just now submitted his request. </para>

A very bad disease is prevalent amongst those engaged in its manufacture. It is a noxious trade, which ought not to be encouraged in this country. I think that the paint industry will be amply protected by a duty of 2s. per cwt., which was the old' rate.

                    <para>The evidence is conclusive that the Commonwealth Tariff has not retarded the local manufacture of white lead ; the process in operation when the evidence was given was not perfect ; the material used was not the most suitable ; and in consequence there has been, and is, a difficulty in obtaining capital to develop the industry. The local article is not undersold "by imported white lead, and, in view of the raw material being on the spot, and the heavy transit charges on imported white lead, there is - as was admitted - no necessity for any duty other than for. revenue purposes. The proportion of imports of paints mixed for use in relation to paints ground in oil is small, .and it -was plain that the witnesses asking for a higher duty desired the absolute prohibition of these :goods, in order to obtain a monopoly of the market. It was admitted that there was little local competition in relation to the magnitude of the business. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> is quite right in discussing the duty upon white lead in connexion with this item. But I would point out to him that the item is not confined to white lead. It also includes paints ground and in liquid. Now, although the manufacture of white lead may not commend itself to the honorable senator, he is scarcely justified in requesting the other Chamber to reduce the duty upon, all paints, ground and in liquid, from 4s. to 2s. per cwt.  His  arguments were addressed only to the disadvantage of manufacturing white lead in the Commonwealth, and I ask him not to press his proposal, which, if carried, would affect all paints, ground and in liquid. I do not know that the manufacture of white lead cannot be carried on in Australia under conditions which will eliminate the dangers that confront those who are employed in the industry elsewhere. </para>

                    <para>. - T - The proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> is one to increase the duty upon paints, and the reason advanced in its favour is that a duty has already been placed upon one of the raw materials from which paints are manufactured. But I would point out that a" duty is to be proposed upon barytes, which is a substitute for white lead. If we are going to charge the manufacturer a duty upon his raw material he may reasonably expect a little measure of protection. Of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> made a very frank admission when he declared that the effect of a duty is to enhance the marketable price of the commodity upon which it is imposed. </para>

Apparently that is the desire of honorable senators opposite. I wish to see the paint industry established, here. I can refer those honorable senators who voted recently under the misapprehension that barytes was not produced in Australia to page 241 of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission's report, where it is stated that - </para>

                    <para>In Sydney a paint manufacturer, representing a limited liability company, with a nominal capital of £20,000, requested that barytes, instead of being put on the free list as suggested by some witnesses, should remain dutiable at 1s. per cwt., as there were large deposits of it in New South Wales. </para>

                <para>That paint manufacturer asked for a protective duty of1s. per cwt. on his raw material. He was, at any rate, an honest man.

                <para class="block">We have taxed linseed oil at the rate of 6d. a gallon. Linseed oil and barytes are the chief ingredients of some paints. I believe that barytes forms as much as 90 per cent, of green paints, and of some classes of blue paints. I hope we shall not crush out this young and growing industry of barytes mining simply because of a misunderstanding. I desire the raw products of Australia, used in the manufacture of paints, to enjoy the same measure of protection as is given to the paint manufacturer. I have shown that barytes is mined and ground successfully in New South Wales. It enters into the composition of paints, and, therefore, in the interests of  that young industry I ask the Committee to agree to a protective duty, on this class of paint, of 4s. per cwt. against the United Kingdom. My request will certainly abolish preference, but if it is a question of fostering an Australian industry or giving preference to Great Britain, my vote will be in favour of the Australian industry every time. </para>

                    <para>Much will depend upon the vote taken on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> request. In a rather thin Committee the honorable senator and myself urged the claims of the comparatively new industry of barytes production. I believe that one or more votes which were cast against restoring the duty to the level at which it stood when the Tariff was introduced will be cast differently in the next division. A Sydney manufacturer asked the Tariff Commission for a duty of is. a cwt. on barytes. The A section of the Commission recommended that a duty should be imposed. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; but unless we vote for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> request the paint manufacturers will be disadvantaged. We want the duties restored to the level at which they were introduced by the Government in another place, in order that the barytes industry may receive protection. The evidence which I have quoted ought to have some influence on protectionist senators. If it will not move protectionist senators, or senators who were returned on protectionist principles, what will move them? I know what would move them at a certain period of their political existence. I ask honorable senators who previously voted against increasing the duty on this item to reconsider their position now. We have been fairly consistent in giving protection to certain industries, and should not make an exception of the barytes industry, but should give it the protection to which it is justly entitled. </para>

                    <para>. - I may be one of those referred to who might have voted under a misapprehension. I recognise that barytes is the basic material of the coloring matter in paints. Up to a few minutes ago I was not aware that it was produced in Australia.. I asked to-day if it was possible to secure a sample, but it was not until I came into the chamber that I saw a sample of barytes prepared in powdered form. It would have been wiser to postpone a couple of items until we decided what the duty on barytes shall be. If we increase the duty on that article we must necessarily increase the duties on other items, such as " Colours, dry, n.e.i." I am prepared every time to support infant industries. If there is an industry in. any part of Australia struggling for existence I am always prepared to give it protection. I regret that, the vote went against us on  the last occasion, and am prepared now to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> in abolishing preference. I think we shall be able by effective protection to produce all the barytes necessary for the coloring matter of paints in Australia. Now that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has shown, from the Tariff Commission's report, that barytes is produced here, I hope that the Committee will vote to abolish the preference to Great Britain in this case. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so ; the horse is in the shafts and pulling very well. Only one witness was examined before the Tariff Commission, and, according to him, this company has a nominal capital of £20,000 <inline font-style="italic">;</inline> and under the circumstances I am suspicious, as I was in the case of the Commonwealth Oil Company. Personally, I do not think there is sufficient proof of the presence of commercial barytes in New South Wales or South Australia ; if there be conclusive evidence let it be brought forward so that our way may be made clear. Assuming, however, that what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has said in this respect is correct, I direct the attention of honorable senators to the enormous natural protection there is already. If the industry cannot succeed under the circumstances, I am afraid that, from a commercial point of view, the local barytes is such that manufacturers will not use it. </para>

                        <para>- I suppose the honorable senator is adopting the word from legal phraseology; and in reply I say that the onus of proof lies on those who ask for the increase of duty. The cost of barytes in England is said to be 28s. a ton, and in Germany a little higher ; whereas the cost here, I am informed, is 62s. a ton - a natural protection of over 100 per cent.I am afraid that if we increase the duty unduly, we shall increase the price of the raw material to the manufacturer of colours. If local consumers are confined to Australian barytes, the result will be the complete disturbance of the industry. </para>

                        <para>- That, of course, is a stock argument. But the colour industry is largely dependent for its success on cheap raw material; and if we create any undue disturbance in this connexion we shall very probably, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has said, have to revise the whole Tariff. For the reasons I have given, I strongly advocate that barytes should be admitted free; or, at any rate, the duty ought not to be more than that suggested by the single witness who appeared before the Tariff Commission, namely,£1 per ton. Even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> will admit that that witness had, probably, strong interest in placing the most favorable case before the country. </para>

                        <para>- Nothing of the kind. We may take it that this witness presented the best case ; and strong reasons are necessary before the duty is raised  above the figure he suggested. It seems to me that on this item, as on many others, the Tariff is being made on a " go as you please " principle. The man "who has the strongest " pull," or who can finance, is probably the man who can get most out of the taxpayers. Originally the Government wanted a duty of £2 a ton, but the House of Representatives, after careful consideration, would not agree to their proposal. It is clear that the Government are out for revenue. Wherever they want an increased duty they say that it is high protection, and when we point out that it may injure a settled industry they say that they want revenue. It has not been shown that even if we go so far as the witness asked, namely, to £1 a ton, the consumption of the natural barytes will be prejudiced. I take it that a protection of <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> a ton is quite sufficient. Notwithstanding the man's statement that lie can manufacture paint on a basis of barytes with that measure of protection, the Government get some one to rise and tell the Committee that it is not' sufficient from a protectionist point of view, and that the duty should be fixed at £2 a ton. If that is not a squeeze, I should like to know what is a squeeze. If my speech fails to change a vote, or to save the honour and consistency of the Government and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> the public will know pretty well what the position is in regard to barytes, and also the reasons which influenced us in protesting so strongly against this unnecessary increase of duty. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking about the best article. It is a serious thing for a man to be called upon frequently to paint his house. When a house is painted the paint ought to last for a reasonable time. Of course, the Railway Department of this State may have had special reasons for doing what they did, but I am speaking in the interests of those who have to use paint. It is unwise, I think, not to give a preference to the United Kingdom. The result will be that the lower "priced white leads, which are not nearly so good as the English article, will come into the market, and give general dissatisfaction. Therefore quite apart from the question of preference, by which we ought to stand - in the interests of the users, we should give to the British article, which is the best in the world, a preference of 6d. per cwt. </para>

Those who are distinctly against giving a preference to Great Britain are entitled to their view, and to vote to give effect thereto. </para>

                        <para>- The duty in the general Tariff represents an increase of 50 per cent. The old duty was 4s. per cwt., and. the duty proposed in the schedule is 6s. If honorable senators are prepared to increase the duty to 6s.9d., I suppose that nothing but numbers will restrain them. This is an article which is required in every household in the Commonwealth. There is not a house which does not sooner or later require paint, and more particularly is it  purchased in the interior districts, where very often it is not possible to get paint made up as it may be required. The ready-made paint is used there, and it is proposed by the Government to increase by 50 per cent, the duty under which this trade has made satisfactory progress. </para>

                    <para>. - There need not be much doubt on the subject, as any one who has farming or grazing knowledge must know that tattoo oil is well known throughout Australia as the oil used most extensively in the branding of sheep. I confess that I had overlooked its inclusion in paragraph b of this item until my attention was directed to it by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl's</inline> question. It is as well, to emphasize the fact that honorable senators are now being asked to increase by 50 per cent, the duty imposed upon an article which is used by every sheep farmer in the country. </para>

According to the evidence given before the Commission there are extensive deposits of colours of all shades at Blumberg, near Adelaide, South Australia.

                        <para>- All this is brought about by the action of Ministers in coquetting with demands for higher duties. They know that infinite time and trouble were devoted in another place to the framing of the Tariff, and although magnificent protection was afforded to local industries, they do not appear to be content, and we find them supporting every single request for a further increase in the duties. </para>

                        <para>- No; in every instance they leave that to one of their followers, and the only argument the Minister can give in support of a request for on increased duty is that it is consistent with the original proposal submitted by the Government in another place. Do we not know from the lips of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne himself that the Government submitted high duties in the first instance in another place in order that they might have something to give away? Is it not known that the rates of duty proposed are, in many cases, 100, 200, or 300 per cent, higher than those recommended by the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, and that in 200 instances the finding of this judicial tribunal, which was established that we might learn the. truth about the so-called struggling industries, ' have been departed from? Honorable senators cannot point tq a single industry, which under the old Tariff was a struggling one. Increases of duties, are being obtained by means of statements absolutely lacking in truth! When, in regard to another item, I asked what the effect of a protective duty would be on primary industries, I was told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> that he would deal with that later; but he did not do- so. With, on the one hand, the industries which are crying out for protection, and, on the other, the great body of. primary producers, which is to be preferred ? In every instance the Labour Party prefers to give a tremendous dose of protection to the manufacturers, instead of studying the interests of the primary producers. Protection is the policy with which they pull the leg of the Government, and on which they are going to fight the next election. I shall have much pleasure in putting the true state of affairs before my constituents. Honorable senators seem to have .not 'the faintest notion of the importance of our primary industries. They talk of the need of giving employment, but they injure the primary industries, which give employment- to thousands, in order to protect industries some of which employ only two men and  a  boy. </para>

Well, in this item", the rate proposed in respect to imports from Great Britain is that recommended by' the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, whose recommendations he said should be followed. The Commissioners recommended a duty of 3s., and I am willing to vote for 'hat rate in respect to importations from Great Britain, whence 80 per cent, of our importation of paints comes. I should like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> to show his consistency by joining me in supporting this proposal. </para>

                        <para>- The Tariff Commission took a great deal of evidence in regard to paints, and were shown samples of locally-produced coloring matter, by which they could not help being impressed. We have been told that the industry is not a struggling industry but to my knowledge, it has been struggling for nearly twenty-five years without being able to go ahead, because of the competition of imported materials, many of which come from southern Europe. Within thirty miles of Adelaide there is practically a mountain of colouring material. Not only is the colour obtained from it good, but its durability compares favorably with that of any other. Is not the mining for this material as much a primary industry as any other kind of mining? </para>

                        <para>- I have no desire to comment further on it. It is not a savory subject. So far as concerns the material to which I have been referring, I should like to add that the natural products that have been found in South Australia and other States, and manufactured into paint, are of such a quality that the paint adheres to the material to a greater degree than does paint manufactured from any other substance. In the instance to which I have alluded - the railings of Victoriasquare, Adelaide - when the paint was taken off a few years ago, it was found that it left nothing but the white metal to which it had been adhering. For durability it cannot be surpassed. It is certainly a primary industry, and it has also unfortunately been a struggling industry. It has been struggling for the last twenty - one years, and has not got on its feet yet. But I am hoping that if this Tariff proposal is adopted and made permanent, we shall, in the near future, have paint made in Australia manufactured from our own  material that will be equal to the best in "the world. </para>

                    <para>- - I am sorry that fiscal divisions of opinion cannot be exhibited without heat being engendered. In discussing a matter of this kind, we ought to make allowances for those who differ from us. I can assure honorable senators who are opposed to this request that some of those who are not in accord, with them know quite as much about the primary industries of this country as do others who are always declaring that they are the special advocates of such industries. The matter with which we are dealing is undoubtedly a primary industry that is well worthy of encouragement. I should like honorable senators who usually regard themselves as the champions of primary industries to remember that those who hold the protective fiscal faith know quite as much about such industries as do the free-traders. I have all my life been engaged in primary industries. -It must be remembered that while there are some primary industries which are, perhaps, able to stand without, fiscal assistance, it is impossible for others to get a start without such assistance. Surely, we can express such opinions without being called asses or without being assured that we know nothing about the primary industries of Australia and care nothing as to whether they sink or swim. Personally, I have a great deal more to lose from any damage done to primary industries than perhaps have those who make such observations. I am here to try to give a start to alt industries which are struggling, and if I can do that by voting for a duty such as is proposed I am happy to be able to do so. </para>

                    (New South Wales) [5.52]. - I- must oppose this proposal because I think it is quite possible that in administering the Tariff the Department of Trade and Customs may bring the dry materials used in white-washing within the operation of this duty, and seeing the enormous amount of whitewash that will be required by the Ministry and the Labour Party in connexion with their performances in relation to the Tariff, I am certainly opposed to any duty that will place a difficulty in the way of their being whitewashed, as is so urgently necessary.

It does not matter whether a deposit of ore or of any other primary material is found in any particular State - it is our duty to give it a fair measure of protection. I have consistently supported a moderate amount of protection being given to Australian industries regardless of geographical situation. But I really want to know on what grounds <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> who was a member of the Tariff Commission, is supporting an increase in this item, and on what grounds it was originally supported by the protectionist members of the Commission.

I shall read from the reports evidence which I think bears out my contention that there is no justification for reverting to the duty originally proposed by the Government.

Ample protection is afforded by the. transit charges on colours imported. There is not sufficient output to justify the embarking of the necessary large  capital  and scientific skill in the production of high-grade chemical colours. This disability is too great for any duty to equalize. It is, however, a fact that a variety of primary colours is manufactured successfully and profitably in the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>. - Just before the last division <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> was greatly exercised in his mind as to the evidence given before the Tariff Commission, and was at some pains, for which he is to be commended, to try to correct a wrong impression into which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> had evidently fallen. I object to the slight tinge of rebuke in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley's</inline> remark that any honorable senator should be guilty of negligence in quoting only a portion of the evidence and not the whole df it. Recognising that the honorable senator is a perfect Pilate in his search after truth, I propose to supplement the limited knowledge of this subject which he has gained by his examination of the report by drawing his attention to a few statements to which he has not referred. The witness O' Connell, who, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> knows more about this business than all the rest, said - </para>

Were the importations of dried colours into Australia stopped, within three months he would have 100 men, now idle, manufacturing them. If he could get his article on the market he would soon convince the public of its quality.  His  paint had been used bv the Railway Department, on private buildings, and by the municipal authorities, with satisfactory results. At present the public would rather buy inferior -paint from Germany, Italy,- and other countries. With the duty he. would sell his paint for much less than the public now paid for imported lines. He also suggested this increased duty to encourage the production of linseed oil, which is used in the manufacture of paint. The Commonwealth Tariff had not prejudiced his industry, but he wanted the Tariff to help it. " A 5  per cent. Commonwealth Tariff is no advantage at all." </para>

Everybody who knows anything about the paint trade is aware that one particular. class of mineral deposit cannot be used for all the varieties of paint required, and that there is a limited market in Australia for any one class of paints. I congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> upon the discovery that the mineral paint deposits in South Australia are sufficiently large to enable some -railings around a few of the small squares in the city of Adelaide to be painted. But in New South Wales we have not only overtaken the local consumption, but we are shipping thousands of tons of this mineral material to other parts of- the World. " All this bathos about the industry providing employment for so many men is so much superb fudge. Instead of contending for a duty upon this mineral material, it would be just as sensible to advocate the imposition of an export tax upon wool. </para>

I have had a close connexion - not a profitable one, unfortunately - with mineral paints in New South Wales ever since 1868. During all the period that has since elapsed, a large enterprise has existed there, known as the Standard Paint Company, which was originally started by the well known auctioneering firm of Messrs. Richardson ' and Wrench, who used to carry on their operations in what is now a part of the Sydney watershed. In more recent years, its paint has been manufactured in Woolloomooloo, which forms a portion of Sydney. I have no doubt that some honorable senators know where Woolloomooloo is situated, and I hope that they visit it at suitable times. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham's</inline> education has been so sadly neglected that he needs to be taught how to spell Woolloomooloo, but in view of the fact that he is, comparatively, a recent arrival from the Old Country we must make some allowance for him.  If he will spend a quarter of an hour with me during the adjournment for dinner, I shall be able to spell Woolloomooloo for him, and also a number of other words, which will probably be more useful to him. </para>

You, sir, asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> whether he regarded the expression used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> as an offensive one. He replied in the affirmative, and you then said, " Then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> must withdraw it." Under the circumstances I hold that there is only one course for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> to adopt, and that is to withdraw the offensive expression and to cease arguing against your ruling. </para>

                    . (New South Wales) [7-45]- - A night Or two. ago I submitted that if the Government continued to profess an interest in preferential trade with the United Kingdom, they would, in view of their actions, be guilty of a fraudulent pretence. I may go a stage further now, and congratulate them on dropping all pretence in "the matter of United Kingdom preference, tearing up and scattering to the winds all their pledges, offered with so much eloquence to the United Kingdom by the Prime Minister,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline>
                    a little while ago, and posing here as not only anti preferentialists, but prohibitionists against England, as well as against the rest of the world. I do not refer personally to my esteemed and learned friend
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline>
                    for whom I have great respect and deplore that he is to be found in such very unfortunate Ministerial company. I must, of course, address. my remarks to the particular item before the Chair, but every one within hearing will know that I am speaking generally when I say that it is deplorable to find the Government supporting in this Chamber propositions that have been opposed elsewhere. There was a show of preference to the United Kingdom displayed elsewhere, but here of late, and particularly in this instance, there has been very much more than a backsliding - there has been a lamentable exhibition of the abandonment of Ministerial pledge, Ministerial promise, and the hopes that surrounded those features of the Tariff, which seemed to indicate that blood was thicker than water. But we find that blood is not, in the estimation of many here, thicker, than water, and any nation of the world is just as good to some honorable senators as, and better to some others than, the land from which we spring - the land whose great power overshadows and protects this far quarter of the globe, and' to which we are bound, whether we like it or not, by such strong ties. I must conscientiously support in connexion with this item and in the future, just as I have done in the past, the proposals that are to be found in the second column of the schedule, where some show is given to the workers and the people of the Old Country who outlay so largely every year towards the assistance of the defence of Australia and Australian trade. These dry colours cross the globe coming and going.' There are imports of them from the United Kingdom to Australia. Hundreds and thousands of tons of minerals for the making of dry colours traverse the waters of the globe from Australia to England. That traffic to and fro is under the aegis of the British Navy, which is supported by the taxpayers of the country to which we should be proud to give a preference, not only as an evidence of our son hood to the Old Land, hut as a token that we appreciate benefits conferred and advantages given. I deplore most sincerely the frequent opposition shown to preference to the United Kingdom, which is nicely printed in our schedule, and shockingly ignored in our voting.

I do not believe that any true Australian will agree with their action in seeking to give to every other country in the world the same advantage as they are willing to give to Great Britain. I often hear them talk about the way in which the workers in the Old Country are sweated, but according to their votes' they would never give those workers a chance of getting more work. They want to make the people of the Old Country compete against all the cheap labour of the world. </para>

                        <para>- I am trying to show that if the request- is agreed to the United Kingdom will be put upon a level with all other countries.  The Prime Minister when in Great Britain made great professions of his desire to give preference to the United Kingdom, but  now the representatives of the Government in this chamber support a motion to raise the duty against the United Kingdom to the level of that against the rest of the world. I believe that that action has been forced upon them. They have not done it of their own free will, but are obeying orders. I cannot understand the attitude of the Government in endeavouring to place Great Britain on the same footing as every other country. </para>

                        <para>- We are putting Australia first ; but it is possible that the honorable senator who interjects does not approve of preference. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> told us to-night that the dry colours produced in South Australia are so good that when they were applied to iron railings in Victoria Square, Adelaide, the paint lasted for fifteen or sixteen years, and the metal had to be scraped, until it was bright before it could be repainted. If what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> states is the truth, then it would appear that, for the sake of employing fifty men in the colour industry, thousands of painters are to be thrown out of work.' . I understand that a number of Government buildings in Melbourne require painting, and if these local' colours are used, it is evident, from what we have heard, that no more painters will be required for many years. </para>

It does not speak well for Australia that representatives of the people here should seek to deprive Great Britain of the preference promised by the Prime Minister. . Real labour representatives know that it does not matter whether a man works for his bread in England or Australia; . and the request can only tend to undesirable class distinction. If the object be as I say, to place the workmen of Great Britain on the same level as the workmen of China and Japan, let that object be openly expressed ; but my vote shall always be given for preference to the Old  Country </para>

                        <para>- Betting is illegal in Victoria. The Tariff, as introduced here, approved by the Ministry, provided for duties of 2s. 6d. and 2s., and the Government expressed a perfervid belief in the principle of preference. We are now asked by the Government to raise both duties by 6d., and, because we are not prepared to do so, we are accused of being opposed to preference. In other words, the Government say " We will give you a preference conditionally on your raising the duty in the general Tariff just as high as we like." That is the extent to which they believe in preference. While some honorable senators are open opponents of preference </para>

                        <para>- It is the preferential policy, and I venture to say that there is no more ardent  preferentialist  than 1 am. On this item the  preferentialists  in the Chamber sought £0 make the duty higher against foreign- nations, but the other side objected. Some of them have declared that they do not care for preference, but would use it on every occasion to reduce duties." That is the use to which they are now endeavouring to put it, while they are prating, as" <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> did just now, about the "dear Old Land." A few moments ago there was an opportunity to give a preference to Great Britain on this item. It was taken advantage of by honorable senators on this side to propose a duty _ which would be higher against the rest of the world than we thought to be necessary even against Great Britain. That object we were unable to consummate because of the votes of honorable senators on the other side. We therefore have to acknowledge regretfully that on this item preference to Great  Britain is not possible, and to insist upon our first preference for Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - A strong appeal has been made to us by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> and others that we must consider first the Australian industry whether it be primary or secondary, and then make the duty high enough to protect that industry as against the world. That is a sentiment which of course appeals very strongly to Australians, but I cannot understand the position upon which the Government and their supporters seem to be insisting.  They have urged that Australians should look after Australian industries and build up the Tariff accordingly. I know that in the construction of recent Tariffs that principle has . been departed from, and articles have been made free. Within the space of a few minutes that principle has been -departed from here to our knowledge. In another place the Government departed from it flagrantly.  The  CHAIRMAN.-  The honorable senator must address his remarks to the question of the duty on dry colours. </para>

The request before the Committee is a complete reversal of the Government's policy, I am not an 'ardent admirer of their idea in regard to preference, but if there is any benefit in a preference it seems to me that there is an opportunity of conferring a "benefit in connexion with this item, because in 1906 we imported £19,705 worth of dry colours, of which £10,847 worth came from the United States of America. In the case of many items that country has been regarded by honorable senators as the most formidable competitor with our industries. With them no words have been too strong or too expressive to point out the dangers from which we are suffering in that regard. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> waxed quite eloquent at times in his denunciation of such competition. If, as it appears from the ' figures, the United States of America is such a dangerous and formidable antagonist, cannot <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> who said that the secondary object of his affections was the Old Land, give something even for that object? </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator did not succeed on that occasion, why can he not join with us on this side and give what we can to the Old Country ? If, however, he will not help us, what is the value of his terms of regard for the Old Country? In the face of the figures I have quoted I ask the Government, if there is a shadow of reality in their pretence, to try to do some little good for the Old Country by voting with us on this occasion. If they will not support our efforts, what conclusion can be drawn from their refusal but that their preferential scheme is a mere pretence? The meeting of Parliament was delayed for many months in order that the Prime Minister might -go to the Colonial Conference, and by a splendid, burst of eloquence and argument try  to impress upon that body how - much he and his Government desired to benefit the Old Country by a preferential Tariff. I suppose that the supporters of the Government indorsed everything which was said and done on that occasion. But when we ask them to grant a little preference to the Old Land as against the United  States and other foreign competitors they turn a deaf ear to our appeal. Even if we do not succeed in carrying this duty as it stands, I think that we shall have' the satisfaction of having made it pretty clear, to the public what is the proper term to apply to such political conduct as that of which the Government and their supporters have- been guilty. </para>

But Shylock-like they say, " No, we want an increase of 150 per cent, on the old duty." Is there any sense or any gratitude to Great Britain in that? It is monstrous.

For the sake of doing a little crawling to the men who are supporting him at the present time. ' I trust that this duty will be left as it is. I trust that honorable senators, and especial lv the representatives of the Government in this Chamber, will have some little sense of decency in the conduct of business, will on this occasion reverse the previous vote and allow the preference to imports from the United Kingdom to remain. </para>

But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> gave as a reason for .moving the requests he submitted -to the Committee his intention" to move the insertion of a new paragraph providing for the imposition of a duty on barytes. That was an intelligible proposal, because when it was proposed to impose a duty on barytes, a raw material used in the manufacture of paint, it was not unreasonable from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> 's stand-point to increase the duty on paint. Here we have an article which stands in exactly the same relation to paint as does barytes, which is a raw material from which paint is made. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator knows well that I am not likely to vote with him to increase a duty by nearly 150 per cent. The original duty on white lead was1s. per cwt., and to show its utter absurdity the proposal to increase the duty to 2s. 3d. per cwt. need only be stated. The honorable senator should come forward openly and say that he is moving this request because he does not consider the present duty of 2s. per cwt. high enough; but he should not tell the Committee that he is seeking to increase this duty on a raw material of paint because! he intends later on to support the imposition of a duty on another raw material. If the intention were to assist the trades affected by the former item he should leave the duty in this case as it stands. I point out that whatever may be the virtues of barytesno one would contend that it is a better raw material for the manufacture of paint than is white lead. Yet while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has intimated his intention to move for a duty of 2 s. per cwt. on barytes, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> now asks the Committee to agree to a request that the duty on white lead should be 2s. 3d. per cwt. No one who desires to see superior paint made, here will consider it advisable to impose the higher duty upon the superior raw material. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> to leave this duty as it stands, though I do not profess to be animated by any hope that the honorable senator will accept so reasonable a suggestion. </para>

                        <para>- I dare say that is so, and that the whole matter is cut and dried. I ask honorable senators to pay some attention to the fact that it is proposed to impose a duty of 2s. 3d. per cwt. on white lead and a duty of only 2s. per cwt. on barytes, whilst no one will pretend to prefer paint made from barytesto paint made from white lead. Barytes is used in the manufacture of paint because it is an inferior substitute for white lead, and in framing this Tariff we should at. least do what we can to encourage the manufacture of the superior article. </para>

I have not discovered consistency either in the Tariff or in the attitude of some honorable senators, who vote for preference on some items, and try to destroy ft on others. If the interests of Australia required an increase of only 3d. in the general duty, a similar increase should be sufficient in the preferential rate. </para>

                    <para>That the House of Representatives be requested to amend item 236 by inserting the following new paragraph : - "g. Barytes, per cwt., 2s." </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">This is a request of which notice -was given when the Tariff was introduced in the Senate. It is perfectly true, as was said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> in discussing the previous paragraph,  that the Minister in charge of the Tariff in another place accepted an amendment taking barytes from the position in which it stood in the Tariff and inserting it in item 239, dutiable at 5 per cent, as against foreign countries, and free in regard' to imports from the United Kingdom. It was stated at that time that barytes "was not produced in Australia. That statement went uncontradicted, and at a late hour at night, or early in the morning, the Minister in charge of the Tariff consented to the amendment proposed. But later on it was discovered that barytes was produced in various parts of the Commonwealth, and that there are large deposits of it scattered throughout Australia which can be worked to commercial advantage. It has been decided, therefore, to rectify the error then made, and1 the request which I have submitted is for that purpose. I understand that a parcel of barytes is to form one of the features of Australian productions at the forthcoming Franco-British Exhibition in London. Quite recently what are considered to be very valuable deposits of baryteswere discovered in my own State. Other deposits capable of being developed are to be found elsewhere in the Commonwealth. As honorable senators are aware, barytes in crushed or powdered form is used as a dry colour, and is employed in the manufacture of paints. In some cases it has been used as a substitute for white' lead. 'We have large importations, particularly from- Germany, France, and Belgium. It has been considered desirable,  in the interests of protecting our own industry and promoting local production, to propose a duty of 2s. per cwt., and I therefore move accordingly. </para>

Passing from that phase of the question, I would point out ' that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> is quite consistent in what he is doing. This duty, of 5 per cent, in respect of foreign imports is a slight preference to the United Kingdom, and, possibly, that is why he desires it to  be removed. It is another evidence that wherever it is possible to do so some honorable senators are prepared  to destroy the preference which the Government say they are pledged to support. - <inline font-weight="bold">('Senator TRENWITH (Victoria)</inline> [9.1 1]. -1 hope that the item will not be made free. - ' </para>

' It may, however, and probably will, have the effect of diverting- to Great Britain some of the imports that now come  from Germany. I hope that 'result will- be achieved, and, if 'it can be, we ought to aim at it. There are some protectionists who do not believe in preference. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has repeatedly expressed his disapproval of the principle, and I could understand his objecting to this duty. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> perhaps, takes up the same stand, but there are protectionists who believe, very properly, that our first preference should be for Australia/ and that we ought to have a second preference, and a strong one, for the United Kingdom. </para>

It is a mineral deposit which has never been discovered in Australia. At any rate, there are no records, of its discovery here, and I see no reason why the manufacturers of laundry  blue  should be taxed to' the extent of 5 per cent, upon the raw material of their industry. But assuming that ultramarine blue were discovered' in the' Commonwealth, the ex'pense that would require to be incurred to  extract it from the solid rock would be so great that it would scarcely be worth while to undertake the work. I would also remind the Committee that our manufacturers of laundry blue have to compete with the German article, because German chemists have discovered a, process , by which they can make, ultramarine blue equal in quality to the. natural product. In support of my contention I quote the following from the <inline font-style="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica,</inline> Vol. 23, page 721 - </para>

I believe that an ultramarine factory has been started in Great Britain since then, but the cost, of importing the article is so great that, in order to assist the Australian manufacturers, of laundry blue, the Minister should not object to my request. Even the most pronounced protectionist cannot point to any portion  of  Australia where this, mineral has, been, or is likely to be, discovered. Why then, impose this tax, which will operate only as a revenue duty ? </para>

A request to the same effect was preferred to the Government some months back .  One gentleman interested in the manufacture of blue in the Commonwealth represented to the Minister of Trade and Customs the necessity of making ultramarine blue free, whether it came from the United Kingdom or elsewhere. After making inquiries, the Minister refused to accede to the request. An effort was made to free the article in another place, but was opposed by the Government, and was unsuccessful. </para>

                        <para>- The reason was that this was a preferential duty of 5 per cent., and ultramarine blue was being manufactured in Great Britain. In a circular issued by Messrs. Lewis and Whitty it is admitted that the article is made in the United Kingdom, but it is also stated that the price charged to them in Great Britain is higher than they have to pay in Germany. It is manufactured by Reckitt and Sons, who, observing an account in the press of the interview between the Minister and Messrs. Lewis and Whitty, wrote to the Minister as follows :  - </para>

                    <para>.- I think I can show in a few words, the absolute hollowness of the Minister's contention. The only duty proposed is 5 per cent. (General Tariff), while the article, if it comes from Great Britain, is free. The quotations for ultramarine blue by German and English firms show that a preference of 5 per cent, will be absolutely useless, and can only result in imposing a tax upon the Australian manufacturers of laundry blue, without diverting the trade in any way to Great Britain. The lowest quotations for ultramarine blue are: English, <inline font-style="italic">£37</inline> IOS- Per ton&gt; freight and charges paid ; German, ^30 per ton, freight and charges paid. Five per cent, is is. in the pound, which will mean 30s. per ton, bringing the total price of the German article up to ^31 ios., as against .£37 10s., the lowest English quotation. That duty -cannot possibly divert the trade to England. The Government are assuming an absolutely unfair position. Reckitt and Sons have, on account of the duty on laundry blue, started a factory in Australia. That is very satisfactory to protectionists. The English manufacturer, who formerly manufactured the article in England and exported it to Australia, has been induced by our protective Tariff to start a branch of his factory in Australia. But by this preferential duty we shall simply be compelling the other Australian manufacturers either to pay the tax or buy their raw material from their trade rivals, Messrs Reckitt and Sons. No fair-minded Committee should tolerate such a state of affairs. No manufacturer should be so placed at the mercy of his trade rival. For those reasons f favour ultramarine blue being made absolutely free. I do not think it necessary to remove ultramarine blue from this item, which includes the raw materials of many manufactures in Australia. These articles are not made in Australia now,, and lt is not contended that they are likely to be made here. In the previous Tariff they were absolutely free, and the protectionist section of the Commission recommended that they should remain so, whereas the free-trade section - though, as a fact, that section consisted of revenue Tariffists - suggested duties of 5 to 10 per cent., with a view to raising revenue. Under the circumstances, I urge that these commodities should be admitted -free and I shall certainly move to that effect, seeing that they are all in the same category. It appears that this pseudo-protectionist Government desire to follow the revenue-raising recommendations of the free-trade section of the </para>

It is true that the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended that these various colours- should be free; but we must remember that when the Commission was appointed, and the members of it received their instructions, there was no suggestion of preferential duties, and, under the circumstances, they were not in a position, or did not feel inclined, to recommend varying imposts. If the free-trade section recommended duties of 5 to 10 per cent., those duties were to operate against Great Britain and other countries. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> might as .well decline to give a preference on all the other articles in the item as on the one immediately under discussion ; and, if he is influenced by those who have been urging 'honorable senators to do away with preference, I think he is on the wrong tack. What have we done already ? We have given substantial protection  to the manufacturers of laundry blue. </para>

                <para class="block">During the discussion on various items, honorable senators have professed them selves as having been very much concerned about not handicapping other trades and industries in Australia by imposing duties on articles necessary for the successful pursuit of them. They have even gone to the length of trying to reduce duties on articles which we can produce, and which they reckon ought to be made as free as possible to primary and other industries here. Item 239' includes a large number of articles which are not only necessary but essential to the carrying on of certain trades and callings. . We do not produce the articles in Australia, nor is it contended that we are likely to do so for a considerable time, and the duty proposed, is a purely revenue one. The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended that all the articles contained in this item should be admitted free. On the other hand, the free-trade members of that body recommended the imposition of duties of from 5 to 10 per. cent. - revenue duties of which they, were always in favour. This evening <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> made a great song about poor painters being out of work, or having their raw materials taxed. Here is an item including a number of articles which can be made free for the poor painters. </para>

They are also essential to many of the metal trades. The item also includes London purple and Paris green - two articles which we do not produce here, and which are essential to a number of trades and callings. We handicap the people engaged there in by imposing a tax on their raw material. The item also includes prepared glazes for pottery. We have an infant pottery industry, and honorable senators opposite want to handicap it by imposing a duty of 5 per cent. on a very necessary article to give a finish and an ornamentation to the product. </para>

                        <para>- I do not care by whom the tax is imposed. It is the duty of  the Committee to scrutinize every item and to amend the Tariff if they think that desirable. The item also includes sulphate of copper and ultramarine blue. I hold that the tax oh the latter article is absolutely iniquitous. It compels the people who were engaged in the manufacture of laundry blue here before the imposition of the Federal duty, which induced Reckett of England to establish a factory here, either to buy from that firm or to pay the duty, and to that extent they are at a disadvantage as compared with their trade rivals. It is an absolutely iniquitous tax, which should' not be tolerated by any one who has a sense of fair play. The item also includes - Ceramic colours' ; artists' colours; dyes, dry or in paste, in bulk for manufacturing purposes ;  Vandykes  ; manganese; Paris white; vermilions; and crayons. A great many of these articles are used in the production of paints. Not long ago honorable senators on the other side were nearly fainting in their efforts to get paints admitted free, or at a reduced duty, but now we find them ready to vote for a higher duty. </para>

                        <para>- We tested honorable senators on an item just now, and they voted in that way. That is how we know what they are ready to do. Their profession of free-trade is hypocrisy pure and simple, because they want to impose a tax on almost every item ; the members of the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission recommended nothing but revenue duties. How can we have free-trade if we levy a duty on almost every article? Revenue duties will accomplish nothing in the way of inducing manufactures in Australia, but will merely take money out of the pockets of the people. They increase the price to the consumer, -whereas protectionist duties reduce the price to the consumer. We have here one instance of the benefit of protection. Prior to the Tariff of 1902 the quantity of laundry blue imported was enormous, but what was the result of the passing of a protectionist duty on blue? The result was that the big English firm of Reckitt and Sons immediately established a factory in Australia. That is the kind of thing that is accomplished by protectionist duties, and it is the kind of thing which anti- Australians like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> would prevent for all time if they could. I am against revenue duties all the time, and I intend to give honorable senators an opportunity to vote against one on this item. I shall not labour the question further. I hope that those who dp not believe in revenue duties will assist me by their votes to carry my request. I have found that some honorable senators who profess to be in favour of relieving the taxpayers of - unnecessary burdens are prepared to vote for the highest revenue duties they can get. </para>

If honorable senators opposite are consistent they will support my very reasonable request. It cannot be pretended that this is a protective duty, and I point out for the information of the Vice-President of the Executive Council that the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended that all the articles enumerated under this item should be free. </para>

                        <para>- I know that, but I wish them to be admitted free from every part of the world. I have no wish that our people should be taxed for the benefit of the people of the United Kingdom any more than for the benefit of the people of any other part of the world. If they are to be taxed al all it should be for the benefit of the people of Australia and not for the benefit of the people of the United Kingdom. Honorable senators oppose protective duties on the ground that they object to the imposition of an undue burden of taxation upon the people of Australia, but they are now apparently willing to impose such a burden for the benefit of the people of the United Kingdom. When the Government bring forward a conservative proposal, it is the conservative honorable senators on the other side who help them to carry it. </para>

                    <para>. - The observation has frequently been made that the Government seeks to use preference as an excuse for increasing its revenue, and that is what has been done in this instance. The imports of the Commonwealth of asphalt and roofing tiles are valued at about ,£12,093, of which £11,512 worth-comes from France. It is evident, therefore, that this is a commodity which England does not produce in considerable quantities. She will not produce such tiles as a result of this preference duty, because the small consumption in this country would not be sufficient inducement. The purpose of the request moved by the Minister appears to me to be to impose a high duty against France, under cover of granting a preferential duty to Great Britain. A little while ago I heard my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> use a phrase which I think is applicable to present circumstances. He spoke of a proposal as a "hollow sham." If ever there was a hollow sham it is this. The Government, a little while ago, voted against a preferential duty which would have helped </para>

                    <para>. - Perhaps the last  speaker  was taken somewhat " on the hop " when turning to statistics relating _ to this item. I find, on reference to the Trade and Customs returns for 1906 - from which, I presume, the honorable senator was quoting - that under the .heading of asphalt and roofing tile's the imports into Australia were of the value of £12,093, of which .£11,512 came from France. But immediately following those particulars are figures in relation to tiles n.e.i., which are included in this item. I find that ,£15,000 worth came into Australia, of which ,£10,695 came from the United Kingdom. These figures clearly show that Great Britain exports a considerable quantity of tiles to Australia. The total imports into this country under the item as it stood before I moved the additional words were, in 1905, from Great Britain, .£9,576 <inline font-style="italic">;</inline> from other countries, £17,204; in 1906, from Great Britain, £"10.716; from other countries, £"16,381. So that. Great Britain, so far from being unable to produce and export these goods to the Commonwealth, can, and does, pro-, duce and export a considerable proportion of them - certainly not one-half, but more than one-third. It is proposed to make a difference between 35 per cent, and 25 per cent., to allow of the balance of the trade being in favour of Great Britain. </para>

                        <para>- The Committee ' has already requested an increase in the duty on tiles, and I see no earthly reason why we should not afford adequate protection to the industry of manufacturing fire-bricks. We can make them to stand any degree of heat. For the first time I am dealing with a matter affecting an industry in the State of which I am a representative. We are manufacturing in Western Australia firebricks which stand any degree of heat. The Clackline Firebrick Company in that State has supplied the Golden Belt and also the Ravensthorpe Smelting Company, in the Phillips district, with firebricks which have been subjected to the highest degree of heat in connexion with the reduction of ores, and have stood the test satisfactorily. I am satisfied that the eastern States can produce them with equal success. </para>

                <para class="block">So much for the employment of these bricks in the Fremantle Smelting Works. Under the Federal Tariff of 1902 firebricks for reverberatory  furnaces were free, because it was thought that we could not produce bricks refractory enough to stand the intense heat of a reverberatory  furnace. The <inline font-style="italic">West Australian Mining, Building, and Engineering Journal</inline> of 8th inst. reports that Clackline firebricks are being used in a reverberatory  furnace in Western Australia. The manager of the Ravensthorpe Copper and Gold Mining Company, when manager of the Perseverance mine, gave evidence before the Tariff Commission that we could not manufacture firebricks of the quality necessary for such furnaces; but since taking charge of the Ravensthorpe Company's operations he has sent a repeat order to the Clackline Firebrick Company for a supply of its bricks. It has been proved that we can manufacture the best class of firebricks. Even those who formerly opposed the use of the local production are now adopting them, and I think we may fairly give adequate encouragement to their manufacture.

                    <para>The Phillips G. and C. M. Co. have commenced the erection of a reverberatory  furnace. This furnace will not take the place of the present blast furnace, but will be worked as an adjunct to the latter. It will treat fully 30 tons of ore daily. It is the intention of the management to utilize the reverberatory  furnace for the smelting and reduction of the finer ore and concentrates, thus relieving the blast furnace, which will be kept fully employed with the reduction of the larger ores for which the latter is specially adapted. It has also been decided to use West Australian-made firebricks. Orders have been placed for the necessary bricks to be supplied by the Clackline Firebrick Co. </para>

We have in this case further proof of the advantages which flow from the establishment of even a small industry capable of keeping within reasonable bounds  the price of the imported article, and we ought to give it the additional protection which it requires since it can supply the requirements of Australia with ease and satisfaction. </para>

It is clear, therefore, that either Western Australia or some of the other States have practically "collared" the whole of the firebrick trade of the Commonwealth. That being so, it seems to me that this is not a fitting time to ask for an increased duty. It is abundantly evident that under a 15 per cent, rate the industry is not in the slightest danger. </para>

                    <para>. - I had intended to submit a request that firebricks should be made free, but I will not do so, because a duty of 15 per cent pales into insignificance when compared with the total cost of importation. If there be one article in the Tariff which enjoys an enormous natural protection it is that of firebricks. A thousand of these bricks which in England cost <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 10s. will weigh about 3½ tons. They form about the <inline font-style="italic">most</inline> awkward cargo that can be put into a ship's hold, and, at the same time, owing to their brittleness, they require very careful handling. Even then considerable loss is sustained. Consequently, the natural protection which they enjoy is enormous. I have seen accounts relating to firebricks which showed that they had cost from.6d. to 8d. a piece to land here. This particular class of bricks has to be used in connexion with smelting operations, which require every economic advantage. If there were in Australia any lire clay' suitable for the manufacture of firebricks, I should defy any British or foreign brick to compete successfully with the locally made article. But, as a rule, the firebricks produced in Australia lack the quality which permits of their being cooled, without breaking into fragments. I trust that the present duty will be retained. </para>

                        <para>- The position must be. judged from the stand-point of the price of these firebricks landed at Kalgoorlie. The evidence tendered to the Tariff Commission was that imported firebricks cost from to <inline font-style="italic">£10</inline> per 1,000, whilst the locally produced firebricks cost only from £5 to <inline font-style="italic">£6</inline> per 1,000. Surely we ought to encourage the use of the. cheaper and equally serviceable article. It is a very significant fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Klug,</inline> to whom I referred earlier in the debate, despite his statement before the Tariff Commission that firebricks could not be made in Australia which would withstand a high temperature, has, now that he is in charge of the Ravensthorpe Gold and Copper Smelting Company, ordered a shipment of firebricks from Clackline for the reverberatory  furnace upon his mine. Under the 15 per cent. duty in the previous Tariff the importations of these articles amounted to£25,880 worth. It is proposed now to continue the same rate of duty ; but I as a protectionist am not satisfied with a rate that does not give sufficient protection to the local industry. </para>

(General Tariff) and  20  per cent. (United Kingdom). As the Tariff was first introduced these articles were dutiable at those rates, but another place, apparently under a misapprehension of -the facts, included them in this item and so made them free. I understand that in South Australia they can be produced. The request is in consonance with what the Government first proposed when the Tariff was introduced. </para>
