                        <para>- I desire to interrogate the Vice-President of the Executive Council in regard to a question asked last week about the production of the report of a Board appointed by the Minister of Defence. I must explain that as the result of questions asked, and representations made here, the Board was appointed to inquire into the manufacture of cartridge blanks. I was requested to give notice of the question, but the report was tabled in the other House on that day. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> whether he does not think that it is somewhat discourteous to the Senate that when a question has been raised here, and a senator has asked for a report to be laid upon the table, compliance is not made with his request, and the report is tabled in another place where the question has not been raised? </para>

                        <para>- I feel quite certain that no discourtesy was intended, and it will be my duty to inquire into the circumstances under which the report was tabled elsewhere. My honorable colleagues are most particular in laying papers on the table of the other House at practically the same time as they are tabled here, unless it should happen that the Senate is not sitting. But where a matter has been specially referred to in the Senate, I am sure that it was owing to an inadvertence that it was anticipated elsewhere in the way suggested by my honorable friend. I shall be only too glad to inquire of my honorable colleague as to the circumstances under which it was done. </para>

                            <para>- I thought that I made it clear that I was desirous that my honorable friend should wait until the Treasurer had delivered his Budget statement. He must be aware that in the circumstances I have indicated, the practice is to extend that courtesy to the Treasurer. He will see that if information in connexion with the Budget could be elicited, by dribs and drabs, immediately prior to its delivery, all interest in the Budget would necessarily fade, and, more than that, it would not be fair to the Minister. If my honorable friend can sec his way to wait, as some other senators have seen fit to do, until the Budget statement is delivered, I am sure that he will get full information on the point. In passing, however, I would remind my honorable friend that the monthly payments to the States practically have little reference to the exact proportions of the revenue to which they are entitled. For instance, a payment may be made this month in excess of the three-fourths share ; it may be made next month below that proportion ; but of course an adjustment takes place at the end of the year. That is the only way in which it can be done. </para>

                        <para>. - The opportunity afforded honorable  senators of looking into the provisions of this Bill, by- the adjournment last week of the debate upon it, has convinced me - as I venture to think it must have convinced every honorable senator - of the wisdom which prompted so large a section of this Chamber to request that adjournment. It appears to me that the measure stands very much in a class by itself. In the first place, it is a highly technical measure, and I, for one, am free to admit that in looking through its provisions I came across terms with which I am not familiar. Seeing that the Bill covers a very wide range, and that it is so highly technical, I assume that it will impose a very heavy responsibility upon honorable senators, and demand the utmost care which they can devote to its consideration. There is another reason why the Senate was more than justified in asking for time to study its details. In dealing with a matter like shipping, we have to recollect that we are dealing with something which involves more than merely Australian interests. Any Navigation Bill that we may pass must, incidentally at least, touch both Imperial and foreign interests, and to that extent the decisions at which we arrive will throw a very heavy responsibility upon us. There is another reason why the &#39;request for time to study the provisions of this measure was acceded to. We must all recognise that it touches very intimately the great producing interests of Australia. To my mind, much as we may aid by means of a Tariff our manufacturing interests, our producing interests must for many years to come stand out as the great interests of Australia. In turning our attention to shipping, we must always bear in mind that we are legislating, not merely for shipping and seamen, but that we may, if we are wise, lend distinct aid to a great body of producers throughout Australia. If, on the contrary, we seek to hamper shipping, we shall, to that extent, impose a handicap upon those engaged in our primary industries. All these considerations convince me that the little time asked for and granted by the Vice-President of the Executive Council to enable honorable senators to make themselves conversant with the provisions of this Bill, was time&#39; well spent. I make these remarks because I have noticed - and doubtless other honorable senators have noticed - that there was some little tendency on the part of our journalistic friends&#39; to jibe at the </para>

                    <para class="block">Senate because it was not prepared to proceed with this Bill last week. It is very easy to criticise, but I should like to know anybody who would have been prepared to cast a vote upon an important measure embodying more than 400 clauses, and dealing with so many interests, without preparation, unless he were willing to vote in a spirit of utter recklessness. </para>

                            <para>- Three Bills have been introduced into this Chamber dealing with navigation, and I believe that a fourth was drafted, but not submitted.. Yet I venture to say that there are certain facts which make the appearance of this measure premature at the present juncture. The very object of the Navigation Conference particularly was to ascertain if it was not possible to arrive at some unanimity upon matters in which Australian and Imperial interests were touched. . Above all, it was desirable that every opportunity should be afforded the negotiating parties to place fully and frankly before each other the objects which they had1 in view, and the objections which they might see to the proposals emanating from the other side. These negotiations are still proceeding, and I say &#39;it is eminently desirable that they should have been brought to a termination before we were asked to deal with this Bill. But seeing that these negotiations are still in progress, I am not going to suggest that we should lay this, measure .on one side. But I do suggest - and I ask the concurrence of the Senate to the proposition - that we should have the reply of the Imperial Government to the latest communication sent by the Commonwealth Government, before we allow this Bill to pass finally out of our control. We can at once proceed with the measure and carry it almost to its final1 stages, by which time we may expect to be in possession of the reply to which I have referred.. But if that reply is not then to hand, I maintain that it will be more in&#62;  keeping with the dignity of this Chamber if we allow the Bill to stand over till next session, or until we know what is the last word from the Imperial authorities upon this subject. It appears to me rather curious that the communications from the Imperial authorities, which are dated November of last year, were not replied to by the Commonwealth Government until the 15th June. Seeing that this matter is admitted by all sides to be one of such importance, there are ordinary rules of courtesy with regard ito correspondence which should apply to it ; and we might have assumed that the Government would have sent an earlier reply to the communications received from the. Home authorities. But something like six months were allowed to pass before a  ire.ply  was sent. When I look at the date, I am rather impelled to ask why it was that on the 15th June the Government awoke to the fact that the obligation was upon them to send a reply. Honorable senators will remember that about the 15th June the Government must have been confronted with the question of what business they were going to place before Parliament ; and it seems to me that only at that stage di3 they wake up to the fact that this matter required further consideration. I venture to say that it was simply because the Government had no other business to present to the Senate that they were led to think of the Navigation Bill and suddenly to determine to proceed with&#39; it. I ask honorable senators to bear that in mind. I have already affirmed (hat the Bill is premature; and my explanation of why if is now pre.sented to us is that the Government has no other business for the Senate to go on with. If I am wrong, I hope that the Vice-President of the Executive Council will tell us what other business he has to proceed with. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator speaks of his promise with regard to this Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> will correct me if I am wrong in saying that the Minister gave a promise many months or even years ago to proceed with the measure, but did not do so. It was delayed to enable the correspondence to proceed, and we should not have seen the Bill&#39; now were it not that -the Government were unable to place any other business before us for our consideration. Let me next deal with that phrase in the last minute from the Imperial Government that the Vice-President of the- Executive Council spoke of as being unfortunate. I rather think that it was. Whatever merits may, underlie the matter in debate, and which are largely of a legal character, I think that the phrase to which reference was made by the honorable senator is hardly one that is usual in diplomatic correspondence, and certainly is not one which should have been used at this stage in a communication between two members of a. great empire. But while my honorable friend was dealing with that part of the question, he talked a great deal about the rights of Australia. I would remind him that rights entail obligations. I fail to see, however, that he had any conception of the fact that if Australia is going to stand upon her purely legal rights in this matter, she must not complain if Great Britain does the same. If we are prepared to ignore altogether the doctrine of mutual interests there must be no complaint here if Great Britain acts in a similar manner. lt must be evident to those who have followed the proceedings of the Conference, and have read the correspondence with Great Britain, that it has been made abundantly clear that the Imperial Government have absolutely no desire to in any way interpose in regard to legislation dealing with Australian! ships and Australian interests. That has been made absolutely clear; and it is- not unreasonable that Great Britain should turn round and say, &#34; We ask you to extend to us the same consideration we are extending to you. Australians, with self-government, govern yourselves if you please, but do not attempt to govern us.&#34; I shall endeavour to show that in this Bill we have gone a little bit beyond that excellent principle. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly, but I am not aware that the Board of Trade man is attempting to legislate for Australia. We, however, do attempt, in this Bill, to do that which the Board of Trade has  never attempted to do. If I am wrong, I shall be only too pleased to be set right when we get the Bill into Committee. Let me quote resolution 9; and I do so because it gives us a starting point in dealing with the Bill, and also with the line adopted by the Government in its communications with the Home authorities. Resolution 9 was adopted by a Conference, which was attended by delegates from Australia and New Zealand, by representatives of the shipping interests at Home, of seamen&#39;s bodies, and of Board of Trade officials. That resolution seems to me to. be so plain that I did not think it possible to give to it anything but one interpretation. It reads as follows :  - </para>

                    <para class="block">That resolution seems to me, as I have said, to be abundantly clear. It means that the law which we were to pass was to apply to Australian ships, pure and simple, or to ships doing Australian coastal trade. But I was absolutely surprised, on reading the last despatch sent by the Prime Minister of Australia to find that what he says, in effect, is, that although that resolution was passed unanimously, that Australian law should apply only to Australian ships, it did not mean that at all. The interpretation which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> places upon it is that although the resolution says that the Australian law is to be applicable to Australian ships, it means some other ships as well. Now, my knowledge of the English language is, I admit, limited, but I thought that this resolution had been drafted in such a plain and simple form, that he who runs might read. Yet we find the Government introducing a Bill containing provisions in conflict with the resolution, turning round upon the resolution, and saying that the measure shall apply not only to Australian ships, but to other ships as well. </para>

                            <para>- There does not seem to be anything that it would be possible to introduce in a subsequent resolution that would modify this resolution. I did not think that any one would venture to say that it was capable of any other construction than that which I have placed upon it. That resolution was not only passed by the Conference, but it also came before our own Royal Commission. The Royal Commission accepted and passed it unanimously. I venture to say that when they did so, they accepted it without any reservation of any kind, and that they had no serious objection to it. That Royal Commission had upon it men well versed in the subject, and familiar with the proceedings at the Conference; and they would have taken exception to this resolution had they seen any objection to it. </para>

He says, in his last despatch, that it means not only Australian ships on the Australian register, not only ships engaged in the coasting trade, but it also means foreign-owned ships not in the coasting trade. I think I have made that clear. In other words, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> says that, although the resolution declares that the Australian law shall be applicable to certain classes of ships, it is to be applicable to all classes. </para>

                            <para>- I never thought that it would be possible for any one in or outside an Australian Government to attach to any resolution to which we have been a consenting party any doubt or hesitation. But in future they will certainly be justified in doing so. Let me show how the Government proceeded to give effect to the resolutions, although the negotiations were assumed to have been carried on with the desire to bring the Imperial and Commonwealth &#39; authorities together. The first Bill which was tabled in the Senate was the measure which the Conference considered, and in respect of which :the resolutions were arrived st. Honorable&#39; senators may perhaps be astounded when I Hell them that after the Conference had considered Bill No. 1, and arrived at some agreement, the Government deliberately made Bill No. 2 and Bill No. 4 worse, so far as Imperial interests were concerned, than was Bill No. 1. For instance, clause 8 of the Bill, which was submitted to the Conference, provided that that portion of the Bill - Division I. - should apply only to Australian registered ships, or ships engaged in the Australian coastal trade. But what do we find in this Bill? The Government have made that portion of the Bill apply also to British ships. It does seem to me a little curious that when every &#34;delegate went to the Conference, professing -a desire to arrive at uniformity, as far as possible, and resolutions were arrived at on a Bill and made the subject of subsequent negotiations, the Government should immediately turn .round and carry that &#34;Bill farther from uniformity. Let me shaw in one or two particulars where the &#34;present Bill considerably differs from Bill No. 1. </para>

                            <para>- The Navigation Commission made many recommendations, and so did the Navigation Conference, but that does not affect my point. On a Bill which provided that Division I. should apply to only Australian registered ships, the Conference arrived at a resolution that our legislation should be applicable to Australian ships or ships engaged in the coastal trade; and the Government, to show their <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> in the matter immediately turned roun&#39;d ana extended the operation of a portion of the Bill hitherto limited to our ships to British ships, and that, too, after a resolution had been arrived at - to which, by the way, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne was an assenting party - that our law should be limited to our own vessels. By altering Division I. and making it apply to all ships this Bill violates two resolutions arrived at by the Conference. It violates the one to which I have already referred. It also violates resolution 21. which T thought would have had the unanimous support of every man in Australia, and that is that no conditions shall be imposed on British ships mAre onerous than those imposed on foreign ships. Any condition imposes some restraint upon &#34;-he person who i-- compelled to observe it. Yet we are imposing the provisions of Division I. on British ships, but not on foreign ships. I ask why that is sought to be done? If it is good and sound, and we have a perfect right, legal and moral, to attempt to impose on British ships conditions which we will assume for the sake of argument are beneficial, surely we have a right to impose them on foreign ships ! </para>

                            <para>- Do any of these conditions represent obligations or responsibilities at all ? The answer is that the Government are now negotiating with regard to the carrying of a certificated officer on board a British ship. That, I submit, is an obligation, and by this Bill the Government are attempting to force British ships to observe it, but not foreign ones. That is making an unfavorable difference against the British ship-owner. </para>

                            <para>- They have taken exception to clause  35.  My honorable friend is right in saying that they did not take exception to clause  8.  But they did take exception to one clause in the division which deals with British shipping, and which comes to the same thing.  </para>

                            <para>- I am surprised at the Minister&#39;s statement, because, in the correspondence with the Imperial authorities recently tabled here, the Prime Minister is carrying on a contention with regard to one of the clauses which will apply to British ships.

Clause  23  says - </para>

                            <para>- We shall deal with the manning afterwards. What I contend is, that under clause  23,  a British shipmaster cannot take into his employment as an officer any person who is not duly certificated, but a foreign ship-master can, because this portion of the Bill does not apply to foreign ships. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend will pardon me, and I am not without authority in what I am saying, because the Board of Trade have pressed this view upon the Government, and the latter did&#39; not give to the former the answer which they gave to the Senate. The Prime Minister&#39;s answer to the Board was not the assurance which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has given <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the Senate. On the contrary, he said - &#34; We think it very unfair to allow a British-owned ship proceeding from &#39;Sydney to China to go out with an uncertificated1 officer while we compel an Australian registered ship to carry an officer with a certificate. If we allowed that, the effect would be to transfer the Australian ship to some other register.&#34; The Government did .not deny that it made a difference between the foreigner and the Britisher, but their answer was, &#34; We want to have equal&#39; conditions for Australian ships and British ships coming here.&#34; Let me paraphrase the argument, but not the words of the Prime Minister. If it is manifestly unfair to allow a British ship to go out without a certificated officer, when Ave compel an Australian ship to carry a certificated officer, it is equally unfair to an Australian ship to allow a foreigner to go out without a certificated officer, and it is  doubly/  unfair to a British ship. The best answer I can give to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> is the reference I have made to the Prime Minister&#39;s answer to the Board of Trade. The latter did not suggest that there was any provision in the Merchant Shipping Act which dragged in the foreign ship. What he said straight out was that in fairness to our local ships we cannot extend this privilege or release from obligation the British ships. But that leaves out of view the fact that by imposing clause 23 on British ships and not on foreign ones, the Government have violated resolution 21 of the Conference, which provided, at any rate, for equal conditions as between British and foreign ships. </para>

                    <para class="block">Act, and that having worked well in the past in some places it may be assumed that it will work well here. They are merely references to some provision which is designed, perhaps, to carry out the same purpose. Even if Australia is not prepared to give some little preference to Great Britain in this matter, I do ask honorable senators to join with me in saying that no law we pass shall make an invidious and unfair distinction between British and foreign ships to the advantage of the latter. Looking through the measure I ask myself why we should exhibit so tender a feeling for foreign shipping. I do not believe that it is due to any lack of loyalty on the part of the Government. But there must be some reason for it, and I can conceive only of one. We know that in the last resort no law is worth the paper on which it is written unless there is a force behind sufficient to give it effect. If we pass laws here which are distasteful to foreign countries, who is to give them effect ? We are aware that there is a power which can give effect to our law against British shipping because, when necessary, the Imperial Courts themselves become part of the machinery for carrying it out. We are to this extent, I think, imposing upon the magnanimity and good nature of the Mother Country. We pass laws affecting her shipping because we feel that she will not resent it, but we hesitate to pass similar laws against German shipping because Kaiser Wilhelm might view the matter in a different light. </para>

                            <para>- I wish it to be made perfectly clear that Australia is in a peculiar position in regard to legislation  of this kind. If our legislation affecting foreign interests brought about any conflict, what would happen ? To whom do we look now when an Australian ship receives unfair treatment abroad? What happened only quite recently when a ship belonging, I think, to Burns, Philp, and Company, preferred a claim against the German Government? To whom did we look to secure consideration for that claim ? We did not look to anything which this Parliament might do, or even to anything which might be done by the Seamen&#39;s Union, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator, Guthrie</inline> is so able a leader, but to the Imperial authorities. I say that just as. we look to the Imperial Government to gi.ve effect to our laws and to secure our interests abroad, so we should consider that there is an obligation upon us not to pass any legislation which we can see is calculated to increase the responsibilities of Great Britain in her relations with foreign countries. I have said that Division I. of this Bill is limited to British ships. If its provisions are good, and we have a moral and legal right to impose them, we should impose therm upon all ships. If that be not considered desirable, and personally I do not think it is, we should revert to the form in which these provisions were originally introduced, and should limit them to Australian ships or ships doing business on the Australian coast. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, I should regard such cases as coming properly within this division of the Bill. What I desire is that the Commonwealth should not go beyond its proper domain as a self-governing community. The privilege of self-government is a very great one indeed, and just as we appreciate that privilege we should be prepared to recognise that other communities have an equal right to govern themselves in their own way. Australia is not quite big enough vet to attempt to govern the world. There is one reason why I refer to this matter perhaps at some length. Australia has a very peculiar interest, especially so far as its shipping is concerned, in trying to live on good terms with everybody. Perhaps our foreign shipping is not to-day a very big factor, but we all hope that it will extend as time goes on. I, for one, look forward to the time when the Australian flag will be seen upon many waters. It is extremely desirable that where we can do so, we should preserve unanimity with the Home authorities as to the law to be imposed. This is not a question affecting merely British interests, but Australian interests as well. I am contending for uniformity in the interests of Australian shipping. In this connexion, I cannot do better than read a quotation from, the inaugural address delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd-George</inline> to the Shipping Conference in London. Speaking of Colonial shipping, he said-  lt is also to their interest that uniformity should be secured. Colonial shipping is in its infancy ; I do not see why in the future it should not claim its share of the international shipping of the. world, and naturally it is in the interests of Colonial shipping that you should procure now, so far as it is practicable, uniformity in the regulations imposed on the shipping of the world. Some success has been, achieved in securing international uniformity with regard to two or three matters of very great importance, and I am not sure that we are not on the eve of securing some kind of international uniformity with regard to load-line. The great maritime countries of the world are approximating to the British rule in this respect. </para>

                    <para class="block">The right honorable gentleman seems to me to have there laid down a sound rule for our guidance, and to have shown that uniformity is to be desired not only in British, interests, but in our own also. If it is annoying to the master of a British ship to have to conform to certain rules and regulations in London, and when he comes out here to find that he is under some new law,, it must be equally harassing to the master of an. Australian ship when the voyage is. reversed. A master of a ship is sometimes, compelled to depart from his original voyage, and to turn here and there, and it: must be most harassing to him to be confronted with the necessity of observing a?, different set of conditions at every port he visits. </para>

                            <para>- There are differences, and it is the object of Federation to&#62; wipe them out, but I am suggesting the desirability, so far as possible, of arriving at legislation uniform with that of Great Britain. There is one advantage which I almost overlooked which appears to have been gained from the delay which has taken place over this measure. It seems to me that the Government are learning, if slowly, the lesson taught by the recent High Court decisions. They are learning that we have to move within a written Constitution, and that it is not desirable for us, merely because we wish to do something, to assume that we are at liberty to do it. The Government should learn the difference between working under a written Constitution and the position in &#39;Great Britain, where the only Constitution recognised is the law which is passed by the Imperial Parliament. One of the alterations which we find in this Bill is proposed with the distinct purpose of avoiding conflict with State interests. I congratulate the Government upon that. I hope that the time has gone by when we shall have any more of what I may call &#34;try on&#34; legislation. We have passed certain legislation here which many honorable senators who voted for it admitted frankly was of doubtful constitutionality, but which they were prepared to &#34; try on.&#34; I hope that the time when such legislation will be submitted has gone by, and that before we are asked to pass any laws it shall be abundantly clear that they are such as&#39; we are competent to pass. Returning to the Bill, it seems to me that our task would have been very much simplified if the Government had confined themselves to the resolutions approved of unanimously by the Navigation Conference. With regard to those on which no agreement was arrived at, it is a very different matter. Where unanimity had been reached by British representatives, by three gentlemen from Australia - all in political life - and -by representatives from New Zealand, I think the Government would have been well advised if they had followed the decisions arrived at. </para>

                            <para>- Then I must regret either that my voice is failing or that the honorable senator&#39;s hearing is not as good as it used to be. I have referred him to clause 23, and to the fact that the Government propose the imposition of a law upon Australian and British ships, while at the same time exempting foreign ships from that law. I wish to lay down one or. two propositions as indicative of the way I approached this question. I think it desirable that we should limit our legislation as far as possible to our own shipping, and to what transpires within our own jurisdiction. Next, I say, with regard to our own shipping, that where the matter is unimportant we should adopt the British law for the sake of uniformity. I say, further, that throughout the Navigation Bill we should make it clear whether its provisions, apply to all shipping, or to ships on the Australian register or engaged in the coasting trade, and that, as in the later clauses, where the provisions are confined to classes of ships, we should say clearly to which of them. In going through the Bill, I am in grave doubt - a doubt which is shared by people in the shipping world - as to what classes of ships are intended to be covered by certain of its provisions. It will be admitted that that is not at all desirable. </para>

                            <para>- It will be my duty, in Committee, to .give the Vice-President of the Executive Council several instances. I am glad to have heard his interjection, because I take it as assenting to the position I have laid down, that if there is any vagueness or ambiguity in the Bill, he will join with me in trying to remove it, so that any one may at once see whether a clause in the measure is intended to apply to all shipping, or only to some shipping. The honorable senator asked me to give him an instance, and curiously enough, the next line in my notes reminds me of one. I refer to the question of what constitutes seaworthiness, and to clause 204 of Division VI. This division applies to all ships. In clause 185 it is provided that this part of the Bill shall apply to all ships, British or foreign. Another portion of the Bill provides that the manning scale shall apply only to Australian-registered ships, or ships engaged in the Australian coasting trade. </para>

                    <para class="block">Then clause 204 provides that a ship shall not go to sea unless due regard has been paid to the number and qualifications of the crew, including officers, and in every other respect fitted to encounter the ordinary perils of the voyage then entered upon. I ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council to say how it is proposed to determine whether a ship is fit to encounter the perils of an ordinary voyage. Is the manning scale and the ship&#39;s equipment to enter into the determination of the question ? The answer must be that they are, and then I ask at once, what standard is to be adopted - the Imperial, the Board of Trade, or our own? This peculiar state of affairs might arise unless we make it clear to what ships the various conditions must apply. We have an Australian standard for Australian ships, and the master of a ship coming to an Australian port with a crew held to be under the manning scale might be proceeded against and penalized, whilst another ship alongside of him might be permitted to go to sea with exactly the same class of ship and the same crew. Are we to proceed against the master of the latter ship ? I am asking how clause 204 is to be interpreted, and whether in this particular case it is proposed to determine the question of seaworthiness according to the Australian or the Imperial standard. Honorable senators will agree that these matters cover extremely difficult and complex questions, and deserve all the thought we can give them. It is not at all desirable to assume that because a certain portion of the Bill may be said to apply to one class of ships, there is not a chance that another portion may be quoted to complicate matters. </para>

I must apologize to the Vice-President of the Executive Council for having failed to make myself understood, but I thought I was careful to lay it down that I was seeking to limit our legislation to our own affairs. I am merely pointing out that there is an ambiguity in many of these clauses, inasmuch as it is not clear whether they are to apply in their entirety to all shipping, or merely to our own shipping.

                            <para>- Will it be passed in such a form that under clause 204 we can detain a British ship because she is not manned according to the Australian scale? I say that we ought to make it absolutely clear what portions of the. measure will apply to British ships, what portions to foreign ships, and what portions to Australian ships, so as to prevent complications arising subsequently. Everybody will then be. in a position to understand what we intend. </para>

                    <para>That resolution was also approved by the Navigation Commission appointed by the Commonwealth Government, and it seems to me to provide a plain and simple procedure. We should make our manning scale apply only to Australian ships. But while the Bill under consideration stipulates that the manning scale shall be obligatory only upon Australian ships, under the definition of &#34;seaworthiness.&#34; the Government may refuse to allow any British ship to leave our ports unless she is manned according to the Australian standard. In other words, they will be able to accomplish indirectly what they do not attempt directly. What is the standard of seaworthiness ? </para>

                            <para>- I admit that &#34; seaworthiness &#34; covers a hundred and one things. But one of those things relates to the number of the crew of any vessel. Again I ask, &#34; What standard are we to set up ? &#34; What portion of this Bill is to apply to British and foreign ships, and what portion to Australian ships? Surely we ought to make its provisions so clear that there can be no doubt as to the class of ships that we intend to be covered by them. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> statement is correct, British ships must be prepared when they enter our ports to put on additional hands to bring the crews up to the Australian standard. </para>

It means that after all the British mercantile marine cannot be such a bad place, seeing that so many foreigners seek employment in it - that they leave their own flag to accept work under the British flag. </para>

                            <para>- No. Persons generally go &#34;broke&#34; upon sheep-runs, and go to sea afterwards. This Bill provides that ships shall be surveyed every six months, whilst the New Zealand law - and New Zealand, I take it, is just as progressive a country as is Australia - stipulates for survey only once in twelve months, which is also the law of England. Apparently we are attempting to create work without any compensating advantage. Can the Government show that it is necessary to provide for the survey of vessels every six months? Of course, I am not speaking of vessels which have been in collision, or which have sustained an accident of any description which might render survey necessary. I am speaking of ships which pass through only the ordinary routine, and I venture to say that in such cases the Government cannot show that a survey is necessary every six months. Before passing from clause  201,  I desire to draw attention to the very unsatisfactory method&#39; that has been adopted in making what I assume is .a concession to the Board of Trade. Clause 201, after stipulating for a survey every six months, goes on to sa\&#39;, that the Minister, if satisfied that any British or foreign steam-ship has substantially complied with the requirements of the Bill, may give a certificate which will have the same effect as one given upon survey under this measure. That provision appears to be all right, but such a jumble occurs in succeeding provisions, that it seems as if the Government have been torn between two minds. Clause 201 recognises the validity of Board of Trade certificates, and stipulates that where the Minister has reason to think that anything has happened to render a survey justifiable, he shall have power to 0 der it. Everybody will agree with that clause. But, unfortunately, a later provision appears to contradict it. In one case, the Board of Trade certificate is to stand good, unless the Minister has reason to move in the matter, whilst under another portion of ;.he Bill, the Minister has apparently to take it for granted that something is wrong with that certificate, and has power to grant an exemption from survey. Sub-clause 2 of clause 201 reads - </para>

                    <para class="block">That appears to me to reverse the procedure for which provision is previously made. In the one case the Board of Trade certificate is to be regarded as good, unless challenged by the Minister; in the other it is assumed to be bad, unless the Minister grants an exemption. It does not appear to me to be necessary that every vessel which enters Australian ports should have to approach the Minister to obtain a certificate of exemption. Let me now turn to another portion of the Bill, which  1  am sure will prove of considerable interest to~~ honorable senators. I refer to the provisions which deal with the condition* under which seamen shall work. Without approving of any detail, I venture to say that no portion of this measure will receive such sympathetic treatment as that to which I am alluding. The portions dealing with the health and the sanitary surroundings under which seamen shall move, is entirely in accord with much of the legislation that we have passed dealing with land industries. It represents the trend of modern legislation. The time has gone by when anybody can ask, &#34; Am I ni)- brother&#39;s keeper&#34;? Seeing that we have enacted reasonable legislation to  those engaged in land avocations, we may well extend similar legislation to seamen. Much of this legislation has been defended upon the grounds of humanity, but I claim that it can be defended upon quite other grounds. It seems to me that it has a sound economic basis. If by any law that we pass, we can prolong the lives of our workers, or extend the period of their productive capacity, we, by that law, add to the wealth of the community. For that reason, we can approach with sympathetic hearts any proposals which will insure healthier conditions to those who follow the occupation of sailormen. And there is a special reason why the sailor has claims upon our sympathies. He carries on his occupation free from our observation. Those who work in factories and in other industries ashore are more or less furnished with opportunities for making their condition known, and are open to be observed. We all know something about factories and workshops, and the way in which people are employed in them. But few of us see the sailor at his work, or have opportunities of observing how he lives on board his- ship. And it is because he is so remote from observation, and because of the particular perils of his occupation, that he may make reasonable claims on &#39;our sympathies in dealing with these clauses. But in relation to the manning scale laid down in this Bill, I am compelled to join issue with the Government. There is a schedule to the measure which lays down the scale of manning to be observed in Australia. The objection that I take to these clauses is one that was put before the Commission, and has been laid before honorable senators by those entitled to speak with authority on the subject. The objection to any fixed manning scale is that different vessels require different numbers of men, quite apart from their tonnage. A ship fore and aft rigged requires a different complement &#187;f men, although she may be of the same tonnage, as a ship that is square-rigged; and the same applies to different classes of engines, boilers, and machinery, as well as to firing facilities. AH these things make it impossible to have a hard and fast manning scale. The Vice-President of the Executive Council, when introducing the Bill, said that these objections had been answered by the proposed appointment of a Committee. I venture to think that instead of being answered they have been admitted. The word &#34;admission ; &#39; . seems to me to be better and more applicable to the case. The Government have seen, and admit, the inequalities . which would result from the -adoption of any fixed scale ; and, therefore, they propose to appoint a Committee. But, having gone so far, they seem to have become frightened at their own audacity, and to have stopped there, because they render the Committee practically inoperative. It is to be merely an . advisory Committee. There is absolutely no obligation on the Minister to be guided by its recommendations. The one obligation upon the Minister is that he shall not determine the number of the crew of any particular vessel until he has been advised by the Committee. But, beyond that, the Minister -can do exactly as he pleases. I am bound to point out one serious objection to having :a hard and fast manning scale, and I do so with the view of suggesting an enlargement of the powers of this Committee. </para>

I venture to say &#39;that Parliament will have more control over the Committee than over the Minister, judging from what has transpired since this Parliament has been established. We all know - and there is no need to mince the fact - that, although a Minister may do wrong, party considerations frequently prevent punishment being meted out to him. That is one of the evils of party government; although in saying so much I must add that I do not know of a better form of government. I wish to show one evil which will arise from leaving this manning scale in the Bill. The operation of it will be this : It will cause ships to remove from the Australian register and take refuge upon registers of countries that have not such a scale. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend surprises me. I did not think that there was a man in Australia who would not welcome a large accession to the number of ships registered in Australia. To my mind, it would be a great thing indeed to have a larger number of ships upon the Australian register. It would- be to some extent a guarantee that they would observe Australian conditions; and that is surely not an unimportant consideration. </para>

                            <para>- I am afraid that my honorable friend does not see the tangible advantage arising from what I may call an intangible advertisement. From that point of view alone, it is desirable to have upon the Australian register every ship engaged in the Australian trade. One of the reasons urged by the Government as to why they cannot comply with the conditions of the Board of Trade is that, if they did so. our ships would transfer from our register to the British. If that is a sound argument to advance with regard to certain provisions in the Bill, it must also be a sound argument to apply to the manning provisions. I  am not asking for an inadequate manning scale, but if we have a scale which bears harshly and inequitably upon certain ships, they will undoubtedly leave the Australian register. </para>

But I venture to say that there is a third party to consider, and that is the general public. It must occur occasionally to the general public that the fact that they have to pay is the reason only why our legislation has been called into existence. </para>

                            <para>- There is no necessity to raise the question of under-manning. No one has suggested that that should be allowed. But I do not wish to help to pass a law to compel a ship to carry a single man more than is necessary for her working. There is no profit to Australia and none to the seamen in having idle men on board ship. I am trying to devise the best method of ascertaining the necessary complement of every ship. The Bill lays down a standard, and says, &#34; We do not expect you to work under this scale; you can wipe it off the slate, and we will appoint a Committee to say what is a fair complement for every ship to carry.&#34; But then the Minister comes along and can ignore the complement fixed by the Committee if he likes. It seems to me to be very much better to enlarge the powers and scope of the Committee and to dispense with the Minister altogether. This power of the Minister leads me to another point, and that is the powers conferred by this Bill on the Minister by way of regulation. There is too much legislation by regulation in Commonwealth Acts, and it seems to me that the tendency is to increase the evil. Whether it is caused by those who are responsible for framing Bills being unable to suggest a remedy, or provisions adequate to the circumstances, I do not know; but I do know that Parliament is becoming less and less responsible for legislation, and is throwing more and more responsibility upon, the Minister - which really means the permanent heads of Departments. 1 do not know whether honorable senators are consenting parties to the fact that we are shirking our responsibilities and throwing upon other people duties or obligations that rightly belong to us. </para>

                            <para>- I hope that it is a feature which we shall endeavour to remove from&#39; this Bill. We can admit at once that there must be some things which are better dealt with by regulation ; but when it comes to fundamental principles I maintain that it is wrong that any party should be called, upon to legislate except that body which was appointed by the Constitution to do this work. There is another feature of the Bill which strikes me as being particularly wrong. In this measure we are proposing, to invest the Minister with the powers of a Court&#39;. We have on several occasions before given him the powers of a Parliament which will enable him to legislate, but this is the first time we have given the Minister the powers of a Court. </para>

                            <para>- I made mv statement with those Acts, in my memory&#39;. I repeat that this is the first time we have given the Minister the power to act as a Court in civil disputes between two individuals. Under the Customs Act, when am importer and the Crown come into conflict, the Minister is intrusted with powers which are necessary to protect the revenues of the Crown. But under this Bill we say that in disputes between individuals for money owing from one to another, the parties need&#39; not go into Court, but the case can be dealt with by the Minister. I hope that Parliament will never place in the hands of one man, outside the publicity of a Court, powers which should only belong to a Court- </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator knew as much about the shearing of Australia as I do he would not make that statement. Not only are the sheds not taking men on the whole time, but for months ahead they have their &#39;boards picked. I want to deal with another matter. It is not, perhaps, a big one, in view of the state of our own law, but I think that it discloses a hesitancy on the part of the Government to meet- the Imperial authorities, even on unimportant points. With regard to our regulations, the Board of Trade had asked, and the Commission and the Conference had approved of, three months&#39; notice of any change of regulation being given. One would have thought that that was a reasonable request.- Seeing that a ship might leave London on a round voyage, and on arrival here find herself under a different set of regulations from that which had prevailed on her previous visit, in the circumstances three months is surely not a long notice to give. After the Commission and the Conference had approved of it, one would have thought that the Government would&#34; have readily fallen in with the suggestion. But instead of doing that, their answer was that probably the Board of Trade were not aware of our Statutory Rules Act, which provides for notice to be given. It was not a frank and ready willingness to meet the Imperial Government. It is quite true that we have a law which provides for no less than sixty days&#39; notice to be given. The difference between that and three months is so slight that one would have thought that the Government, without any hesitancy would have said: &#34;Yes; we will provide in the bill itself that a regulation shall not operate until three months&#39; notice has been given.&#34; It is a little matter I admit, but J. think that the Government would have acted very much more in . accord with the best traditions of Australia if they had yielded readily to the Imperial authorities on that point. I desire now to say a few words about what is bound to be one of the contentious points of the Bill, and that is the coasting trade. I do not dispute for a moment - nobody can - that Australia has an absolute right to determine what ships shall participate in its coasting trade. But the question which arises in my mind is&#39; how best to exercise the right. It does not follow that because we have a legal right to do something, it is wise and judicious to exercise it. I feel compelled to question the wisdom of the course proposed in the Bill. I have already referred to the great importance to our producers of having ample shipping facilities. It seems to me that every restriction we place upon our ships plying round the coast is in some way or other sure to rebound as a handicap to our producers. It has been said that the attempt to secure the Australian trade to Australian ships and Australian seamen is a natural sequence of the protective policy which has been adopted. I have to admit that when I first heard the argument it rather appealed to me ; it struck me as having something, at any rate, of logic to support it, but after I came to look into the matter, I thought that I could see a full and effective answer. When we were dealing with the Tariff, we certainly imposed a number of duties, but we also left a very large free list. Why did we leave certain items on the free list, and why did many protectionists vote in that direction? They said: &#34;Whilst we have a protectionist policy for Australia, we still think that the benefits which will be incurred by the duty on this industry or that industry will be more than outweighed by the disadvantages on certain other industries.&#34; Similarly it appears to me that any advantage which we might give to the Australian ship - and I think that it will be very small - will be far more than outweighed by the tremendous handicap which will be imposed on Australian traders and producers. Seeing that I have spoken of the advantage to Australian shipping as being small, it may be said that it cannot therefore follow that the handicap on the other classes I refer to will be great, but I think I can show that it will be. First of all, the advantage of securing to Colonial shipping all the trade we can will, I think, be very small indeed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> said the other day that he had no figures available to show what it was, but I think that it will be small. Therefore, in the remarks I am making, I am not speaking solely of the quantity of trade which maybe deflected, but I have a much more serious matter in my mind. The evidence given before the Navigation Commission, and I think the evidence of our daily experience, shows that there is something very much in the nature of a bond or trust existing among local ship-owners. If that Commission did nothing else, it made it abundantly clear that this combination did exist, and that the effect of its existence was certainly to restrict trade. I think that there is an admission in the Bill that it exists because it makes rebates under certain conditions illegal. If we give to people, or a class of people, a monopoly, it is idle to be surprised if afterwards they take advantage of it. To-day, the shipowners are in a flourishing position. This cannot by any stretch of imagination be called a strangled industry. I suppose that in Australia there is no industry which is reaping a larger profit or doing better. The ship-owners cannot come to us with any <inline font-style="italic">ad misericordiam</inline> appeal ; they cannot look to us for sympathy : they cannot tell us that unless they get the additional assistance their industry will be closed up. We all know that their business to-day is a sound, flourishing, and expanding one. But they have shown a great tendency to take advantage of any opportunities which are presented to them. The Senate would be ill-advised, would be doing something distinctly detrimental to our producers and traders, if it turned round and placed the ship-owners, who have shown no consideration to the general public, in a position to carry out freely the policy which they have hitherto adopted. It is for that reason that I shall vote against anything which would prevent even the present limited competition. That is in my opinion the only means by which we can hope to put down the monopoly. The Government, I notice, have recently instituted some prosecutions under the latest Anti-Trust Act. I shall say nothing regarding them until a final decision is given. If we confer a privilege or monopoly on ship-owners it seems to me absolutely idle to expect anything else than that they will take advantage of it to the last penny. Apart from that reason the Bill itself, I think, shows the folly of the coastal trade provisions, for it no sooner lays it down that we shall keep our coasting trade to ourselves than it makes two bad breaks and provides means by which that portion of the law can be torn up. The first one, of course, is made in the interests of that much-petted State, Western Australia. </para>

                            <para>- No doubt my honorable friends from that State had something much more interesting to them - their railway. Having provided that our coastal trade shall be limited to Australian ships, this portion of the Bill goes on to say that the Governor- General may exempt -  (a)British ships carrying mails to or from the Commonwealth under contract with the Government of the Commonwealth ; or </para>

                    <para class="block">Those two exemptions are rather peculiar. One can understand a power being taken there to provide an exemption for a special class. But the point I wish to emphasize now is that there are two classes of exemptions. Let me paraphrase them in this way - &#34; The Government may by order declare that the carrying of passengers between ports in Australia by the Orient Steam Navigation Company shall be legal; but when they are carried by the Peninsular and </para>
                    <para class="block">Oriental Company it shall not be legal.&#34; In the previous Bill there was a distinct exemption made in favour of ships trading from Western Australia to Adelaide. There is no earthly reason why an exception should be made in favour of any State. But the point was raised that the constitutionality of the provision might be challenged, and I assume that it was because of a fear that the challenge would be successful that the wording of this clause has been altered. But I venture to say that this same evil exists, that under the powers of exemption it is possible to give preferential treatment to different States, to extend to one State a consideration denied to another. </para>

Surely it may be said that Western Australia is given privileges and opportunities which are denied to Queensland ! The reason assigned for making the exception is that Western Australia has not got a railway. Has Tasmania got a railway ? </para>

I want to see that this privilege, if given to Western Australia, is extended to every State which makes use of the big ocean liners. I pass from that now, and would like to say that if there are to be any exemptions at all under the clauses relating to coasting trade - if they are to remain as they are, and I hope they will not - they should be in favour of British ships as against foreign ships. In the case of a certain class of ships engaged in our coasting trade, such as the German boats, which are subsidized on the understanding that they shall not carry away certain of our produce, I think it would not be unfair or unreasonable to deny to them any advantages they might derive from participation in our coasting trade. </para>

My main point is that if there is to be any exemption under the clauses relating to the coasting trade, it shall be made in favour of British ships. </para>

                            <para>- I was just going to say that I hope that no attempt will be made to discriminate by passing the measure in such a form as to permit of the favouring of one company as against another. Honorable senators know what they desire, and they will consult their own interests if they set it out in the Bill, and will not leave the matter to be dealt with by the Government, to be possibly the subject of some miserable intrigue in a Minister&#39;s office. I have spoken at greater length than I intended, and should, perhaps, apologize for the time I have taken. My only excuse is the tremendous importance of the measure, and the many complex questions with which it deals. I have intimated briefly the points which seem to me of major interest, or which invite criticism. I shall only add that at the Committee stage I shall look for the assistance which those who, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> are familiar with the subject can lend. The information which the honorable senator will be in a position to give the Senate will be more readily accepted, and more valuable if submitted - I do not like to use the term - without exaggeration. I was at a loss for a happier word to use, but if the honorable senator will submit his information in a plain and businesslike manner, it will assist honorable senators to solve many questions which, as at present buried in this Bill, are absolutely mysteries to us. </para>

                        <para>. - There is, I am sure, only one feeling in this Chamber as to the importance of this Bill. Every member of the Senate is thoroughly seized with the importance of questions relating to navigation, not only because they refer to Australia, but because the shipping of the Empire is one of the greatest of British assets. It is an industry in which British enterprise shines to very great advantage, and outclasses that of almost all the rest of the world put together. We have hap three different Navigation Bills brought before -us - one in 1904, another last year, and the third this year. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has pointed out, we have had a Navigation </para>

                            <para>- It is quite true, but is &#39;it necessary, when one is offered a courtesy, to say, &#34;I do not want your courtesy, because I am entitled to it &#34; ?&#39; The whole, thing is a regrettable instance of the inability of the Australian Government to rise to the true level of Australian nationhood. I direct the attention of the Senate to the fact that up to the present time there remain between fifteen and twenty points in connexion with which the Board of Trade and the Australian Government are not at one. Yet we are proceeding with this Bill. Before we met, it was understood throughout Australia that the Bill was not to be proceeded with, and it ought not to be proceeded with, while so much remains unsettled. Let me point out to honorable senators that there are some clauses, and notably the very important clauses dealing with coastal shipping, which have not yet been submitted to the British Government at all. They are unaware of the revolutionary changes which are proposed in this Bill with respect to the coasting&#39; trade. Full as the measure is of matters of grave importance, the clauses which deal with the coasting trade of Australia are ot the first consequence. Last week I asked for information under several detailed heads, and the Minister was unable to give me any. The honorable senator did not, in his speech, volunteer any information to show why this revolutionary change for the building up of a monopoly in- our coasting trade was necessary. He did not show that the shipping engaged in our coastal trade was being wiped out, or that the companies engaged in it were not paying dividends. He did not show that over-sea ships were carrying cargo from port to port on our coasts, nor did he give any details as to the number of passengers which, no doubt, they do carry between Australian ports. </para>

                            <para>- I &#39;believe that is true, but the Minister gave the Senate no information and no reason for the revolutionary changes sought to be made. On this question it is very interesting to call to mind an extract from a speech made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> at the Colonial Conference, held in London in 1902. He said, referring to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seddon</inline> - </para>

                        <para>It is the fact as he stated, incidentally quoting from an American senator, that the American coastwise trade is exclusively reserved for the American shipping, and the coastwise trade is interpreted as trade between America and her Possessions, trade, for instance, between America and Samoa ; and, of course, if we are to adopt a similar principle it would make it impossible for trade between Great Britain, the Colonies of Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, and the Cape to be carried in .any but British vessels ; now that, of course, was the old principle of the navigation laws ; the navigation laws were repealed, I understand, largely at the instance of the Colonies. I believe it was complaints from the Colonies that competition was interfered with by our laws, which was the prime mover in the repeal of that legislation. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">It is a very remarkable thing that the British Government, some fifty years ago, should have removed the old navigation laws, very largely at the instigation of the Colonies, and that now certain of the Colonies should seek, on their own account and on their own coasts, to enact a measure of this kind. Tn the Bill brought before us last year it was proposed to specifically exempt certain vessels trading to Australia. But in this Bill the Government . contemplate making a decidedly new departure from that course. It is now intended that these provisions shall be brought into operation only in the case of ships carrying coloured crews. The legislation which is now proposed in regard to our coastal trade, is in direct opposition to all the views held by free-traders. At present, however, I pass by that consideration. I merely wish to draw attention to the fact that it is also very largely antagonistic to the views entertained by protectionists. We know that when the Tariff was under consideration, we decided, again and again, that certain articles should be admitted free, or that very low duties -should be levied upon them, because otherwise, great interests would be seriously affected. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has already pointed out that the producing interests of Australia are so great, and depend so largely upon the shipping facilities granted to them, that we should do everything in our power to encourage shipping in .our waters, and nothing to discourage it. We cannot impose a burden upon shipping without it reacting upon our producers in the form pf increased&#39; freights and charges. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator says, &#34; Let us own the ships.&#34; I&#39; wonder where the money is to come from. Some of the new vessels belonging to the Orient Company will cost as much as ^375,000 each. The aggregate value of the shipping engaged in the Australian trade is many millions sterling. Even from the point of view of protectionists, I argue that it is desirable that we should provide  our producers with every facility for getting their produce to the markets of the world. But above the free-trade, and_ the protectionist view, there is the Empire view. </para>

                    <para>It is quite clear, therefore, that the Government hold strong views upon this matter, and that the issue of any order which they will be empowered to make under this Bill w;ll be determined by those views. Tn other words, if companies like the Peninsular and Orient, and the Nippon Yusen  Kaisha, carry  coloured labour on their vessels,  they  will be excluded from our -coasting trade. That, I contend, would be a grave offence to the Empire spirit. In this connexion, I should like to read -what took place at the Navigation Conference, which was held in England.

                        <para>It is unnecessary for me to go into the question of whether Lascars, or European are the better sailors. That has been thoroughly well thrashed out in another Committee, the report nf which, I think, you have before you. But I would strongly urge this Conference not to adopt a resolution which is worded as this resolution is worded. It is a great reflection upon 200 or 300 millions of the King&#39;s subjects, who are just as loyal, just as law-abiding, just as industrious, just as sober, and just as good citizens as we are ourselves. I should like to point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Belcher</inline> that if this resolution is adopted it would place vessels belonging to Australia under a serious disability. No vessel belonging to Australia, according to what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Belcher</inline> said, would be able to go to Calcutta, Singapore, or China except with a European crew. </para>

He then quoted the following - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>We quite sympathize with the determination of the white inhabitants of these Colonies which are in comparatively close proximity to millions and hundreds of millions of Asiatics, that there shall not be an influx of people alien in civilization, alien in religion, alien in customs, whose influx, moreover, would most seriously interfere with the legitimate rights of the existing labour population. An immigration of this kind must, I quite understand, in the interests of the Colonies, be prevented at all hazards, and we shall not offer any opposition to the proposals intended with that object, but we ask you also to bear in mind the traditions of the Empire which makes no distinction in favour of, or against race or colour ; and to exclude, by reason of their colour, or by reason of their race, all  Her  Majesty&#39;s Indian subjects, or even all Asiatics would be an act so offensive to those peoples that it would be most painful, I am quite certain, to  Her  Majesty to have to sanction it. Consider what has been brought to your notice during your visit to this country. The United Kingdom owns as its brightest and greatest dependency that enormous Empire of India, with 300,000,000 of subjects who are as loyal to the Crown as you are vourselves, and among them there are hundreds&#39; and thousands of men who are every whit as civilized as we are ourselves, who are, if that is anything, better born in the sense that they have older traditions and older families, who are men of wealth, men of cultivation, men of distinguished valour, men who have brought whole armies and placed them at the service of the Queen, and have in times of great difficulty and trouble - such for instance on the occasion of the Indian Mutiny - saved the Empire by their loyalty. I say, you&#39; who have seen all this, cannot be willing to put. upon those men a slight which I think is absolutely unnecessary for your purpose, and which would be calculated to provoke ill-feeling, discontent, irritation, and would be most unpalatable to the feelings, not only of  Her  Majesty the Queen, but of all her people. </para>

                    <para class="block">I think that those extracts in themselves are very valuable, giving the Senate reason&#39; to pause in dealing with legislation of this character. It is time, I think, for Australians to denounce indignantly what is being done in regard to the coloured races. It is one thing to pass an exclusion law, to say that the coloured races and the white races shall be kept apart. That is entirely natural and allowable, and I for one feel that it is right. But it is an entirely different thing to take up the ground that some Australians have taken, and that was taken up last week, when it was threatened that if this Bill becomes law those who are our fellow subjects will not be allowed to trade upon our coasts. It is a serious thing to insult the natives of Asia and the hundreds of millions of our fellow subjects there. We have already gone too far in that direction. Honorable senators will not have forgotten that a couple of years ago we had a Bill before us which proposed to give some preference under the Tariff to goods brought from England in ships, provided they were manned by white British subjects. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith,</inline> speaking in London on the subject - not being at the time a Minister, as he is to-day - said that under no conceivable circumstances would the people of the United Kingdom consent to receive any preference of the kind from which their fellow subjects in India were rigidly excluded. The Bill was rejected on that very ground. Since then we have passed what vs known as the South African Preference Bill, in which there is a clause distinctly offensive to coloured people. We give a certain preference on sugar grown by white labour. If it is grown by coloured labour no preference is given. Nearly the whole of last session we were engaged upon the revision of the Tariff, and there was a very long list of articles as to which preference was given to goods shipped, not from the British Empire, but from the United </para>

                            <para>- It is not a question of competition with 2d. per day men, but of treating the Empire on one basis. We need not give any preference whatever if we do not like. We have before to-day had reason to pity the misfortunes of coloured peoples who have been shipwrecked and landed on our inhospitable coast. I know that a number of people are continually telling us that we have all sorts of things to fear from the Asiatic, who will, at some future time, do something that will be very dreadful. But what I am anxious about is, that we shall do what is right with regard to them. I am not troubled as to whether, in future, they will endeavour to do wrong to .us; it is much more important that we should do what is right. The Vice-President of the Executive Council poses as a great friend of the Empire. But, in my judgment, there are no people within the Empire who are creating graver dangers for the future than is the Government of Australia at present. They are rather burden builders than Empire builders. </para>

The provision of these Acts of Parliament and the suggestions contained in the report to the Royal Commission on the Australian Navigation and Shipping Bill have caused some apprehension amongst British ship-owners lest those measures should impose on British ships in Colonial ports restrictions and requirements which might be inconsistent with those which are imposed by Imperial Legislation. These Imperial restrictions are very onerous in their character, and they are increasing in their burden practically from Act of Parliament to Act of Parliament. The burdens imposed upon the ship-owners in this country by Imperial legislation, I think I may claim to be the most onerous in the world, and the fact that British ship-owners- British shipping - has thriven in spite of them, is&#39; beyond all praise. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I have been pointing out that while &#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> relied upon the New Zealand Act to support some of his. statements, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Ward stated that he knew that there were objections to the Bill, and that the giving of the Royal assent had been delayed for two years, but he did not admit that it was given subject to a sort of review of the measure at the Conference. Notwithstanding that there -is the statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd-George,</inline> and, I think, it does to. some extent weaken the reliance which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> placed upon the New Zealand Act. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd-George</inline> wound up his speech by saying - </para>

                    <para class="block">I think that the Senate, as a whole, will be inclined to do that. I now wish to draw attention to the memorandum submitted by the representatives of the British shipowners to the Conference. It is a very carefully drafted, and very moderately worded, statement of their views and position. As it occupies about four columns of this closely printed document, I think I ought not to read it all, but I recommend honorable senators to examine it carefully, as it contains a good deal of interesting information. Here is a passage which bears a good deal on an interjection made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> this afternoon with regard to loss of life - </para>
                    <list type="decimal-dotted">
                        <item label="6.">
                            <para>There has of recent years been a marked and steady decrease in the number of lives lost from British ships. In 1872 the loss of life amounted to 3,533, whilst in 1904 it was only 1,113. During that period British shipping had doubled in size. </para>
                        </item>
                        <item label="7.">
                            <para>The reduction in the loss of British vessels through wreck during the same period has been equally striking. The comparative figures are not given until 1S76, in which year 280,000tons were lost out of a total of 6,000,000, whilst in 1903 the loss was only 135,000 tons out of a total of /04 millions. </para>
                        </item>
                    </list>
                    <para>I think that those figures show a wonderful improvement of the position. </para>
                    <para>The British ship-owners, in submitting these points for the consideration of the Commonwealth, do not wish to minimize the importance of the consideration of safety and comfort on which the Royal Commission has laid so much stress, but they, believe that they are justified; in claiming that the British mercantile marine-  is at the present time better equipped and better manned than it ever has been. </para>
                    <para>If British shipping is to maintain its hold upon the sen-borne trade of the world, it is essential that it should be managed on sound business lines. It must show reasonable security for the capital invested, and it must be made to yield a reasonable return on the investment, otherwise the capital will be diverted into safer and more profitable channels. Further, if the disasters which have overtaken the over-sea shipping of the United States are to be avoided, the British ship-owner must be allowed in his business to deal with its constantly-growing and varying requirements free from all unnecessary rules and regulations, the enforcement of which place the British vessels at a disadvantage with their foreign competitors on the high seas. </para>
                    <para>Rules and regulations are necessary to secure the safety of life and property at sea, but it is essential in dealing with a world-wide trade, that all such rules and regulations shall be not only reasonable in themselves, but also that they shall fix standards applicable to all ports and on all seas. </para>
                    <para>The ship-owners, as such, are not interested in questions of constitutional law, and they have no desire to conduct their business through the Law Courts. Therefore, in this memorandum, they have not attempted to deal with legal difficulties. They have assumed that it is the desire of all parties to the Conference to enable British ships, without distinction of register, to trade on fair and equitable terms in all British possessions. </para>
                    <para>In the interests of British shipping there should be :  - </para>

                    </list>
                    <para>It is obvious that British ship-owners cannot carry on their business, or can only carry it on under grave disabilities if they have to comply with different and possibly conflicting requirements in every part of the Empire, and to pass in every British possession surveys in order to establish their compliance. </para>
                    <para>The position, even for liners regularly trading on a route between two parts of the Empire, would, at best, be harassing, whilst for last passenger steamers sailing on fixed dates which leave no margin of unemployed time, it would be impossible, except at the prohibitive cost of running additional steamers. </para>
                    <para>Liners constitute but a small proportion of British shipping. The larger proportion has no fixed route. Such ships on leaving the country of their register have frequently no programme beyond the first stage. Their owners cannot, therefore, provide for compliance with divergent standards when they are ignorant of the ports which their ships will visit. </para>
                    <para>Vessels engaged in the general carrying trade of the world, must of necessity be prepared, if they are to be worked to the best advantage, to accept employment wherever offered. This ability to go anywhere and accept all employment offering has, in the opinion of British ship-owners, been one of the most important factors in building up the British mercantile marine, and, by avoiding voyages in ballast, cheapening the cost of sea carriage. </para>
                    <para class="block">I have read about one-fourth of the memorandum, and I ask honorable senators who desire to study and understand this very important question to take an early opportunity of reading the whole of it. Let me now draw attention to the annual meeting of the Associated Chambers of Commerce of the United Kingdom, which was held in London in April last. Their view is entirely distinct from that put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> to-day. He would have us to believe that the Bill, as it has been amended and submitted to us, is entirely in agreement with the resolutions of the Navigation Conference, but the Associated Chambers of Commerce of the United Kingdom do not think so. At their annual meeting, the following motion was moved by  Colonel Coffey,  of Liverpool - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>That in the opinion of this Association legislation in Australia and other Colonies of the Empire affecting British ships owned in the United Kingdom should not, except as regards the coastal trade of the Colony, impose upon such ships any restrictions beyond those imposed upon them by the Imperial Merchant Shipping Act. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>That seems to be reasonable. I shall content myself with reading one extract from the speech which  Colonel Goffey  delivered in support of the motion. After referring to the Conference, he said - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Following that Conference, a Bill was introduced into the Commonwealth Parliament last September, entitled a Bill for an Act relating to Navigation and Shipping, but he had no hesitation in saying that its terms practically ignored all that was agreed upon at the Conference. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>The motion, I may say, was carried unanimously. Honorable senators would do well to bear carefully in mind the vast powers which are conferred by this measure on the Ministry of the day. For many years I have been saying that &#34; Government by regulation has increased, is increasing, and ought to be diminished.&#34; Instead of that, we have brought before us a Bill which increases government by regulation to an extent which was not dreamed of years ago. Even those very vital and serious provisions relating to the coasting trade are to be dealt with by the Minister. It is well to warn honorable senators that they must not be misled by the marginal references in the Bill.. It does not follow because we see the letters &#34; M.S. A. &#34; - an abbreviation for Merchant Shipping Act - placed in the margin, that a clause is in  agreement with a provision of that Act. It is. only a slight reference to it. The interpretation clause contains two pages of definitions, and instead of these being arranged alphabetically, they are arranged in the loosest way possible, so that it is the easiest thing in the world for any one not to find a reference which he may require. The matter of desertion will have to be very carefully dealt with by the Senate. If, when the mail steamers come out here, some of their men choose to desert, and they are not to be liable to arrest for forty-eight hours afterwards, the vessels may be placed in a very awkward position, as the owners are under a penalty to perform their voyages to schedule time. If we permit men to leave the steamers, and have no power of speedy arrest, it is quite clear that the owners of the vessels may be put to great trouble. I think we should do well to alter the clause dealing with this matter, and at any rate to permit the power of arrest within twenty-four hours. </para>

                            <para>- With regard to <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> extended meaning of coastal trade, we know that under the United States law it covers the Philippines and the Sandwich Islands. But it is not many weeks since I saw a cable message to the effect that a Bill was to be brought in to remove the Philippines and the Sandwich Islands from the operation of the coastal laws of America. Every one will admit that that is a step in the right direction, and therefore the existing interpretation of coastal trade under the American Act ought not to be accepted by us as any encouragement to adopt a similar interpretation. I might extend my remarks on this Bill in many directions, and when in Committee I shall deal pretty fully with various aspects of it. I support very strongly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> request that we should retain possession of the Bill until the despatch arrives from the Home Government, which, a few weeks ago we were informed by cable, had been sent. I feel that to some extent we are guilty of discourtesy in discussing the matter even as we are now doing before the arrival of this despatch. Certainly the very least we can do is to retain the measure in the Senate until the despatch arrives, that it may be permitted to influence our final judgment as far as possible. </para>

Apparently <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> did not answer the invitation at all until he had consulted with the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seddon.</inline> At the time, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seddon</inline> had put forward his own Bill, and naturally did not wish to give it up. However, New Zealand and Australia were ultimately represented at a Conference, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin&#39;s</inline> principle of Australia for the Australians stood in the way all through, and as a result we now have a Bill submitted which in many respects is diametrically opposed to the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act, and it must not be overlooked that the Merchant Shipping Act of 1904 has been greatly improved. A measure which is not definite cannot be a. satisfactory measure, and if everything is to be left to regulations or to be &#34;as prescribed,&#34; it cannot be said that our legislation is- definite. For that reason I hold that this is not a satisfactory Bill. There is too much dependence upon the Minister all through. Under clause 279 the Governor-General may declare certain vessels British ships, and free from the coastal regulations, and under the next clause, as pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> he may exempt certain other ships. That is very indefinite. Where is die policy of Parliament in so important a matter, if the Minister is given power to do this and that in dealing with questions of policy? It is one of the great blots on this Bill that under it the Minister is enabled to do pretty well as he likes. One clause provides for a Committee of experts, who are to judge as to this, that and the other, but the advantage of that provision is nullified bv another, saving that the Minister is not required to appoint such a </para>

Where is the policy of Parliament expressed in such an indefinite provision ? It is a great blot upon this measure that so much should be left to be prescribed by regulation. If this method of prescribing everything is to be adopted, I should like very much to see provision made for the appointment of a Board or Committee, and if there are difficulties in the way of the appointment of a Board, I should rather that we adopted the practice of Canada in establishing a Department of Marine for the Commonwealth. In Canada it is provided that the Marine Department shall have a Deputy Minister of Marine appointed as supreme executive head of the Department, and the administration of the following matters is placed under the control of the Department - </para>

I do not believe that clause  417,  which given control over seamen&#39;s homes, is constitutional. I should like to know whether the Government intend to defend it. I question whether we have any right to go into Victoria or New South Wales, and say that this or that seaman&#39;s home is not properly managed, and that until it is the sailor shall not live in it. However, that is a matter with which we can deal in Committee. I propose now to refer to the crew as prescribed by clauses  37  and  38,  and I am glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is present. </para>

She may be voyaging to England very quickly or she may be returning from that country very slowly. These considerations cause her requirements to vary from time to time. , </para>

                            <para>- The pro. vision relating to coal consumption is quite opposed to the section of the New Zealand Act, which is certainly liberal enough. All the evidence, I contend, goes to show that a manning scale cannot be equitably adopted. As a result an expert witness proposed that a Committee should be appointed to adjudicate upon the requirements of each ship. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has dealt with so many of the weak points of the Bill - and no reply has been vouchsafed - that I do not intend to reiterate his arguments. There is only one other matter with which I propose to deal, and it has reference to vessels employed upon our rivers and bays. The Bill requires these small vessels - vessels probably about 15 tons - to keep a log and to carry a certificated master. That, I contend, will inflict a decided hardship upon their owners. Quite a number of these vessels are engaged in carrying wood down the Huon </para>

Their masters have a knowledge of their own business which qualifies them to safely navigate these vessels, and that should be sufficient. In Committee I shall endeavour to secure an alteration of the provision relating to these craft. In conclusion, I desire to say a word or two upon the clause dealing with desertion. The Bill provides that the absence of a seaman without leave for forty-eight hours shall constitute desertion. How is the captain of a vessel to know whether a seaman intends to desert or not within forty-eight hours? In Committee I shall move for the excision of the objectionable words, &#34;after forty -eight hours.&#34; If we do&#39; not provide for the return of deserters to their ships we shall have the free immigration of paupers to this country. </para>

                        <para>. - Apparently, some members of the Opposition think that the debate upon the second reading of this Bill should be an extended one. Personally, I regard the measure as one the provisions of which should be threshed out in Committee, and it is for that reason that so many members of the Labour Party have refrained from discussing it. I agree with much that was said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> regarding the difficulties which surround a Bill of this character. The fact that its provisions will be applicable to other than Australian vessels makes it a very difficult Bill to handle. But every precaution has been taken to obtain the fullest information regarding the position that we occupy, both from the stand-point of the Imperial connexion, and also from that of State rights. I can quite understand some difference of opinion arising in respect of the clauses which deal with British and foreign shipping. But we must bear in mind that a Royal Commission has exhaustively inquired into this question, and that subsequently its work was reviewed by an Imperial Conference which met in London, and upon which all the maritime  t  sections of the community were well represented. </para>

                            <para>- I question whether it would be possible for any Government to make a Bill of this magnitude harmonious in every respect. But we know that no pains have been spared to obtain all the information that is available upon this comprehensive subject. It now remains for this Parliament to do what it thinks best. I quite recognise that the Imperial Government, when they meet us in a representative sense, have every right fo put their views before us. But, having done that, I hold that the Commonwealth Government were justified in. resenting any communication emanating from an official Department of the British Government of a similar character to that which has been the subject of comment during this debate. After all the inquiries we have made into this question, I contend that the manner in -which a Board of Trade official comes into the picture is very reprehensible, and that the Prime Minister would have failed&#39; in his duty to the Commonwealth if he had&#39; not replied in the spirited manner in which, he did. What is the principal objection that has been urged to the Bill during the course of this debate? The leader of the Opposition seized upon one point of that correspondence, but left its cardinal features severely alone. I can quite understand the people of the United Kingdom resenting the imposition of any restrictions upon British vessels by this portion of the. Empire. We know that for many years- - notwithstanding the popular clamour for an amendment of the Merchant Shipping Act - they successfully resisted all attempts to provide for the survey and inspection of foreign ships. Recently, however, they were obliged to give way upon these points, partly as the result of popular clamour,, and partly because of the unfair competition to which British ships were subjected.. If it had not been for that unfair competition, I very much question whether any alteration would have been made in the Merchant Shipping Act of the United&#34; Kingdom. But, having amended that Act in regard to the load-line, &#38;c, they were obliged to listen to -representations which have been made from time to time by parliamentary Committees and various other bodies. I quite admit that inspection is hateful to the employers in any industry, and especially to ship-owners. </para>

                            <para>- But if we avoid questions because they are difficult, we shall never have a satisfactory law. We require to exercise some control over foreign shipping entering or leaving our ports in an unseaworthy state. I admit that there is a certain amount of ambiguity in the clauses of this Bill dealing with the subject. I am not satisfied that the provisions are based on sound principles. But they are founded to a large extent on the Merchant Shipping Act of Great Britain, and we cannot go very far wrong in following that piece of legislation, because shipowners are largely represented in the House of Commons, and their interests are likely to be well looked after by members of Parliament there. I have before me a copy of the latest Merchant Shipping Act of Great Britain, passed in 1906. I think that the report of our own Royal Commission exercised a considerable amount of influence on the Imperial Parliament when the Act was passed. I have been looking up the English <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports, and find that our Royal Commission&#39;s report was referred to on several occasions. Several members of the House of Commons spoke very highly of it, especially the representatives of the sailors in England, who have been good enough to admit that our report did much to secure for the men engaged in the mercantile marine tetter legislation for improving their condition, and so forth. Regarding the detention of ships that may be unseaworthy, section 2 of the amending Act reads as follows - </para>

                    <para class="block">The latter part of the section was put in to remedy a very grave defect in the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894. There was a power of inspection. But only those foreign ships were inspected which shipped cargo or passengers within a port of the King&#39;s Dominions, or that were going to a port of the King&#39;s Dominions. The amending Act gave power to inspect for the purpose of finding out whether a ship was seaworthy or not, no matter whether her cargo or passengers were shipped in any port of the King&#39;s Dominions. That is to say, to-day the Merchant Shipping Act of Great Britain gives power to inspect any foreign ship. Formerly a foreign ship could enter any British port, and no matter how unseaworthy she might be, or how unsafely she might be loaded, she could not be inspected or interfered with if she came from a foreign port. That legislation had this effect. When many British vessels became inadequate to meet the requirements of the British Act they were registered as foreign ships, and the result was that a ship formerly on the British register could be entered on a foreign register, and could sail from a British port, provided she did not ship cargo or passengers from that port ; and she could continue in the foreign trade, and continue to be loaded unsafely without interference. As I have said, I quite agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> that there is a certain amount of ambiguity about clause 204, to which he drew attention. I admit that there is a slight difference between it and the British section which I have read. But I think it will be admitted that power should be taken under this Bill to apply the same provisions as to inspection as are contained in the British Merchant Shipping Act, and that we should exercise control over ships leaving our control, at least to that extent. I quite agree that the manning basis of deciding whether a ship is seaworthy or not may have a conflicting effect upon the working of this measure. But we have to bear in mind that whilst the Bill provides a manning basis, the matter is left very much to the committee. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> that this is an admirable arrangement, because ships differ so much in construction that it is utterly impossible to lay down any rule that can be applied to every imaginable vessel. What might be a fair manning basis for one ship might be altogether unfair for another. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly. There is no industry in which, there have been so many changes as in shipping. Every day we see something new, either for the purpose of enabling ships to travel faster or for labour-saving. Therefore, a basis of manning that might suit one class of ship would be utterly unfit for another. The appointment of a committee representing all the interests involved is the best method of settling such points. </para>

                            <para>- They should have responsibilities, otherwise there would be no use in appointing them. To appoint a committee, and give it no power would be a very foolish proceeding. There may,  however, be a difference of opinion as to the extent of the power conferred. I have given some attention to this point, and must admit that I have not made up my mind as to how far we should go in conferring power upon the committee. But a certain amount of power must be given if the committee is to do work of any value whatever. Regarding some of the other objections that have been urged by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Walter</inline> Howell, I would point out that the Board of Trade officials have not fully acquainted themselves with the Australian position. Otherwise they would not in such an unqualified manner condemn some of the clauses in this Bill, of which they have shown disapproval. </para>

                            <para>- I am quite satisfied that had those officials been better seized of the facts, and the reason for the insertion of the clauses in the Bill, they would not have condemned them so strongly, or at all. If there is one of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Walter</inline> Howell&#39;s points which is stronger than another, it is his condemnation of the clauses relating to advances. On the surface one would be inclined to think that there could be no serious objection to advancing a certain amount of money to a sailor shipping in Australia for a foreign voyage. One would think that a harmless procedure of that kind could be carried out without evil effects to any one concerned. But, as a matter of fact, there is nothing so much needed in our navigation law as the regulation of advance notes given to sailors at ports which are generally looked, upon as foreign ports in the trading sense. It has been stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger that if we could show that captains of ships act unfairly to their seamen, and assist in causing their desertion, he would be prepared to help us. I think that I shall be able to quote sufficient evidence to secure his support of the clauses so far as they apply to the crimping operations which were revealed to the Commission at Newcastle. I believe that if the industrial history of Australia was searched, no page would be found so black as that which deals with this subject. In Newcastle, a state of affairs was revealed to us which it shocked us to think was possible in such a country as Australia, notwithstanding its industrial laws, and which should have been remedied years ago. It has existed so long that apparently those who are living on the traffic have lost all sense of shame, and do not fear the consequences which should follow the commission of such actions. </para>

                            <para>- There has been no punishment. On the contrary, there has been rather a premium offered for the continuation of the traffic. It has been not only encouraged, but also extended to classes whom one would not expect to be guilty of such wrong-doing. We had proof that at Newcastle captains entered into an arrangement with &#39; crimpers to take and supply men at so much per head. The crimpers arranged their business in such a way that the blood money went into the pockets of the crimpers and the captains. We had that evidence from witnesses whom I think no One would question or doubt. </para>

                            <para>-I do not know whether the honorable senator, since his visit to England, has become so unsophisticated as &#39;to believe that the reports of masters of foreign ships cannot be fixed up to get over that little difficulty. We know that arrangements have been made between a sailor and the captain which were perfectly illegal so far as the latter was concerned. It must be remembered that ships have to lie in Newcastle for some months. I have known ships to be lying there for nine months waiting for orders. Whilst a ship is at the port a seaman&#39;s wages are running on, and it may be of interest to the captain, who may be a part-owner of the ship, to get rid of a man. He can save money in that way if he knows that his ship is likely to be at the port for say six months. But where that was not necessary, and a seaman had an inducement to remain on the ship because he had two years&#39; wages due to him, the captain made the position so warm that the poor fellow was very glad to clear out, and, as regards the wages, it was an easy matter for the captain to fix up a report for his owner. </para>

                            <para>- The arrangement can be fixed up on board the ship. It is not necessary in every instance to take the men to the Shipping Office. It is owing to that laxity that this traffic at Newcastle has been allowed to exist for so long a period. In support of the statements I have made, I propose to quote from the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McVane,</inline> Sub-Inspector of Police at Newcastle, whose words I think will carry some weight with honorable senators, especially when they hear that he has occupied a responsible position at the port for a great many years, and exhibited a thorough grasp of the subject before the Commission -  20363. Do you mean to say that the captain of the ship and the boarding-master equally reap something out of it? - Yes. 20364. Out of the advance note, or something; else? - Out of the advance note and something else. 20365. The captain pays so much for supplying the men? - Yes. i understand he pays <inline font-style="italic">&#163;x</inline> a head to the boarding-master to supply them, and then the boarding-master divides that <inline font-style="italic">&#163;x</inline> with the captain afterwards. I presume the captain tells his owners on the other side that men were so scarce in Newcastle that he had to pay this money to get the ship away. 20366. Is that a general practice at this port? -I believe it is ; but it is very difficult to prove, because the captain is liable as well as the boarding-master. 20372. Why do seamen desert? - Sometimes, I suppose, they are induced to desert by these crimps, and sometimes things are made so miserable for them on board that they probably arc glad to get away. 20379. As far as the captain is concerned he shares in the supply money? - Yes, and often, no doubt, in the wages due to the deserting seamen. </para>

I am referring to. the work of engaging seamen, and to the practice under which a captain enters into m agreement with a crimp to pay <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> per head for seamen supplied.

                        Howell seems to think, and I believe it is the prevailing opinion in the Old Country, that to pay off seamen in any other port than a home port is to encourage desertion. Witnesses whom we examined at Newcastle were of a contrary opinion. They seemed to think that if seamen on British vessels were paid a certain amount of their wages in British ports there would be less desertion than there is at the present time. Here is the opinion of a boarding-house-keeper named Edward Watson -

There is less desertion from foreign ships than from British ships. The foreigner gets a percentage of his wages when he leaves at a port; the Britisher gets little or none, except at the will of the captain. There are more desertions from British ships here than from any other. </para>

This witness mentioned the way in which sailors were robbed of their wages, and referred to a case in which twelve men, w-ho had  ,&#163;40  due to them, received only <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> each. The witnesses examined at Newcastle were representative of all sections of the community, and there was a remarkable unanimity in their condemnation of the crimping traffic carried on in that port. I see no way of abolishing the traffic if the advance note system is continued, because, until it is rendered unprofitable, it will bo continued. I hope that the Senate will make  short shrift&#39; of this matter, and will agree to the provision dealing with it as it stands in the Bill. I must express my astonishment that clause  99  should find a place in any Bill introduced in such a Parliament as this. If an appropriate marginal note for the clause were to be adopted, I should suggest a very different one from that which is now attached to it. The marginal note in the Bill is &#34; Assaults on crews,&#34; and the clause provides that - </para>

                            <para>- It is a wonderful term, as used in a clause of this kind, and, I think, a more appropriate marginal note for the clause would .be, &#34; Do not nail his ears to the pump,&#34; or something of that kind. This is a .measure dealing with one of the most difficult callings in which to prevent assault. When a ship is at sea, far away from the restraint of recognised authorities, we should be very jealous of the power we place in the hands of any officer having control of men. I regard this clause as an invitation to a brutal captain, or pugilistically inclined officer, to practice upon those under him. </para>

                            <para>- The best way to deal with such a clause is to wipe it out altogether. We should take no risks in such a matter. To leave it in the Bill is to invite almost any kind of disorder on board ship. If we are going to agree to a clause of that kind, let us also embody in the Bill a provision which will have the effect of putting the seamen upon a similar footing. Let us provide that a fireman must not without &#34; lawful justification &#34; assault an officer with a shovel. If&#39; the master or other officer of a vessel is to be a law unto himself, let all parties start upon a fair basis, but do not let us give to an officer a privilege which we refuse to extend to a seaman. </para>

                            <para>- It is quite worthy of that body. I now desire to direct attention to that portion of the measure which relates to the accommodation which must be provided for seamen. The first Bill dealing with this subject made far from satisfactory provision in this connexion. Under it the accommodation upon vessels might have been fit for human beings, or it might have been the reverse. We all recognise that upon modem vessels there is much to admire. When we step aboard an up-to-date passenger steamer we almost feel that we are in a palatial hotel. &#39; The cabins are roomy and well ventilated, the saloons are luxurious in the extreme, and there are usually splendid promenade decks. In &#34;short, from the stand-point of the passengers, everything necessary has been provided. But if we chose to examine the accommodation set apart for the seamen in the forecastle, we should probably find that a very different condition of things prevailed. A man who is compelled to do laborious work in the stokehold has frequently to live in a dirty cabin which&#39; is more fit for a dog than for a human being. Under the original Bill the space allotted to each seaman was the miserable allowance of 72 cubic feet. I am pleased to notice that this measure provides for 120 cubic feet. </para>

                            <para>- They are essentials in a modern steam-ship. Where the great majority of our mercantile vessels consisted of sailing ships, of course, 72 cubic feet afforded a greater degree of comfort to the, average seaman than it does today. A sailor working amongst the rigging or on deck all day does not knock off in the dirty state which characterizes the man in the stokehold. The latter, who is invariably begrimed with smoke and dust, should certainly be afforded the means of observing ordinary rules of cleanliness. </para>

                            <para>- Only since the Act of 1906 was passed. The Navigation. Commission received complaints in reference to the accommodation provided in the British mercantile marine from all and sundry. If in the future our seamen are provided with the accommodation that is contemplated under this Bill, they will, be able to conform to the laws of decency and cleanliness much better than they have been able to do hitherto. There is another aspect of this question to which I desire to direct attention. Any person who has visited the stokehold of a steamer must have realized the high temperature which invariably obtains there. Very often the heat is so overpowering that it is impossible for a man to do a decent day&#39;s work. But in  a ship which is well ventilated - and I am pleased to say that we have some such vessels on the Australian coast, notably the turbine steamer <inline font-style="italic">Loongana</inline> - the firemen are able to do a much better day&#39;s work. Upon the <inline font-style="italic">Loongana</inline> mechanical contrivances have been adopted for the ventilation of the stokehold. These contrivances can be installed at comparatively small cost. No great outlay is necessary to generate the requisite electricity with which to drive fans for the purpose of extracting the hot air from the stokeholds of vessels. It is time that we insisted upon the installation of these mechanical contrivances, and I am quite sure that ship-owners themselves would no* regret the step, because they would be more than compensated for the extra expenditure to which they would te subjected. This reform is more necessary in Australia than it is elsewhere. We all recognise that in the colder climates, the stokeholds of vessels are not as warm as they are in our warmer latitudes, where, at the best of times, the heat is very trying to the stokers. If we decide to base our manning scale upon the coal consumption of vessels, we certainly ought to differentiate in favour of the warmer latitudes as against the more temperate regions. Another question to which I wish to draw attention has reference to our wharf labourers. As a class, these men have been more neglected from a legislative standpoint than has any other section of the workers. Further, no class of workmen is subjected to keener competition, and particularly is this the case at big ports such as Melbourne and Sydney. Every individual who is unemployed appears to think that he has a right to enter into competition with those who make labouring upon our wharfs their regular calling. Some discrimination ought, I think, to be made in favour of the latter. As a matter of fact, most of the accidents which occur in the loading and unloading of vessels is due to the employment of novices. The accident funds of some trade unions are kept depleted by. the casualties which occur through the employment of men who are unfamiliar with this class of work. . </para>

                            <para>- I think so. Certain portions of the Bill deal with the handling of cargo and its proper stowage. If it be right that we should legislate in regard to the proper stowage of cargo, it is equally our duty to see that that cargo is handled in such a way as not to endanger fife. Upon the mines of New South Wales, and more particularly the coal mines, the accident funds are financed by a royalty system which obviates the necessity for taxing the miners to provide for their wounded comrades.- </para>

The Navigation Commission took a deal of evidence from wharf labourers who urged that something should be done in this direction with a view to relieving them from the heavy financial strain to which they are now subjected. They argue that the industry should provide for the workmen who are injured in it. </para>

                            <para>- Unfortunately, that is not so. If it were, I should have no complaint to make. The unions have no say in the selection of the men. They may have a say as to who shall become members of unions, but that is quite different. The proposal that I have mentioned is so eminently fair to all concerned that I trust it will be supported. The Commonwealth and the ship-owners, as well as the men, should, in equity, contribute towards bearing this burden, which ought not to be  placed  entirely upon the workers. I have one other remark to make, and it is in regard to live stock that is carried on passenger vessels engaged in the coastal trade. When travelling between Western Australia and the eastern States I have noticed the deplorable condition of steerage passengers in this regard. Often there is no room for them to walk about on account of the live stock carried on deck. This is not only a source of danger, but, from the point of view of health and comfort, an evil that should be remedied or controlled. </para>

                            <para>- I have observed women suffering from sea-sickness, who, when they came on deck to get a little fresh air, had to squat or sit about in proximity to cattle, sp that their sickness was aggravated. I can mention a case in point. The <inline font-style="italic">Arawatta,</inline> a well-known steamer on the northern run, came into collision with another vessel. Owing to the number of cattle carried on deck, the sailors had the greatest possible difficulty in getting to the boats. This created quite a panic, and it looked as if things were going to be very dangerous indeed. It required a great effort to control the people, but, at length, the panic was calmed down, and something like order was restored. We ought to try to remedy that state of things, and to make regulations so that cattle may not be allowed to get in the way of passengers or of the sailors engaged in working a ship.. I have a few amendments to propose when the Bill gets into Committee, and I hope that my fellow senators will recognise the justification for them, and will give to them that support which is essential if they aTe to be placed on the statute-book. </para>

                        <para>. - I am pleased that this Bill has at length been placed before us for consideration. It has been looked for by seamen with a great deal of anxiety for a very long time. Although it was not dealt with last session, I think that there was good reason for going slow with a measure that will undoubtedly have far-reaching results. A large number of people and a few journals are always ready to take advantage of an opportunity of scoffing at the Commonwealth when it is found that our legislation is declared invalid, or when our efforts to legislate do not find their way to the statute-book. I do not wish to see the Commonwealth Parliament passing legislation which is &#39; afterwards successfully challenged, nor do I desire to see our efforts expended upon legislative proposals which do not become law. Although, therefore, this Bill has been sadly wanted, still the utmost caution is warranted in&#39; order that we may pass a measure that will not only confer the advantages which are anticipated, but will endure as a piece of legislative work. Owing to the character of the Bill, it is one which can be more conveniently handled in Committee. It will require; careful dissection at that stage. Consequently, discussion on the motion for the second reading is to Some extent superfluous. I notice the absence from the Bill of a clause empowering the Commonwealth to take into its service ships engaged in the coasting traffic in times of emergency. </para>

                            <para>- I hope that that is so, because it is only proper that the Commonwealth should have power to avail itself of ships engaged in the coasting trade  if  we are ever placed in so unfortunate a position as to require for naval purposes the services of our mercantile marine. I do not suppose that the Vice-President of the Executive Council  win  claim that this is a perfect measure. It has been collected from many sources. The New Zealand Act, the British Merchant Shipping Act, and the Acts of the several States have been drawn upon largely, with the object of making this a workable measure. We have many interests to consider. We have to consider the interests of foreign ships trading with the Commonwealth, and of British ships, which do the bulk of our trade with foreign countries, as well as the local vessels that are continually on our. coast. These conflicting interests have to be minutely analyzed, and at the same time we have to bring forth a measure that will preserve a balance of equity between the varying interests. It is natural that a Bill collected from&#39; so many sources should not be perfect from, its inception ; and I must confess that my study of it leads- me to think that it cam be considerably improved. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> made pointed reference to the non-observance of resolution 9, passed by the Imperial Conference. But I think that if he reads the correspondence on the subject, together with the reports, he will find that the Conference came to a unanimous decision with reference to ships employed: on our coasting trade and ships registered in Australia being entirely subject to the law of the Commonwealth. </para>

It sets forth clearly that ships registered in Australia, and ships engaged in our coasting trade, should <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> absolutely subject to Commonwealth law. Furthermore, in defining the coasting trade, the Conference, which was composed of representatives of shipowners in Great Britain, agreed that foreign-going ships, if they engaged in our coasting trade, carrying passengers from port to port, should be subject to our law. There was no murmuring against that resolution. </para>

                            <para>- It appears to me that resolution 9 is carried out as reasonably as possible in this Bill. The meaning of the resolution is plain. Tt approves of the Commonwealth legislating for ships registered in Australia, and also for ships engaged temporarily in the coasting trade - such as the vessels of the Peninsular and Oriental and Orient companies. </para>

                            <para>- Clause 37 of the Bill is exclusively confined to the manning of ships registered in Australia and engaged in our coasting trade. It does not say that our manning scale shall apply to foreigners. It is the honorable senator who has put that interpretation upon the Bill. He also took exception to clause 23. He said that it, too, was at variance with the intention of the Navigation Conference, and I interjected that it might have been taken from the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator also referred to the seaworthiness of ships, and was rather inquisitive as to what standard would be applied. According to my reading of the Bill, it is rather difficult to understand what standard can be applied, but I am sure the honorable senator will not contend that the Commonwealth authorities should allow any ship to depart which is not properly manned. Is he prepared to take up that attitude? </para>

                            <para>-In that case I should do what is provided for in the Bill, and that is,  accept  the Board&#39;s certificate as long as the Minister was satisfied that there was no necessity for a survey, and in doing so we should be following the example which is set by the Imperial authorities, because they subject foreign ships to the same inspection, and the same overhaul as their own ships. That is very clearly set forth in the correspondence. </para>

                            <para>- A lot of talk has been indulged in about the need for the Australian people to extend every consideration, within reason, to the shipping interests of the Old Country. I am not inclined to place the shipping interests of the Old Country before the shipping interests of the Commonwealth. Considering how the former have treated the Australian people, I believe that they are deserving of very little consideration at our hands. Up to the present time they have done very much better out of the people of Australia than the latter have done out of them. </para>

I am supported by a very weighty authority, in the opinion that the people of Australia .have contributed much more than their fair share towards the dividends of British ship-owners.

This course has been adopted for many years by the Calcutta and Bombay Indian native merchants for all&#39; goods shipped from Liverpool and Manchester, and average about 21s. 6d&#39;. per ton. While twenty years ago it was considered by shipowners that 27s. 6d&#39;. was a fair thing from Great Britain to Australia, since the Conference or combination of brokers, who simply limit the number of ships placed on the berth, they have by a cunning system of rebates, maintained a freight rate which has averaged 47s. 6d. for the past twenty years. </para>

What has been happening on the other side of the case?&#34; The expenses of ship-owners have not been increasing. In the minority report of the Navigation Commission it is set forth very 4 plainly that for the last fifty or sixty year&#39;sthe cost of manning and&#39; working the ships has been gradually decreasing. They report that according to Board of Trade returns the number of men per  100  tons-- required to man steam-ships was as follows : - 7.69 in 1854, 6.47 in i860, 4.35 in 1870, 2.95 in 1880, 2.73 in 1890, and 2.27 in 1909. It is very clearly shown that for the last twenty or thirty years the reduction in the cost of working steamships has been marked. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> also took exception to clause 279, which confers power on the Governor-General to exempt ships engaged in our coasting trade. Of course, the honorable senator&#39;s argument was directed to show that in this matter Western Australia was entitled to no special consideration. I confess that I should much .prefer to be in a position to make no request to this Parliament for special consideration for the State from which I come, but I believe that the exceptional&#39; position which that State occupies is such as to warrant the Federal Parliament extending to her some reasonable treatment. While <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> strove to minimize the claims put forward on behalf of Western Australia, I think he did not give due consideration to the serious influence which the Shipping Combine is able to exercise upon the progress of that State. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that the eastern States derive much more benefit from the trading of the Melbourne Steamship Company than does Western Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has said that other States of the Commonwealth are subjected  by the Shipping Combine to the same kind of treatment that Western Australia suffers from. I meet that argument by saying that 01 the eastern side of the Continent there is a network of railways which mav be taken advantage of to keep the Shipping Combine within reasonable bounds. </para>

                            <para>- The figures I propose to quote have not been obtained from the Chambers of Commerce, but they are authentic, and they show that the railways linking together the eastern States operate as an appreciable corrective in keeping the Shipping Combine within reasonable bounds, and in compelling them to quote freights on the eastern side of the Continent which they would not quote if they had not those railways to compete against. I propose to quote figures supplied by the head of an important engineering firm in Melbourne to show that railway freights compare most favorably with freights charged by the Shipping Combine. I submit these figures to enforce my contention that, so far as Western Australia is concerned, there is no serious competition to be faced by the Shipping Combine, and that to that extent the people of that State are handicapped. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that reasonable competition with the Shipping Combine in the eastern States is afforded by the railway systems by which those States are linked together. Some time ago the manager of the. Austral Otis Company, an important engineering firm in Melbourne, received -an order from the Broken Hill mine to supply fifty concentrating tables. He found on inquiry that they would weigh 35 cwt. each. After he received the order, as a prudent business man, he inquired into the best and cheapest means to land the tables at Broken Hill. He found that the shipping companies operating on the coast wanted&#163;10 per table for taking them from Melbourne to Port Pirie, or &#163;500 for transporting the fifty tables. </para>

                            <para>- The manager of the company considered the freight quoted rather over the mark, and he then inquired what it would cost to transport those concentrating tables from Melbourne to Broken Hill by rail. He found that it would cost &#163;12 8s. 4d. To complete the comparison, it is necessary to give the freight on one of these tables from Port Pirie to Broken Hill. That would have been <inline font-style="italic">&#163;6</inline> 6s. 2d., which would have made the total freight by steamer to Port Pirie and by railway to Broken Hill &#163;16 6s. 2d. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. The difference in cost was about &#163;4 per table, or. a difference of&#163;200 in a contract for the transport of the fifty tables. It will be seen from the experience of this Melbourne manufacturer that the people of Western. Australia are in a very awkward position, in being almost entirely dependent upon the steamers of the Combine for their communication with the eastern States. We have no railway communication with the east to compete with the Shipping Combine, and I have shown that railway communication in the case to which I have referred  made a difference of something like <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4</inline> in the freight on concentrating tables from Melbourne to Broken Hill. </para>

                            <para>- I should like to see some amendment of the Bill in connexion with the qualification of officers. It makes provision for first-class engineers and marine engine-drivers. According to my reading of the measure, a third-class engineer might sometimes be called upon to work side by side with, or to relieve, a marine engine-driver, and it is not likely to be conducive to discipline, or to raise the status of the marine engineer&#39;s calling, that any such officer as a marine engine-driver should be provided for in the Bill. It is provided, also, that an A.B. must be qualified by three years&#39; service, and a term of service is fixed for apprentices; but the Bill makes no mention of the qualifications required for a marine engine-driver or a third-class engineer. That is left to regulation. I object to that very much, because if it is necessary to provide in the Bill the term of service of an  A.B.,  it is equally necessary that the qualifications required for officers in the engineering department, whether third-class engineers or marine engine-drivers, should be set forth in the Bill. The provision conferring power on the Governor-General to exempt foreign ships from obtaining licences in the coastal trade is, in my opinion, a most objectionable one. Clause 289 empowers the Ministry pf the day to exempt any foreign ship which may be trading upon our coast from the necessity of taking out a licence. Now that we have made up our minds to protect our shipping from unfair competition it would be most unwise to vest any Ministry with such a power. When the Bill reaches the Committee stage it will need to be recast with a view to providing that foreign ships, trading between the Commonwealth, Fiji, New Caledonia, New Zealand, and other portions of the South Sea Islands shall conform to the same conditions as  Australian  ships. </para>

                            <para>- The Tariff, I am happy to say, has been disposed of. The best way of regaining our hold upon the trade with the South Sea Islands is by giving shipowners engaged in that trade a fair chance by compelling their competitors to observe similar conditions to those which they themselves are called upon to observe. To that end I suggest the insertion in the Bill of some words which will provide that vessels engaging in any trade in which Australian ships are engaged shall observe similar conditions. In the absence of such a provision foreign ships will be at liberty to engage in that trade and to pay their crews only <inline font-style="italic">&#163;3</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4.</inline> per. month, or any other scale that they may choose to adopt. That would be a most inequitable condition of things. I regret that the provisions of the Bill, so far as accommodation is concerned, are not to apply to existing ships. Clause 135 sets out that if ships built prior to the passing of this measure are found to be in an insanitary condition, the Minister shall see that they are forthwith placed in a sanitary condition. But in respect of these vessels no provision is made for the accommodation of the crews. A large number of these ships are engaged off our coast, some of which are comparatively new. In my opinion they should be called upon to provide adequate accommodation for their crews so long as it is possible to carry out the necessary alterations and the Minister does not think that the undertaking would be impossible or impracticable. It is conceivable that in some ships the increased accommodation could not be provided without the work pressing harshly upon their owners. But I wish to see the Ministry empowered to compel ship-owners to provide the accommodation contemplated in this Bill when such is possible to be done. </para>

                            <para>- I am speaking upon this point subject to correction. The manning scale does not give me complete satisfaction. To any person with a knowledge of the construction of ships&#39; boilers, engines, &#38;c, it is quite plain that to fix 3J tons of coal as the unit which is to determine the number of hands that shall be carried in a steamer&#39;s stokehold, would1, in some cases, be altogether misleading. At present the Bill provides that a coal consumption of 3 J tons shall be regarded as the unit of measurement. Under such a provision the men employed upon some ships on which no trimmers are carried would have a decided advantage over those engaged upon vessels on which trimmers are carried. Take the case of -a steamer which carries six firemen - two for each watch - and three trimmers, or nine all told. The consumption of coal upon such a vessel would be about 31J tons, and the six firemen would each be called on to work 5J tons. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I am merely pointing out the inequity which would obtain under the Bill as between a ship which carries trimmers and one which does not. The provision scale is one which, I hope, will not bc adopted by this Chamber/ I know of no better means of creating a disturbance in the maritime industry than the enforcement of that scale. It is by no means an adequate one, and if put into operation will certainly result, in serious disturbance upon our coast. In order to show the difference between the scale which is regarded as the minimum under this Bill, and that which obtains under the American Act, I would invite the attention of honorable senators to a few leading items. The scale embodied in this Bill provides for the supply of 3 lbs. of fresh bread per man weekly. That cannot by any stretch of imagination be regarded as a reasonable allowance. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. Those biscuits are usually so hard that one would &#39; require to soak them in water for a couple of days to render them edible. The quantity of soft bread for which provision is made under the American Act is lj lbs. daily. In other words, the American sailor receives 10J lbs. of soft bread weekly as against 3 lbs. for which provision is made under this Bill. In the matter of salt meat, the .measure provides that each seaman shall receive 3 lbs. weekly, as against 3^ lbs., the quantity prescribed by the American schedule. This Bill also makes provision for the supply of 6 lbs. of potatoes per man weekly, as against 7 lbs. under the American Act ; of, 4 ozs. of coffee, as against 5^ ozs. under the American Act ; and of 5 ozs. of dried fruits, as against 9 ozs. under the American Act. The American schedule further sets out that whilst in port 1&#189; lbs. of fresh meat shall be supplied to each member of the crew in lieu of canned meat, and that fresh fruit and vegetables shall also be supplied. I have never heard of fresh fruit being supplied to seamen on the Australian coast, but I contend that wherever the opportunity offers, ships entering our ports should supply their crews with fresh fruit and &#39;  vegetables. I have much pleasure in supporting the Bill in its present crude form, and 1 hope that when it finally passes both Houses of the Parliament it will be the means of conferring much happiness upon the men engaged in our maritime trade, and of rectifying a long-standing wrong. </para>

                        <para>. - I am sorry that some members of the Navigation Commission have not addressed the Senate at length upon the motion for the second reading of this Bill in order that we might have obtained some light and leading in respect of it. The measure is altogether too important for me to allow it to pass without making a few observations. It is an enormous Bill of 417 clauses. It- is not only of interest to Australia, but is of quite as much interest to other countries in all parts of the world. It is a fundamental measure, touching vital interests in a great many ways. It affects many classes - the seamen, the owners, the producers, and those who &#34; go down to the sea in ships.&#34; The passage of the Bill will probably make 01 mar our future to a considerable extent. It will not, I trust, be looked at from one point of view. The whole of the interests affected by the measure should receive fair consideration. If the Bill concerned ourselves only it would be a very simple one to deal with. But it touches our relations with almost every country with which we trade, and ft affects crucially our relations with the Mother Country, the&#34; greatest maritime nation on the earth. The measure is so large and comprehensive, and so full of great possibilities, that it is difficult for one who is not versed in the technicalities of the subject to deal with it effectively. I feel some diffidence in touching it at all at this stage. But I wish m to make a few remarks on questions which have not  been  hitherto dealt with. I venture to. express the hope that the discussion of the measure will not be, as previously, a time-wasting effort. The Navigation Bill has been before us for four or five years. I do not say that time has been lost, because we have derived more light on the subject, and have had the benefit of a larger experience to guide us. But I trust that we shall now be able to pass the Bill into law. I have some misgivings on the subject, because I fail to see how a measure of this size and importance can be passed during the present short session. It seems to me to be impossible. But at any rate we can make progress with it, and probably get it ready for another House to take up next session. While, as I have said, we need to consider the whole of the interests involved, I wish to insure that the interests of the travelling and producing public shall be considered. It seems to me that those interests have not in the previous part of the debate received that prominence which they deserve. We have here a great land, which some day, perhaps, will be a maritime country. But we are young yet, and if we wish to develop Australia as quickly as possible, our aim at present must be not to endeavour to develop a great carrying trade upon the seas, but to increase, the production of our land. We cannot do that successfully, however, without the use of maritime resources to a very great extent. We require means of communication with people outside. We need extended markets for our products. We shall make no progress unless we can do something in the direction of securing cheap freights for our producers and cheap passages for the travelling public. I have not heard the interests of the producers mentioned in the course of the debate. They have been entirely ignored, or treated as a negligible quantity. One would think that they were scarcely worthy of consideration. Yet they are the people who have to find freight for all the ships with which we are dealing in this Bill. The producers and the travelling public are those who find work for the seamen and profit for the shipowners, yet they seem to be very little considered. Any Bill that limits the possibilities of developing our travelling and carrying trade will impose a heavy handicap on sellers in this country and on buyers abroad. Therefore we must be very careful as to the provisions that are inserted. It is plain that we can do as we like in regard to many of the provisions of the Bill. We have within our coastal limits probably plenary powers. But, looking at the whole of the interests involved, I ask whether we shall be wise in pushing those powers to the fullest point to which we might push them. As the leader of the Opposition pointed out to-day, if we are going to exercise our full legal rights without regard to the interests of other countries - foreign nations as well as the Mother Country - they will push their legal rights to the utmost limit also, and then our position will be worse than before. We must not forget that we are part and parcel of the great British Empire. I am sorry to see the anti-British feeling that is abroad. I was surprised at the remarks of the last  speaker,  who said that British&#39; ship-owners had derived more advantage from Australia than Australia had derived from them. He not only condemned British ship-owners, but local ship-owners in still stronger terms. I do not think that the allegation that British ship-owners have acted unfairly by Australia is justified. We owe a great deal to such lines is the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company and the Orient Steamship Company, which have been running for so many years, and have been carrying our goods and passengers at not unreasonable rates. More recently we have had the White Star line carrying goods and passengers at low rates. I do not consider that the animadversions passed upon British ship-owners are justified. The mercantile  marine is the greatest industry in the British Empire, and Great Britain owns half the mercantile shippers in the world.  Her  foreign trade is enormous. If it came to be a question of whether Great Britain would have to sacrifice her foreign trade, it would suit her very much better to drop the Australian trade and stick to that with the foreigner. The position is that Great Britain can do without the trade of this country, but we cannot very well do without that of Great Britain. Last year the British entrances and clearances were 250,000,000 tons. The total foreign, British, inter-Imperial trade was not 5,000,000 tons. By our legislation, we may cause Imperial trouble, and, therefore, before we place upon the statute-book a measure that will tend in that direction, we ought to consider seriously the consequences that may ensue. Some very pregnant remarks were made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George at the Imperial Conference in regard to the trade of Great Britain and the proposed legislation of this country. These were his words - </para>

                        <para>Owing to the vastness of our mercantile marine in every part of the world the tonnage exposed to possible reprisals or to increased competition through subsidies and in other ways would be many times as great. It is evident that (i country so situated must necessarily look upon proposals such as that made by Australia in a very different light from that in which they may appear to the point of view of Australia, whose foreign-going shipping is relatively very small. As I have already said, we have half the merchant shipping of the world. Looking at the entrances and clearances of ships of various nationalities in British and foreign ports, I take first of all the United States of America, which is one of the countries which, would be hit by this resolution, and I note that over 25,000,000 tons of British shipping entered and cleared in 1905 in the United States ports, while less than one and a half million tons of American vessels entered and cleared in our ports. There were 15,500,000 of British shipping in French ports compared with  3,000,000  tons of French shipping in United Kingdom ports. Take Russia. The British shin&#39;s in Russian ports- came to  8?  - million tons; the Russian ships in British ports came to i? million tons. There were nearly 12,000,000 tons of British shipping in Italian ports compared with less than 950,000 tons of Italian shipping in the United Kingdom ports. Even in the case of Germany the British shipping at German ports is in excess of German shipping at British ports  -  io? million tons as against  8$  million tons - but of this million tons of German shipping  4  million tons were simply in ballast, while of the io? million tons of British shipping,  3  million tons were in ballast ; so that, as far as cargoes were concerned, we were in the proportion of five to three. These figures have only to be mentioned for us to see at once how vulnerable our merchant shipping is. This is not said to disparage the value of the suggestions for the encouragement of British shipping, but to illustrate the special difficulties of our position as compared with that of the Colonies. There are methods by which the Colonies, or some of them, could give a very direct impetus to British shipping if they desired to do so - if for instance they were to relax some of their restrictions upon British ships which desire to enter into the coasting business in Australia more especially. As a matter of fact, in the last few years those conditions have been made very onerous; so onerous that they will drive British ships out of the Australian, trade altogether. </para>

If you superimpose absolutely fresh conditions in Australia the result will be that our own conditions will be quite nugatory, and ships which can enter and do trade in every other part of the world except Russia and the United States of America will not be allowed to enter the Australian coastwise trade. In fact, Australia will hit us harder than even France in that respect. If Australia wants to help British shipping, far and away the most effective way would be to treat us a little more generously in the matter of merchant shipping legislation. I am bound to say that, because the resolution comes from Australia.

                        <para>- They have gone pretty far. Allow me to point out that the British Imperial Parliament has been the pioneer of the world in the protection of the life and in the improvement of the conditions of seamen, and in the load-line regulations. We were the first to initiate legislation ; we were the first with regard to life-saving appliances; we were first with regard to seaworthy ships; and we have been first with regard to food scales, and I am not sure we have not been in advance of Australia. Australia is discussing a food scale. So that on the whole we are dealing with what is, after all, a very enormous interest in this country. I want the Australian delegates to remember that when we pass a law affecting shipping we are passing a law which affects the biggest interest in this country, and we have to move a huge body, and it is a much more difficult matter for us, apart from the principle, to propose retrospective legislation. We have about 11,000,000 tons of British shipping already constructed under the old conditions. That is a very gigantic interest, and I want <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> just to bear that in mind. We are moving very steadily, and we have moved in advance of Australia in one or two particulars; in fact, we have shown <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> the way. </para>

It  is  so small as to  be  scarcely worth while to cause any friction, or to precipitate any trouble, with the Old Land by interfering  with  it. The trade done by British vessels is also very small in comparison  with  the volume of the Inter-State trade. In these circumstances, is it wise to deal with either foreign or British ships, so as to create complications? As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George stated, the enormous trade of . Great Britain compels  a  very slow movement, but during the last year or two the conditions  have been  liberalized to a&#39;. very great extent. I shall reserve any reference to details until we get into Committee on the Bill. When the Government of Great Britain, with her enormous trade, in comparison with our  small  trade, invited  us  to send, delegates to talk things over with them, it was a great step to take, and a courteous thing to do. It showed how desirous they were to elicit the facts, to get at our minds, and to treat us with every possible consideration. We must be careful about the provisions we pass in this Bill. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> stated yesterday, the British Government have the right to hang up this Bill as they hung  up  the New Zealand Bill. They displayed a fair spirit towards the New Zealand Bill. They hung it up  for  a  while, but ultimately they assented to it, and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Ward insisted, without any proviso or promise regarding a reconsideration afterwards. I have no doubt that the Home Government will treat us fairly. Our Bill goes beyond the  New Zealand measure to a very considerable extent. </para>

If we stood entirely by ourselves we should not pass some of the legislation which we place on our statute-book. We pass it only because we have the Old Country at our back, and yet some of us are only too ready to slap the Old Country in the face when an opportunity offers. </para>

                            <para>- Nor is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham.</inline> I might mention another point on which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> touched to some extent. If we restrict competition from outside in the shipping industry, we shall only increase the local monopoly of which the honorable senator so bitterly complained. The great improvement which has taken place in our coastal shipping of late years has been due to the improvement in the shipping coming from outside. Local shipping has had to make some effort to keep pace with it. If the enterprise of those interested in foreign shipping visiting Australia had not operated as a whip to the back of local effort, we should not have the comfort and convenience afforded to-day by the ships of local companies engaged in our coasting trade, and, if the outside competition did not exist, the freights, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> complained,, would be increased. We should not forget that it is the competition of outside shipping that keeps our local ship-owners up to the mark. Whilst I am as strongly in favour of a White Australia as any one can be, I hold that we should be very careful about attempting to secure a&#62; white ocean. We ought to remember that at the present time&#39; there is great tension amongst some of the coloured races who own King Edward as </para>

                    <para>Sovereign,and, while keeping Australia white - and I give way to no man in my desire to do that - we should refrain from doing anything which would be likely to cause trouble outside our. own country whilst the tension to&#39; which I have referred continues. We must study the interests of our great primary industries and the position of the Empire, and we should not permit ourselves to be led. away by socialistic leaders, whose regard is not for the Empire or for the solid future of this country, but for the whims of the passing moment. Although it &#39;is not apparent on the surface, we should never forget that these movements in industrial and shipping matters are all part of a great attempt to drive us on to the nationalization of the shipping and other industries. I remind honorable senators that in the division which was taken on the motion submitted in another place by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> for the establishment of a Commonwealth line of mail steamers to conduct the oversea mail service, only members of the Labour Party voted for the motion, whilst every other member of the House of Representatives voted against it. This shows how careful we should be of the trend in Commonwealth legislation to which I have referred. </para>

                            <para>- I should like to know all the facts. Without a knowledge of the whole of the circumstances we are not in a position to judge to the full effect the utterances attributed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid.</inline> On the proposals to be found in this Bill for bettering the position of seamen, I trust that the Senate will be found to be unanimous. The very interesting speech which we heard from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie should convince every member of the Senate that the introduction of this Bill is justified by the provisions for the improvement of the conditions under which seamen have to carry on their work, if on no other ground. On these matters, I hope that we shall be a unanimous Senate. We should recognise that the more we improve a man&#39;s environment, the more likely we are to effect improvement in the man himself. We were afforded a lesson in this direction by the recent visit of the American Fleet in the character of the seamen and of the surroundings in which they were called upon to perform their duties. I have travelled in American ships, and I have found that if you elevate the surroundings of a seaman you will elevate the seaman himself. You increase his self-respect, because you give him an inducement to improve himself in accordance with his improved environment. </para>

                            <para>- There is nothing of Socialism in that, I hope. It is a doctrine of common humanity. Of course, with some honorable senators every good thing is a form of Socialism. But, whether this doctrine be socialistic or not, I trust we shall be found unanimous in every effort to improve the conditions of our seamen. I agree with what has been said as to the _ necessity for improved accommodation for seamen, but I think with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> that we should deal reasonably with the case of ships whose construction renders difficult compliance with the requirements for improved accommodation. . We should strive to pass a reasonable Act. We should not ignore any of the great interests which are sure to be affected by such a measure, because once it is passed it is likely to be many years before it will be amended. I trust that its consideration will not be hurried, that every clause will be given the attention which its importance demands, and that, acting conscientiously, we shall pass a measure which will be in the forefront of the navigation laws of the world, will be fair to our own people, to the British Empire, and generally to a.ll with whom we have to trade. </para>
