                        <para>- This is merely a formal motion to enable me to obtain an opportunity to debate the question of which I have given notice. &#39; The subject with which I wish to deal seems to call for very few remarks from me, and to demand rather that 1 should bring forward evidence to disprove a gross slander upon a very large body of .my constituents. The charges made by the Postmaster-General are well known. I must consider them, not as charges made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline> in his. private capacity, or as a private member of Parliament, but as slanders by a Minister of the Crown, whose position increases the wrong done to a large body of honorable men. - 1 know something of the miners of New South Wales, my Connexion with them haying been fairly close.  Two companies of <inline font-style="italic">my</inline> regiment consist exclusively of coal-miners, and I know the honorable and&#34; sober character of these men. Although they do not live&#39; in the Maitland district, they are, I take it, a fair sample of the mining population of New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>- The men in the companies of which I speak live in the South Coast district; but there is a considerable interchange of miners between that  .and the Newcastle and Maitland districts. Of the men who have been slandered, many, while working in the Maitland district, have their homes in the Newcastle district, travelling between their homes and the mines by train.  The Postmaster-General visited the Maitland district, was handsomely received there, being welcomed by the playing of brass bands, and with other demonstrations of good will ; but, on his return to Sydney, he thought fit - prompted by some anonymous informant - to slander those who had entertained him, by stating that, of the 3,000 men in the district, one out of every five became so intoxicated on Pay Saturday that he could not resume work before the following Wednesday, and went back then only because, if he did not do so, he would lose . his place in the mine. That was equivalent to saying that  600  men in the district are wretched drunkards, who indulge in excesses every fortnight, and was ;a most offensive calumny to be uttered by a Minister of the Crown on no better authority than the alleged statement of a policeman.  I  have not acted hurriedly in this matter, having patiently, day after day, asked the Vice-President of the Executive Council if reparation would be made, and, finally, if the Government &#34;would agree to the appointment, of a Select Committee to investigate the charge. As I could not get the promise of either, I asked yesterday if Ministers approved or disapproved of the statement of their colleague, and again received no reply. As the old north country saying has it, &#34;there are more ways of killing a dog than choking him with butter,&#34; and I am taking a new way in this instance, by moving the adjournment. I am proud to say that I am not acting alone in the matter, having been asked by several honorable senators to take this course. Not being satisfied with the utterances to which I have taken exception, the Postmaster-General has :since, at a &#34; Pleasant Sunday Afternoon,&#34; or some other gathering in Melbourne, repeated his slanders, again on the authority of some one who prefers to remain anonymous. Surely, there is. some limit to a man&#39;s right to slander his fellows, or, if not, there must be some redress for those who are slandered. I, therefore, ask the representatives of the States assembled in this Chamber to indicate by some expression of opinion their disapproval of the wholesale slandering by the Postmaster- </para>

                <para class="block">General of electors of the Commonwealth. What would be the position had I c:&#62;me to Melbourne and uttered a similar slander in reference to 3,000 gold miners in the Bendigo district? There would not be enough printer&#39;s ink to smother me, or enough blue metal in the streets to pelt me, and I should have deserved both had I done such a thing. But, in the opinion of some persons here, the people of New South Wales may be abused as much as they please. I do not -think that that is the view of the Senate, and I cannot believe that the Ministry, whatever its initial sympathies may be, has fallen so low as to unitedly approve of such a slander of human beings by one of their number. I am a temperate man, and approve of the principle of temperance, but I am afraid that I cannot, be quite so temperate in speech when dealing with such a matter as this as I should like to be. I certainly do not want to fall into the error which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline> made, of using outrageous language in discussing a subject which deserves very different treatment. However much the Postmaster-General may represent the dignity and purity of temperance in respect of the use of liquor, in this instance, at least, he has not represented the purity of temperance in his language. I have some evidence of how his comments are regarded by the people against whom they were made. I shall read, in the first instance, resolutions adopted by the Committee of Management of the Collieries Employes&#39; Federation of the Newcastle District - </para>

                <para class="block">Those resolutions are framed with most commendable care, and are free from any extravagance or wildness of phraseology. They might have come from persons occupying a more prominent official position than the members of this Committee do. I  have some other statements by persons whose opinions in respect of this matter ought surely to be entitled to respect. First of all, I quote the views of Police-Superintendent Saunders, a gentleman known to me for upwards of twenty years as a very high-class police officer, who years ago had charge of the Broken Hill district. I was present at the opening of the railway to Broken Hill, twenty years ago, when I saw probably 8.000 or 10,000 miners in the streets after a long holiday of  jolification,  and neither at night-fall, nor at it p.m., when I was on my way to the train, did I see a drunken man amongst them. Superintendent Saunders, when interviewed on this subject, said he - could not express any opinion about the miners of the Maitland coal-field, but from what he knew of miners generally, and he had spent the best part of his life amongst them, he could certainly say that, as a class, they were no more addicted to drinking than any other body of workmen. He had not gone into the matter, but he firmly believed that if the police court records were examined, it would be found that miners did not figure more prominently than any other class of men in fines for drunkenness. </para>

He, too, had spent much of his life in south-coast and northern mining districts, and could honestly say that for sobriety the miners compared favorably with any other class of workmen. One had only to walk through the streets of West Maitland on a pay Saturday, when hundreds of miners from the  coal-field could be seen. There was almost an entire absence of drunkenness. The miner, like many other men, was fond of his glass, but because he went to the hotel for a drink on or after pay-day, that was no reason why he should be classed as an excessive drinker. The statement that one out of every five of the miners on the Maitland coal-field was an excessive drinker after pay-day, could not be borne out by evidence. </para>

It was true that a large number of men would assemble at an hotel on pay-day, but only a very small percentage, perhaps one in thirty, would drink to excess. No man in the district was better qualified to express an opinion on such a matter than he, and no man would more fearlessly denounce drunkenness than he would.

                        The miners could afford to laugh at such an unfounded statement, but for the fact that prominence had been given to it by the office held by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger.</inline>
                        It &#34; was necessary to overtake such a lie, and to have the truth made known. Regarding the loss &#39;of shifts by some men after pay-day, that arose from the fact that they lived in Newcastle district and batched at Kurri Kurri or elsewhere on the field. On pay-day, they went home to Newcastle, and on Monday took a day off.

                <para class="block">Those who know anything about coal mining in New South Wales are aware that this statement is true; it is a rational and easily comprehensible one. These men, living in more or less discomfort twenty miles from home for a fortnight at a stretch, on the Saturday following pay day return, to their families, and, not unnaturally, take a day off on the Monday. I suppose that there is no enormity in taking a day off. Even honorable senators commit that crime, if it be a crime. But dare any one accuse them of being drunk because they occasionally take a day off? </para>

                <para>I do not think it is necessary for me to say any more upon the subject. As far as I am able to do so, I am speaking on behalf of my absent constituents, and every honorable senator has a right to do that. Indeed, it is not only his right, but his duty to do it, seeing that his constituents are not here to speak for themselves. As far as I can, I am voicing the opinions of my. constituents in thus reprobating the most unwarrantable attack that&#39; has ever been made by a Minister of the Crown upon any body of Australian workmen. I very much regret that I should have had to occupy the time of the Senate even to the extent of ten minutes or a quarter of an hour in dealing with this matter. I feel sure that some debate will follow. The large number of honorable senators who rose to indorse my action in seeking to move the adjournment of the Senate is plain proof that a good deal of feeling upon this question exists in the- Chamber. I hope that the discussion will lead to such a refraction on the part of the Postmaster-General as will be satisfactory alike to the miners whose characters have been assailed., to the Postmaster-General himself, and to the Ministry whom his indiscretion has seriously&#39; besmirched. There is no member of the Cabinet who has not to bear some share of responsibility for the utterances of his colleagues unless he chooses to repudiate them. I hope that the Prime Minister will repudiate the allegations of the Postmaster-General, and thus lift his colleagues out of the unpleasant position in which they have been placed by being associated with reckless slanders against a body of men in respect of whom there is no justification for alleging that they are less temperate or less well conducted than is any other body of workers in the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>. - As an old Newcastle miner, and one who for many years represented the miners of that district both in private and public affairs, I cannot allow this occasion to pass without making a few observations. I am sorry that&#39; there should be&#39; any occasion for a question of this kind to be raised in the Senate. I regret the public manner in which charges against the Newcastle miners have been made by the Postmaster-General, and repeated by  him.  Of course I can understand any public man making a mistake, and afterwards, when he discovered how groundless was his accusation, withdrawing it. But in the present instance <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline> has seen fit to repeat what I know from personal knowledge to be a gross calumny upon the .Newcastle miners. Under such circumstances if I&#39; were to remain silent my silence would be interpreted as giving consent to allegations which I know to be as far removed from the truth as it is possible for them to be. I do not for a moment claim that all the </para>

                <para class="block">Newcastle miners are saints. I dare say that they contain a fair share of sinners. But I have never lived in any mining community where there was a larger percentage of steady, sober men than- is to be found in the Newcastle district. In no mining district that I know of will there be found so large a percentage of men who are their own landlords, owning their own homes and their own plots of ground, on which they spend their spare time. No body of men in any district take greater pride in having decent homes than do the Newcastle miners. If the charge which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline> has seen fit to make against them were true, those things would not be so evident in the Newcastle district as they undoubtedly are- to those who have visited the district and know the lives of the miners. When he saw that objection was taken to his remarks, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline> should have made inquiries, and then, if he found that the objection was well-founded, he should have withdrawn the charges. Until he knew that they were true, his duty, &#34;in view of the high position that he occupies in the public life of the Commonwealth, was not to repeat mere tattling that had come to him second-hand from a policeman. If he had been fully seized of the importance of the question and his own position, he would have turned a deaf ear to those remarks rather than re-hash them at other gatherings &#39; away from. the district in which he had heard them. I dare say that there is in the Newcastle district the same amount of drinking as will be found in most big communities. In Newcastle proper, which is a seaport, visited principally by oversea ships, most of them manned by foreigners, I dare say a great deal of drunkenness will be found. But it is not in the city of Newcastle that the Newcastle miner dwells, nor does he even visit it very often.  He lives in- the subordinate townships, which extend for twenty or thirty miles around Newcastle. In any of those townships will be found as steady and sober a set of men as are to be found in the Commonwealth. Knowing the Newcastle miner as I do, I am obliged to give expression to these views now that the question has cropped up in the Senate in this public manner. I wish to make all due allowances- for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger.</inline> We know that for some time a certain epidemic has been passing over Victoria, and no doubt&#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline> has become inoculated with the microbe. Like many an- other good man, he has gone wrong. We are all sorry for it, and it is our duty to bring him back to the right track. There seems to be a wave of intemperate language passing over this community in reference to the drink question. </para>

                        <para>- The Judkinsmicrobe seems to be getting into the blood of ever so many good men. I hope that the lesson which we are giving them to-day will- bring them back to a more temperate frame&#34; of mind, especially when they are referring to people at a distance. Statistics, compiled by the Victorian Statistician show that the people of New South Wales are a more sober lot than those of Victoria, ira that the drink bill per head of the population of New South Wales is 5s. rod. less, than that of Victoria. Therefore, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger,</inline> if he wishes to do good in the way of lessening the amount of drink consumed, need not go out of his own State to find work. I know that there is a great deal of agitation going on in connexion with the drink traffic in and around Melbourne. Much of it I do not agree with, and much of the language indulged in by these agitators does a great deal more  harm than good. The statements made by the Postmaster-General will not raise him in the estimation of the community, or be supported by those who know the real state of affairs in Newcastle and the Maitland district. I am sorry to have to make these remarks with reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger,</inline> but he -should be more careful of his language when he visits distant parts of the Commonwealth on business connected with, his Ministerial office. He should, as far. as possible, confine his work and his speeches to his duties as Postmaster-General, and to what is going on in his great Department. I am sure he has plenty of scope for the exercise of his talents there. There is no need for him to go out preaching to the Newcastle miners about their weakness for drink. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators must draw some distinction between the expressions of opinion uttered in the discharge of ministerial duties and the mere private expressions of opinion of an individual.

                        <para>- That may be; but honorable senators can readily understand that other Ministers do not devote their attention to the mere private expressions of the opinion of a colleague. I have only the general idea that at some temperance gathering my colleague saw fit to make certain statements. I do not hesitate to speak in the highest terras of &#39;the miners as a class. I have had the privilege of association with them from time to time. I feel that they are entitled to the most generous consideration, and&#39; to be regarded as amongst the most worthy of our citizens. That is my personal view; but I ask honorable senators to consider dispassionately whether the matter which has been brought before the Chamber is, after all, not really a personal issue as between the Postmaster-General and the miners themselves. </para>

                        <para>- Thaf may be; I dp not pretend to say whether that is the fact or not ; but, assuming the language to have been used, it is unreasonable to attempt to make the Ministry responsible. From that stand-point I deny any right of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild.</inline> to regard the statement made as any more than a private statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger.</inline> I do not pretend to know the merits of the case, though, like other honorable senators, I have seen various statements in the press. Supposing the. statement were true - which I do not suggest for one moment - is a member of the Government not at liberty to assert what he believes to be true, and is the responsibility to be cast upon the Government of proving the truth? Surely that is a most unreasonable contention. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline> is responsible for his action in his private capacity, and the time of the Senate ought not to be occupied in dealing with a matter which lies between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline> and the miners - a matter which mav be decided in the Law Courts if the miners feel aggrieved because of any slanderous statements, or as to which, as has been done, they may repudiate the allegation. No Government can be regarded as responsible for the private . expression of opinion by  a  gentleman : who happens to be a member of  the Ministry. No doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline> is prepared to take all responsibility ; and he may be called upon either to prove or withdraw his statement. That is a matter for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger,</inline> not for the Ministry. Moreover, I may say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> did not emphasize the courtesy which is characteristic of him, and mention to me his intention to move the adjournment of the Senate. </para>

                    <para>. - I am sure that honorable senators sympathize with the Vice-President of the  Executive Council in his somewhat unfortunate position- the honorable gentleman is between the deep sea and a historical personage. The Vice-President of the Executive Council, should he attempt in any way to approve of the utterances of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger,</inline> would have to share the lesponsi-&#39; ability which, as he says, at present rests on that gentleman himself. On the other hand it would be uncomfortable for him, with other honorable senators, to express disapprobation of the utterances of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger;</inline> and, under the circumstances, every, one must sympathize with the Vice-President, of the Executive Council. However, as briefly as I can, I should like to refer to one or. two reasons which the honorable gentleman put forward for &#34;the view he has pressed on the Senate. He has made the best Of a rather bad case;&#39; but I claim indulgence while I look a little closer into the matter. First of all, the Vice-President of the Executive Council overlooks one fact. He tried to draw a distinction - and I admit that it is a distinction that can be drawn - rbetween <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline> as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger,.</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline> as the Postmaster-General. It must not be overlooked, however - and to my mind this is one of the serious aspects of the case - that it was not <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline> who visited the Newcastle district and got his information - it was not <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger,</inline> one of Melbourne&#39;s citizens, as a private individual, who was made the guest of a large number of people in the locality, and was enabled to obtain material for statements which he gave to the world at- large - but it was the Postmaster-General. Further, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline> wasannounced to speak in Sydney, it was not merely <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline> who was billed, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger,</inline> Postmaster-General. The attempt made by the Vice-President of the&#39; Executive Council to dissociate <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline> from the Postmaster-General recalls to our mind Gilbert and Sullivan&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Mikado.</inline> In that opera the Lord High. Executioner holds many offices, in one of which he sentences himself to death, and in another of which he formally reprieves himself. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline> may have many capacities, and probably in one he will sentence himself for his utterances, and in another will give himself a free pardon. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> says that it is not possible for, him to determine the merits of the dispute ; but I point out that it is possible to see whether there is any justification for the libel by looking into the statistics. There are something like 15,000 coalminers in New South Wales, though what percentage is in the Newcastle district I cannot say. </para>

                        <para>- I should say that it is a safe estimate that at least half of the coal-miners of New South Wales are in Newcastle. &#39; If we take the percentage of coal-miners who are said by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline> to give way to intemperance, it will be seen at once that not all the paid magistracy, not all the honorary magistracy, and certainly not the very insignificant police force in Newcastle, would be sufficient to control the alleged deluge of intemperance. I have not actual figures, but sometime ago I looked into this drink question as affecting various trades and callings within the Commonwealth, and to my surprise and pleasure I found that, so far as the information was available, the Newcastle coal miners need not fear comparison with any other body of men in New South Wales. That being so, it is not only regrettable but reprehensible that any one occupying a position like that of Postmaster-General should, on the public platform, make statements of the kind, without being absolutely assured of their accuracy. It is, to my mind, a serious breach of the rules of hospitality that such a statement was made, and if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger&#39;s</inline> desire was to do good, and not merely make a sensational speech for the purpose of pleasing his particular hearers, it would have been much more manly to have addressed the miners them- selves, and pointed out how it was possible for them to lead better lives as men and citizens. On the contrary, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline> parted with the Newcastle people on the best of terms, and then proceeded to Sydney, where he made the speech of which complaint is made. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think he could please any one; but, knowing something of the coal miners, I am convinced they would have honoured <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger,</inline> where . to-day they blame him, if, seeing, as he thought, an evil, he had called them together and said, &#34;Men, I tell you of the evil course you are following, and urge that, in justice to yourselves, you ought to do better in the future.&#34; The miners would respect a man who thus spoke; but, instead, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline> parted from them without a word, and afterwards made the speech which he repeated on the first public occasion in Melbourne. There was ample time between the original statement and its repetition, seeing that it was challenged, for &#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline> to have sought for further information. If he had sought for thar information he would, I am convinced, have found that he had . been, led astray bv possibly one or two intemperate men like himself.  His  proper course, if he found out that he was wrong, would have been to take the earliest opportunity to withdraw the reflection, and to apologize. If, on the -other hand, he found that he was right, he should have given the source of the information which presumably he thought justified him in repeating the statement. </para>

                        <para>- I have no doubt that the Postmaster- General told the truth so far as he was concerned, but seeing that the statement was challenged in the first instance, it was due to the miners of Newcastle, as well as to himself, that he should have immediately set to work to obtain official and other information to enable him to determine whether or not he had libelled that body of men. If he had. . his course was clear, but without further inquiry he blindly repeated the statement, and to that extent seriously increased the enormity ot the offence of which, I think, he has been guilty. </para>

                    <para>. - In the first place,I desire to complimentt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> for having taken the wise course of offering a protest to the Senate, in the interests of a large concourse of his constituents. I do not intend to speak for many minutes, because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has anticipated very largely what I had intended to say. I sincerely hope that the protest which has been made here this morning, and which) I indorse, will be sufficiently strong: to induce the . Postmaster-General to apologize, not only to the Newcastle miners, but: to the whole of the Commonwealth, for having, in an intoxicated moment, made an exaggerated statement. That it was an intoxicated moment we may well believe, because I think, that a cool, clear-headed man like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline> would, were he not intoxicated by the position which he then occupied, have reasoned more closely with himself, and would not have been led away by the influences of the place in which he stood. It is quite evident that in the WorrallJudkinsMauger fraternity there is a desire on the part of the members to vie with each other in certain statements. I think that those men ought not to be allowed to publicly denounce large bodies of respectable men - men about whom they know nothing personally, and with whom they have had no connexion other than by means of a flying visit, such as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline> paid to Newcastle. It grates on the ears of men who, like myself, have lived and worked the better part of a life-time. in mining communities, and know thousands of miners personally, to hear of such an exaggerated statement as was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger.</inline> Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> I can say that there is. not in Australia to-day a more upright body of men than the miners - certainly there are no men who are more jealous of their integrity and good name, or more ready <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> listen to wise counsels than they are. Had <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline> had a spark of gentlemanliness about him, had he even shown a desire to manifest true manhood, had he gone out to the Newcastle miners and said to them, &#34;Now, T have something to say to you that will be for your welfare here, and for the betterment of your children,&#34; I could have appreciated his action, sympathized with him, and probably indorsed most of what he might have said. . But having gone into Newcastle and seen the men. I think that it ill became a Minister of the Crown to go to another place and mingle with an intoxicated, intemperate Crowd for the purpose of merely creating a sort of counter-sensation to the utterances of a . Worrall or a Judkins. I sincerely hope that the protest uttered here this morning will be sufficiently strong to at least recall <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline> to earth, and let him know that he is Postmaster-General, that he was introduced to the Newcastle district, and also spoke there as a public man, and that the discharge of his public responsibilities ought to be of greater moment to him than a mere desire to flaunt any principle which for his personal welfare he may have adopted. I hope that in future he- will express his views without attempting to insult other people. </para>

                    </talker>
                    <para>. - Iamglad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has brought this matter before the Senate, though, of course, I regret vecy much the necessity for his action. I recognise that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline> is a man who has devoted a great part of his life to the study of social questions. I realize that, in availing himself of an opportunity to speak against the liquor traffic, he was acting consistently with his previous conduct. If, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> aptly put it, he became intoxicated when he was speaking, and was deceived as regards the peculiar conditions of the Newcastle &#34;miners, I could perhaps forgive him for using that extravagant language which is sometimes indulged in by all of us who are saturated with an ideal. But what I cannot forgive the Postmaster-General for is that when he learned that a protest, and a very legitimate protest, had been made by those who represent the men Whom he attacked - if he had any knowledge of the environment of the miners he must have known that his words were exaggerated - he, being a responsible Minister of the Crown, did not at once publicly announce that he was mistaken in his views. It is quite clear to me that he had not looked very deeply into. the facts before he spoke. My knowledge of the working classes of the Old Country and of the Commonwealth is pretty extensive. I have moved among them all my life, and I think that I. understand them. I believe that, man for man, there is less drinking amongst the working classes of Australia, among whom I include the miners, than there is in any other class. I venture to say that even in New South Wales there is no more and no less drinking - human nature being very much the same in all classes - in the higher walks of life than in the lower walks. If there is a body of men who are healthy, sturdy, and independent, and who, despite the social conditions in which they live, are good fathers and good citizens, I believe that it is the workers in the mines of Newcastle and other districts. It should always be remembered that the social life of the miner is a very hard one. Wherever such conditions exist, it will be found that at the end of a term,&#34; say, fourteen days, when regular payments are made, there&#34; is a little demonstration, just as occurs when a ship&#39;s crew is paid off. But even that is not characteristic of the average of the men. A noisy few may often be assumed to represent a great many more than is the case. It is so in this instance. I feel sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline> will regret having made his statement without sufficient evidence, but having made it, and it- having been proved to him that it has given pain to a very large number of people in the Commonwealth - because his remarks apply not only to the miners of Newcastle but to the miners throughout Australia, who regard it as an attack upon them generally - I do hope that he will tender to these workmen what is their due, namely, either a full exposure of the evidence upon which he made his assertions, or an entire withdrawal of them. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline>
                    LEDGER (Queensland) &#91;12.1&#93;. - I think that the debate will do all the good that it was intended to-bring about. The statement attributed to
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline>
                    is a libel and a slander upon a certain class 01 men, and, as
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline>
                    has pointed out, it reflects not merely upon those who were the immediate object of attack, but upon the whole manhood of Australia. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has pointed out the distinction that the statement was made by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger,</inline>
                    and not by the Postmaster-General. We may admit that within certain limitations. But, &#39; on the other hand, we must remember that the statement will go forth to the world as that of a Commonwealth Minister, who has had the audacity or worse to stand up and libel a certain section of the manhood of. Australia. The country has hostile critics enough outside as well as within its borders, and we are naturally inclined to put our foot down very heavily against those who slander our good name. I do not think it needs anything by way of asseveration from me to show that the manhood of this country compares with the very best manhood of humanity in social and in other virtues. But when we find a Minister of the Crown identified with a statement that reflects most unjustly upon a particular class&#39; of individuals, and when we know that the reflection may be extended against the whole of our manhood, we are perfectly justified in drawing special attention to it. If
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline>
                    had made his statement merely as
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline>
                    the miners of Newcastle could have allowed it to pass unnoticed, and would have done so. It is because
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline>
                    happens by grace of somebody to be a Minister that his words and actions have been brought up in the Senate. I have said that sometimes our public men make very rash statements with regard to Australia. I have seen in our literature, historical and otherwise, some statements with regard to  this country which have fallen from the lips and pens of Australian leaders of thought, that have made me blush- for them and express my indignation. I believe that.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline>
                    will have not! only the support of every man in- the Senate in his criticism, but will be supported by every decent man and woman in Australia.

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline>
                    and his colleague as Postmaster-General. Now, sir, I have not, of course, had the opportunity  10  hunt up precedents or warranties for what I am going to say, but I am sure that the recollection of every member of the Senate will support me.

                        <para>- If the. honorable senator&#39;s contention be right, it amounts to this - that it would be a matter of indifference to a Cabinet if one of its members committed burglary. I know that that is a <inline font-style="italic">reductio ad absurdum,</inline> but it is the logical sequence of the honorable senator&#39;s assertion that a Cabinet has no possible connexion with the alleged private utterances of one of its members, so that a Minister may, in claiming that he is acting in &#39;his private capacity, say or do anything. The position is not a tolerable one. If the remarks by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline> had been said privately it would have been quite a different, matter, but they were uttered at a meeting, called by advertisement, to hear an address by the Honorable Samuel Mauger, Postmaster-General of the Commonwealth. It is simply impossible for a member of the Ministry to go on to a public platform under such circumstances and dissociate his utterances from his position. If his had been the utterance ot a private member of either House of Parliament should I have dreamed of bringing it before the Senate? Certainly not. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline> did not occupy the position of -Postmaster-General I should not have troubled the Senate by bringing the matter up for consideration. It is because of the high position that that gentleman occupies that importance is added to his very intemperate and unworthy assertions. I- am quite sure that it is unnecessary for me to pursue the matter further. Of course, I do not intend to call for a division upon the motion. I did not seek to do anything more than afford an opportunity for myself, and other honorable senators, to say what is appropriate in behalf of men whose case could not otherwise be heard here. It is all very well for lodges to pass resolutions, and send them to the Postmaster-General, but these resolutions have not received the publicity which his charges obtained, or which will be given to this debate. I do not think that honorable senators consider justifiable the strictures passed on me bv the Vice-President of the Executive Council, for  :having brought the matter before them. I -recognise the awkwardness of the position &#34;.to him, to his colleagues, and to the Post.masterGeneral, and have no wish to &#34;rub it in.&#34; Indeed, I did not attempt to do so. I should not have said what I did in regard to Ministerial responsibility, had it not been for the remarks of the Vice-President of the Executive Council. Although, in supporting the motion, I may have made some incidental references to the public position of the Postmaster-General, I did not attempt to carry the debate so far as it has been carried by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. I thank honorable senators for the support which they have given to me. I am sure that this brief discussion will afford great satisfaction to the large body of honorable men on whose behalf I have ventured to speak, as one of their representatives. With the leave of the Senate, I wish now to withdraw the motion. </para>

                    <para>. - It seems to me that in no division of the Tariff are increases in duty, more regular and excessive than in this. There are items in other divisions in connexion with which there may be bigger increases, but the average increase is bigger in connexion with the items of this division than in connexion with those of the other divisions. It is proposed to increase the duty on blacking from 20 to 40 and 35 per cent. As is natural, the recommendations of the free-trade and protectionist sections of the Tariff Commission in regard to this item differ ; but I feel it my duty to draw attention to very curious and regrettable omissions in the summary of&#39; evidence put forward by the latter. On page 234 of the  report of the protectionist section, it is stated that - </para>

                <para class="block">That statement is correct so far as it goes; but the witness added something which entirely destroyed its value, but to which there is no reference in the paragraph from which I have quoted. Having complained of the insufficiency of the duty, he went on to say, according to the report of the free-trade section -  &#34;We are doing a fair trade, considering that we have just started.&#34; There were two or three other makers in South Australia, but he was early in the market.

Honorable senators, will find in other parts of this schedule the other articles included in the original item in the first Federal Tariff. Oils for leather are covered by item 234. Ink and stains for leather have been embodied in a separate item - item 425 - and we do not adopt&#39; with regard to them the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff&#34; Commission that a duty of 35 per cent, be imposed. We have imposed a duty of merely 20 per cent. Varnishes for leather have been allowed to fall under the general heading of &#34;Varnishes,&#34; item 237. The Government proposed in respect of that item a duty of 30 per cent., or, in the alternative, a duty of 2s. per gallon. Another place, however, determined to impose a. fixed duty of 2s. 6d. per gallon. Berlin&#39; and Brunswick blacks have also been removed from the compass of the original item and placed under item 237, since they more properly belong to the varnish class. </para>

                        <para>- No; because we imposed a duty of 40 per cent, in respect of the item now before us, whereas on item 237 we proposed a duty of 30 per cent., or 2s. per gallon. That proposition was amended by another place, a fixed duty of 2s. 6d. per gallon being imposed. What I wish specially to point out, however, <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> that the corresponding item under the old Tariff was far more comprehensive, and that the Tariff Commission recommended that a duty of 35 per cent, should be imposed on the goods covered by it. Instead of adopting that recommendation, we have cut up the item, and some goods which were formerly included in it are now appearing, at a lower duty, in other portions&#39; of the Tariff. In addition .to those already mentioned by me, bronzing and mer.-r powders, which appeared in the corresponding item in the old Tariff have been taken out, and made a separate item- - item 232- - dutiable at 20 per cent. I think that honorable senators will see that we have not increased the old Tariff bv 100 per cent, in respect- of all these articles. We have done so only in regard to those mentioned in item 230. The imports of blacking, including dressings, in 1903 were of the value of &#163;41,180. In 1904 they were valued at &#163;46,501; in 1905, &#163;56,372; and in 1906, </para>

I understand that we have in the Commonwealth all the materials necessary for making these goods, and in view of the steady increase in imports one cannot help wondering whether the protection hitherto afforded the manufacturers of these goods was adequate. The fact that the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission has been exceeded in respect of one or two lines is compensated for, to some extent, by many other articles which appeared in the cor-, responding item in the old Tariff being subjected to a lower duty. </para>

                <para>The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission were extremely careful to omit that statement from their summary of the evidence. It is a most important point, throwing an interesting light on a question that is continually cropping up, as to whether these duties are or are not going to increase prices. This witness candidly admitted that if his request were granted- and it is proposed now to accede to it - the public would pay more than they now do. He did not in any way say that he was not selling his goods; he gave evidence that his industry was a growing one. What lie pointed out was the obvious fact that if we imposed such a duty as would prohibit the sale of the imported article, under 7d. per tin, he could sell his polishes at 6d. per tin, as against 3d. and 4jd. per tin, the market price of the imported polishes under the old Tariff. If honorable senators are content to impose this duty in order to enable this gentleman to put 3d. per tin on the price of his goods, notwithstanding that under the old Tariff he was able to carry on a profitable business, and despite the warning given by the man . himself that he intends to increase . prices if this step be taken, the responsibility must rest with them. </para>

The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission declare that no advantage is to be derived from retaining the duty upon graphite or plumbago, as the two or three individuals&#39; in the Commonwealth who have used locally produced plumbago had to discard it on account of its unsuitability for their purposes. I think that the Committee are entitled to know upon what information the Government have reversed their former decision &#34;to admit this article free. </para>

                <para class="block">In reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> I may say that in the form in which this schedule was introduced in another place this item was free. If honorable senators will look at the fourth column of the tabulated statement supplied to them they will see that the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended the imposition of a duty of 35 per cent, upon graphite and plumbago. Through an inadvertence, however, a proposal was submitted to the other Chamber tn admit these articles free. The Government,, through the Treasurer, pointed out that a mistake had occurred, and proceeded to rectify it by asking the Committee to impose a duty of . is per cent., which was the rate recommended by the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission. That is the whole explanation of what1 has occurred; in connexion with this item. It was really not the intention of the Government that it should be included in the free list. I am informed that graphite and plumbago are produced in considerable quantities in South Australia. Large deposits exist there, and also in other parts of the Commonwealth - deposits which I understand can be worked <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> commercial advantage. With regard to black lead and foundry black both these articles are manufactured in Australia in fairly large quantities. Despite this fact, however, a considerable quantity has been imported. There is no separate record of these imports except in the case of black lead, of which we imported ,&#163;4,227 worth in <inline font-style="italic">!9&#176;3&#62;</inline> ;&#163;3&#62;&#176;68  worth in 1904, .&#163;3,091 worth in 1905, and j&#163;i,55i worth from the United Kingdom in 1906. We have exported a few small consignments of black lead to the South Sea Islands,- but that product has come from abroad. None of the black lead made in Australia has been exported. Seeing that we can successfully produce plumbago and graphite in Queensland and South Australia, and that we are producing black lead and foundry black, a duty of 20 per cent, is not too high a rate to impose upon this item, especially iri view of the fact that the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty of 35 per cent. </para>

                    <para>.- The  Minister affirms that the article can be produced locally. The evidence of those who have to use it is that owing to some difference in the grain, or for some other reason, it is not suitable for their particular work. Let us assume for the sake of argument that it is suitable. We are asked to impose a duty of 20 per cent, because we are told it will stimulate a local industry. The consumption of this article in Australia is about 600 tons. I am credibly informed that two or three men. in a suitable mine, could knock that stuff out in about a month. That is the big industry we are asked to stimulate !  </para>

If we produce this article, and have to pay trainage- the only  two mines I know of in Australia would have to pay some trainage, one of them a considerable amount - and then pay freight to Europe, we shall not be able to compete with the, at least, equal, and most people allege superior, article from Ceylon. </para>

                        <para>- I am not in possession of evidence to the contrary, but I remember reading, a few months ago, testimonials from people, stating that the Australian article was equal in every respect to that imported from Ceylon. There are almost unlimited quantities of it in South Australia and Queensland. The industry&#39; at present is not very large, but it is not so small as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> endeavoured to make out, when he said that a few men could produce the whole quantity required for Australia in about a month. He omitted to mention that after it has been mined it must go through other processes before it becomes fit for use in the various in&#39;dustries in which it is required. </para>

                        <para>- Seeing that the witnesses were asking for pretty stiff duties, I do not know how the honorable senator can so dismiss them. The interjection of the honorable senator almost relieves me from the necessity of reading the extract from the report of the Tariff Commission. If the innuendo of the honorable senator has any force, it would have saved a  lot of trouble if, when a man came before trie Tariff Commission, he had been asked whether he was a free-trader or a protectionist. If the witness happened to be a protectionist, he could have been told to go ahead as much as he liked, but, if he were a free-trader,, he might as well have been asked to step down, because he was convicted before he opened his mouth. The witnesses to whom I refer were, however, not free-traders; and the interjection by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> only means that, no matter what the evidence, he is prepared to accept only what suits him, the rest, although given on oath, being dismissed. </para>

I do not often detain honorable senators by telling a story, but I think I may on the present occasion, just in order to illustrate- the honorable senator&#39;s contention. Some time ago, at an election in New South Wales, a candidate was confronted by a quotation from a speech which he had made in Parliament. The candidate immediately demanded to see a copy, and, when he saw it, he exclaimed, &#34;Why, this is <inline font-style="italic">Hansard;</inline> it is a free-trade publication ! &#34; That suggestion quite sufficed to relieve the candidate of his difficulty ; and in a similar way we may accept the interjection of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story,</inline> by which we are invited to reject sworn evidence, simply because it is that of free-trade witnesses. Although the evidence was given subject to examination by protectionist Commissioners, the following is from the report of the Tariff Commission : - </para>

                    <para>The manufacturer of black lead in Melbourne admitted that plumbago, graphite, foundry black, and black lead were all practically the same material. Graphite was an inferior quality of plumbago. He imported the latter from Ceylon of varying quantities and values, <inline font-style="italic">&#163;8</inline> to per ton, and to make foundry blacks simply blended and ground it. so as to make an even sample at a medium price, ^&#39;13 to &#163;14 per lon. There was no  possibility,  he thought, of using the local plumbago. Nearly every week samples were offered to him, but none of them were good enough. The Australian product was not fit for his purposes; it was a rough, hard kind of stone, and could not be treated here, while that which he imported from Ceylon was a soft lubricator. He- admitted that .foundry black, as plumbago so treated is called, was supplied to foundries for casting purposes, and was indispensable to them. Black lead was plumbago&#39; in bulk or made up into blocks, packets, &#38;c, for retail trade. He asked for 100 per cent, duty, which he considered would be equal to 2s. 6d. per box of 1 gross of i-oz. packets. He did not want 100 per cent, to cover cost of wages, but to shut out the imported article and compel consumers to take the  colonially-put-up  article. He admitted that some qualities of his black lead were sold at is. per gross less than the imported makes. The witness desired plumbago free as his raw material, and in that he was supported by a witness in Adelaide. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is now endeavouring to escape from a difficulty he has created. Before he even knew the names of the witnesses, he was prepared to dismiss their evidence as that of unworthy free-traders. Thank Heaven, the honorable senator has not sufficient power to prevent the formation of independent judgment in fiscal matters ! One of the witnesses, who, so far as we can judge, spoke honestly, said that nearly every week he was offered samples of this commodity, but that if was not good enough for his purpose. There is no reason to suppose that this manufacturer would continue to import the commodity at a high price if he could obtain it at the same or a lower price locally. I can understand a protectionist contending that a little more stimulus would encourage the production of  this mineral, or whatever it may be called ; but we must remember that the consumption is so small that this industry is not worth considering, in view of the injury which might thereby be done to other and more important trades. This commodity is used very largely in the making of castings. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has, I am sure innocently, misrepresented some evidence which was given. I remember reading that evidence, which was to the effect that the material was used for fine castings - not that it was unsuitable for such castings. We hope, under the new Tariff, to see a very large development in the iron industry, which will lead to an increased demand for this material for the purpose I have indicated: and that, I think, meets the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that the item under consideration is only a small one. There is every probability in the near future, when the iron industry has developed, of a very much increased demand for this material. </para>

                    <para>. -  The question whether this commodity is or is not of use in the making of fine castings is of very serious importance. We all know how delicate an operation is- required to obtain  castings which are good and clean ; how the smallest flaw  ot  mistake may destroy days of work of great value. The object of all foundries is to obtain a good skin on the casting, so that it may look clean and bright instead of rough. </para>

                    <para>. - This article is used on such a small scale that I think we are beating the air when we give it such importance in connexion with the iron industry. It is only for, perhaps, one casting out of twenty that plumbago is used, and the object is to give a fine plain surface on work of an ornamental kind. The use of the commodity does not add to the solidity of the casting in any way, but is merely intended to give a good finish. </para>

                        <para>- The cylinder of an engine is not usually cast in sand, but in loam, and therefore this duty will not be a great tax on the industry no matter how heavy it may be made. &#39; Only a pound or two is put into the blacking bag to be dusted over the &#39; surface. There is so very little . of the article used that I suppose ironfounders have not considered the question of cost at all. There are several other things which can be- used, as well as that article. For. instance, ordinary pease meal if ground up sufficiently can be used. I have seen it used time and&#39; again for that purpose. It puts on a different complexion and gives an equally smooth surface. It is only to a few of our natural industries that we can extend any form of protection. Here is a natural industry which can be helped. Consequently, I should like to see the duty retained at its present rate.- From my knowledge of iron work I feel sure that it would be a very slight&#39; burden indeed. </para>

Nevertheless, owing to prejudice, they found a difficulty in obtaining a market against the English manufacturer, even when prices were equal, or nearly so. . He also nrepared, foundry black, and sold it in large quantitites, but met with powerful opposition from . the large English firms.

That would force consumers into the use of the Australian put-up article. </para>

                    <para>. - I want to show that there is no discrepancy between the statement quoted by the honorable senator and my statement. The Commission was dealing there with the evidence given by a gentleman who was  making black lead, which, I suppose, is sold for ordinary domestic purposes. I referred particularly to the use of this article in foundries - a very different thing. Therefore, there is no discrepancy between that evidence and what I referred to. Seeing that the honorable senator has cited the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lewis,</inline> let me point to a discrepancy therein. This witness admits that he is selling large quantities, but he says that he has met with powerful opposition. I should imagine that where a man met with, powerful opposition he would be able to sell only small quantities. On the other hand, if he was selling large quantities, it is quite clear that the opposition was not very powerful. </para>

From then until now I have paid attention to the matter, and I have never heard of the discovery, in Australia; of graphite, which would fulfil all the conditions, of commerce. There is graphite of a rather low grade which is useful for some purposes. In one large case, where the mine- was in Queensland, and the shares held principally, if not exclusively, in Sydney, contracts were entered into for the supply of the article to a number of manufacturers in the full belief that it was all that was required, but the stuff was not up to the market requirements. It was not so useful for commercial purposes as had been anticipated, and, like many other mining ventures, that one came to an end. I do not know of a quality of graphite for a great many of the manufactures which will meet the requirements of the market. This is the raw material requisite for a great many manufactures, and the lowest duty which can be imposed will be in the interests of local industry, namely &#34; 5 per cent. </para>

                    <para>. - These are articles which I think might reasonably be placed on the free list. They are used in what might be called the smaller departments of many trades. I do not say that they affect a big industry, nor am I prepared to say that the retention of the duty would crush out or even seriously handicap the industries in which bronzing and metal powders are used - still the duty represents a tax on the users of these powders, and if, as I think can be shown, they are not being made in Australia, it becomes not merely a revenue duty - an expression which I was told I should not use - but an unnecessary tax on the industries in which they are employed. At page 234 of the report of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, I find this statement made - &#34; </para>

                    Sydney printer and box manufacturer complained that bronze powders were liable to . 1 revenue duty of 20 per cent. which was too much for the industry to stand. They could not possibly |&#62;e made in Australia, and as a raw material, should be admitted free. A Sydney stationer, representing the Association of Master Printers and Allied Trades, agreed with this contention, and pointed out that the &#39;importation of bronze powders did not affect any Australian industry ; they were a highly specialized manufacture, and were a necessary raw material, of the trade. 1 do not pretend to have read the whole of the evidence given before the Tariff Commission, but I have read the reports, and can discover no evidence contrary to this statement, and I do not think I have&#39; overlooked any paragraph in the reports which contradicts that which I have read. If any contrary view had been put forward I feel certain that the members of the protectionist section of the Commission would not have allowed the paragraph I have read to remain uncontradicted. They would at least have said that other wit-  nesses contradicted .this view, or would have quoted evidence given, to the &#39;contrary. As they have not done so, I think it is a reasonable assumption that these powders are not made in Australia, and I therefore move -

It was stated by the particular witness referred to, who no doubt is interested in the free admission of these powders, that they should be placed on the free list. </para>

                        <para>-  His  evidence was to the effect that these powders were not being made, and were not likely to be made, in Australia.  I do not think that we should conclude from such a statement that it is not possible to produce in Australia such articles as bronzing and metal powders. In any case, I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and I think this argument should have weight with the honorable senator, that the duty of 20 per cent, at present imposed is that which has been in force since the Tariff of 1901. The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended that the 20 per cent, duty should continue in force, and the free-trade section of the Commission recommended a duty of 10 per cent. I speak subject to the qualification which I have previously admitted as to the absolute accuracy of the entries in the column containing the recommendations of the freetrade section of the Commission. In the circumstances, I hope that honorable senators will not depart so far from the recommendations of both sections of the Commission, and the duty imposed under the old Tariff, as to agree now to make the item free. </para>

                        <para>- It does not follow that if they are not being made here at the present time, they cannot be made here. Surely honorable senators do not believe that we have reached the limit of our capacity of production, and that we shall never produce in Australia what we are not producing to-day. Honorable senators are aware that the existence of a duty on articles which were not produced in the country has led to their production being commenced after a time. </para>

If the honorable senator had listened carefully to my reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> he would have heard me say that so far as I knew, no evidence was brought before the Tariff Commission to contradict the paragraph quoted by the honorable senator; but that the absence of any such evidence did not conclude the case. We have had from members of the Tariff Commission statements that in regard to certain items, no specific evidence has been forthcoming, and they have, therefore, in such cases made no recommendation. There are many items in respect of which there was no specific evidence. The fact that no witnesses came forward, however, does not prove anything. </para>

                        <para>- I am not in  a  position to do so. I candidly admit that. The argument which I address to the mover of the request is, that the duty has been 20 per cent., that the continuance of that duty is recommended bv the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, and that an impost of 10 per cent, has been recommended by the free- trade section. Again, I remind the honorable senator that he has .stated that he does not intend to move for the reduction of duties which are already in existence, except in the case of food items. </para>

I do not know whether it is inserted for the sake of uniformity, seeing that we are taxing live stock, and other things. But it does seem to me to be ludicrous to put a duty on tallow, a commodity which we export very largely. It is only in case of an absolute dearth in this country, owing to drought, that the soap and other manu-&#62; facturers are under the necessity of importing it. It does seem to me that if there were a time. of necessity when our manufacturers have to import, tallow largely, it would be ridiculous to have this duty on it. I move - </para>

The tallow that comes into this country is largely for reexport purposes. It comes m from New Zealand and the Pacific Islands in small quantities, either- to be used in Australia, or to be transhipped to European ports. Therefore the duty appears to be to me to be one. of those which have no value. It is impossible that it can ever be operative. </para>

Surely honorable senators know that, in many instances, tallow is imported in spite of the fact that we are great exporters of that commodity. In many years imports are received from New Zealand, and it is not at all desirable that our own farmers and cattle-raisers should be submitted to competition from that Dominion, any more than they are submitted to competition in regard to other lines in the Tariff. </para>

                    <para>. - The remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline>  simply show that he really knows very little about the question - and naturally so. The fact is that every week tallow comes in from New Zealand and the Pacific Islands. It comes in for sale, and shipment to Europe, because the largest tallow market in the world is in Sydney. Surely the Minister does not wish to legislate against the development of an industry which is wholly beneficial to the Commonwealth ? In the twenty years during which I have been in Australia, not one cask of tallow has been imported, except for sale and re-exportation. At the time of the biggest drought that we ever had, our exportation of tallow was the largest on record, because so many cattle were boiled down to prevent them from dying from starvation. The tallow which is imported from New Zealand and the Pacific. Islands comes here to be sold in a market where it is likely to bring good prices; but the effect of the dutv will be to cause it to be shipped direct to- Marseilles, London, or Liverpool. </para>

                    <para>. - After hearing the arguments of Senators Millen and Gray, I was at first disposed to regard it as of little consequence whether tallow is admitted free or not ; but, looking more closely at the item, I see that the duty is on greases and tallow unrefined, imported in packages of less than 4 lbs. The intention of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission and of the Government is to- prevent the importation of greases, or unrefined tallow which can be used for the same purposes. No doubt honorable senators have seen unrefined tallow used for the greasing of dray axles, for example. But there are other anti-friction greases of a very high value, costing sometimes almost &#163;100 a ton, which a duty of 4s. per cwt. will not keep out of the market, and therefore, when the proper time comes, I intend to ask for an alternative duty of 25 per cent., whichever will return the higher rate. I think that, except for an amendment protecting our manufacturers of axle grease from importations of the anti-friction greases to -which I have referred, the item might well be left as it is. </para>

                    <para>. - In reply to the statements of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> as to the importance to the Sydney market of the import trade in tallow, 1 would point out that in 1906, according to the Government Statistician, only 1 ton of tallow was imported into the Commonwealth from the South Sea Islands. Mv experience is that cattle will never fatten well enough in the islands to create any tallow trade. To ascertain the true reason for this request, we must look behind the scenes. I find at page 180 of the freetraders&#39; Koran, the report of the freetrade section of the Tariff Commission, this summary of the evidence of a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Vider  of New South Wales - </para>

                        <para>- The fact that during the same year we exported a very large quantity of tallow shows that the statement was valueless. Those who urge the abolition of the duty on tallow have one of the best markets in the world in which to secure their raw material. But .like most manufacturers, whether they be freetraders or protectionists, they desire to obtain their raw material in the cheapest market. That is a matter which concerns themselves, but we ought not to expose the Australian tallow market to outside competition. I am not&#39; going, by my vote, <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> assist in doing so, since the official statistics show that we produce more tallow than is necessary&#39; to satisfy our own requirements. </para>

                        <para>- He probably does know j but the free-trade party unfortunately does not, and does not want to know. Wishing, as I do, to be of some service to that party, I shall try to give it a glimmering of an idea of the reason, why these duties are levied. We impose a duty upon &#39;wheat to encourage its production in the Commonwealth. Honorable senators will reply that we are now producing more than sufficient to supply our own needs. That is perfectly true, and in such circumstances the duty on wheat is inoperative. But there are years when  even in Australia we do not produce enough wheat for our own requirements. &#34; That is the very time,&#34; says the freetrader, &#34; when the duty is a severe impost upon .the people of the Commonwealth.&#34; But why do we collect the duty during a  drought? For the reason that we want to make Australia independent of every outside country so far as her food supplies are concerned. We make the duty operative in times of drought, as a stimulant to agriculturists in overcoming the dry spells from which we suffer. </para>

                        <para>- I am now giving reasons why we impose a duty on wheat, and almost every other agricultural product. Let me come to the duty on tallow. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> himself supplied the reason why we should impose this duty, when he said that no doubt in years of drought there was plenty of tallow available in Australia, but not tallow of the requisite quality. We desire to encourage the production of tallow of the very best quality, and one way of Stimulating its production is to protect, our people against the competition of other countries.&#39; That is why the duty is imposed. It is part of the national policy of Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> was very much concerned about the people who produce tallow in the South . Sea Islands and New Caledonia. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will not object to my speaking. Having regard to the time that he occupies in addressing the Committee, I think his objection to hear the other side comes with very bad grace. This is a question which affects the primary producers, of whom I am a representative. Our New South Wales friends - &#39;the contingent calling themselves free-traders - seem to draw their inspiration from the press, the Chambers of .Commerce, or the importers ; the primary producer is not considered. We ought not to speak disparagingly of the various States which we represent. Since the little State of. South Australia alone sent to England this year through the produce depot some  270,000  lambs, surely it should not be necessary for Australia to import tallow. If it is, there must be something wrong. It would appear that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> is raising an outcry because of a little bit of business which the abolition of the duty would bring to the Sydney merchants. </para>

I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> who objects so strongly to hear the other side, will be good enough in the interests of the public to slightly curtail his remarks. </para>

                    <para>- - Senators Stewart and W. Russell have been distinctly unjust to me in their remarks. When I interposed during <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> observations, it was with a view to informing him that I recognised that the sense ,of the Committee was against me, and, in order to save time,  I was prepared to allow the matter to go. But the moment I indicated my feeling in the matter, both he and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> commenced to rend me to pieces. I have therefore come to the conclusion that it is utterly useless to attempt to do anything to expedite the transaction of business. </para>

                <para>I have already given, my reasons for this proposal. I desire to protect the manufacturer of greases against the competition of anti-friction greases, which sometimes range in value up to &#163;100 per ton. Upon such greases a duty of 4s. per cwt. would have no protective incidence whatever. As we have already adopted alternative duties in respect of other items, I hope that, my request will commend itself to the Committee. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable senator has asked the Committee to agree to a very high alternative duty. It is quite true - as he has mentioned - that greases range in value over a very wide area. Some are comparatively cheap, whilst others are very dear. Upon some of the greases imported a duty of 25 per cent, would amount to as much as <inline font-style="italic">&#163;,2</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> 5s. per cwt. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> persists in his proposal, I ask him to accept a lower alternative <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate, and the Government may then .be disposed to meet him. </para>

                    <para>. - If the Minister of Home Affairs believes that a lower <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty will afford sufficient protection to our manufacturers, I have no objection to accepting a duty of 20 per cent. To my mind, that is a sufficiently low rate to levy as an alternative to the fixed duty, seeing that in some . instances the value of these anti-friction greases is so high that the specific duty would have no protective incidence whatever. </para>

In regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s</inline> proposal, I would point out that 20 per cent, is a very high rate to levy, inasmuch as it would be applicable only to greases of a very high price, and would then be out of all proportion to the 4s. per cwt. which would be levied upon the lower class of greases. But the Government offer no opposition to . the two divisions being fused in the way proposed bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline></para>

                    <para>. - The object of the original proposals of the Government in respect of tallows and greases was to encourage the importation of axle and other greases in bulk, with a view to having them made up into smaller packages here. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> now proposes to levy only one duty upon them, which will be an inducement for the packing to be undertaken outside the Commonwealth. As I do not think that is his desire, I ask him&#39; whether he recognises the effect of his proposal? He said just now that free-traders seemed slow to understand what protectionists aim at. If what I have pointed out is what he is aiming at, I do not understand his action. But I question whether he voices the protectionist idea in regard to this matter. . I certainly prefer the Tariff as it stands to his proposal. </para>

If tallow or greases are imported in . packages under  4  lbs. in &#34; weight, they will be charged  4s.  per cwt., or the alternative <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate, and the same duty will also be applicable to these goods if they are imported in bulk.

                        <para>- There may be thousands of parcels of axle grease, but my remark had reference -to tallow. I ask the Government not to agree to the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> which, if carried, will inflict injury upon the Commonwealth without any industry gaining the slightest benefit from a protective stand-point. The&#39; importations of tallow, especially, from New .Zealand, where it is produced in large quantities, come to Sydney, when there are profitable freight opportunities. The New Zealand exporters send it to Sydney in order&#39; that it may be re-exported. Australia is benefited by that means, because work is given at the wharfs in unloading, and to carriers ; commissions are also earned in Australia, storage charges- have to be paid here, and the loading of the tallow again on to the ships for Europe gives more work. Consequently, a considerable amount of money is spent in the Commonwealth through the importation of tallow. Any effect that it has on the local price, from a manufacturing point of view, is infinitesimal. I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell, who represents the farmers, that he will in no way be doing them a kindness by voting for the duty, because it will have no incidence whatever from either a protectionist or free-trade point of view, whereas we should be very foolish to do anything to prevent one part of the Commonwealth at any rate being a market for  the tallow industry, as it is now. A duty of 2o- per cent, will absolutely prohibit every cask of tallow coming into the Common wen 1th from New. Caledonia, New Zealand, or Fiji for re-export, and all the charges which the Commonwealth gets as  profit will be absolutely killed. It would be ridiculous with a 20 per cent, duty to expect any one to import tallow, which  now averages &#163;23 a ton, for re-export. The proposed duty will do no good, while it will do a great deal of harm from a business point of view. The Committee will be committing a legislative injustice to the best interests of the Commonwealth by adopting it. The trade now may be comparatively small, but it is developing, and we ought to be proud that we can have in Australia the largest tallow market in the world. We ought to do all we can 10 develop that market, seeing that at the same time we shall in no wise weaken or injure any of our existing industries. </para>

These greases are used by an enormous number of people in a great many industries. The tanning industry, for instance; is progressing extremely well in Australia, and turning out excellent leather, which is becoming almost equal to the English. One of the main ingredients used by the fellmongers is grease. A number of the constituents of the grease are not obtainable here, and have to be secured outside Australia. The imposition of this tax will be of no benefit to the farmers - the primary producers whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell is always trotting out but never helping. It will, at the same time, press hardly on a large number of industries which use grease. The item ought to stand as it is. We were told when the. Tarin0 was brought into this Chamber that the Government intended to stand bv it as it was, but they are running away from it on almost every other item. </para>

Such a message has been obtained, and, under it, proposals for taxation have been introduced. Yet the Government are, time after time, allowing private members, with&#39; no share of Ministerial responsibility, to take the financial&#39; affairs of the Commonwealth under their control, while Ministers sit supinely by, knowing all the time that, if the requests proposed be agreed to, another message will be necessary for their adoption elsewhere.

There is no doubt that it is possible to manufacture a greasy substance that is very useful in making the joints limber, and rendering men acrobatic, politically or otherwise, even though they be advanced in years. There was a law-giver in New South Wales, who, at one part of his career, was perfectly solid on the question of tallow.- The people believed in that gentleman as an ardent free-trader, who, in view of the pastoral industries of New South Wales, would always be in favour of reducing the duty on tallow as much as possible. But the time came when that well known politician changed his views remarkably. I may, in passing, say that the honorable gentleman could take his hand at poetry, and was also a kind of secondhand warrior. However, the time came when this well-known supporter of . freedom for tallow changed his opinions; and yet, when he unfortunately happened to get into &#34;the Federal Parliament, he sought, and has since sought, to impress people with his firm belief in free-trade. </para>

                    <para>- It is the highest proof of my consistency as a politician that a broad joke levelled, I do not hesitate to say, at the head of the party to which I belonged, and with, whom I was at some serious difference on the question of Federation - a satire so broad that I doubted whether the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> would give it room - should be the only thing that can be charged against me during my parliamentary career of twenty-five years. At the time that letter was written I was working night and day in opposition to the form of Federation then proposed.</para>

                        <para>- I am sure, the honorable senator is not so dense. In the hope of proving some inconsistency on mv part, that letter has been printed and distributed bv tens of thousands in Sydney streets, but it has never affected my election to the extent of a dozen votes. At the time that letter was printed I was engaged in piloting through the New South Wales Parliament the Bill that blocked the acceptance of the Constitution of the Federal Convention. A New South Wales Act provided that there should be over 50,000 affirmative votes to &#39; bring about Federation. In the Legislative Assembly I put through all its crucial stages a Bill which raised that number to 80,000, and that killed the first referendum vote there. The letter which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has read  was written at that very juncture. It was a farce and a folly to quote it here. </para>

                        <para>- My own com mon sense has taught me so. The fact that we export tallow proves my statement conclusively. According to the statistics, in 1906 we imported over 19,000 cwt. of this article, yielding a revenue of a little more than . &#163;2,000. In face of our production of tallow, I think it must be clear to any one that there is something connected with this article which does not appear on the surface. I believe that a good deal of mineral composition is used in the making up of these greases, and no matter what we may do with tallow or anything else, that article will be imported for making greases for use in connexion with certain forms of machinery here. &#39; This is undoubtedly a revenue duty, and on that, ground, especially as the revenue therefrom is not very much, it can very well be repealed. </para>

                        <para>- We have tallow -the main base of such lubricants - in practically unlimited quantities, and if it is necessary for some purposes to mix mineral oils, we have local mineral oils, and admit some mineral oils free, the others being subject to a very low duty. It would be a disastrous thing from a protectionist point of view to allow the free importation of an article when its production here has been fostered and encouraged by a protective duty. To my mind a dutv of 4s. per cwt. is a low one. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> I understand, purposes to move for an alternative <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty of 20 per cent. That is, I think, a very much wiser course. We should insist, so far as we can by a protective duty, that this commodity, even if we have not all the raw material, ought to be made in the &#39;Commonwealth, where it is used. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to remind honorable senators that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s</inline> proposal would not bring these sub-items into line. The request he has carried in connexion with paragraph a is to make the duty  4s.,  with, an alternative <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty of  15  per cent. If the duty applicable to paragraph. b is to be  2S.,  and the alternative <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty  15  per cent., it must be clear that, should the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> principle be applied, we are doubling the proportiopaterate of duty as compared with paragraph a. I suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> might amend his request by providing for an alternative duty of  10  per cent. </para>

I agree with him that if the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty, were fixed at  15  per cent, on both these paragraphs, it would come into operation twice as often where the fixed duty was  2s.  I shall therefore be satisfied with an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty on these bulk packages of  10  per cent., and ask leave to so amend my request.&#39; </para>

I have been asked to move it by persons who wish to be put on the same level as other manufacturers who are enabled to denature the oils they require for manufacturing purposes. It is well known that linseed oil is one of the elements of paints which are universally used in Australia. If China and other oils may be denatured for manufacturing purposes, there is no reason why linseed oil should not be treated in the same way. </para>

                    <para>. - There will be mo objection on the part of the Government to the insertion of a new paragraph under this item, providing for the admission, duty free, of linseed oil denatured under the conditions suggested by the honorable senator. But I point out that paragraphs a, b, c, d, and e of this item refer to the introduction of oils in vessels containing quantities not exceeding 1 gallon, whilst linseed oil to be used for the purpose to which the honorable senator refers would naturally be imported in larger quantities. In the circumstances, I . suggest to the honorable senator that it would be well for him to delay moving his request until the Committee has dealt with paragraph 1, in which he will see that provision is made for a duty upon linseed oil. </para>

                    <para>. - Honorable senators will notice that under item 234 we have a number of sub-items that are practically governed by the same principle. Feeling that the increased duties proposed are unwise and unwarranted, I propose so far as I am concerned to take one division only on a proposal which I shall submit to the Committee, and to be satisfied with the result of that division as a test vote. I mention this in order to show that I have no desire to waste time. The duty under&#39; the old Tariff on oils introduced in quarter-pints and smaller sizes was 6d. per dozen ; under the Tariff with which we are now dealing the. duty on imports under the general Tariff has been fixed at is. per dozen, an increase of 100 per cent. Bearing in mind that provision has been made for a preferential duty, I intend to submit a request for a duty of 9d. per dozen on imports under the general Tariff, and should that be agreed to, I shall move requests for a duty of 6d. per dozen on imports from the United Kingdom with corresponding reductions in the subsequent paragraphs.

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is quite right in saying that paragraphs a, b, c, d, and e bear a relation to one another in respect of the rates of duty imposed, but it will be observed that the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission . made certain specific recommendations&#39; with regard to the imports covered by these paragraphs. The Government in their original proposals submitted duties &#39; in accordance with those recommendations, and these were afterwards reduced in another place. For instance, on paragraph a, covering oils imported in quarter-pints and smaller sizes, the Government submitted for consideration a duty of is. 6d. per dozen, and the House of Representatives decided that on and after the 3rd December, 1907, the duty should be is. per dozen, as against the Government proposal and the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission. In the same way it will be observed that the duty on paragraph b was reduced from  3s.  to  2s.,  on paragraph c from  6s.  to  4s.,  on paragraph d from  12s.  to  8s.  per dozen, and on paragraph e from  4s.  to  2s. 8d.  per gallon. Honorable senators will see that with the exception of the duty on paragraph e these are duties at per dozen, and if they consult the report of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission they will find that very good reasons are there given why the rates of duty previously in force should be raised in any new proposals submitted to Parliament. They show that there is some necessity for an increased protection against the importation of these oils, and I hope the Committee will agree that we are not proposing too great a measure of protection when we ask for a duty of is. per dozen under paragraph a, where the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended a dutv of is.  6d. </para>

                    <para>. - I find that we import a large quantity of castor, colza, and linseed oils. Every year about  &#163;35,000  is paid in duty on lubricating oil. It therefore appears to me that the item as it stands is simply revenue producing, and that the duty is not sufficient to be protective. It has not encouraged local production. There is no doubte that all of these oils can be. produced in Australia: I beg to move - </para>

                    <para>.- It has been said that this is purely a revenue item. When I interjected that the duty under the old Tariff had not been effective, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> replied that it was for us to show that that was so. If it had been effective the importations of oils would not be so considerable. I find that in  1906  we imported about  1,500,000  gallons of colza, castor, and linseed oils. There is no earthly reason&#39; why we shouFd not produce in Australia all the linseed oil that we require. Again, castor oil is made from a plant that flourishes wonderfully well in most of the desert places of Australia. It is a useful plant to grow on arid land that is valueless for other purposes. As to the growing of &#39; flax, from which linseed is made, I wish to read a passage from the official organ of the Farmers&#39; League. This is a Victorian newspaper, published at Geelong, and the number from which I quote is dated  20th  February,  1908.  It is well to show what has been done in. the matter of the production of flax in Australia. The paragraph says - </para>

                    <para>As a result of profits made last season, certain Gippsland farmers cultivated increased areas of flax for harvesting this season. There were also others who, during iqo7, were induced to grow flax  crops  for the first time. About Warragul most of the growers sold the last crop to the Penal Department at prices ranging fiom &#163;3 10 <inline font-style="italic">&#163;3</inline> 17s. 6d. per ton, and the average yield was probably over 2 tons to the acre. This season, owing to the Pentridge flax treating plant having been burnt, the Penal Department is not operating on the market to anything like the same extent, and a number of growers, . being without an outlet, &#39;are obliged to stack the crop. Two growers, near Warragul, have plants of their own, but the increasing areas they plant keep their machines fully occupied. Unless an outlet is provided for what others grow, a promising and developing industry will receive a serious set back. </para>

It is stated that the flax growing industry is likely to become a very promising one in certain parts of Victoria. There is any quantity of land in Southern Australia that is suitable for the production of flax.

                        <para>- I do not think that it is producing this oil. I would rather stimulate the industry by the&#39;granting of a bounty in the first place, instead of taxing all users of machinery in the Commonwealth, and when the local production was sufficiently large, I should be willing to pro tect it by the imposition of a stiff duty.  I shall not object to the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> if it is made clear that this oil can be produced in Australia and sold here at the prices now being charged for lubricating oil ; but I hope that we shall receive more information on the subject. </para>

                    <para>. - As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has pointed out, Australia imports nearly  3,000,000  gallons of lubricating oil, and the Commonwealth Oil Corporation of New. South Wales is to-day producing at the same rate, and is increasing its plant with a view to making its output  6,000,000  gallons a year. It is evident that the present duty is not sufficient to protect the local industry against the competition of the Standard Oil Company. </para>

                    <para>. - According to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> the Commonwealth Oil Corporation is producing as much lubricating oil as is imported, and is going to increase its output. That being so, I cannot understand why it needs an additional protection of  100  per cent. Every user of machinery in the Commonwealth has to pay the duty on lubricating oil, and if effect were given to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> proposal, the cost of this oil would be increased by nearly one-third. The position would be different if it were shown that the local company cannot compete against foreign imports; but, as it is doubling its output, it cannot really need a higher duty,, and if we raise the duty to  6d.  per gallon, we shall be giving it a handsome present at the expense of our mining arid&#39; manufacturing industries. I look upon the proposal as preposterous. </para>

                    <para>.. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> has stated that he would be inclined to support the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> if he were satisfied that lubricating oil can be produced in Australia.  in sufficient quantities to meet the demand, so that those who use it would not have to pay more for it because of the duty. Even free-traders will agree that it is the accepted policy of the country to encourage the investment of capital in manufacturing by the imposition of import duties. The leader of the Free-trade Party has admitted that. Now, there is in New South Wales, where the free-traders come from, the Commonwealth Oil Corporation, which has invested nearly  &#163;950,000  in developing the shale oil industry. It has constructed a. railway to connect its shale -deposits with the western line, at a point  87  miles from Sydney, this connexion costing about  &#163;200,000.  The corporation has sixty-four retorts for distilling oil, which are almost completed, and it is intended to have altogether twice, that number, as well as a refinery.- Experimental coke ovens have been built at Wolgan, and arrangements have been made for the erection of. others. The present output of the company in solar, residual, and lubricating oils is equivalent to  3,000,000  gallons per annum, and will be increased within a few weeks to  6,000,000  gallons per annum, while it is thought that before the end of the present year its total output of oil of all kinds will be equivalent to  12,000.000  gallons per annum. Therefore the corporation will soon be producing enough oil to meet the requirements of Australia. Should it then be. called upon to withstand the unscrupulous competition of the Standard Oil Comrjany, which has unlimited millions at its disposal, and whose  chairman  at a recent meeting of shareholders said that its foreign market should be protected at any cost ? </para>

                        <para>- I am sick of hearing little Australians run down the quality of local productions. They speak as though Australia is such a wretched country that it cannot produce anything of better than second or third quality. We must bring foreigners to do our electrical and mining engineering .work, while our own men go abroad to obtain positions such as they cannot get at home because of the stinking-fish cry of the &#34;comic coterie &#34; opposite, to use the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild.</inline> I can view this proposal from an impartial stand-point because the- industry has  not yet been started in the State of which I am a representative. This corporation proposes to expend something like .&#163;950,000 in establishing in New South Wales a purely Australian industry, and why should we not afford it a little encouragement? Honorable senators opposite will say, as they have said again and again during our consideration of the Tariff, that those engaged in other industries in which lubricating oils are used will have to pay &#34; this inordinate tax.&#34; I contend that they will not have to pay one farthing of it. In the first place, the Commonwealth Oil Corporation is pledged not to increase its prices to the consumer; and, secondly, it will have such a large output that it will not pay it to raise prices. Then, again, we. know that the Standard Oil Trust, which is one of the greatest monopolistic syndicates in the world, will be rushing in large shipments of oil with a view to preserve its Australian trade and stamp out competition. </para>

If, like the Standard Oil Trust, it spreads1 out its tentacles so as to be in .any way injurious to the people, we shall be able to deal with it; whereas we have no power to deal with the American Trust. Apparently some honorable senators opposite would leave Australia for all time at the mercy of that corporation. If we are to grant protection, let it be effective. What is the value of a duty of 3  Jd&#39;.  &#39; per gallon when we can impose what would be a really effective impost? A duty, that will not preserve the local market to </para>

                    <para>. - The duty under the old Tariff was 3d. per gallon, and the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission was that that- duty should be continued. Reference has been made to the establishment in New South Wales of the Commonwealth Oil Corporation. I understand that when the Tariff Commission was taking evidence, it was not possible for the corporation to put before the Commission its position with regard to the production of oils in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that it was either .not completely formed or was not carrying on operations when the Commission was taking evidence. Since the Tariff was submitted to another place, inquiries&#39; made by the Government have satisfied us that the Commonwealth Oil Corporation, as the result of the work that it has done and is doing, should be in&#39; a position to supply the Australian demand for various oils which under this Tariff have -imposed upon them duties which are at present of a revenue, and not of a protective, character. The duty of 3d. per gallon, which has been in operation since  j  902, has been in effect a revenue impost. When the first Federal Tariff was under consideration, representations were made that an enterprise which was then being entered upon in Tasmania was likely to re: suit in the supply of the local demand for some of these oils.. It was thought, however, that the parties concerned were not proceeding on a scale large enough to warrant the imposition of a protective duty. In the present instance, the Government have been satisfied by the inquiries they have made that the Commonwealth Oil Corporation is sufficiently strong financially to be able, with adequate protection, to do what it hopes to do to fight in Australia the Standard Oil Trust as suppliers of the local demand for these oils. In this instance,  we see no objection to affording an opportunity to them by the aid of the Tariff to carry out what they intend to  do  in the production of these oils. The duty on kerosene will be considered later on. I understand that kerosene in a cruder state than the oil used for domestic purposes is now being supplied by the Commonwealth Oil Corporation, although not to a very large extent, to the Australian Gaslight Company of New South Wales. That kerosene is devoted to the Gas Company&#39;s own purposes, but the Corporation intends to take steps to supply the Australian market with its requirements in respect of kerosene. The Government have every reason to believe that the Australian market for  the  oils now under consideration can be supplied by the Commonwealth Oil Corporation and other Australian enterprises. </para>

                        <para>- I am not in a  position to define every item. I am informed, however, that its &#34;output of black and blue oils - which are equivalent to solar, residual and lubricating oils - at the present time is at the rate of about 3,000,000 gallons per annum, and that it is rapidly increasing. It is estimated that about the end of 1908 the output will be at the rate of about 16,000,000 gallons per annum instead of 3,000,000 gallons as at present, and that in 1909 it will be able to supply.

                        <para>- No ; I am speaking now only of solar, residual and lubricating oils. The Corporation has already demonstrated its belief in its own capacity to supply the market by the expenditure of a very large sum in the acquisition of properties in New South Wales. If has either completed, or &#39;has in course of construction, a railway line some 70 or 80 miles in length to connect its works with the main system. I know, too, that it is taking steps to connect its works directly with the Sydney Telephone Exchange, something . like too miles distant, and in every way its expenditure of capital in .New South Wales seems to indicate that it is in the enterprise for business, and that the directors have the utmost confidence in their capacity to carry out what they propose to do. </para>

                        <para>- As many honorable senators are aware, when the first Federal Tariff . was under consideration it was stated that a duty of 3d. per gallon was really a revenue impost; that there was in Australia no enterprise of sufficient magnitude or promise to warrant Parliament in imposing a protective duty. Every honorable senator knows that there must inevitably be associated&#34; with every local effort to supply our requirements in regard to oil a tremendous handicap in the shape of the keenest competition that it is possible to bring forward. We all know what the competition of the Standard Oil Trust means. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so, but the mining industry is peculiarly affected by this proposal. Lubricating oil figures very largely among the stores consumed by a mining company, and especially by those which have very large plants running. The mining companies of Western Australia more particularly would be very hard hit by an increased duty. Honorable . senators will perhaps be surprised to learn the  value of the stores which one of our large mines consumes. I intend to give only two illustrations. The Golden Horseshoe mine, carrying on . operations in Western Australia and employing  855  men, last year consumed  , &#163;95,552  worth of stores, apart altogether from the cost of water, firewood, round timber and jarrah. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly. Let me take as another example the value of stores consumed by a smaller mining company - the Associated Northern. That company employs  125  men, and in one year, on the basis I have mentioned, consumed stores of the value of  &#163;11,302.  Honorable senators who are aware of the extensive plants employed by large mining companies do not need to be told what a heavy consumption of lubricating oil takes place, especially as the larger plants run at high speed. Of course, we all desire to encourage the manufacturing&#39; industrv. but we must be careful that in doing so we do not strike a death blow at industries which are already established, andl which . are emolovinj: large numbers of men at high rates of wages. </para>

                        <para>- The miners of Western Australia produce gold- at  a  cheaper rate than do those of any other part of the world. I mean to extend some consideration to the thousands of men who are employed upon mines which are barely paying, and which, if an additional duty be levied upon their stores, will be compelled to close down. There are  a  large number of mines in Western Australia which are just on the verge of being unremuherative, and I should not be doing my duty to that State if I did hot seek  IP  extend some consideration to them. </para>

                        <para>- As one who is required to pay the household  accounts, I know that I have not benefited from any &#34; dumping &#34; operations on the part of the Standard Oil Company. But we are all aware that that company is not the only supplier of oil in Australia. There is, in addition, the British Borneo Company, and other companies.- I welcome the advent of the local competitor, but I say that he is already sufficiently protected. Were it not for the local competitor, I should vote for free-trade in the matter of lubricating oils. Some honorable senators have been most assiduous in endeavouring to secure the free admission of the raw materials of the manufacturer. Here is the raw material of the mining industry and of the manufacturer. But I do not ask that it shall be admitted free. I merely claim that an undue burden should not be levied upon it. That the old rate of duty was sufficient from a protective stand-point is evidenced by the fact that a company invested in the industry the colossal sum of nearly &#163;1,000,000, without any guarantee that&#39; it would receive a higher measure of protection - indeed, without any guarantee that it would receive even the protection which it was afforded by the old rate. That capital was subscribed very shortly after the first Commonwealth Tariff was enacted. It&#39; is clear, therefore, that this company of wealthy men was satisfied to accept a lower duty than that which is now proposed. Under these circumstances, how can it be argued that an additional measure of protection must be accorded to the industry ? If honorable senators could make out a case for an additional measure of protection, there might be some excuse for placing this increased burden upon the mining, and manufacturing industries of Australia. But I ask them to pause before lending an ear to the request of the Commonwealth Oil Company for additional protection, seeing that by granting it we shall penalize and perhaps destroy some of the other industries to which I have alluded. We cannot forget&#39; that this company is making representations to individual senators. I know that it has its agent in the parliamentary lobbies. </para>

                        <para>- So has the Standard Oil Company. . Information has also been forwarded to honorable senators by means of circulars, but, of course, as an honorable senator interjects, that is a perfectly legitimate thing, to do. I do not blame the Commonwealth Oil Corporation for asking for an increased duty. But the mere fact that they ask for it is no reason why we should grant it. We have to pay some regard, not merely to the Oil and Shale Company, of New South Wales, but to the mining industry of Western Australia, the manufacturing industry of Victoria, and the sugar-milling industry of Queensland. All these enterprises have an equal right to our consideration. Consequently, my vote will be cast against any increase in the duty set out in the schedule. I ask  the Committee not to jeopardize the employment of thousands of men throughout the Commonwealth by endeavouring to extend further protection to an industry which does not require it. </para>

                    <para>. - If there has been any &#34; lobbying/&#39; either by the Standard Oil Company or by the representatives of the manufacturing company to which allusion has been made, I have not heard of it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> appeared to think that because 3,000,000 gallons of oil are annually produced in the Commonwealth, and because our consumption approximates to 3,000,006 gallons, we are therefore- producing the oil required for lubricating purposes. But I presume that the 3,000,000 gallons that&#39; we are producing consist of crude oil. Of course, I wish the industry to progress as rapidly as possible, and I speak as one who has some knowledge of its possibilities, because in Tasmania we have large deposits of shale material in connexion with which various experiments have been made from time to time, and from which it is possible to extract lubricating oil, so that in time an industry may be established. </para>

                        <para>- No, this question stands upon a plane of its own. I need scarcely point out that over &#163;35,000 has been annually collected in duty upon lubricating oils. Who pays that duty? Obviously it is the industry and enterprise of Australia, whether it be in the form of a&#39; mine or of a sewing-machine factor)1. Now Ave are asked to increase that impost from &#163;35,000 to &#163;70,000. </para>

If we wish  to stimulate the industry let us offer a bounty for the production of lubricating oil. But in the meantime do not let us levy a heavy impost upon all manufacturing enterprises. .

As a matter of fact there are many industries in Australia which have been established under protective duties and which are today supplying the consumer with a. cheaper article than he was able to obtain previously. I wish to show the effect which the removal of the protective duty had upon the company which was producing oil in Australia- previously. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> stated that it was not necessary to give any protection at all. because a powerful company, with a capital of nearly &#163;1,000,000, has undertaken the development of the industry on a largecale. and should be satisfied with a small duty. This company was formed to take over the business of a previous company, which had become defunct. </para>

The company decided to abandon the manufacture of illuminating oils not because there was any difficulty in disposing of the product, but because at this period the duties on kerosene were removed and the Standard Oil Company cut prices to a point which did not enable the New South Wales Shale and Oil Company to manufacture at a profit. </para>

                    <para>The quality of the illuminating oils manufactured by the New South Wales Shale and Oil Company was of the highest class,- in fact, taking the flash point, which is the true test, the illuminating oil produced by the New South Wales Shale and Oil Company would be ranked as one of the first illuminating oils manufactured in the world. This statement is borne out by the various analyses which were from time to time taken by the New South Wales Shale and Oil Company, and is also borne out by the fact that the New South Wales Railway Commissioners selected the oils of the New South Wales Shale and Oil Company for their signal lamps. The contract for the supply of oils to the Railway Commissioners extended right up to the date of the abandonment of manufacture by the New South Wales Shale and Oil Company. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That shows that the local oil only was used for the signal lamps on the New South Wales railways, where it is most important that the illuminant should be of the best quality, as the safety of thousands of lives may depend upon it. It was not -urged that the New South Wales Railway Commissioners were using second-grade or inferior oil. The local company were producing the very best illuminating oil, notwithstanding interested statements that they were producing only very inferior oil. May that .not be equally true in the case of the lubricating oil? This &#34;stinking-fish&#34; cry, running down Australian productions and trying to prove that they should not be encouraged or get protection because of their inferiority, is enough to make any true Australian heartily sick. It is alleged that the duty will increase the cost to other manufacturers. It will not increase the cost in any way, because &#39;the local company have given a pledge, or are prepared to enter into any bond, that they will not increase the price at all. If we refuse them protection, it is almost certain that what happened before in the case of illuminating oils will happen again in this case. The Standard Oil Company will put their product on the market, reduce prices to such an extent as to force the local company out of production, . and then bleed the users, of lubricating oils in Australia.. For that opportunity they will have our free-trade friends on the other side of the Chamber to thank. Those who argue that to increase the duty will increase the price to the consumer or to other industries, when we have every facility to produce the article ourselves, are putting forward a statement for which there is no warranty , in fact or probability. I hope we shall give this young Australian industry, which was previously crushed out by foreign competition, such a measure of effective protection, as will enable it to stagger on to its feet, and by-and-by to stand alone. I intend to vote to give it all the encouragement I can. </para>

                        would have been fairer in his arguments, bad as they were, if he had not imputed to honorable senators on this side a desire to give no protection to the company whose interests he has been supporting. We all recognise that we are fixing up a protectionist Tariff, and protection is supposed to be the policy of .the country. I believe that every honorable senator is willing to give a fair and just measure of protection to this good, strong, and, I hope, honorable company. But the Government appear to be supporting a higher duty, which means 100 per cent, more than the A section of the Tariff Commission recommended, and
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline>
                        says there will be no burden on other industries, although the impost! which he suggests is about 50 per cent, of the cost of the article. What would the honorable senator think if I suggested that his friend who is briefing him on behalf of the Commonwealth Oil Corporation has been guilty of perjury in that sworn declaration? Did not that gentleman depose that when the New South Wales Shale and Oil Company got into difficulties and could not produce oil, because the protection of 6d. under which it did nothing for four or five years had been taken away, it was finally wiped out by the Standard Oil Company? Does

We have now an instance of what may happen in a legislative chamber, which, to a great extent, exercises judicial functions, when honorable senators listen to statements made by lobbyists, who did not think it worth while to give evidence before the Tariff Commission. The Vice-President, of the Executive Council has made a most lame attempt to explain the absence of the representatives of this company as witnesses. </para>

                        <para>- We have an affidavit to the effect that this company was wiped out by the Standard Oil Company in 1897, although they did not start business until 1901. If the Vice-President of the Executive Council votes for every increase of duty, I wish him joy of his policy, because the general consumers will &#39;curse the Deakin Government for raising the price of all they eat, drink, and wear, and thus imposing an enormous burden upon the primary industries of the country. It was refreshing to hear the statesmanlike speeches of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> ; and it is to be regretted that the great apostle of protection, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> was not present, because it would do him and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> a great deal of good if they sat at the feet of men better informed than themselves in the A.B.C. of economic law. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has shown the position in which every honorable senator must be placed again and again in connexion with this Tariff. On the one hand we have the protectionist policy, and, on the other hand, the interests of the primary industries ; and we know that on the latter Australia depends for her credit. I happened to read a short time ago a most in&#39;structive article in this connexion, in the commercial supplement of the London <inline font-style="italic">Times,</inline> dealing more particularly with, the tin-plate industry of Canada. We know the great fight England has had to retain this industry ; how America has absorbed about half, and how Germany is making encroachments. All the manufacturers of tinned plate in Canada, combined in a large deputation to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid</inline> Laurier, and asked him either to impose a duty or to increase the duty, I forget which. </para>

If it be alleged that it will support or help the Commonwealth Oil Company, my reply is that that company was floated with an authorized capital of &#163;800,000 long before any proposal of this kind came before the Senate. That is a very important point. The money was subscribed, and the company were prepared to carry on their business at a stated duty, but now it is proposed to give them  too  per cent, more protection.

I&#39; cannot understand why we should give to a company who have the money, and are prepared to go on with a smaller duty, more protection then they asked for. There must be some reason for the action of the Government, and they ought to show why the additional protection should be given. </para>

                        <para>- I venture to say that we on this side will do as much to help the company in a fair and equitable business deal as will those on the other side. The difference between us lies in this fact : that honorable senators opposite when they receive from gentlemen in the lobby and elsewhere glowing accounts of the possibilities of industries they take everything that is said to them for granted, and come here, not prepared to discuss the why and the wherefore, to compare the advantages with the disadvantages, but to propose increases of duty recklessly. It is gratifying to hear that a large number of men have invested their money in an undertaking in the State I represent, and if I could qualify as a geographical protectionist, or a geographical free-trader, I might be induced to do more to develop this industry than I should consider to be consistent with the well-being of the people at large. But I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that the Commonwealth Oil Company was established with an absolute knowledge of the conditions not only in New South Wales, but throughout Australia. The company accepted all the responsibilities connected with the industry, and knew the fiscal position. </para>

                        <para>- They knew perfectly well the fiscal conditions of the country at that time, and it may be assumed that as business men they were prepared to carry on the industry under those conditions. Honorable senators on the other side have&#39; laid great stress on the statement that the fear of opposition by the Standard Oil Company of America warrants us in giving increased protection to this industry. But I for one cannot understand why my honorable friends should dare to use that argument. Because it is not very long since we heard them, with all the earnestness and eloquence they could command, calling upon the Government to carry through the Senate a Bill which would put a stop to any unfair competition by any outsiders either in America or elsewhere. Surely if the Standard Oil Company are going to throttle this new industry the powers which are contained in the Anti-Trust Act could be brought into force? We have not had one iota of evidence that the Government intend to exercise any of those powers. These honorable senators came here this afternoon and spoke of the clangers which &#39;ie ahead, owing to the competition of the Standard Oil Company, although they are the very persons who brought into existence that splendid piece of machinery which no one has heard of since it was_ created, and which, to judge from their speeches, they now regard as a dead letter. </para>

No one who realizes the position df affair1; throughout America, Europe, and Australia can fail to see the handwriting on the wall concerning the immediate future. When we recall the great fall in the price of metals, and the marked change in industrial conditions in America, England, and Germany, it is absolutely impossible for us not to realize that we in Australia must in time feel their effects. </para>

Every handicap imposed upon industries renders it more difficult to carry them on profitably, and if they are not carried on profitably, it is absolutely certain that that will not be in the interests of the workers of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Arid does not the honorable senator know that at certain times and under certain conditions the difference in the returns between the profitable and unprofitable prosecution of industries is very small ? Everybody should know that, and should know that the alarming conditions to which I have referred must re-act upon Australian industries. Whilst I am proud that this industry has been established in New South Wales, and hope that it will be permanently developed, and while I should be prepared to vote for a bounty to secure its permanent development, if that were considered necessary, because I think it is an industry to which the bounty principle is applicable, I contend that double the previously existing duty should afford quite sufficient protection to the local  company  to secure the profitable development of their mines, if, as they believe, they contain the raw materials they require. The  only  question I have not satisfactorily solved is whether the quality of one of the products of the local works is equal to that of the imported article. </para>

In the interests of the Commonwealth as a whole, I believe that the duty at present imposed, being double what it was before, is more than ample to meet all the requirements of the local industry, and that to impose a higher duty would be to waste the people&#39;s money. </para>

I should like to ask honorable senators whether the production of gold, silver, copper, or any other metal  from mines in Australia can be considered as representing a primary industry anymore than the production of different qualities of oil from shale. I see no difference between the two. </para>

                        <para>- I do not  object  to wealth being made in any way, so long as in the making of it all industries are considered on their merits. You,- sir, according to Senators Gray and Dobson, have made a very eloquent appeal to the Committee. May I, in passing, direct your attention to the fact that when a member of the Labour Party is eulogized by the honorable senators to whom I have referred it is very possible that he has been on the. wrong track. I consider that your appeal was of a very eloquent character, and no doubt has had a considerable effect upon some members of the Committee, but I complain that your references to the enormous sums spent by mining companies on stores were not sufficiently definite. You said, for instance, that the Golden Horseshoe spent  &#163;100,000  a year on stores, but there was nothing .in your statement to indicate what proportion of that amount was spent on lubricating oils. The stores entered on the books of a mining company are of a multifarious character. I have known nearly &#163;350 worth of whisky to be entered amongst mining stores as disinfectants. </para>

                        <para>- It is, but when an argument is .based upon a certain statement there should be something definite in the statement. I should expect to find amongst the most important items in the stores bill of a mining company such things as blasting materials, dynamite and other explosives, fuse, candles, and matches - and if mining companies are treated by match manufacturers and importers as the Commonwealth Government has been treated by those persons a considerable amount of money must be wasted by the companies in that direction. Amongst mining stores I should also expect to find ropes, belting,&#39; and a hundred and one other articles of that kind. We know also that the stores bill of a mining company includes provision for the entertainment of directors and their friends on visits to the mine, and every member of the Committee must know something of the extent to which this kind of hospitality on the part of mining companies is sometimes carried. In view of these facts to say that because  &#163;100,000  is spent on stores by a mining company the company will be ruined if it is called upon to pay 2d. or 3d. per gallon extra on lubricating oil is stretching things a little too far. With respect to the proposed increase of  duty  on this item, it has been clearly stated that those who are asking for it are prepared to give any reasonable guarantee that the price of lubricating oil will not be increased to the&#39; consumer. </para>

I ask honorable senators to say whether it would be wise for us to place the primary industries or the secondary industries in Australia at the mercy of the Standard Oil Trust of America. I suppose that every member of the Committee has some knowledge of the history of that Trust and the way in which it operates, and knows very well. that from its inception it has followed a course of crushing out every one opposed to it, and when it has succeeded of turning about and fleecing the public. </para>

                        <para>- The only thing that can check the Standard Oil &#39; Trust is either the existence of a competing company sufficiently protected to be beyond its power, or the nationalization of an industry such as is being carried on by the Commonwealth Oil Company at the present time. As it is not possible to secure the nationalization of anything while senators holding the same opinions as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> are here, we are thrown back on the alternative of giving the Commonwealth Oil Company and other companies a chance of operating alongside the Standard Oil Trust. That can only be done by granting them sufficient protection. . I am prepared to do that, &#34;and I hope that a majority of honorable senators will be of the same opinion. Of course, I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> and those who vote with him are always in favour of trusts, and during the history of the Senate, every time a word has been said against any trust, whether it has been the Sugar Trust, the Tobacco Trust, the Standard Oil Trust, or any other, the honorable senator has been up in arms in their defence. He and his friends are doing the same thing at the present time. </para>

                        <para>- I gave that gentleman a definite opportunity of doing so. He sent in  It&#39;s  card to me. evidently seeking an interview, and I informed him that I was unable to grant him that, because of a rule I have laid down, and not because of any disrespect to the individual in question. But I requested him to place before me in writing anything that he chose in connexion with the Tariff. I have never heard from that gentleman since. Had the information which has been furnished to other honorable senators &#39;been supplied- to me, it would have been in my hands a few days ago, so that I should have been able to look into the statements. But the company had apparently some objection to placing those who are thought to be not favorable to its pretensions in the position of being able to investigate the case for themselves. Therefore I can come to no other conclusion than that the company did not want such an investigation to be made. I am supported in that view by the fact that they did not. give evidence before the Tariff Commission. The statement has been made that the company was not in a position to present its case before the Commission. In answer to that, I refer to the fact that the members of the Tariff Commission did not sign their report till some time after the company commenced operations. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has pointed out that the last day on which the Tariff Commission was open to receive evidence was in June. 1906. Now, the second annual meeting of this company was held on the 18th December,1 907. </para>

                        <para>- No, the second annual meeting. That is one evidence which I can give- that the company was then in existence. But in furnishing this evidence I should like to point out to honorable senators that a big company of this kind is not formed on the day when it is registered. People are not going to put together a million of money for operations of this kind without a great deal of previous negotiation. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. We have under our New South Wales company law a provision by which a syndicate - as being the preliminary to a company - can secure registration; and&#39; that is practically the form in which our large companies are started. They secure registration as a syndicate in the first instance, and get to work as a legal entity, afterwards completing their arrangements for the formation of the company. Whether that was done qr not in this instance.I do not know, but I shall&#39; quote a statement from the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Ape</inline> to show that this company was born, in  existence, and at work before- the date on which the Tariff Commission ceased to receive evidence. In a recent issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> there is a very long report - three-quarters of a column in length - as to the operations, past history, and future prospects of this company. I have not the slightest doubt after reading it carefully that this article was inspired by the company themselves, because the&#34; details given by the writer are such as could only have been - supplied by some one quite familiar with the company&#39;s work. I am not saying that as being in any sense objectionable; but it is evidence that the article is not the result of mere guessing on the part of the writer in the columns of the <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> It is stated here - </para>

                <para class="block">Now, I submit that as further proof that before &#39;the date of the annual meeting of this company those connected with it were in a position, if they wished to do so, to approach the Tariff Commission. That they did not do so is evidence, to my mind, together with other reasons to which I shall refer, that they were perfectly willing, to start operations under the Tariff as it then existed. It does not require much inducement for any one to approach the Tariff Commission and say, &#34; We have a company in a state of formation, although not registered to-day,&#34; and to point out that if the promoters are given a duty higher than the duty formerly on the Tariffthey would be able to get to work immediately. In other instances interested parties did not wait for a company to be formed and registered. They said, &#34; Put the duty on, and Ave will get to work.&#34; It was quite competent for those associated  Avith  the Commonwealth Oil Company to do exactly the same thing e\&#39;en if the registration had not taken place. I should like the Committee to know who the gentlemen controlling, or at  any  rate directing, this company are. I will mention their names in order to show that it is not in the hands of inexperienced people, that they are not novices in big financial operations; but that they may be assumed to  know  enough to look after their  own  interests and the interests of their shareholders. Not that I object to that; but I venture to say that these gentlemen were not likely to lose the slightest chance of advancing what they believed to be the interests of their company. Certainly they have not been slow, to come here and place their case before honorable senators. Surely if they  were  of opinion that an increased duty was necessary at the time they would ha\&#39;e approached the Tariff Commission. But it appears to me that it is merely at the eleventh hour, and after having seen  how  other people can come here and get concessions - having noticed that it only meant&#39; &#34; Ask and ve shall receive &#34; - that they naturally said, &#34; Although we were prepared to go to work on a duty of 3d., still if Ave can get more from the Senate, we are going to get it.&#34; And so they have come here. </para>

                        <para>- I am not doubting the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of the company. I think it is an absolutely sound and reputable company. But I say that their action in this matter is rather an argument against the plea that it is necessary to give them a higher duty than- that proposed in the Tariff. I do not wish to be misunderstood. The whole of my remarks have tended to show that the company already had the conditions that they thought  were  essential to success, when they put their money into the venture and started. They were perfectly satisfied Avith the prospects at that time. If they had come to us and said that there  was  some error in their original calculations, or that there had been some disturbance in the conditions, which had upset their arrangements, they might hav had a better case for asking Parliament for a greater measure of protection than </para>

                <para>was contained in the original Tariff.  Now  the names of the directors of this company are - <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Newnes,  B&#39;art., M.P. ; <inline font-weight="bold">Sir W.</inline> B. Avery, Bart. ; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> L. Harmsworth, M.P. ; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. D.</inline> E. Alves, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. William</inline> Blythe. Two of the names I have mentioned are those of gentlemen who  stand high in the journalistic world of Great Britain. I am not taking exception to the fact that the company is controlled by a London directory. No one would be so shortsighted and &#39; foolish as to suppose that all the great natural industries of this company are going to be exploited by Australian capital. No one  welcomes  the  investment  of capital in Australia more heartily than I do j and I am especially pleased that the control of this big venture, if it is to be outside Australia, , is centred in Great Britain. But I refer to these facts to show that the company is not controlled by inexperienced men, but by men with plenty of experience of big companies, who knew what they were doing when they invested their money in this venture and invited the investing public of Great Britain to put their capital into the investment under a duty of 3d. per gallon on oil. </para>

                        <para>- Does my honorable friend mean to say that these gentlemen put up &#163;800,000 on the prospect of an increased duty? I should like to see the prospectus which they issued to .those whom they invited to take shares. I should like to know whether they attempted to float this company on the plea that there was a prospect of an increased duty. We may safely assume that when they put their&#39; prospectus forward they gave facts and figures to induce their fellow citizens in Great Britain to invest their money in the venture on the understanding that they were to work under a duty of 3d. per gallon. </para>

The names of the gentlemen I have read are a sufficient guarantee for- the fact that they would never have put their money into it at all unless they were satisfied that they could carry on under that duty. They would not have asked the people of England to subscribe &#163;800,000 for a  ven.ture  which depended for its success wholly on the increasing of a protective duty. </para>

                        <para>- An appeal has been made to the Committee to increase the duty, and I am reviewing the position of the company to ascertain what justification there is for doing so. If I found a justification, I should vote for a higher duty, but I have not done so yet. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nash&#39;s</inline> latest book dealing with registered companies, published in 1906, the authorized capital of the company is &#163;800,000, though it is possible that that capital&#34; may have since been increased. Of that capital there have been issued 500,000 preference shares and 225,000 deferred, each of &#163;1 in value, the deferred shares being fully paid up and the preference shares being paid up .to 8s. each. Of course the deferred shares issued as fully paid up may not have contributed to the working capital of the company. They may have been given in payment for the assets of the old New South Wales company, and possibly  some of them went to those who filled the useful and necessary role of promoters. But the company is not small and struggling ; its means are not circumscribed. Everything in its circumstances suggests that those who direct it obtained, in the first instance, the fullest information regarding the resources to be exploited, the possibilities of the market, and, above all, the probabilities of the Tariff. I wish them Godspeed in their undertaking. It would be a curious thing if, being a New South Welshman, I tried to in any way hamper their enterprise. </para>

                        <para>- All are agreed that a duty should be imposed, the only question being whether we should vote for the rate of 3d. proposed by the Government, or that of 6d. proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> which would allow the company to levy tribute on every owner of an engine, whether in mine, factory, workshop, or steamboat. We have had read to lis a statutory declaration by a gentleman connected with the old New South Wales company containing statements clearly designed to show that it failed because of the removal of the New South Wales duty on oil ; but I deny that that was the sole or the main cause of the company&#39;s non-success. According  to Coghlan&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Wealth and Progress of New South Wales</inline> for 1898-99 the company failed chiefly because of the steady fall in the price of the shale which it was exporting. The price fell at one time over &#163;3, hovering for a number of years between <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> 5s. and <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> 9s. a ton. After 189 1 it fell, first, to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 18s. 9d., and afterwards to <inline font-style="italic">fi</inline> is. 6d., a figure which made, the company&#39;s operations unprofitable. The New South Wales duty was 6d., but that was subsequently, reduced to 3d., and disappeared gradually at the end of a year or two. If there is any journal in Australia which is keen to attribute to Tariff defects the failure of a company like this it is the <inline font-style="italic">Age j-</inline> but in the article to which- 1 have referred it is stated that there were several reasons why the company failed, these being enumerated as insufficiency of capital, the rugged nature of the country to be worked, and the assiduous assaults of the Standard Oil Trust. If the Tariff and the competition of the Standard Oil Trust are advanced as the reasons for the failure of that company, I ask what was happening while the duty of 6d. per gallon was still in force? Notwithstanding the existence of that duty, the company diminished its production of petroleum until it had brought it to vanishing point. But every one knows that the company was never robust, and that its failure was due largely to the insufficiency of its capital, and to the nature of the country which had to be worked. </para>

                        <para>- If I were to quote statements from the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> or the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> my honorable friends would brush them as ideas an honorable senator did this afternoon - with the remark that they were the views of prejudiced free-trade organs. Therefore, I hope to save time, and to have a little better chance of carrying conviction to the minds of my honorable friends opposite by quoting from a newspaper which, if at all biased, leans towards their way of thinking. I wish now -to deal &#39; with the tremendous bogy that is put forward to frighten timid senators. We are told that unless we double the &#34;duty the Standard Oil Trust will crush out of existence the Commonwealth Oil Corporation, with its capital of nearly ;&#163;i, 000,000. </para>

                <para class="block">Do my honorable friends suppose that the promoters of the Commonwealth Oil Corporation, when they commenced operations, had never heard of the existence of the Trust? Do they imagine that they set out for New South Wales with an immense capital, and did not discover that an Oil Trust existed in the United States of America until they had commenced operations? We may depend upon it that they knew more about the operations of that Trust than any honorable senator knows. But they said, in effect, &#34; Trust or no Trust, Tariff or no Tariff, we are strong enough to exploit the shale deposits in the mountains of New South Wales.&#34; Let us go a little further. I want to show that if we imposed a duty of even is. per gallon, or double that rate, the local corporation would still have to face the competition of the American Trust. If the company carries out its project, no power on earth can save it from having to compete with the Trust, not only at its own doors, but in the markets of the world. If its claim be correct, that it is producing oil at the rate of 3,000,000 gallons per annum, and will shortly be producing something like 12,000,000 gallons per annum, there is only one place where it can dispose of its surplus output,&#39; and that is in the markets of the world. If, therefore, the Commonwealth Oil Corporation is strong enough to produce oil in New South Wales and send it abroad to compete in the open market with that of the Standard Oil Trust, it need hot be frightened to meet that combination within Australia, where it will be protected to the extent of a duty of 25 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- I shall have a great deal more faith in- that statement, which we hear so often, when I see, on the part of the Government, a movement to control some of the trusts already in existence here. I am not suggesting that the Commonwealth Oil Corporation is a trust; I am dealing now with the abstract question. Do honorable senators suppose that any trust is going to be frightened by such a Ministerial declaration as we have just heard? Legal action alone will frighten a trust, and the Government seem very slow to take proceedings. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know thai we have a written guarantee. There is one way, and one way only, in which a company could give a guarantee of the kind, and that would be by depositing in the Treasury a substantial sum, to be forfeited at any time it attempted to charge a higher price. Nearly every witness who came be fore the Tariff Commission said he would guarantee that if a duty were imposed to protect his industry he would not increase his prices. The only exceptions were one or two simple, honest men, who said that with the imposition of a higher duty prices would be raised. It is easy to make such promises, and if&#39; later, it were found that prices had increased, we should probably be told that the cost of production had increased. But there is something more involved than the mere question of increased prices. Allowing for fluctuations which take place, whether due to increased prosperity or other reasons, there ought to be, over . a long period of time, a steady diminution in the prices of articles of this kind. That being so, when a company with every evidence of a long life before it gives a promise that it will not increase prices, I want something more. In such circumstances, I should look for a guarantee that prices would fall in sympathy  with  values outside. </para>

                        <para>- The difficulty of obtaining a bond from a company is too obvious to be stated. I am not now referring to the Commonwealth Oil Corporation ; but the ease with which a company can avoid the fulfilment of a bond must be apparent to every one. If a. promise is made by one board of directors - and I am not aware that the directors of the Commonwealth Oil Corporation have ever made the promise of which we have heard so much - another board of directors may refuse to be bound by it. We have no regal evidence that the company has ever made such a promise. </para>

                        <para>- That would depend upon whether or not the Anti-Trust Act contained any special provision in regard to what should be accepted as evidence. I believe that in the Bill we have passed there are some special provisions of the kind. But the point I wish to make is that it is easy for promises of this kind to be made without the sanction of the directors. Very frequently, zealous representatives of a company will allow their zeal to carry them a little further than they ought to go. </para>

                        <para>- I regard the statement that the Commonwealth Oil Company will guarantee not to increase the price of its product as the &#34; trimmings &#34; put around the dish that we are invited to swallow. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has affirmed that the oil industry is as much a primary industry as is the gold industry. That statement is  perfectly true, but the honorable senator did not carry his parallel as far as he should have done. The position is that the oil industry, which is a primary industry, is seeking permission to tax the gold-mining industry - which is another primary industry. What would be said if the gold-miners of Australia approached Parliament with a request to enable them to take 5 per cent., 30 per cent., 15 per cent., 25 per cent., or 50 per cent, of the product of the oil mines? Yet the proposal now under consideration is that&#34; the oil industry shall be permitted to levy a tax of 50 per cent, upon its product, which is largely used by the mining industry. I think we are all too apt to forget that for every Broken Hill, Golden Horseshoe, or Great Cobar mine that is discovered there are hundreds of ventures which prove failures, which are abandoned for want of sufficient capital to develop them, and that there are thousands of men at present prospecting small shows, the success of which depends. entirely upon the economy with which operations can be conducted. I am hot pleading for the large mines-- </para>

I am endeavouring to deal with it from a practical stand-point, and I am unable to see the slightest justification for extending to this company a single point more protection than was afforded it by the 25 per cent, duty which was originally proposed. But even if such a justification existed one would still be entitled to consider the other industries of the Commonwealth which will be injuriously affected to the extent that we subsidize this great and wealthy corporation. </para>

                    <para>. - The industry which we have in our mind&#39;s eye in discussing this item is one which has been languishing for a very long period indeed. Had the shale deposits upon which it is based been located in any State other than New South Wales I believe that its success or otherwise would have been determined two generations ago. The industry has existed in New South Wales in a very tame and lame form for the last twenty years. </para>

                        <para>- No. It was only during the operation of the Dibbs Tariff that any protection was extended to it. Had the industry been centred in a protectionist State like Victoria its success or failure would have been established years ago. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has addressed himself chiefly to the present position of the Commonwealth Oil Company. He has pointed out that that company was formed under free-trade conditions and without any guarantee that the industry would be afforded any measure of protection whatever. In making that statement I think that he slightly over-drew the picture, because since the advent of Federation it has 1&#34;&#62;een well known that, whether for good or for ill, the electors of the Commonwealth have unmistakably declared in favour&#39; of a protective policy.- Consequently, those who are interested in the company to which T have alluded must have realized that when the Tariff was revised the industry would very probably be extended a reasonable measure of protection. Whilst I have never been personally engaged in this industry 1 may mention that nearly twenty years ago I was invited by a gentleman to prospect the very country which now forms a portion of the territory belonging to the Commonwealth Oil Company - I refer to the district surrounding Capertee. That gentleman prospected the district, and  sold out to the company that afterwards sold out to the present big corporation. The. industry has been struggling ici New South Wales for twenty years or more. In the other districts which the corporation has now secured the right to mine in, it has been known for a long time that kerosene shale exists, although its quality or .quantity was uncertain. It was only by prospecting that anything de finite could be known. I give credit to the company for having. done a great deal of that prospecting work, and, so far as I can judge, as one who has some knowledge of mining,- they have splendid prospects of success. If any company can possibly make the oil industry a success they can. They have enormous capital to work upon, with a great extent of territory, containing what I believe to be a fair quality of shale, and, leaving kerosene out of consideration, they have excellent prospects of doing well with the by-products, which the Standard and other . oil companies now exporting to Australia cannot produce. We should approach this subject with those facts in mind, remembering that we are now framing a Tariff for the purpose of extending Australian industries. We should deal with the question irrespective of whether we have free-trade or protectionist ideas. I would remind free-trade senators that we - are now considering a protective and not a revenue or free-trade Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- I see that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> is still on the fence. He was there1 during the passage of the last Tariff, and I believe he will stay there until the end of the chapter. This Australian, company will probably meet with very keen competition from the beginning. A most powerful company to compete against is the Standard Oil Company of America. Knowing that the local company will have to meet straightaway with the keen competition of so powerful a rival, we must be prepared to give it a certain amount of encouragement, especially as it has already shown its <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> by coming here, getting together capital, building a fairly lengthy railway, opening up shale mines, and erecting retorts to treat the shale. Bearing in  mind  the amount of protection we have given to other industries, we cannot do other than grant a fair measure of protection to the company which proposes to produce oil in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- A little more than 25 per cent, would be a fair compromise. I have risen to make a proposal which I hope the Committee will accept. By it we shall not be taxing any existing industries. The State which I represent depends for its existence on the mining  industry, which is and always will be an enormous consumer of lubricating oil. I am, therefore, to a great extent, proposing to tax the industries of my own State in order to give a fair share of protection to the Commonwealth Oil Corporation. There are a number of other industries besides mining that will be taxed to supply a market for this oil, and therefore I wish every safeguard to be provided in order that those industries may not be taken advantage of in the meantime, because, after all, the operations of this oil corporation are a thing of the future. Whether it will be a. success or not is a matter of speculation. If we frame the Tariff so as to give a fair measure of protection to the company, and, at the same time, place no tax upon existing industries, we shall have come to a settlement with which no reasonable man can find fault. For that reason I intend to move a request that the duty be increased from  3&#189;d.  to  4d.  per gallon (General Tariff), and from  3d.  to  3¾d.  (United Kingdom), but that those increases shall not come into force except by proclamation issued on the authority of a resolution of both Houses of Parliament. By that means the duty will stand as it is now in the Tariff - our free-trade friends cannot object to that - until the company has shown itself capable of supplying the whole of the Commonwealth markets by its own efforfsl. That is so eminently sensible and reasonable a proposition that no one should be able to take exception to if. I cannot agree to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> request to increase the duty to  6d.  per gallon. The Committee will do well to accept my suggestion as a settlement of the dispute. </para>

                    (New South Wales)  &#91;9.10&#93;.  - Before we adjourned for dinner, I, in the course of an interjection, made reference to the great interest shown in certain quarters in support of &#34; tinpot &#34; industries, and I understand that an impression prevails that my remark had reference to the Commonwealth Oil Company. I desire to disabuse any honorable senator of such an idea. The Common wealth Oil Company, I have every reason to believe, is a well-founded, competent corporation, and will be able to carry out the objects for which it was formed. It may seem very unusual that, after sitting here for weeks assisting in passing duties, and sometimes in attempting to retard the imposition of what I regard as excessive duties, in respect of the industries of every State in the Commonwealth except my own, I should not rise for the purpose of offering support to a proposal that seeks, nominally, to enhance the benefit which the Tariff confers oh a great industry in New South Wales. This is an industry that does not exist, and is not likely to exist, in any of the other States, because in New South W,ales alone are to be found beds of shale of sufficient richness to supply the kerosene and lubricants which form the subject of our present discussion. But while I do not intend to occupy any length of time in stating the case as I regard it, I shall be compelled to take five or ten minutes- in dealing with a matter which
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline>
                    so lavishly explained in the course of an hour&#39;s oration. I can sum up very quickly, I think, the facts as they strike me. The Commonwealth Oil Company was formed with a full knowledge of the terms and conditions of the old Tariff ; and those who subscribed the funds could not_ have dreamt of proposals such as are now before the Committee. I am sure I am well grounded in the belief that they made their calculations carefully, with a full knowledge of the existing circumstances ; and the large sum of money, approximating to nearlv&#163;1,000,000, which this company raised, is sufficient to satisfy me that it was not subscribed recklessly. The gentleman at the head of this company in Australia enjoys the confidence and respect at any rate of every one who knows him in New South Wales, and I believe he is well-known and respected throughout the Commonwealth. I do not for an instant suppose that this large capital was invested with the idea that profits could not be made under the then existing Tariff, and that some other Tariff proposals would be necessary for success. If I am correct, why should the whole community of Australia be taxed in order to increase the earnings of a company, the members of which determined that they could operate successfully under the old Customs rates ? I should like to see this company a success, and I think it will be, even -without the higher duties for which some honorable senators are clamouring. I believe that at least some of those who are seeking higher duties are doing so
                    <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline>
                    - that they are not. seeking to benefit their own States. I make no .charge, such as has been frequently made in the course of the Tariff discussion, about geographical free-traders or geographical protectionists. &#34;This is simply and solely a New South &#34;Wales industry ; and I pay honorable senators from other States, who support a higher duty, the compliment of believing that they are seeking no personal advantage for themselves or for their constituents. On the other hand, if I tate a course which is unusual with a large majority in the chamber, in opposing a duty peculiarly applicable to an industry in my own State, I cannot be charged with seeking any advantage for myself or any section of my constituents. The effort I am now putting forth must surely be in the interests of those higher aims which transcend localism and State interests, and are for the good of the whole community. Week after week, while higher duties on coffee, arrowroot, tapioca, and other tropical produce have been fought for persistently, and. let me say,&#39; successfully by honorable senators, representing Queensland-

It has only been necessary for some honorable senator to say that in some unnamed street in the vicinity of Melbourne, some one is occasionally making a pair of gloves or a pair of socks, to raise an enthusiastic demand for high duties. I have never asked for a duty. or sought to support a duty, applicable to my own State. </para>

                        <para>- I have already paid those honorable senators the compliment of acknowledging that, in common parlance* they are not attempting to grind any axe of their own. I have only to make my position quite clear. I believe that this is a strong and capable company, certain to produce good results, and that those good results, which were calculated on the basis of the late comparatively low duty, will be to the advantage of the whole of- Australia, and not of New South Wales alone. As the calculations have been based on a lower duty there is no possible reason why this or the other House should impose a higher burden of taxation upon the entire people of the Commonwealth, when the gentlemen concerned, by their own acts - by their subscription of funds, their securing of a large area, and  their developmental operations - have given the strongest evidence to the world that they have every justification for believing that with the duty in the old Tariff they can carry on successfully a development of industry and a production sufficiently large to materially enhance the well-being of those who have happily invested their money in this great enterprise. I may be regarded as remarkable in my opposition to a duty for a local industry. If I am remarkable in that regard, at least it is not a reflection upon myself. It might possibly be a reflection upon honorable gentlemen who have sought for their States local advantages, while I do not believe that the State from which I come, with its splendid resources and its large invested wealth, needs to beg at the hands of the people of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The last statement will, I hope, be taken as more nearly expressing what I intended to convey. The company wishes to obtain a certain amount of immunity from competition ; . and, directly or indirectly, to have a  State guarantee. I do not know that it is our duty when framing a Tariff to guarantee, directly or indirectly, any company, however reputable or. strong it may be, at the expense or risk of the taxpayers. I wish to carry the memories of my Socialist friends back to the time when, if a man spoke in Parliament of a syndicate or large company, and talked of guaranteeing syndicates and companies by means of State assistance, he was accused of betraying the public interests, and of desiring to run the country in the interests of monopolies and wealthy syndicates. I fancy that the Socialist&#39;s are weakening very strongly in that direction. From time to time I have received circulars which pointed out that if increases of duties were granted, certain companies would be formed to work industries in the Commonwealth. I put the circulars on one side after reading them. I intend tq investigate the statements very carefully, because I think that it is somewhat suspicious when we have company promoters or company prospectuses lying about Parliament, and are asked by circular to consider the promotion of some company. </para>

                        <para>- But that, is the reverse of what the honorable senator implied. In this case, we are asked by a company to increase the duty on an article to the extent of 100 per cent. When we receive a circular from company promoters, we are perfectly justified&#39; in scrutinizing their statements very carefully, and in ascertaining, if we can, who are behind  them. </para>

                        <para>- No, that I received a circular from company promoters, as I believe many other honorable senators have done. I have received a circular in which it is held out to me, as an inducement to vote for increased duties, that if they are granted certain companies will be formed. I do not intend to trouble the Committee further with it now, but when the proposals are submitted I intend to make a- very close investigation of the statements that have been made. I wish to make it quite clear that every syndicate in America that approached Congress in order to secure city franchises, and, as it ultimately turned our in very many cases, in order to exploit the citizens, submitted a guarantee that if the water, gas, or transportation franchise for which they asked were granted, it would result in no increased cost to the citizens. </para>

                        <para>- Whilst I direct attention to a coincidence in the similarity in the form of application to Parliament, I impute no corrupt practices to any local company. In referring to the peculiar way in which the request for&#39; an increase of this duty has been put before honorable senators, I have no wish to cast the slightest reflection. I assume that, so far as this local industry is concerned, it is in the hands of <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> men, who intend to work it for national purposes, but I still think that the protection asked for is too high, and I cannot vote for such an increase in this duty as has been suggested. I am glad to find that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie sees clearly that the company is asking too much. </para>

                        <para>- No; I should prefer a &#39; lower duty than that which the honorable senator has suggested.  1  think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has put his case admirably, and that there is no answer to his argument that the company has been able to do so much under the former duty. In the interests of the taxpayers&#39; I feel that the prudent course to pursue is to let this company &#34; paddle its own canoe.&#34; The company commands large capital, its operations are, apparently, promising very well, and, in the circumstances, I do not feel inclined to give it any further assistance than that afforded by the existing duties. </para>

                    <para>. - We have heard a great deal of more or less irrelevant talk this afternoon. The case for the duty in this instance can be stated in a very few words. Those of us who favour an increase of the duty have been accused of desiring to levy tribute upon every industry in Australia. If honorable senators who made that charge had given the matter the slightest consideration, had dived &#39;a few inches below the surface of the question, they would have discovered that, so far from attempting to levy tribute from every industry in Australia, our object is to save Australian industries from having to pay tribute to a foreign company. That is exactly the position. I ask honorable senators to say whether it is better, in the interests of Australian industries, that the supply of lubricating oils should be a monopoly in the hands of the Standard Oil Company, or that there should be a company within the confines of Australia supplying those oils to our various industries in competition with the Standard Oil Company, and keeping its operations under control. That appears to me to be the whole question in a nutshell. I have no desire to see the mining industry, about which some honorable senators appear to be so anxious,- handed over to the tender, mercies of the Standard Oil Company. At the last annual meeting of that company the  chairman  stated in distinct and definite terms that the company was determined at all costs to retain its hold of its foreign markets. What did that mean? It meant that the company was prepared to spend, not thousands, but millions, of . pounds in exterminating opposition wherever it might be found. Here we have a company trying to raise its infant head in New South Wales, a powerful company, as we have been told, having command of a great deal of capital and floated by some of the sharpest men in Great Britain. We have been told that this company established itself in Australia under the old Tariff, and yet, with all the acumen, financial stability, and knowledge of affairs possessed by those who control it&#34;, what is the result ? It comes to the Senate, and asks for our assistance in its conflict with the Standard Oil Company. That is the position. If these men were men of straw, who did not know their business, and were not anxious to promote this industry, we might discount their statements, but their position in the financial world, and the fact that they have embarked their money in this enterprise, is surely a sufficient guarantee to honorable senators not only that they &#39; are anxious to promote this industry, but that the danger of their extermination at the hands of the Standard Oil Company is not a mere dream, but a reality. Are we going to help this company or to assist the Standard Oil Company? That is the question which honorable senators must answer to-night. I do not care how some honorable senators may attempt to cloud the issue by words, nor do I care a . single straw for their lengthy effusions, which, for the most part, had nothing whatever to do with the question. </para>

We have plenty of shale in Australia, and we should be able to manufacture all the lubricating oil, kerosene oil, and every other kind of oil that we require. I believe we shall yet do so. I have no wish to keep the Committee longer, and finding, very much to my disgust, I may say, that a majority of honorable senators are opposed to my request, I beg leave to withdraw it. </para>

                    <para>. - This is a technical matter in regard to which I cannot pretend to any knowledge. We have the assurance of the Minister that if the amendment is made, it will not affect ordinary kerosene, or make dutiable what is now on the free list ; but will simplify administration. That being so, I do not offer any opposition to the request. It is, however, very strange that such a request has come, not from the responsible Minister, but from a private senator. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator forgets that what is going on here is absolutely without precedent in any Parliament in the world. In other Legislatures it is Ministers alone who propose taxation; but here any senator is allowed to do so, by moving for increases of duty, Ministers supporting their requests, although they know that they cannot be considered in another place unless covered by a message from the Governor-General. The proceedings in this Committee are unparalleled in the history of Parliaments. Who is responsible? The Ministry can afterwards turn round and say, &#34; We did not propose this. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator So-and-so</inline> did . and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator So-and-so</inline> proposed something  else.&#34; And so they go on until we have a Government that does not govern ; a Ministry that does not administer. </para>

I have no need to elaborate the matter, and I think that you will admit, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> that so far as I have gone I have not exceeded in the slightest degree the latitude which must necessarily be permitted in the extraordinary circumstances in which we find ourselves. I have taken part in another place in the framing of a considerable number of Tariffs, and have never heard of private members of Parliament proposing a tax on the people. </para>

It is difficult to closely follow what is going on in view of the many requests proposed and then temporarily withdrawn, in accordance with the general custom, to accommodate other honorable senators. I hope, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> you will not think that what I said just now had the slightest tinge of discourtesy to yourself, but I most respectfully claim, with the greatest deference to you personally, and to your position, that at the proper time I should have the right to discuss the matter that I have referred to. There is, however, in view of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has pointed out, no need to raise that question now. </para>

                    <para>. - When I stated that the request moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> was acceptable to the Government, I hope that I was not misunderstood by many honorable senators, as I appear to have been by some. I said then that I had not seen the requested amendments until, at all events, some little time before any other member of the. Committee had seen them. This particular request, which it is competent for any honorable senator to submit, was brought under my notice before it was moved. That is a courtesy which I, as a Minister, appreciate very much, because it affords me an opportunity, before I give expression to the Government&#39;s attitude with regard to the matter, to consult those who know far better than I do the actual working of a Tariff. It was some time during the forenoon that it was brought before my notice that a request of this kind was to be moved. I then consulted the Customs officials who are in attendance here, and who have been of great service to Ministers and to other senators who have had requests to propose. I was informed by them that if it were agreed to it would enable them to dp what I said - to distinguish between oils brought in to be used for purposes such . as those to which the oils mentioned in these sub-items are put, and oils which might, for those purposes, be introduced fraudulently, as kerosene. That will explain that this request is not being moved at the instigation of the Government or in the interest of the Department of Trade and Customs. Finding, as I have said, that the requested amendment would be acceptable and advantageous, I informed the Committee, as I deemed it my duty to do in such circumstances, that that was the view which, the practised officials of the Customs Department took of it, and that the Government would accept it. Instead of the Government wishing to evade the responsibility of submitting requests for amendments which the Department desire, the position is entirely different. </para>

                    <para>. - The tabulated statement in the hands of the Committee shows that the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended the imposition of a duty of 6d. per gallon upon naphtha and benzine, of 3d. per gallon upon mineral oil n.e.i., of&#189;d. per gallon upon&#34; other&#34; oils, and of&#188;d. per gallon when those &#34;other&#34; oils were methylated. I am not in a position to say at the moment what is meant by &#34; other &#34; oils, but it seems to me that naphtha and benzine, in the light &#34;of the recommendation to which I have referred, have some claim to a larger duty than&#188;d. per gallon. </para>

In ether words, it means an increase in the rate of 300 per cent. I do not propose to labour the question, but it seems to me that we are asked to sanction this increase without any sufficient reason, other than that these oils can be manufactured in the Commonwealth. </para>

If so, the Committee have unconsciously passed an amendment which will affect kerosene. </para>

                    <para>. - What I told the Committee was the information given to me by the Customs officials. They have ascertained, upon inquiry, that . 790 is a degree of specific gravity below which will be found oils that may be introduced as kerosene oils, but that are invariably used for other purposes than illuminating. In that way, oil which should pay duty, coming in for industrial purposes, may be introduced as free through being designated kerosene, and afterwards be turned to other purposes than illuminating. The  790 standard has been adopted by the Customs Department after inquiries made by them. I have just ascertained, since <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> raised the point, that they are assured that . 790 is the correct degree of specific gravity above which all oils claiming to be kerosene should stand. I shall pursue inquiries further, and if I am satisfied that oil of &#34;as low a specific gravity as . 783 is used commercially, generally, or in most cases, as a kerosene illuminant, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> implies, I shall be prepared to give the Committee another opportunity of reconsidering what they have already- determined upon the voices. </para>

I take the present opportunity because I did not . desire to occupy time by moving the formal adjournment of the Senate. I refer to the compulsory retirement of a post-office official from the membership of a Roads Board in Western Australia. On the  9th  November, 1905, this question was raised by me in the following motion - . </para>

                    <para>That, in the opinion of the Senate, members of the Commonwealth Public Service should be permitted to hold elected positions on municipal and other local governing bodies, so long as such positions do not interfere with the proper performance of their duties as public servants. </para>
                    <para class="block">A general discussion took place, and the motion met with support from honorable senators on all sides. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> spoke in favour of the proposal, and the representatives of the Government, Senators Playford and Keating, in asking that the motion should be withdrawn, pointed out that a minute had been issued to the heads of Departments to the effect. that the Government would not approve of public servants taking such positions. After the debate had gone on for a time, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> who was Minister of Defence, said he was in sympathy with the motion - that the issue of the minute was a mistake, and it would&#34; be withdrawn. That distinct, promise will be found recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of  9th  November,  1905,  pages  4805-6.

                    <para class="block">So that  the Public Service Commissioner has not approved of the extension, and the Deputy Postmaster-General will not apply his decision until the election has been held. When we passed the Public Service Bill we gave up the control .of the Public Service so far as certain things were concerned to the Public Service Commissioner, but retained certain other matters within the control of the Minister, subject to the approval of Parliament. The - Deputy Postmaster-General, the Public Service Commissioner, and the Secretary to the Post and Telegraph Department have apparently, without remitting the matter to the Minister, and because of some regulation which I contend is <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> or which, at any rate, is in direct contradiction to a distinct promise made to the Senate by a former Minister that the direction issued to heads of Departments would be withdrawn, have assumed for the Commissioner a power which the Act did not give and was not intended to give him. I consider that the question is an important one. I submit to the Minister who represents the Postmaster-General that he should ask his colleague to retain the power which Parliament intended that he should exercise, and not allow the Commissioner to assume a power which was not given and was not intended to be given to him by the Act, and, furthermore, to see that the will of this Chamber which was recorded on that occasion, and which the Ministers promised to obey, is obeyed, and that these positions shall be open to members of the&#39; Public Service always subject to the limitation in the Act, that their occupancy of them does not conflict with the performance of their public duties. </para>

                        It does appear to me to be absolutely outside the risk of cavil that by some extraordinary means the Secretary, to the Postal Department,

                        has assumed a position and exercised a power which undoubtedly he does not possess, and which appertains to the Minister. If the latter is too busy in matters which have already been discussed here&#39; to attend to his duties, and neglects them, or leaves them to the permanent head of the Department, it is quite time that Parliament intervened.

                            <para>- I hope they do not all do that, but clearly something has gone very much astray in this case. In addition to what I have said about the permanent head of the Post and Telegraph Department, I cannot help thinking that the Public Service Commissioner, whom I have known for very many years, and who I believe to be a most valuable public officer, has by some extraordinary process been led astray, and induced to take up a position which, according to law, as shown by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> is clearly untenable. The public servants of the country are surely to be permitted to discharge the duties of citizen-, ship so long as their discharge does not interfere with the proper discharge. of their duties under the Public Service Acf. They should be in a position to give their services to municipalities and to the whole community without this extraordinary attempt lu establish a bureaucratic autocracy. Here we find one or two public officials assuming duties which belong to the Minister and the Governor-General in Council, and the right to order that which can alone be ordered by the Minister and the Governor-General in Council. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that Parliament has not parted with the -right to interfere in such cases. I hope that the Minister of Home Affairs, in whose hands I believe the  administration of the Public Service Act is placed,, will give such attention to the matter brought under his notice as will bring about what appears to be a much needed reform in its administration. The case to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has directed attention may perhaps be only one indication of a canker that is eating into the heart of the Public Service. If this kind of thing can take place in connexion with membership of a Roads Board, goodness knows what may be going on in other directions, and to what extent&#39; the faithful and proper administration of the Act is being warped. The  Deputy  Postmaster-General of Western Australia may be a very good man, but if the men under him cannot deliver letters within a few hundred yards of the post-office to which they are attached, I do not think we can regard him as a very reliable guide in this matter. . In my opinion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has discharged a valuable public duty in bringing this matter forward, and I feel sure that at the hands of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> the needed intervention will be readily accorded and justice done. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to say just a few brief words in reply. It was not until I heard what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has had to say just now that I was personally informed of the facts connected with this particular case. Although inquiries were made of me some time since in the Senate, and I gave replies to them as furnished by the Department, I was not personally cognisant of the circumstances of the case. I am not quite sure, even now, after learning something of the nature of the correspondence, that the case is quite So bad as my honorable friend is inclined to think. I intend as early as possible to go into the whole of the correspondence, and to see my honorable colleague, the Postmaster-General, with regard- to it, when perhaps there may be discovered a very satisfactory explanation of the matters of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has complained. &#39;I was under the impression when the honorable senator was reading through the papers that he read a. minute- by the Postmaster-General to &#34; inform the applicant Myers accordingly,&#34; but on looking at the papers I cannot find that, and the honorable senator now assures me that the minute to that effect was written by the  Deputy  Postmaster-General of Western Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I can quite understand that in many instances, in order to expedite the settlement of matters of this kind, the permanent head of a Department might send on a communication to&#39; the Public Service Commissioner. In the ordinary course a Minister on receipt of an application of this kind would probably refer it to the Public Service Commissioner for the courtesy of an expression of his opinion. If the Minister, through pressure of other work, did not happen to be in his office when such an application was received the permanent head of the Department might, in order that the matter with which it dealt should be expedited, take the responsibility on behalf of the Minister of sending trie communication to the Public Service Commissioner for the favour of his advice and recommendation, which the Minister might subsequently consider and act upon. I was under the impression that at such a stage the Postmaster-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger,</inline> did deal with this matter, and after considering the advice tendered, gave instructions that the applicant should be informed that his application could not be granted. I have failed to find that impression sub&#39;stantiated by the papers, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> assures me that his recollection is that it was the  Deputy  Postmaster-General ot Western Australia who minuted the papers to that effect. As I have already said, I shall make further inquiries as to the Minister&#39;s attitude with respect to the application, and I hope I shall be able to put some more satisfactory view of thereafter before the honorable senator than that which has been presented by him thisevening. </para>
