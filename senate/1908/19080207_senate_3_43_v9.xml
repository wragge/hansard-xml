                        <para>- I wish to know from the Minister representing the Postmaster-General why newspapers which arrived from Sydney mid-day yesterday were not delivered until this morning? If it is due to the undermanning of the Melbourne Post Office, I ask whether the Government think it justifiable to allow this state of things to continue, seeing that during the past six . years the Commonwealth has returned to the States , £6,000,000 more than the Constitution required to be paid? </para>

                    <para>. - I am greatly disappointed at the little progress which has been made with the schedule during the past fortnight. Honorable senators must admit that the public has a right to expect that we shall have finished with the Tariff by the nth March, a date which, in my judgment, gives us ample time within which to do the work. I wish to avoid night sittings, and therefore give notice that next week I shall ask the Senate to meet at 11 a.m. on Wednesdays and Thursdays. Should that expedient fail there will be no alternative but to sit very much later from time to time ; because the work must be got through. </para>

During the past fortnight we have been very dilatory, not having done more work than should have been done in half-an-hour. I do not propose any alteration of the hours of meeting next week; but I think. that we should, by Thursday, have dealt with Divisions IV. and V. If we have not done so, I shall invite honorable senators not to terminate the sitting until the consideration of Division V. has been finished. I think, however, that with the cooperation of honorable" senators we can get through our work without sitting unduly long. What we should do is to vote, and not to talk. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators on this side of the chamber would have every reason to resent it. If, on the other hand, the Minister's remarks merely conveyed a regret that more progress had not been made, we can indorse therm I also want to point out, as I have done before, that it is hardly reasonable for one side to plead for expedition on the part of the other side unless they are also prepared to set a good example in that direction ; and in that respect the Government have hopelessly and manifestly failed. </para>

Council made a certain statement as to the progress of the Committee on the Tariff in general.

Minister, but I asked him to desist. I did so because, whilst standing order 405, which provides that no senator shall digress from the subject-matter of any question under discussion, has frequently been allowed to remain in abeyance so far as. a Ministerial statement is concerned, on no occasion, so. far as I am aware, has it not been applied in this connexion to all other senators, save leaders of parties. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has dissented from my ruling in the following terms - </para>

In accordance with that practice, I allowed the Vice-President of the Executive Council to make a statement, although it was not germane to the item "Corn Flour" then under consideration. Following another recognised practice in not only the Senate, but, I believe, almost all legislative assemblies, I permitted <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> as leader of one of the parties in this Chamber, to comment on the remarks of the Minister. It was announced in the Senate some time ago that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was the leader of one of the parties, and, so far as I am aware, that announcement was made with the consent of a majority of honorable senators of the Opposition. It was stated at the same time that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> had ceased to be the leader of that party, and that intimation, I believe, was received without dissent. In conformity with standing order 405, I refused to allow any further discussion by individual senators. </para>

                        <para>-  I wish, in the first place, to say that the question of leadership is not involved in any shape or form. I did not assert my right to protest because of pretending to be, or claiming to occupy the position of, a leader in this Chamber. In the next place the question involved is not whether a Minister is entitled to make a statement with regard to the business of the Senate. I take no exception to the invariable practice in this and every other Parliament as to Ministerial statements, nor do I take exception to the right of any honorable senator, whatever position he may occupy or be assumed to occupy, to discuss any statement - if he is in order in doing so - made by the Minister. The point which I have raised, however, is one of the highest importance as affecting the individual rights and liberties of the Senate. That is my position. If I am wrong, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> you will so intimate to the Senate, and. no one will yield a more ready obedience than I shall. The point that arises is this : The Minister, in a statement which ought to have been in every respect judicial, fair, and free from reflections on any one, reflected on honorable senators generally. I listened with respect - if I may use the expression - and approval to the resentment expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> I was not alone in feeling that the Minister took advantage of the opportunity to censure honorable senators generally. In the course of a statement, if properly made when it was, which ought to have been confined simply to an announcement with regard to business, and the intentions of the Government with respect to the present position, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> addressed to honorable senators on all sides -he said that he did not confine his remarks to any one section - words of censure of the severest kind. He spoke of waste of time, and said that during the last fortnight we had practically done no work. </para>

But I have an equal right to protest against it, if I regard the charge as unjust. The point which I put to the  Chairman,  who listened to me with courtesy, was that, whatever conventions there may be to which allusion has been made, they do not prevent an individual member of the Senate, who resents a censure that has been passed upon him for the part he has taken in the conduct of public business, from protesting against it. We are not obliged to sit here dumb. There is no standing order which would prevent any member of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor's</inline> party from rising in his place - Notwithstanding what might be said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> himself - and protesting against a reflection which he felt had been made upon himself individually. </para>

If we are not to be allowed to reply to a charge of that character, what will be the result? The accusation will go forth to the public. They will be informed that a certain member of the Senate, holding an official position, has made a general charge against honorable senators, none of whom has resented it. In other words, every honorable senator will have pleaded guilty to it, and the country will at once come to the conclusion that the charge is true. I resent any honorable senator telling me what I ought to do, whether I ought to vote and not talk, whether I ought to talk and not to vote. </para>

                        <para>- I would point out that the honorable senator is now commenting on the action of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, which is not the point that we have to consider just now. The question which is before the Chair is whether the  Chairman  of Committees was right in ruling that, under standing order 405, it was not in order for any honorable senator to reply to a general censure levelled against the Senate. </para>

                        <para>-  Surely we are concerned about the honour and position of every member of the Senate'. The crux of this question is that one member of this Chamber has levelled a damaging charge against every other honorable senator, and honorable senators are not to be permitted to reply to him. He has in effect said, "You are 'a lazy, incompetent, useless lot. You are mere cumberers of the ground and ought to be cut down." That is the substance of what he has said, and we are expected to take it lying down like lambs. </para>

                        <para>- I did not understand that the Vice-President of the Executive Council was endeavouring to go behind the terms of my ruling. I thought that he was offering to the Senate, with . the concurrence of . senators, an explanation that he had no desire to censure them. I had no objection to his doing so, but if the point of order is raised as to whether he has the right to go beyond the terms of the question placed in my hands, my reply is that he has no more right to do so than has any other honorable senator, nor shall I permit him to do it when the Senate takes exception to it. I thought it only fair to give him, as the Minister  charged with making the original statement, an opportunity of saying something explanatory as to his intentions when making that statement. </para>

Chamber the usual statement as to the course of business, and pointed out what would be necessary to be done in order to get through the Tariff by a particular date. The  Chairman  permitted me to make that statement. The leader of the Opposition rose and commented upon my statement. I most distinctly understood that the  Chairman  - having ruled that, according to the practice of Parliament it was usual to hear the Minister as to. the conduct of business, and to hear also the leaders of other parties - could not then hear anybody else. I submit that that is an ordinary and, indeed, the usual practice, which, if it were not adhered to, would prevent the disclosure by Ministers of valuable public information which the Senate has the right to hear.. If the Minister's mouth is closed, and he is prevented from making statements of that character, the Senate itself must ultimately be the sufferer. </para>

                        <para>- I find myself in the peculiar position of being able, as the question was put before us by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> to indorse the conclusion which he has drawn, and also, as the statement was made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, of being in agreement with that honorable senator also. There is, however, a divergence in the two statements, and therein lies the whole point, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> which now awaits your decision. The ordinary practice of a Ministerial statement is absolutely in violation of our Standing Orders. Consequently if a Minister violates a standing order when he makes a speech in the absence of a motion, it follows that every other honorable senator who attempts to speak must equally break that standing order. But, outside of written laws, it is frequently, both inside and outside of Parliament, found necessary to have an unwritten law. Such an unwritten law. has been evolved in this case, in order to meet the convenience of the Senate and to tend to the expedition of business. That was the view put forward by the Vice-President of the Executive </para>

                <para class="block">Council. I quite indorse it, but it is not the point before us now. The point was stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> much more accurately than by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. It is one thing, for the convenience of the Senate, for a Minister to make a Ministerial statement so long as the discussion is limited, as has been the practice in the past; and I think the decision of the  Chairman  of Committees was absolutely correct. I ask honorable senators to believe that I am trying to express myself on the point without, so far as one can, any personal bias. But there is a big distinction between the old sound, judicious practice of a Ministerial statement, and a Minister using the privilege and the courtesy extended to him by the Senate, for the purpose of making what may be regarded as a reflection on any section of the Chamber. </para>

                        <para>- While I admit that a Ministerial statement is against the Standing Orders, there is a distinction, which, I think, ought to be drawn between a purely Ministerial statement and so-called Ministerial statements which may be used for the purpose of reflecting on any section of senators, or on the Senate as a whole. It seems to me that if we allow a Minister to break the Standing Orders for the purpose of making a reflection on members of the Senate- </para>

                        <para>- I do not say that it was ; I am merely endeavouring to place, before honorable senators the point which I think is involved. I am not affirming that the Vice-President of the Executive Council made any attack, but trying to discuss the matter as a purely abstract one. It is one thing to allow a Minister, in order to expedite business, to acquaint us with the intentions of the Government, and  it is quite another thing for a/ Minister to use the opportunity, it may be from mere want of tact, to convey some censure on any section of senators, or on the Senate as a whole. Unless this distinction is kept clearly in view, it is quite- possible that the decision given to-day in a particular case, may later on be interpreted as having a general application. I .specially invite your attention, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> to the fact that the Minister is stated to have censured the House. </para>

                        <para>-  I think- 1 am correct in saying that the Vice-President of the Executive Council is affirmed to have charged honorable senators with dilatoriness; and it does not require any special imagination to see that if a Minister may be permitted to do this, some one else may go a little further and accuse honorable senators of absolute laziness, or wilful neglect. The objection laid may be taken as affirming that the Minister did censure the Senate; and, to my mind, that is the whole point. If a Minister, having used the courtesy extended to him, not for the purpose of making a Ministerial statement, but for the purpose of censuring the Senate, is any other honorable senator, irrespective of the position he may occupy, to be barred from defending himself? The Standing Orders having been broken to enable one individual to make what, is regarded as an attack on another, ought the latter to be allowed to reply or not? That is the point which awaits decision. On the general principle that on a Ministerial statement discussion shall be limited as in the past, I am with the  Chairman  of Committees, but I do not think that this is one of those cases embraced by that principle. </para>

                        <para>-  But, as has been pointed out, wC have, for our own convenience, adopted an unwritten law - a law that we can put our finger on and squelch at any moment-- namely, that leaders, under special circumstances, may be permitted to make statements. It is urged that. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> might flout the Standing Orders and discuss a subject not before us, on the ground that the Vice-President of the Executive Council has censured honorable senators. I submit that if an honorable senator, in speaking to the subject before the Chair, censured honorable senators he would be out of -order, and that honorable senators would have redress in the right to rise to a point of order, and compel the withdrawal of any improper censure. Therefore, it is inaccurate to say that honorable_ senators have no redress. I am referring to the! argument presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> that honorable senators, may be libelled and censured, and have no redress, if it be ruled that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> was out of order. In addition to the redress I have indicated, honorable senators, on the motion for the adjournment of .the Senate, may discuss any subject that seems to them fit in the interests of the community or of the Chamber. It is, therefore, obviously incorrect to state that there is no redress if wrong has been done by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. I submit that, under the rule quoted by the  Chairman  of Committees, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator '</inline> Symon was digressing. </para>

                        <para>- I  venture to say that, under the Standing Orders, the  Chairman  might have ruled that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> could not speak, quite irrespective of the fact that the Vice-President of the Executive Council had spoken. However, it does not affect the issue that two or more senators have been out of order; the question we have to decide is whether the  Chairman  was right in ruling <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> out of order at the time he did so. There is no doubt in my mind that the  Chairman  of Committees, when he ruled <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symori</inline> out of order, was strictly within the standing order - that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> had no right to persist in discussing any subject or question but that strictly before the Chair at the time. </para>

Honorable senators are under a misapprehension when they accept <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> statement that it has been the practice - the unwritten law  for Ministers to make statements under such circumstances as the Vice-President of the Executive Council made a statement this morning; Such Ministerial statements are made, not in Committee on an item of the Tariff - such a thing never happened before - but in the Senate, except, of course, it be a Ministerial statement necessarily connected with the subject actually before the Committee. Now, this Ministerial statement was not connected with corn flour, but with the whole of the Tariff. </para>

                        <para>-  On that point I think that the decision of the  Chairman  was wrong. Until a few weeks ago, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> announced his election as the leader of an Opposition, there never had been a person on this side of the chamber who was warranted- in speaking for every one else here. I submit - and it is a well-known fact, as shown by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> attitude this morning, and as shown by my present attitude - that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was not entitled to speak on behalf of all senators on this side of the' Chamber. If the ruling of the  Chairman  be correct, it produces this result : that a member of the Senate, elected by a vast constituency, and representative of an immense number of electors, is either to have his mouth shut or to be forced to acknowledge membership of a party with which he may be entirely out of sympathy. And, further, if the matter be carried to its logical conclusion, what in the world is to happen to every senator on this side when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is away ? </para>

I object to any ruling that makes me a dumb dog, or seeks to force me into membership of a party with which I have no sympathy. A party that exists to-day may not exist to-morrow ; a party that exists to-day may not have existed yesterday, and how can it be a correct ruling that prohibits a member of the Chamber from replying when attacked? Of course he may seek to reply in the form of a personal explanation, but that, I suppose, would be ruled out of order, because it would have nothing to do with corn, flour. I maintain that you, sir, as the custodian of the rights of the Senate, should not confirm a ruling which closes the mouth 'of a representative of a State under the circumstances which have been disclosed by the proceedings in the Committee this morning. </para>

                <para class="block">Senate. It is remarkable that all those who now take exception to the Chairman's ruling did not rise at an opportune time to a point of order. My contention is that as the Minister was out of order, no member of the Senate could by any stretch of imagination make himself in order by' replying to the statements which had been made. If any particular senators were permitted tq make such a reply, then every other member of the Senate would have the right to pass comment and judgment on the Minister; and, although we are desirous, I understand, of completing the Tariff by the 11th March, it' would be within the province of every honorable senator to talk up to that date on the point of order raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline> No finality could be arrived at. I maintain that, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> was in the first place out of order, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> could not make himself in order on the grounds on which he disagreed with the Chairman's ruling. As we have' recognised that an unwritten rule acquires the force of a standing order, the  Chairman  was right in the first place in permitting an announcement to be made, and when' <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> did probably go outside the announcement- </para>

The Vice-President of the Executive Council, finding, as most of us have admitted, that we were not making very good progress with the Tariff, took occasion - by the courtesy of the  Chairman,   .and outside the Standing Orders' - to make a statement as to what he should have to do with regard to the sittings of the Senate unless more progress were made, and if, incidentally, he did say a few words too many, or did use the language of exaggeration, I think that it is using the language of exaggeration far more for any one tq, say that he made a censure upon us, or that every individual senator was attacked, or anything of that sort. </para>

He may have used one or two sentences which, in the opinion of some honorable senators, contained exaggerated language, but what has been put before you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> gives a very unfair description of what took place. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator- Findley</inline> has hit the nail on the head. The whole discussion was out of order. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> by the courtesy of the  Chairman,  and in accordance with the practice of Parliament, was allowed to make a Ministerial statement, and had' honorable senators thought that they were being censured, they should have protested at once. That they did not do so shows how very' mild the censure, if any, must have been. Following <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> came <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> who is recognised as the duly appointed leader of the Opposition. . He, too, was allowed to make a statement ; but will it be contended that the  Chairman  was obliged to allow the remaining thirty-four senators, had they chosen to do so, to join in a general debate on the Ministerial statement? The whole discussion was out of order : but I contend that the  Chairman  was right in stopping it when he did, because he could not allow other honorable senators to speak without violating the Standing Orders. </para>

                <para class="block">The  Chairman  of Committees has explained that when he took the chair - a request in connexion with the duty on corn flour being before the Committee- -the Vice-President of the Executive Council made a statement. That statement, I gather from the speeches which I have heard, contained remarks which, in the minds of some honorable senators, amounted to a severe censure upon their conduct in connexion with the discussion of the Tariff. Ministerial statements are usually delivered in the Senate; but it is often convenient to permit a. Minister to make in Committee a statement of his intentions regarding the business under consideration.. Such a statement can be made only with the consent and concurrence of honorable senators, to any one of whom it is open to take exception to its delivery. But it is generally regarded as convenient to give . a Minister this opportunity to make known the wishes or intentions of his Government. As to the question whether, if such a statement contained terms of censure on honorable senators, they are entitled to reply to it, I would say that no Ministerial statement should contain such censure ; but if senators thought that they were being censured, they should at once take exception to the language used. The second question which has arisen is whether honorable senators, not having thought fit .to take exception to the Minister's language until his statement was concluded, were entitled individually to protest against the censure administered to them. The standing order clearly lays it down that honorable senators are not to digress from the subject under consideration. The question strictly before the Committee was, I understand, a request in regard to the dutv on corn flour. I do not think that, the Minister having made a statement, other honorable senators had the right to individually protest against the censure which it is said to have contained. Had they the right to do so, and were such a right exercised by the whole thirty-five remaining senators, expedition in the despatch of public business would be impossible. A Minister making a statement should be as careful as he can not to convey a censure on his fellow senators, ' and I am pleased to know that the Vice-President of the Executive Council has absolutely disclaimed the intention to do so </para>

                <para>The question before the Chair was a request relating to the duty on corn flour, and it would, have been irregular to permit an honorable senator to reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> desired to do. The reference to me from the Committee affirms that the Vice-President of the Executive Council in terms of censure rebuked the members of the Senate. The honorable senator has disclaimed any intention to do so; but, in any case, I do not consider that what took place entitled every senator, if he chose, to debate the matter : and when exception was taken to such action the  Chairman  of Committees was right in ruling it out of order. </para>

I should be very glad to secure a reduction in the duty under the general Tariff, but I cannot see the wisdom of having unnecessary divisions, and putting forward propositions which recent divisions have shown to have very little chance of success. I do not wish to block any other honorable senator from moving for a reduction in the duty under the general Tariff, but it is not unfair that I should tell the Committee what I propose to move in regard to the preference Tariff. I intend to propose a preference duty of1d. per lb. </para>

                <para>The manufacture of corn flour in Australia depends entirely upon the supply of. maize. Our own crop of maize is admitted to be extremely intermittent and hazardous. In some years a very fair amount of maize is grown in Australia. In other years practically there is none. In those years when little or no maize is grown in this country, according to the sworn evidence of the one corn flour manufacturer who appeared before the Tariff Commission, very little maize, or none at all, is imported in order to convert it into corn flour. As the manufacturers themselves say, unless they get a sufficiency of Australian-grown maize, and that at a reasonable price and quality, they do not care to go into the business. The only, evidence we had on the subject was from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walter</inline> Francis, a com flour manufacturer. I quote the following questions and answers from his evidence- </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>Does  2½d.  per lb. pay you? - No it does not. </para>
                    <para>Do you lose money on that? - We lose money when maize goes over 2s. per bushel. </para>
                    <para>What is the present market price of maize? - 2s.4d. in Brisbane. </para>
                    <para>When the price of maize is 2s. a bushel you can sell corn flour at 2½d. per lb. ; and when the price of maize goes up you lose money? - That is the case. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">I can assure the Committee that when maize has to be imported the price certainly goes up, and the duty is of no use to this manufacturer, unless, of course, we impose such a duty as will enable him to get a considerably enhanced price for his corn flour. </para>

                        <para>- I take it that the price will be put up to the full extent of the duty in many years ; because every one knows that the crop of maize in Australia is erratic, and determined by factors over which we . have no control. When the supply of locally-grown maize is small, maize must be imported; and when it is imported, it must be considerably enhanced in price, and the manufacturer of com flour will put the price on to the consumer. A duty of 2d. will necessarily be added in its entirety to the price of the imported corn flour. The duty is almost entirely a revenue duty, whilst the labour involved in the manufacture does not justify any duty at all. I do not blame this man because he employs only four men and two girls, but that is a matter which we ought to take into consideration, and which we have to put in juxtaposition with the fact that the number of people who buy and eat corn flour is, of course, out of all proportion to the number employed in making it. </para>

                    <para>. - The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended, with regard to corn flour, a duty of 2d. per lb. The reason why the Government proposed a duty of 2d. was to bring the item somewhat into harmony with another proposal which will be dealt with by this Committee, and has been passed by another place, namely, item 104 - Starch flour - upon which the duty is 2½d. per lb. </para>

So far as the deception of the public is concerned, there is the domestic law of the States to prevent it, and there is also the Commonwealth Commerce Act to prevent the introduction of powdered starch or starch flours in packages designated as containing corn flour. </para>

The rate of duty on corn flour has been brought above that proposed by the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, because starch flours and powdered starch subject to the higher rate of duty are brought in in bulk, and since they cannot be effectively checked the Customs maybe defrauded. </para>

If we left this duty at½d. an article which should pay a duty of 2d. per lb. could be introduced in many instances under the lower duty, and the revenue would consequently be defrauded. </para>

If there is no authority in the Customs Department, let a laundress be engaged; she will be able very quickly, to distinguish between the two.

                        <para>- I am rather protesting against the misapprehension of the Minister. I do not believe for one moment that he would make a statement that he did not think had been communicated to him, and I defend the Customs Department from the accusation of hopeless imbecility which his assertion involves. There must have been some misapprehension. The Ministerial objection does not seem to be in the interest of the struggling little industry that is alleged to exist, somewhere in New South Wales, as an occasional going concern, when maize is cheap. If we bring down the duty we will, perforce, do injury from the protectionist stand-point to some of the flourishing, historical, and much discussed starch factories of Victoria. It is not the starch factories of Victoria,but the consumers of the Commonwealth, that have to be Considered with respect to an article of such very general consumption as is corn flour.I protest against this trotting out on every possible occasion of some Victorian industry as being the sole reason and only excuse for burdening the consumers of the Commonwealth with  preposterously  heavy duties. </para>

The protectionists, having a majority, are going to insert in the Tariff a few items that are utterly indefensible. Are we to consider on one hand this factory with its two girls and four men,  of  the thousands of men, women, and children in the Commonwealth  who consume corn flour ? If honorable senators deem protection to be a good' thing why should they make an absurdity of it by going to extremes ? Under the  old  duty of £d. per lb. an annual revenue of ,£4,000 was obtained. It is proposed that that revenue shall be increased to 6,000, and it will be drawn from those who can least afford to pay it. . . </para>

I admit that there is a difficulty in distinguishing between these several flours. The other day I met a mother who said that any woman who fed her baby on corn flour ought to be shot. I suppose she had in mind the fact that corn flour is liable to adulteration, but there are thousands of other mothers who use corn flour and who I dare say must use it. The Minister should therefore prosecute his inquiries and ascertain whether the analysts really cannot distinguish between the various flours. We have made infants' foods free, and 1 fail to understand why this enormous duty should be imposed on corn flour. If there is any difficulty in distinguishing between these several classes of flour, why should we not make them all subject to a duty of Jd. instead of 2 id. per lb. ? " </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has just furnished a very admirable reason - apart altogether from the question of protection - why this duty should be made so high as to insure the manufacture of corn flour here. He said that corn flour is very liable to adulteration, that careful mothers would not feed their children with it, but that nevertheless there were thousands who did use it. That being so, is it not extremely important that it should be made under our own supervision ? As a matter of fact, in some of the States great attention is being given to the purity of our food supplies. In Victoria we have very stringent pure food laws at present, and the people are asking for still more stringent laws with reference to the adulteration of foods. </para>

                        <para>- If  that is so we must watch the actual processes of manufacture, and see that only corn is ground. At all events, my point is that, if our children are very largely fed on what  is alleged to be corn flour, we ought to take every possible precaution to see that t'he article is what it is alleged to be. A duty on the manufactured article - even if I admit, for a moment, the correctness of the contention that it will raise the price - must tend, at all events, to its local production, and local production gives us a Letter opportunity to secure a pure food supply. If the peculiarities of the article are such that it is difficult to discover impurities in it, it is less difficult to detect local adulteration and imposition  than  adulteration and' imposition outside our jurisdiction. </para>

                        <para>- I am not urging that it will. My contention is that the duty will lead to local production. Then, again, corn flour is made from maize which can be grown in abundance here, and therefore we ought to have absolute control over our own operations. Surely if there is any industry with which we ought to be able to cope it is that of the manufacture Of corn flour and maize 'flour, just as we have been able to cope with the production of wheaten flour and other ground cereals. The health point of view - a very strong consideration, if there were no other - is sufficient to my mind to induce us to impose this duty, whilst the protectionist argument is also a very strong one. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not know whether the Committee is aware that this is a children's food, and therefore ought to be classified with sago, which is free. The difference  between corn flour and starch flour can easily be discovered by a mother when she is making puddings, and requires to use the different brands. That is the reason why a good brand of corn flour commands a good price. The industry is one which has increased enormously under the operation of a duty of Jd. per lb.- to the extent indeed that we are now exporting corn flour - and yet it is proposed to increase that duty by" 300 per. cent. Who will be required to pay the impost? Obviously it will be the consumer. To me, it seems to be one of the scandals of the Commonwealth, that legislators think more  of the interests of two or three manufacturers than they do of those of the general public. A duty of½d. per lb. is a very high one to levy upon an article of this kind, especially as the industry has developed to such an extent that corn flour is now an article of export. To increase the duty to 2d. would be unjustifiable. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to correct <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson's</inline> statement that the tyranny exercised by a majority is responsible for the time occupied in disposing of the items in this schedule. The real cause why we do not arrive at a clear understanding more quickly is the presence of the disease of political inconsistency. When dealing with potatoes or onions, which are the products of Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> was quite solid in regard to the duties that he desired, and quite insistent that he should obtain them. But when he is asked to deal with the maize-growers of New South Wales and Queensland' he gets into an entirely different frame of mind. He seems to be afflicted with chronic inconsistency. If we admit corn flour free, the trade will certainly be thrown into the hands of the people of older countries, and the production of maize in the black-labour countries so adjacent to the Commonwealth will be encouraged. When a drought occurs in Australia, the production of maize decreases, whilst in normal years it increases. </para>

                        <para>- The records show that during 1902-3, when we had to import wheat, we also had to import maize. But in 1904-5-6, which were normal years, Australia was self-supporting in the matter of the production of maize, even to the extent of exporting about 15,000 centals. During those three years the imports of maize were approximately 7,000 or 8,000 centals. It is clear therefore that in normal seasons we can produce sufficient maize for our own requirements. We are not asked, I presume, to deal with those erratic forms of climate to which Australia is subject. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. Surely honorable senators will not say that Australians will not consume their own corn flour ! There must be some trade reason why this commodity is imported. During the six years that the duty of½d. per lb. has been operative, the Commonwealth has been making and exporting corn flour. Yet it is now proposed to increase the duty by 300 per cent. </para>

It is a scandal that such a duty should be proposed. I venture to submit that we are not justified in levying a rate of that, kind in order to increase the price to be obtained for corn flour by dealers here, no matter what may have been the reason which led to the closing of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Francis'</inline> factory. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is now twisting his own words. I did not say that he admitted that the price of the article would be raised. I said that he did not deny it. He maintained that the prohibition would be a good thing because it would enable greater supervision, to be exercised over the production of the article locally. Corn flour is an infant's food. It is a most excellent food, and the argument that there are difficulties in the way of detecting any adulteration in it applies equally to all sorts of commodities. But we cannot deal with that question - as has been, already pointed out - in the Tariff. Duties should not be increased for that purpose. In addition to being complicated with elements of that sort, this question has also been mixed up with that of preference. Nearly the whole of the corn flour imported comes from England - nearly 1,600,000 lbs. Only about one-eighth of the entire importation into Australia comes from any other country. I ask the Committee to revert to the old Tariff. Where we are in doubt as to the amount of duty that should be fixed, we have a reliable guide in the old Tariff, in which the rate on this item was ½d. The protectionist side of the Tariff Commission recommended the increase proposed, but there is nothing to justify it. We shall be giving a preference to England if we reduce the duty on general imports of this article, because England is the main exporter of the article to us. The United Kingdom would therefore get the benefit of a reduction to a½d. I shall not, however, vote for it on that ground. Anything of the kind is, as I have said, a sham, and I am utterly opposed to these sham preferences in the Tariff. </para>

There is no necessity for. them. We should make the reduction, if at all, in the interests of the consumer of corn flour, from whatever country it comes. - We should do that openly, .and not under the disguise of giving preference to the United Kingdom. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> used very powerful arguments in support of the duty. One of his reasons was the securing of the purity of the article - a question which we do not require to go into - while the other was protection run mad. He asks us to add  300  per cent, to a duty which, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane's</inline> figures are correct, was already efficacious.  </para>

                    <para>. - The proposed duty is equal to an increase of  300  per cent, upon an article of food which is an absolute necessity for children, invalids, and elderly people generally. The food must be of the very best quality. Whilst I believe that we in Australia are improving in our methods of manufacture, we have not reached the stage when we can compare the goods we produce for quality with those made in England by business houses whose reputations are above reproach, and who would not endanger their good name by selling an inferior article. There is a difference of  40  per cent, between the price of the ' best corn flour imported from England and the best made in Australia. Surely the wishes of the consumers should be consulted. So large an increase in the duty must mean an increase in the price. We are asked to regard corn flour, not as a food which is urgently needed by children and invalids, but simply as an article the . manufacture of which should be a protected industry, and which must be sold to the consumers irrespective of their own tastes. Medical men frequently advise their patients to buy certain brands' of foods because they have confidence in the makers, and know that they can safely recommend them on account of their purity. It is 'becoming to me more and more of a problem as to how long the consuming public of Australia will continue to be gulled into the belief that the Labour Party are the only men who desire to see their conditions improved. I wonder how long they will be content to allow the members of that party in this Parliament to pile up duties that must have a direct influence upon the purchasing power of their wages. Year by year the cost of living in Australia is increasing, and if this goes on it is questionable how far wages, which now at least are sufficient to keep body and soul together, will go in buying the necessaries of life. I enter my strongest protest against the continually increasing taxation of the food of the people, under the pretext that it is going to encourage some miserably small manufacturer, who may be a thoroughly honest man- </para>

It is an absolute burlesque upon fiscal principles. At one time protection was advocated because it was urged that the conditions here and in other countries were not equal. It was said that all that was desired was such a duty as would represent the difference between the wages conditions in England and in Australia, and give a fair opportunity to our own manufacturers ; but honorable senators who are supposed to represent the Labour Party, throw .that idea to the winds, and say that they do not desire any importations whatever.' </para>

                    <para>. - The remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> have brought me to my feet. To impose duties on the necessaries of life is very much against my inclination, but. I recognise that, if men and women cannot get employment, they are unable to purchase necessaries, however cheap they may be. I beg to resent such statements as those made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray,</inline> who ought to be fair enough to give the names of those to whom he refers. </para>

It is all very well to consider the wages and general prosperity of the few who can possibly be employed in any one of these petty industries - I am not now referring particularly to corn flour - but we ought not to penalize every other human being throughout the Commonwealth by imposing a duty 300 per cent, higher than that which previously obtained.

I have often noticed that if a division is taken immediately after an adjournment for a meal, some honorable senators are deprived of the opportunity of voting, and therefore I shall be glad if we could have from the Minister a little more information on this item. He promised that before we came to a division he would make an effort to ascertain if the Department of Trade and Customs had an officer or could find a person who . knew the difference between starch made from rice and corn flour made from rice. It will 'be remembered that he informed the Committee that in the Department there was no officer who could tell the difference between the two articles, and I suggested a reference of the matter to a laundress, because she would not -attempt to starch any one's shirts with corn flour. That I look upon us as a " dead cert."- - even more a certainty that any_ possibility connected with the test match, in respect of which I think that the Minister, in view of the great progress made this morning, ought to agree to an adjournment. I consider that a test 'match is quite as good a subject for an adjournment as was an election in South Australia. I suggest that we might be let off to-day for a) couple of hours.

                        <para>- I admit, sir, that I have strayed a little from the track, but that has been owing to the extraordinary difficulty on the part of the Minister in regard to describing the difference between the product of rice and the product of maize ; the difference between an article used in the polishing of a- shirt front and the feeding of an infant. Surely by this time he. has discovered in the Department some officer who knows the difference between ah article used in the laundry and an article used in the rearing of infants. ^ I should be glad if, before we go to a division, he will tell us whether he has obtained the promised information. </para>

                        <para>- Good Lord ! What are we to do with this Ministry? I am afraid that they have become corrupted under the influence of these heavy duties. Apparently they cannot rely upon their memories, and we cannot rely upon their promises. I ask the Minister to reconsider the statement which he has just made. We all appreciate his undeviating courtesy in the Chamber, and I do not think that he, in his ordinary condition of humour, if not of mind, would have made such a reply, to me as he has just uttered. </para>

                    <para>.- I  am in a position to give a little information to my honorable friend. At my lodgings there lives an exceedingly clever chemist, who has assured me that there is not the slightest difficulty in telling whether starches have been made from potatoes or rice or maize. He explained that the services of an analyst were not needed, but that there were certain physical conditions which would enable any chemist or other informed man to discriminate, most easily. I hope that the Minister of Home Affairs, if he intends to speak again, will try to justify the imposition of a duty of 2d. per lb. on this article. I ask him to see if we cannot come to a compromise. </para>

It has decided nothing of the kind. It has decided against proposals put forward by various members of the Committee but it has not yet decided that 2d. is the correct duty to impose. It is quite true, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft</inline> says, that the great bulk of the imports of corn flour come from the United Kingdom, which the Government desire to assist in some way by means of trade facilities. Whether England gets its raw material from anywhere else is quite outside the policy of the Government. If honorable senators look at item after item in this Tariff they will see that preference duties are proposed on goods the raw material of which is not produced in Great Britain. Take cotton piece goods. Does Great Britain grow cotton? She is dependent upon the growers of India. Yet the Government propose to give a preference on that item. </para>

                        <para>- Whether we do or not, I am trying to point out to the Committee that the mere fact that Great Britain does not produce the raw material of corn flour cannot be regarded as an argument against a preference duty, because England is entirely dependent for her raw material on other parts of the world in respect of other commodities, just as she is in respect of maize. But English merchants send us the great bulk of our imports in this particular commodity. Now we have a. chance of doing, as I believe, two things at the same time - that is, of giving some slight preference to the manufacturers in the United Kingdom, whilst bringing down the duties at any rate upon a portion of our imports to a more reasonable figure. A great deal was said before lunch about some small struggling industry employing a few hands. This is not a small struggling industry. It is one of the best established industries in the Commonwealth. It supplies somewhere about four-fifths of the entire consumption of the Commonwealth; and that quantity of corn flour is not manufactured by one small struggling maker, in Queensland, but by rich merchant princes like Messrs. Robert Harper and Company, and Messrs. Parsons, in Melbourne. These are the men for whom my honorable friends opposite are making such a strong fight to-day. Local production is strong enough to supply Australia with 5,000,000 lbs., against importations to the extent of 1,750,000 lbs., using round figures. What is more, the production has been steadily increasing under the old Tariff of½d. per lb. </para>

Nevertheless, he is not satisfied with the fact that the local producers of corn flour have overtaken the market to the extent of about four-fifths. I am not seeking to reduce the measure of protection the manufacturers have hitherto enjoyed. But the proposal I have made is to double the duty - to give them 100 per cent. more protection than they have had as against the United Kingdom. If ever there was a case of an industry that has grown under a duty this is one, and yet it is proposed to increase the duty from½d. to 2d. It requires something more than a mere block majority vote to justify the imposition to which we are asked to agree. </para>

What particular preference duties have been agreed to at the instance of the Government under this schedule that apply to articles grown in England? Take the case of chocolate and cocoa. The raw material is imported into England in the form of beans to be manufactured, just as maize is imported in the sack to be manufactured into corn flour. If the Government were justified in giving a preference to the cocoa and chocolate manufacturers of England, and to the working men and women employed in that- industry, they are just as much justified in assenting to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mi</inline> lien's proposal for a preference duty in respect to corn flour. May I be allowed also to congratulate my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> on his accession to the ranks of the preferentialists? I understood some time ago that he was opposed to the iniquitous thing. Indeed, I think that he has given a few votes against me when I have proposed preference duties. But I am very happy to be able to support the honorable senator in a proposal which I was on the point of making myself, and which I am very glad that he has made. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia)  [2.22].  - The Committee iri its wisdom has just decided not to reduce the duty on corn flour in the first column of the schedule to id: per lb. The duty proposed by the Government amounts to an increase of  300  per cent. It has been submitted that an increase of  100  per cent, would be quite adequate. The Committee has said no, and that a duty of id. is too low. Inferentially it is said that the duty .ought to be retained at  2d.  Substantially seven-eighths of the entire importations of corn flour come from England. Therefore I regard the last vote as establishing the duty as against England, which is the largest exporter of this commodity. Now we are asked - and I can quite understand the motive - to again vote upon the matter - to reverse the vote on the pretence of giving a preference to England. I dislike that very much. I think that a straight out vote upon the General Tariff is the proper way to arrive at the right duty to impose. But, of course,  I look at this question simply from the point of view of the consumer of an article of food which is generally used. From that point of view - this being a necessary and universally required article of diet - I .shall vote for the duty of id. as I did before, but I distinctly do it with the strongest protest. It is doing it under a hollow pretext, and I think is likely to do great harm. This is not a substantial preference. It is not a real preference of any description. I quite admit that it may afford an excuse for some to vote for id. who would not vote for that as a straight-out reduction pf duty, 'but the excuse is, all the same - a sham. I merely rose to say that as this is an universally consumed article of nutritious diet, and for the reasons that I have already given for a reduction, I shall vote' for the request, but with the greatest reluctance and with the strongest possible protest against the pretence - I do not use that word in any way as a reflection' upon those who hold a different opinion - for reducing a duty which the Committee has recognised as a proper one to be imposed upon an article of food.

                    <para>. - This is a typical instance of the preference policy of the Government. If Ave analyze the proposal it means this : Under the Tariff with which we have been working for six years, the manufacturers of England who wanted to send corn flour into the Commonwealth could send it under a duty of Jd. per lb. We are now asked to tell England ' seriously and solemnly  that we will give her a preference as to corn flour. In other words, we are invited to say - " Whereas  you have sent in your corn flour and faced the competition of local production during the past six years at Jd. per lb., the preference we now propose to give you is to put up the duty from Jd. to id." I have to vote for this request, although I regard the preference as a sham. But I am- not going to forego any opportunity to protect the interests of the Australian consumer in regard to an article of food which is to some extent a necessary. I shall take even this opportunity of reducing the burden of taxation. </para>

                <para class="block">For instance, take the case of fancy jewellery. If I am asked to give a preference on such goods as that, I shall say at once that the Australian consumer is not much concerned as to whether 'fancy jewellery is cheap or dear. The only thing left for me to consider in that case is - does the proposed duty represent some magnificent effort on the part of Australia to help England in her industrial work ? I do not think that England wants any help from us in her industrial work. But I do think that the Australian consumer wants to be saved from some of his so-called friends. We are now dealing with a food, and if I can only secure a reduction of duty by means of a pretext - rotten though it is - I shall jump at it at once. </para>

                    <para>.-' I can hardly understand the strong efforts made to raise this duty from Jd. to 2d., per lb. I always thought there was a certain amount of common sense amongst honorable senators opposite. But it is acknowledged that in this case we have captured the trade under a duty of £d. per lb. What is going to be the effect on the consumer of increasing the duty to 2d. ? We shall simply put it in the power of one or two firms to raise their prices by 1½d. per lb. The thing seems to me to be so absurd that it is not worth talking about. Surely to goodness honorable senators must look at the interest of the people who use this commodity. If the manufacture of corn flour in Australia, without the protection of the high duty, were shown to be impossible, the position would be different; but the. fact is that, under a duty of Jd. per lb., we have manufactured over 4,060,000 lbs. of corn flour annually, and have had to import only something over 1,000,000 lbs. What reason, then, is there for increasing the price of corn flour to the general public? </para>

                        <para>- No one is more inconsistent than the honorable senator, who sometimes makes excellent speeches, and then gives his whole case away by saying that he intends to support the Government. Certain honorable senators are never tired of telling us that the capitalists are grinding the people to the dust; but they are the men who are endeavouring to remove all opposition out of the path of these capitalists. Ths local manufacturers having captured, under a duty of |d., fourfilths of the corn flour business ought, under a duty of id., to be able to capture the whole of it; but a duty of 2d. will enable them to increase their prices by 1½d. without fear of competition from abroad. I am surprised that those who profess to specially represent the workers are willing to vote for what will practically give a monopoly to two Victorian firms, and lead to an increase in the price of corn flour. </para>

                        <para>- This raising of the duty, which will mean an increase of price, is being forced on the public largely by a section of honorable senators who, night after night, denounced the conditions of the workers in the corn flour industry. Now, however, the Government, supported by the Socialists, are forcing through a proposal which means increased, taxation on the food of the poor and of children. If under the previous Tariff the people were lashed with whips, the Government and the Socialists say that they shall row. be lashed with scorpions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> proposal is designed to mitigate a very bad position. The debate has served to accentuate the hollowness of the Government's preference proposals. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> who so ably puts the protectionist view, often speaks the mind of the Government better than Ministers can, and He has made it clear that he will prohibit the importation of all goods which can be made in Australia, even though the importation may be from the United Kingdom. Therefore he should in practice substitute prohibition in the preference column in all cases where there has been importation from Great Britain. It behoves us then to accentuate the hypocrisy of the Government's preferential proposals. It should be known that the responsibility for the increase of taxation which has taken place lies upon them and upon their supporters, and that there are some of us who are conscious of the hypocrisy and fiscal tyranny which now is asked for. </para>

                <para>In New Zealand, on the  9th  January, oats were quoted, according to the <inline font-style="italic">New Zealand Trade Review,</inline> at  3s. 5d.  and  3s. 8d.  a bushel, and oatmeal at£15 a ton, whereas in Melbourne on the  25th  January - I take this date because the price of oats here was then nearest to the New Zealand price - oats were quoted at  3s. 2½d.  and  3s. 3d.  a bushel, and oatmeal at £2010s. a ton. To those in the inner ring these facts are not surprising. In respect of this item just as in the case of corn flour there is a combine which controls prices in Melbourne to-day. Every manufacturer of oatmeal charges the same price. The price is pre-arranged and adhered to, and has very little reference to the cost of the raw material. The price of oatmeal in Melbourne, where it is chiefly manufactured, is regulated almost entirely by the men who make it, and largely irrespective of the price of oats. Whether honorable senators are prepared to vote for revenue or for protective duties, it is well that they should recognise what the consumer has to pay in spite of these duties or, if honorable senators like, because of them. </para>

                        <para>- The Melbourne price of oatmeal is as nearly as possible the price at which it can be imported plus the duty. That is what we have to face, and for what object? To help what men? Is it to help men engaged in the manufacture of oatmeal when there is no reason  why they should not go on producing it irrespective of what the duty is? We have to consider of course .the question of freights which I do not desire to discuss at this stage, but surely we in Australia are sufficiently self-reliant and capable to be able to manufacture oatmeal without protection ? And protection against whom ? Must we be protected against the New Zealand workmen? We grow oats, and sometimes export them in enormous quantities ; yet we say that we need to be heavily protected against some one in New .Zealand or elsewhere with the inevitable result - because this is the curse of the whole thing - that the price is put up to the level of the duty. </para>

                    <para>. - I should not like to see- the whole item made free, and it seems to me that it should have been set out with greater detail. We do not know how many articles the paragraph " n.e.i." covers. I, in common no doubt with many honorable senators,  had  overlooked the fact that that paragraph includes oatmeal, and it seems to me that if the Minister would tell us what it covers, he would assist us materially in arriving at a decision and enable jus to improve the Tariff. I think that oatmeal ought to be free, and if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> will move accordingly I shall be glad to support him. </para>

                        <para>- Assuming that that is correct - and! I do not admit that it is - the fact remains that in the absence of the local manufacturers the same arrangement would probably be made by the importers. They could bring in as much or as little as they pleased, and could swamp out of competition the smaller man. Under the old Tariff the duty was½d. per lb. As originally introduced the Federal Tariff of  1902  provided for a duty of1d. per lb. on oatmeal, rolled oats, wheatmeal, pearl barley, Scotch barley, maizena, and corn flour; but the duty was reduced to½d. per lb. So far as the other items included under grain and pulse n.e.i., are concerned, the duty was  2s.  6d. per cental, and as the duty on the items dealt with by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has been½d. per lb. since  1901,  I hope that honorable senators will see fit not to disturb it. </para>

                    <para>.- I really cannot understand why a majority of the Committee voted against the last proposal. It could not have been from a desire to give effect to a protective policy, but must have been from a desire to tax the food of the people. Now, I cannot believe that a majority of the Committee wish to impose such a heavy tax as½d. per lb. upon the people's food. In regard to all other similar commodities the duties have been fixed at so much per cental and not so much per lb. I therefore move - </para>

In respect of this item I charge the Government with delaying the passage of the Tariff by proposing an increased duty which in comparison with the former rate which was operative will produce an additional revenue annually of only£2 10s. Last year the revenue collected from this item amounted to
                    <inline font-style="italic">£10,</inline>
                    and the duty now operative will therefore yield

When I sought to extend a preference to Great Britain upon an item which I was informed would produce a revenue of only£100 or , £200 I promptly gave way, thus indicating my desire to facilitate the passing of the Tariff. But the Government now seek to occupy the time of the Committee by gravely asking us to enact a proposal which will give them an additional revenue of1s. per week during the next twelve months. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley.</inline> - Let us get to a division. </para>

                    <para>- Item 73, which relates to linseed meal, affords another illustration of what I am complaining about. The duty upon that item in 1 906 yielded only£10 revenue annually. Similarly item 75, which relates to arrowroot, will yield a revenue of about £19. Thus there are three items upon this page of the Tariff, not one of which will yield a revenue of <inline font-style="italic">£20</inline> annually. Will the Vice-President of the Executive Council assent to the elimination of the particular item tinder discussion? </para>

                        <para>- Possibly it may include " the husks upon which the swine did eat," and which are admirably adapted for the sustenance of political prodigals. I shall be delighted, in the interests of some supporters of the Government, to do my best to relieve them from the tax imposed in respect of those two articles under this item. The increase proposed is 25 per cent., and worse, because under the Tariff of 1902 these articles were dutiable at1s. 6d., and free. I wonder what part of this item was free ? It is of no use to apply to the Minister for information as to how this £10 duty was divided, because the Customs Department were not able to tell the difference between corn flour pudding and a starched shirt front. They cannot, therefore be expected to know how the duty was divided between prodigal husks and thistles and the few small items that went to make up this momentous addition to the consolidated revenue of the Commonwealth. Talk about parish politics ! Some honorable gentlemen imagine that they are so superior to State, politicians- </para>

                        <para>- It is remarkable that in a country like this, where we can grow anything in the nature of animal foods, we should proclaim to the world by the presence of this item in. the Tariff that we may not be able to grow them at some time in the future. The presence of this item in the schedule is equivalent to a cry of " stinking fish." I fail to see that it is necessary to give any protection to the well-known primary industries which must be covered by this item. I shall vote against the item, because it is ridiculous to impose a dutv of this kind. It is an admission of our inability to supply our own market with products of which large quantities are rotting all over the place. </para>

                <para class="block">In giving my reasons for taking this action, I shall follow the example set by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> in approaching subjects of this kind. I was elected as an out-and-out protectionist - a protectionist farmer - and stated that questions that would affect the farming interest would have my first concern, i intend to claim <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen'</inline> s vote on this question. When he was before his electors, he said that he recognised that protection had come to stay, and did not intend to advocate increases or reductions in duties, but would simply remove anomalies. He said that he was prepared, as far as possible, to stand by the Tariff of  1902.  A duty of is. per cwt. appeared in that Tariff on this item. The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended that that dutv should be. retained, and the free-trade section did not advocate any alteration. Seeing that it is admitted on all sides that protection is the settled policy of Australia, I desire to know why one class of the community should be deprived of the. privileges that protection confers. </para>

                        <para>- I am well able to prove that. I have heard lately, especially from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> what a grand country New South Wales is. I have travelled over it frequently during the last twelve months, and am sorry to say that, judging from appearances, the farmers there have had a bad time. When the rain did not fall as plentifully as usual in that State, this question was before the House of Representatives, and it happened that there were in that Chamber a number of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> characterizes as geographical protectionists. I admit that New South Wales has been greatly affected by the drought, and that Victoria has been affected to some extent. But in every year there is a drought in some part or other of this great continent. Even in South Australia there is a limit tq the cultivation of the soil. In certain parts of that State the farmers had poor crops this year, but. taking the State as a whole, they have had an abundant harvest. So in New South Wales, while in large areas the crops have been poor, in other portions of the State they have been excellent. I desire to give encouragement to the farming community. In South Australia now, and even before the recent harvest, thousands of tons of hay were held from last year or the year before. </para>

                        <para>- That is a matter that I have nothing to do with. Since the world began there have been times of drought. Any honorable senator who has read his Bible will recollect a seven years' drought recorded on one occasion. In advocating this duty, I am moving for what I believe to be right, fair, and just. We ought to encourage men who, during years of plenty, reap and . stack abundant harvests in order that these may be available in poor seasons. It may be said that there is some selfishness in such a policy, but, at the same time, the men who take that course do their duty to the country. I do not expect much support from Queensland, and I look for opposition from New South Wales; but I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> that during a recent visit to Western Australia, I saw a great deal of hay in the paddocks and in stacks; and quite a number of the electors and farmers of that State were of opinion that they had not received fair treatment from the Commonwealth Parliament. In the past Western Australia has provided a market for much of the surplus produce of the eastern States; and now, when there is a year of plenty, several boats, I understand, have been chartered on the part of New South Wales in order to obtain supplies from Western Australia. </para>

After visiting Dalgety and some other places in New South Wales - which, in my opinion, did not look up to much - I told my farming friends of South Australia that I was afraid the hay crop there would to some extent prove a- failure, and advised them, as wise men, to cut a larger supply. An occasion is now presented of extending some of the advantages of protection, to the farmer. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator gauges me by himself ; and that is a very poor political standard. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger cannot see beyond his own State, whereas this is the first occasion on which I have referred directly to South Australia, and I only do so on principle. I have been connected with farming practically the whole of <inline font-style="italic">mv</inline> life, though I may not be regarded by certain farming electors as a reliable representative. Some of those electors are horror-stricken to think that a Labour man should ever dare to represent the farming community; and, indeed, I think there £re honorable senators here who do not regard me as in earnest in this connexion. At every meeting I addressed during my political campaign, even in the city of Adelaide, I told my electors that my first and last concern would be the interests of the primary producers ; and I should not be doing my duty this afternoon if I refrained from frankly and fully expressing my opinion. Several honorable senators are apparently shocked at the course I take, and declare that I am trying to injure the farmer; but I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> dr any other honorable senator to justify such an idea. </para>

                            has first to reconcile his statements with his pledges' that he would, as far as possible, remedy the anomalies in the Tariff. The honorable senator has said that he was not prepared to reduce the duty, and neither would he care to increase it. Why ? Is it because of the geographical position of the State he represents? Why should New Zealand be placed on the same footing as South Australia or Western Australia on the Australian market? I speak as a Labour man and as a farmer, and I mean every word I say.

I appeal for support, particularly to those who belong to the same political faith as myself. During the last few days we have heard of Western Australia and Queensland being in trouble in connexion with their products, but now it is New South Wales ; and, in a discussion in another place in this connexion, the representatives of the- latter State expressed themselves as great freetraders. In this Chamber <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> claims to be a free-trader, but really he is not. ' I have the greatest respect for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> who always expresses himself in perfectly clear language, but, in this instance, I think he is in an awkward fix, and I should like to hear his reply before I leave for Adelaide this afternoon. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> were elected to oppose the Labour Party. </para>

                        <para>- According to the official figures which have been published for our information and guidance there is not a shred of groundwork for such an argument. Let me deal first in round figures with the exports of hay and chaff from the. Commonwealth to other countries. In  1902  the value of those exports was  £252,000;  in  1903, £44.000;  in  1904, £28,000;  in  1905, £21,000;  and in  1906, £9,000.  During the same period we exported compressed fodder. In  1902  the value of these exports, in round figures, was  £73,000;  in  1903, £93.000;  in  1904, £142,000  ; in-  1905, £62,000  ; and in  1906, ,£29,000.  I will now give the total value of our exports of hay and chaff and compressed fodder for that period. In  1902  the total value, in round figures, was  £325,000;  in  1903, £137,000;  -in  1904, £1:70,000;  in  1905, £83,000;  and in  1906, £38,000.  Now in  1903  we had one of the severest droughts that have marked the history of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- It is not my purpose to take up the time of the Committee very long. I simply rose to point out the fallacy which underlies the contention that it we restore this duty we shall slaughter so many cattle in the back country and destroy the prospects of the settlers. Surely in view of the fact that in the drought-stricken year of  1903  we exported  £137,000  worth of fodder, it cannot be urged that we are in such a desperate condition that we cannot support our own stock. </para>

                        <para>- During 1903. the Commonwealth exported£137,000 worth of hay and chaff and compressed fodder, so. that the allegation that Australia was in need of those articles during that year is a fallacy, an untruth. It is not borne out by the records of the State Departments. </para>

                        <para>- The purpose of this Tariff is to establish a policy of protection pure and simple. We have recognised that the growers of potatoes and onions in Tasmania, Victoria, and New South Wales are deserving of protection. I contend that the man who goes into the wheat belts is equally deserving of encouragement as is the man who grows potatoes or onions in perhaps the most temperate climate. If we do not give the man who goes into the drier zones protection what will be the result? We will open the Australian market to the products of adjacent countries - New Zealand, for example. </para>

                        <para>- In all seriousness I ask how much stock would , £3,000 worth of fodder support? I forget at the moment how much fodder is required to sustain a beast for a given time; but I venture to say that the £3,000 worth of fodder imported during a year of alleged hardship would only sustain, an insignificant number of stock. I shall cordially support the restoration of a duty which will give a measure of protection to the wheat-growers, who have pushed out into the drier cultivable areas of Australia. </para>
