                    (Western Australia) &#163;2.50&#93;. - On the last occasion on which we discussed this matter it was shown from the reports of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission that two gentlemen came before the Commission to ;give evidence on the question. One was
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Danks,</inline>

                    If we size up the evidence of these two gentlemen, we. shall find that

                    spoke only for
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Danks</inline>
                    - that is, for his own firm. &#34;While I admit that they are large manu.facturers, they are also large importers. Their interests lie in the direction of importing. It is a peculiar thing, too, that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Danks</inline>
                    says that these articles should be classified as manufactures of metal n.e.i.. and be liable to duty at 20 per cent. But this Committee has already decided to request the House of Representatives to make the duty upon these articles 30 per cent. While
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Danks</inline>
                    spoke only for &#34;his own firm,

                    appeared before the Commission as representing the Master Brassfounders, Finishers, and Art Metal &#34;Workers&#39; Association.- As far as the workers themselves are concerned, I think honorable senators will give me credit for knowing their wishes when I say that they have a strong desire for a high Tariff. That being so, I think that it is fair for me to say that the desire of the whole trade is that a high Tariff shall be imposed upon these articles.

Reference has been made to the circumstances under which this proposal for a duty of 20 per cent, was placed in the Tariff by the House of Representatives. It is said that it is the result of an arrangement which was satisfactory to the Treasurer and the Department, as doing justice to all parties concerned. If such an arrangement was made, it is&#39; inscrutable that the Vice-President of the Executive Council should seek to take advantage of a request moved by a friendly senator in order to put up the duty beyond the rate to which his colleague conducting the Tariff through another branch of the Legislature assented. I have not examined the public record to which reference has been made, in order to see whether a compact was entered into or not. Therefore, I can say nothing more about it either affirmatively or negatively.

We must all agree that it is worthy of himself and of the position which he occupies. Of course, my honorable friend&#39;s statement lessens the necessity for me to make the remarks which I was about to make. But, at the same time, I think that it is my duty to mention one point - and I put it to my honorable friend himself - that when a measure like a Tariff comes up from the House of Representatives, I will not say that the Minister in charge of it should, under all circumstances, abstain from seeking1 to alter the rates of duty by increasing them, but I do say that no alteration, the effect of which would be to increase the burdens upon the community, ought to be proposed in this Chamber without very serious and grave reason. &#39; Nothing but the very gravest reason would justify an increase even if a duty were the result not of a compact but merely of a division. I trust that my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft</inline> will now withdraw his request, because., after the Minister&#39;s statement, he has not the slightest chance of carrying it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft</inline> has put it very strongly that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Danks</inline> was not a very good witness. </para>

                        <para>- Recommended, no doubt, on the faith of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Danks&#39;</inline> statement. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft</inline> so nicely put it, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Danks</inline> is acquainted with not merely the importing, but also the manufacturing, side of the controversy. He tried to look at the question all round, better, perhaps, than did <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Busby.</inline> The latter was brought before us as the only righteous man on this question. He, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft</inline> said, &#34; Expresses the desire of the trade.&#34; That, is the solitary support which this proposition has got. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft</inline> put it fairly and frankly that it is the desire of the employers, and also of the workmen, but if the Senate were always to increase duties simply on the desire of the particular trade affected, goodness knows where we should get to. There is no limit upon their appetite. It becomes cormorantic, although no one will say it is unnatural for them to take as much as they can get. It is not a convincing argument that 30 per cent, is the desire of the trade: We ought to have something more in the way of hard facts to show that the 20 per cent., under which those in the trade appear to have been living and thriving for six years, is not&#39; enough, and that, in consequence, this has become a strangled industry. </para>

                    <para>. - In view of the Minister&#39;s frank statement, I suggest, knowing that he, like the rest of us, is not anxious to unduly prolong the time occupied on the Tariff, that he or some of his officers should endeavour to ascertain whether an arrangement such as existed in this case was made in regard to any of the remaining items. Those arrangements are somewhat difficult to follow, but I find that a great number of them were made, and it would probably assist the Minister if he had placed before him by his officers a list of the occasions on which they were entered into. </para>

                    <para>. - I  did invite the officers to investigate each case and advise&#39; me where any such arrangement was made. In this case, unfortunately, it was overlooked. I am bound, as I said from the beginning, by any compact made by my colleagues, and will loyally abide by it, but I want <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to differentiate between this and the last case, where it was simply stated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> that a certain question was agreed to. &#39; That is a mere record, not as against my colleague, but showing that he did not call for a division where he recognised that the voices were against him, and that it was idle to divide. That happens on many occasions, as every experienced parliamentarian knows, where no division is called for unless it is desired to keep  a  record. In those cases it is stated in <inline font-style="italic">Han- sard</inline> simply that the question was resolved in the affirmative. On several occasions, however, when the question has been put, I have voted &#34;no,&#34; although the question has been ultimately resolved in the affirmative. In those circumstances there is nothing binding upon my colleague or myself, and it is for me to exercise the fullest discretion. </para>

                        <para>- And what is more, the Tariff&#39; is inconsistent. We agreed to a duty of 30 per cent. on brasswork, and this work is part and parcel of that upon which the brassworkers and manufacturers are engaged. We are asked to agree to a request for a duty of 20 per cent. on one portion of the work on which the men are engaged, and a duty of 30 per cent. on another portion. The two proposals are highly inconsistent. Feeling very strongly on the subject, and knowing that a large number of men, not only in Victoria, but in every other State, are out of employment owing to the large importation of brasswork, I am prepared to keep on moving requests, even though I may be beaten, with the view of showing my opposition to the backdown of the Government in respect to a promise they gave me a day or two ago regarding their desire to increase the duty. On former occasions, the Government have departed from the recommendations of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, and even from their own recommendations, with the view, as they asserted, of securing uniformity in the schedule. When I desired that there should be uniformity in respect to these two matters - brasswork and chandeliers - the representatives of the Government said that they would stand by the duty that was in the schedule when it was tabled in another place. </para>

                        <para>- No. The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission made many recommendations which were departed from by the Government, because the duties recommended were not sufficiently high. I do not desire to say anything further in regard to this request for a duty of 24 per cent., but later on, when we get further down the scale, we shall have an opportunity of addressing ourselves to the question. </para>

                    <para>. - I  am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> was not in the chamber when I spoke on this matter. It is perfectly true that when he acquainted me with his intention to move for a duty of 25 per cent., I said that, as it was the original proposal of the Government, it was my intention to support his request. It is also true that I had given an assurance to the Committee, and one which it was not necessary to give, because it follows, as a matter of course, as every experienced parliamentarian must know, that in those cases where the Government entered into a compact with another place, I, willing or unwilling, am bound by it. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. Apart from that, I wish to clear up this misunderstanding. Where I have had a discretion and deemed it desirable that the rate of duty should be increased to that which was originally proposed by the Government, I have not hesitated to move in that direction. But when my honorable colleague in another place has bound the Government to a particular percentage, as he has done in this case, I am bound by that compact. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. In this case I am not free to adhere to our original proposal, and there was every excuse for the officers on whose information I, in the first instance, relied. In every case I have asked them whether there was a compact in regard to the item, and received an assurance that there was not. This particular item was bandied about one way and the other, and it was only within the last few minutes that we were able to ascertain definitely that a compact was arrived at. All the other references to the item which I had seen did not point to a compact. Hence it was that I told my honorable friend that I proposed to adhere to our original proposal for a duty of 25 per cent. When I learned for the first time to-day that a compact had been entered into else where, it became my duty to adhere to the statement I made at the beginning of our deliberations on the Tariff, namely, that I was bound by what had been done by the Government. </para>

                    <para>- In my opinion, this request raises a question which I feel somewhat diffident to decide, but which I think should be decided, and that is whether I ought to receive a request for a reduction on a proposed rate of duty which has been negatived which is not of a substantial character. Honorable senators will recognize that this is a two-edged sword which will cut either way. If I accept this request to reduce the duty - as compared with the rate named in the previous request - by 1 per cent., it will create a precedent which will provide illimitable possibilities for stone-walling. Practically, we have no Standing Orders to guide us in dealing with Bills of this class, and the only guidance I have is the practice of the House of Commons, which is laid down in <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> at page 583, in these terms - </para>

                <para>It seems to me that, according to <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> such a motion would not be received in the House of Commons. My personal feeling is that I should not receive it, and that to do so would be to create a very dangerous precedent. Undoubtedly, the reduction on a duty previously proposed should be of a substantial character. I feel that it is my duty to refuse to accept the honorable senator&#39;s request as not being of a substantial character, but, so far from regarding it as a reflection upon me to refer my ruling to the  President,  I invite honorable senators to so refer if they are not satisfied with it. </para>

                    <para>.&#39; - I gathered from an interjection which you, sir, have made, that you are prepared to accept a reduction of 2 \ per cent, in this case as a substantial reduction, and in that connexion I should like to submit, not for discussion now, but for subsequent consideration, that the amount of the reduction in such cases should bear some relation to the duty as set out in the schedule. Whilst a reduction of <inline font-style="italic">z\</inline> per cent, upon a duty of 25 per cent, might be regarded as a substantial reduction, it could hardly be regarded in that light if the duty set out in the schedule were  100  per cent. I indorse the general principles of your ruling that any proposed reduction should be substantial, but, in order to discover whether a proposed reduction is substantial, I suggest that some regard must be had for the amount of the duty pro-posed to be reduced. I wish to say, with regard to the further effort to increase this duty, that the action taken by the Minister is exactly the action which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> would have taken in a private business matter. It was the only honorable and straightforward course which the Vice-President of the Executive Council, or any one else, could have taken in the circumstances. The honorable senator committed himself to a certain course of action on the basis of information supplied to him, and when he found that the information was not accurate, he adopted the distinctly manly course of informing the Committee of his mistake.  I  see no reason why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> should upbraid him on that account. The honorable senator might be a little disappointed, and might express his disappointment that the facts were not as he supposed they were, but he should have been prepared to commend the Minister for the action Re took. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has missed my point. I say&#39; that the Vice-President of the Executive Council took the only honest and manly course that was open to him in this instance, and that whether the duty should be raised or lowered is quite another matter ; and I say that the Minister has done here what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> would do in connexion with any business transaction of his own outside. I wish to add only one word more, on the merits of the case. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft</inline> and other honorable senators have referred to the evidence given by certain witnesses; but what they have said is beside the question, when it is remembered that that evidence was before the Tariff Commission, and the protectionist section of that Commission still recommended duties of  20  per cent. and  12&#189;  per cent. It is not unreasonable to suppose that they recommended what they regarded as an effective duty. </para>

                <para class="block">I notice some exclamations of surprise, but honorable senators will find that under item  170  water meters are made dutiable at  25  per cent., and as gas meters are being made in Australia as well as water meters, I see no reason why they should be dutiable at only 5 per cent. under the general Tariff and be free if imported from the United Kingdom. So far as my information goes, the original proposal of the Government was in accord with the request I now make. As the imports under items  177  and  178  were grouped together, we have no information as to the value of the gas meters imported. I direct attention also to the fact that, under item  172,  &#34; Brass ware and Gunmetal work,&#34; the duties to which we have agreed are  30  per cent. and  25  per cent. I venture to suggest that the discrepancy between 5 per cent. on gas meters and  25  per cent. on water meters is altogether too great. Gas meters are being made at the present time in at least two of the States of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>. - I think the Committee should agree to the request. I believe that the Government were guided in this matter by an arrangement arrived at in another place. There are in every State of the Commonwealth tradesmen of sufficient capacity to make ordinary gas meters. We already make water meters in considerable numbers. There is no more difficulty involved in making a gas meter than a water meter. We know that gas meters are mostly utilized by well-circumstanced companies; and it appears to me that the influence of some of these strong financial companies has been at work in respect of this duty. </para>

                        <para>- There is influence and influence, and it would appear that there has been some insidious influence with regard to gas meters. Under the Tariff of 1902 there was a duty of 12&#189; per cent. Under that duty industries were established for the making of these instruments. A firm in South Melbourne went in extensively for the making of slot meter attachments. I am told that it was growing into an important industry and gave employment to a large number of brass workers. I will not mention the name of the firm, but the, information supplied to me is reliable. It made 3,000 of these things in two years, and three tons of castings and sheet brass were used in the making of them. The information supplied goes to show that there is no justification whatever for putting these goods on the free list. Some honorable senators will probably say that up to the present time few, if any, gas meters have been made in Australia. Some have been made; but even if they were not made here the imposition of a duty would be sufficient to induce manufacturers to turn their attention to this work. I believe that a 25 per cent. duty would open up a new era, and have the result of finding employment for a large number of men. </para>

                        <para>- There is not much hope, judging by the last division, but if one does not make an effort one will never succeed in doing anything. I dare say that the numbers will be against the request, but anyhow it will be to the credit of those honorable senators who were returned as protectionists to vote consistently on this question. The division list also will show how some honorable senators who were returned as protectionists are voting in the opposite direction, and sheltering themselves behind the plea that arrangements made in another place are binding upon them. An honorable compact on the part of representatives of the Government in another place may be binding upon the representatives of the Government in the Senate, but! there are protectionist senators who are not members of the Government, but who have cast their votes in opposition to one or two requests upon which we might have expected their support. The Government have found the party to which I belong fairly consistent in supporting them upon this schedule. It is only a fair thing for the members of our party to. ask the Government to assist us in carrying this request. A duty of 25 per cent. on this kind of work is not a high one, and the result would be to give employment to a large number of workmen who are workless to-day. It would create a new industry in Australia, and enable a prejudice that exists in the minds of some people to be removed permanently, because it could be demonstrated without a shadow of doubt that what workmen can do in other lands Australian workmen can do equally well and as economically. </para>

                    <para>. - I understand that this is one of the items that are affected by a compact made in the other House. I wish to say that the party to which I belong support the Government, because they are a protectionist Government. Now, I do not think that it is binding upon any protectionist to support a Government in regard to any item in the Tariff as to which the principle of protection is entirely abandoned. The principle of protection certainly is not observed, when it is proposed to make an item absolutely free. I do not know that any particular skill is required to make gas meters; or, at any rate, no skill that we have not in Australia. It is ridiculous for a Government calling itself protectionist to enter into a compact to make an item of this kind absolutely free. If the Government are not willing to give an all-round protectionist support to the workers of Australia, they will, as far as I am concerned, find themselves in difficulties before they get through with their Tariff. I am not prepared to follow slavishly a Government which sup  port such propositions as this. Its members ought first of all to be faithful to the principles upon which they were returned to Parliament. If the Government are going to betray the workers in this industry, then, compact or no compact, I shall betray the Government in respect of matters upon which I have my own individual opinions. </para>

                        <para>- I did not vote for the other things which the honorable senator mentions. I have voted consistently to make electrical apparatus as free as I can. Incandescent lamps appeared formerly under item 179, at 5 per cent. and free. They were taken out of the free list in another place in the small hours of the morning and made dutiable under this paragraph at 15 per cent. (general Tariff) and 10 per cent. (United Kingdom). I shall be glad to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> prove that they can be made here. My belief, supported by the evidence collected by the Tariff Commission, is that the requirements of the Commonwealth fall far below the output of any decent-sized factory which any man of enterprise who embarked in the industry would expect to establish. The requirements of the Commonwealth are only about 8,000,000 lamps per annum. Some factories in the Old Country turn out as many as 1,000,000 per week. </para>

                <para>SenatorLYNCH. - The honorable senator is very cute as a rule, but he overdoes it sometimes. My sympathy is not confined to the mining industry. The honorable senator is very fond of reminding the representatives of Western Australia that we have mostly in our minds the interests of the mining industry, but I am glad to notice that some requests which we have carried, while they may benefit Western Australia in a microscopical degree, will markedly advantage the State of New South Wales, so far as the coal industry is concerned. New South Wales is a good second to Western Australia in the case of metal mines, and in the coal industry she makes up a lot of leeway. </para>

                    to support the removal of these tamps from the free list. We can rightly regard it as a needless burden upon those who will employ electricity in the future to light their works. There is no chance of establishing a factory here, and the movement to make the articles dutiable was founded on the false assumption that a company would start here to reload and recap old lamps, of which the filaments were gone, and some of which were, leaky. The assumption was that the company would buy up a lot of these old lamps and start a factory to fill them again with the filaments, reducing them, of course, to the necessary vacuum. The story of that company starting here had no foundation in fact. It is impossible to reload those lamps, as some ingenious people made the members of another place believe. I therefore move -

                    <para>An instrument maker of Brisbane, who was employed in the manufacture of lamps for scientific and medical purposes, stated that he also wished to manufacture the cheaper lamps used generally for electric lighting, which lie had previously manufactured in Glasgow. It  could  be done, he said, under a protective duty, which  should at least be 50 per cent. Lamps, superior to &#39; those made in Germany, could be produced in Australia. The Australian climate was more suitable for their manufacture than the climate of &#39; Glasgow. The present requirement of the Commonwealth was about 8,000,000 lamps per annum, the making of which would employ 600 people.  . . At present Australia was the great dumping ground for defective incandescent lamps, when superior articles gould be made here. A duty sufficiently protective upon incandescent lamps would not only establish a new industry, but would have (he effect of increasing employment in the manufacture of brasswork, machinery, and other things necessary for the production of lamps. Some of the German lamps were retailed at present at 7id., and, if manufactured here, the retail price would be about is., but once a factory was properly established, no doubt the lamps would be produced at a cheaper rate. . . . There would be no very great difficulty in obtaining the skilled labour. If a factory were established it would be either at Sydney or Melbourne. The lamps proposed to &#34;be made in the Commonwealth were those in universal use. </para>

                <para class="block">Further evidence might be quoted in support of the protectionist incidence of the  duty.  T do not think that&#39; it is sufficiently high. If it is to be assumed for the  moment that these lamps are not being made here, surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> will not stretch his imagination to believe that they never will be made here. We are fixing this Tariff, not for to-day or to-morrow, but for a long period. Perhaps ten or fifteen years may elapse before it will be revived. In the meantime, are all these incandescent lamps to be admitted free, on the assumption that a factory will not be established here? I feel satisfied that a factory will not be established under any circumstances if no duty be imposed. I am confident that, with a fairly reasonable protection!, a bigger incentive will be offered to persons to establish such industries in the Commonwealth, and they need not necessarily be confined to the manufacture of incandescent lamps, which of course, are only a subsidiary line. I hope that the request will not be carried. I know that sometimes <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> carries four or five votes with him, and I believe that, at times, some of those votes are given under a misapprehension. There can be no misunderstanding in respect of this line of industry. The men capable of making these lamps are in Australia, ready to start an industry, and all they ask is the support of those who were returned on protectionist lines at the last general election. </para>

I regard that act as his ultimate determination, and in this, as in other cases, I am bound by what he did, and intend to support the item. </para>

                        <para>- The witness practically indicated 50 per cent., which is roughly from 5d. to 6d. per globe, as a duty which would be sufficient to justify him in starting to make these little globes locally. The proposal before the Committee is to impose duties of 15 and 10 per cent., as against the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> to make the article free. I venture to assert that if it be intended to impose a protective duty, and if it be contended that that effort is justified by the evidence, the rate ought to be fixed, not at 10 or 15 per cent., but at 50 per cent. This witness said that the imported article was selling at about 7&#38;d., and that the lamp could be made here for is. Later on he said that it might be sold at a cheaper rate, but he anticipated that in the earlier stages the price would be is. for the local lamp, as against 7 Jd. for the imported lamp. </para>

                        <para>- The witness went before the Tariff Commission to ask for something. Naturally, a man in that position would put forward the best side of his proposition. He certainly would not ask the Commission to recommend a duty of 50 per cent, on &#39;a line in general use, and say that the only article which he could turn out would be an inferior one. That would be altogether against human nature. What this witness did say was that he could produce a superior lamp at is., as against what he alleged to be an inferior lamp sold at 7&#189;d. As regards the alleged inferiority of the imported lamp, it is being turned out by firms in countries where special and long-continued study has been given to its production. Whatever success might attend local efforts, the local manufacturers could not turn out for some years to come an article superior to that made in those countries. Let me show what a duty of  50  per cent, would mean to Australia, according to the figures submitted by this witness. He said that Australia uses annually  8,000,000  lamps of this kind ; that the price of the imported lamp is 7&#189;d., and that the price of the Australian-made article would be is. He asks, us to impose a duty, the effect of which is to add  4&#189;d.  to the cost of each lamp used here. </para>

                        <para>- I have already said that it is all hope on the part of the witness. On an annual consumption of  8,000,000  lamps, a difference of  4&#189;d.  in the cost per lamp would represent a sum of&#163;133,000. The witness also told the Tariff Commission that if the lamps were made here,  600  hands would be employed. It must be obvious to any one that if I take the total wages paid to  600  hands in the industry at  &#163;1,000  a week, I am allowing an ample margin. A great deal of the labour would be extremely light, and the greater proportion of the work would fall to bovs or girls. The wages of  600  employes would run to  &#163;52,000  a year, presuming that they worked full time, so that we are asked by this witness to pay  &#163;133,000  a year in order to find the employment represented by an annual payment of  &#163;52,000. </para>

                        <para>- The witness himself gave the price, and as he has not yet started to make the lamps, and possibly will not make a start for a considerable time, my honorable friend is asking the users of the article to accept an altogether unjustifiable burden. The proposal is preposterous. Surely protectionists are not going to ask the taxpayers to pay nearly  &#163;3  in order that  &#163;1  may be spent in wages in this industry? It would be far better to levy some other tax and distribute it to those who may claim that by-and-by they might get employment in this imaginary factory. The fact remains that no one has ventured to make these lamps here. </para>

                <para>Apart from this witness, there is no mam with a knowledge of the business who will venture to suggest that they are going to be made here for some years to come. The Tariff Commission recognised that. After listening to this witness, and I presume to other witnesses, they concluded, that there was no justification for recommending a duty on these lamps. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> if he has any belief in his arguments, should propose to levy a duty of  50-  per cent, because he has taken the statement of this witness as his sole  reason  for opposing the request. </para>

Even the representatives of the Government are continually finding themselves in that . position because of something done in another nlace. We need not go far to look for the effects of inconsistent action whether in this Committee or in another place: <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has not been so fair as he usually is in dealing with the evidence of the witness to whom he has&#34; referred. I recollect the witness in question very well, and he appeared to me to be an intelligent and honest man. Judging by the fact that he has been able to influence the vote of Senators Chataway, Sayers, and St. Ledger, so far as to induce them to adopt a course which we had no reason to expect them to adopt, he must also be a man of some reputation. This witness said that the invoice value of these little glass globes was 7&#189;d. each, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> overlooked the fact that he also declared that Australia was made the dumping ground for the rubbish of the rest of the world. </para>

                        <para>- They did not accept everything they heard without consideration any more than did the members of the free-trade section of the Commission. According to the witness who has been referred to, we could manufacture in Australia a superior and reliable article, and we should not then be af the mercy of those who dump rubbish into the Commonwealth. If the superior article locally manufactured cost is., it might be far tetter value than what we are now importing at7&#189;d. The witness also stated that in the very near future, when the manufacture of these a.r: tides was fairly established, the price would come down. That is a universal result of the establishment of manufactures in Australia, and in every other country. With respect to the necessity for skilled labour in this industry, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> acr knowledges that we have one presumably skilled worker in the person of the witness who gave evidence on the. question but that witness declared that there would be no difficulty in securing skilled workmen to establish an industry of this description. Honorable senators opposite are always challenging members of the Labour Party on their attitude towards the increase of population in Australia, and I point out that if there are not a sufficient number of skilled workmen here to establish this industry, there are any number of them in Great Britain, Germany, and other parts of the world, who would be only too glad to. come to Australia to produce, under Australian conditions of labour, the articles which they are now producing elsewhere &#34; under very different conditions. I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and honorable senators opposite, that no member of the Labour Party would object to them coming here if an industry were established that would afford them employment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> should consider what he is doing. If he does not desire that the electrolier, metal fittings, glass globes, and filaments complete, should be admitted free, this is not the division of the Tariff in which the matter should be dealt with. If the honorable senator desires merely to deal with the glass bulbs, what he proposes should have been submitted for the consideration of the Committee when we were dealing with glassware. I asked the question&#39; whether these bulbs were included in the item dealing with glassware, and I was led by the Minister to believe that they were. There ought to be no higher authority, but, as the Minister has changed front so often, even to-day, no matter what my confidence in him may have been in- the past I am disposed to think that the uncertainty of his information has had the effect of destroying his equilibrium. I do not intend to accentuate the matter any further, or to refer to the potentialities or possible ramifications of this industry in the future. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> will withdraw his request. </para>

When it was proposed that they should be omitted from that item, the question was asked whether that would mean that they would be subjected to additional taxation. The Treasurer replied that they would,, as they would fall into one of the drag-net items.  I  do not wish to add anything to what  I  have already said. </para>

We are framing a Tariff which is to last for some time, and we are not justified in regarding remote possibilities. We should deal only with existing conditions, or with what is likely to occur in the near future. There is not the ghost of a chance of our making these things in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The figures presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> are, in my opinion, unanswerable. We should preserve some degree of consistency in dealing with the electrical industry, and until it has been developed to a very much greater extent in Australia, it would be unwise for us to impose taxation on these articles, in view of the problematic establishment of their manufacture here.  I  do not believe in imposing a- duty upon an article which would simply be the means of raising revenue without leading to the establishment of an industry. </para>

                    <para>. - I am afraid that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has placed some honorable senators in an awkward position. He is proposing to make vapour lamps free. I have a vapour lamp in my house, and I venture to say that one could make a similar lamp from an old jam-tin. Of course, when one wants a vapour lamp he buys it, but a boy in his second year - of apprenticeship to a brass worker or tinsmith would be able to manufacture vapour lamps in any number. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> -will give us an opportunity of voting, upon these articles separately. A little while ago the leader of the Government announced that he intended to adhere to a compact entered into in another place. Personally I enter my strongest protest against such influences being brought to bear upon honorable senators. </para>

                        <para>- But we know that frequently a senator is disposed to vote 011 party lines. We should, not stultify our own powers of initiative in this regard on account of anything that has happened in another place. We are asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> to treat incandescent! lamps from a protectionist stand-point. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen-</inline> that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> wants protection for the industry of making these lamps, he should ask for the duty which those engaged in  the industry asked for when before the Tariff Commission. Let him propose a request for a duty of  50  per cent., and I will support him. But the Government when asked for a duty of  50  per cent, have proposed one of only  15  per cent. Surely, the making of incandescent lamps is a kindred industry to the making of electroliers, chandeliers, and similar articles. But it appears that the Government hold themselves bound by a pledge given elsewhere. What is the use of discussing these items at all if the Government are going to use alternately the Opposition and the Labour Party to defeat requests? </para>

                    <para>. - I shall support the duty as it stands in the schedule for protective purposes as well as for other reasons. We are apt to discuss items without considering the circumstances connected with the production of the articles referred to. In this case we have to deal with an article that requires very careful packing, and is liable to break very easily. Consequent on this expense and risk, the natural protection on these goods is very large. If we impose duties of 15 and 10 per cent., they will, with heavy landing charges, probably be sufficient to justify any one going into the undertaking if the goods can be manufactured in Australia. When such manufacture is commenced, it might be a fair thing to ask Parliament to consider whether the protection afforded was sufficiently large, if it is not enough we can increase it. But until we have reached that stage of manufacture I do &#39;not think that we should increase the duty very much, nor should we reduce it altogether. I understand that under the comprehensive letters &#34; n.e.i.&#34;telephonic appliances are included. I wish to mention that I intend to move a request for the addition of an extra paragraph in order to cover those goods with the object of enabling them to be admitted free. </para>

                    <para>. - I intend to support the item as it stands in the schedule, but I am put in a difficulty by the fact that all the evidence which I can Collect seems to indicate that the protection proposed would not be anything like sufficient. So far as concerns. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilson,</inline> whose glass factory was the subject of a request in connexion with glassware some time ago, I draw attention to the fact that the item upon&#39; which I moved a request that the duty should be raised affected glass instruments, which in every individual case were already being manufactured in the Commonwealth. There are one or two other items also as to which I propose to take similar action, because  the goods affected are already being made in considerable quantities in Australia. When we turn to incandescent globes we find that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.. Wilson</inline> certainly expresses a hope that the time will come when he will be able to manufacture them in the Commonwealth ; but in a circular which he has issued he makes the statement - alluding to the opinion contained in the Tariff Commission&#39;s report that fifty hands would manufacture all the scientific glassware required in the Commonwealth - that the manufacture of incandescent globes would give employment to 700 persons. In his evidence before the Tariff Commission  he stated that if these lamps were made in the Commonwealth they would give employment to 600 persons. He also estimated the cost of laying down the necessary plant at &#163;5,000, and stated that a factory would probably be established at Sydney or Melbourne. Still there is the overwhelming fact that he required 50 per cent, protection, and it is now proposed to offer him 15 per cent, as against foreign imports and 10 per cent, against the United Kingdom. We have not yet heard from those who strongly support this duty on protectionist grounds how they reconcile it with the definite statement of the only , witness on the subject that 50 per cent, protection is required. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> went as near to explain the matter as possible by pointing to the large amount of natural protection. &#39; I shall vote for the duty as it stands, although it is neither fish, flesh, nor good red herring. When coupled, however, with the natural protection, it may possibly have the effect, wKich we all desire, that these goods will be made in Australia. </para>

The effect of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch&#39;s</inline> request would be that 8,000,000 glass bulbs would not be made in Australia, and the lamps would come in free as finished articles.

As a rule, the best lamps now made will not last more than 1,000 hours. Most of the imported lamps are cheap. The filaments fail, and the lamp becomes useless. The filaments could not be renewed, because the bulbs having been exhausted of air nothing could be done to them without breaking them. Filaments could only be placed in the bulbs as a process of first manufacture. </para>

                        <para>- We are discussing far more than the plain bulb now. Evidently <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> did not mean at the time to refer to the construction of the incandescent electric lamp - a very important process of manufacture, part of which is covered by unexpired patents. I incline to think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> is entirely right in moving the request. The system of electric lighting is in very common use, not only in the mines of Western Australia, but in mines in other parts of the Commonwealth, and should not be handicapped. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> that while we may be able to make the glass bulbs in Australia, probably we shall not be able to manufacture the completed incandescent lamps, except at a cost which will be more or less prohibitive to the mine-owners. For those reasons the honorable senator is quite right in. the position he has taken up with the object of making incandescent electric lamps as cheap . as possible. </para>

                <para>I understand that these articles come under the n.e.i. line, which is very comprehensive. It does not need much argument on my part to show that, inasmuch as they are not manufactured here, they should be admitted free. In support of my statement, I point to the fact that this ultraprotectionist&#39; Government are importing all the telephones, telephone switchboards and appliances which they use. The use of the telephone as a means of communication is increasing so rapidly that in a short time its use will be universal. </para>

                        <para>- Because telephones and telephone appliances when imported for private- use are subject to a duty of 15 or 10 per cent.,&#39; according to the country of origin. It is now generally recognised that telephones are necessities of daily life, especially to those who live in the back-blocks. I hope that honorable senators will see their way clear to remove them from the n.e.i. line, and allow them to come in duty free. The farmer&#39;s telephone in the United States of America is stated to be of the greatest assistance to permanent rural settlement. In Australia., a land of long distances and isolation, it will be a powerful factor in country settlement. It is really more a necessity in the country than in the city.  In cases of fire or illness it is most valuable in the country. It is also useful for obtaining market reports. It puts neighbours widely separated within speaking  distance. As there does not seem to be any wild opposition to my request, I shall content myself with moving, the request for a new sub-item-. </para>

                    <para>. - I rise to support the request. I believe that we are on the eve of a very great advance in the matter of telephone communication. Although it is possible that some of these articles can be made in Australia, yet it will take a very long time before we can make the telephone instruments. At the present time, to fit an instrument properly, is about as much as our fitters can do, let alone to make one. There is nothing more provoking to a man than to get a telephone which is unworkable or causes delay. We are looking for a great advance in the development of this means of communication, especially in country districts. In America telephones are put up very cheaply, and work very well. Wherever they have been introduced in the country districts thcv have been declared to be the greatest boon which the country people have ever had. Our country districts are getting more closely settled, and we desire to give the settlers as many of the comforts and conveniences of city life as we possibly can. If, of course, it can be proved that these articles can be made in Australia in a satisfactory way, let us retain the duty, but in my opinion its retention will not encourage the local manufacture of them. It will simply operate as a revenue duty. Of course, telephones- for the Government come in duty free, but thousands are imported for private use. I think that private users should not be saddled with this tax. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister is to be congratulated upon the exceedingly clever manner in which he has defended the Tariff and supported <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy.</inline> Nothing- he could have said-could have convinced hon- &#39; orable senators more conclusively that they ought to support the request. He pointed out that the Government has a monopoly of the importations, and that the proportion of telephone and telephone appliances used privately is infinitesimal. There is no possible chance of the articles being made on any scale in the Commonwealth while the Government, who use 90 per cent, of the imported articles, are able to import them free. </para>

                        <para>- Then let the Government impose a duty on the articles and pay it, so as to give to people the protection which they require, and, according to their own arguments, cheaper articles will be supplied to them. As regards the Minister&#39;s reference to&#39; the small, use to which telephones are put privately, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> struck the keynote in a very few . words. They are being used to a larger and larger extent throughout the Commonwealth where the Government cannot interfere or regulate their use. Between the head station and shearing sheds, and between the out stations and the home station they are used. &#39; In sugar districts they are used between the head-quarters of the management and the mills. In various other ways they are used to a very considerable extent, although, of course, to nothing like the same extent as they are used by the Government. It is made quite clear by the Minister&#39;s statement that it is unreasonable to expect that, while the Government can import them free, they will be made here.&#39; I suggest that what the Minister has said is the strongest possible reason why we should support the request. </para>

I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> to say why he is proposing to increase this duty. Is it to give protection to the manufacturer of incandescent lamps, with which we have just been dealing ? Is this . the honorable senator&#39;s idea of the proper way in which to meet the request of a witness who asked for a duty of 50 per cent. ? </para>

I venture to say that these duties in respect of 90 per cent, of the imports under this paragraph will be purely revenue duties. These articles are not made here, nor are they likely to be made here. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> is asking the Committee to impose an additional tax of 2&#189; per cent., which can have no protective effect, and which can only enable the tax-gatherer to levy a higher impost upon articles required in this country. </para>

The paragraph includes electrical adapters, overhead traction fittings, telephones and telephonic apparatus, telegraphic apparatus, electric bells and magnetic brakes. These articles are not made here, and some of them we have already dealt with. It is from the protective stand-point that I ask honorable senators to permit the duty to be increased to  17^  per cent, as originally proposed by the Government. </para>

                    LEDGER (Queensland)  &#163;5.35&#93;.  - It is quite refreshing to find&#39; the sturdiest protectionist in the Committee proposing a request for a duty of  17^  per cent. When it was sought to impose much higher duties upon other items, the honorable senator denounced some honorable senators even on his own side as traitors to the cause of protection.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline>
                    has so loudly voiced the prohibitive protection desired by Victoria that we could hardly believe that he would ever slip. The honorable senator has slipped at last, and it will be interesting to learn from this last of the faithful when a duty of  17&#39;  J,  20,  or  25  per cent, will or will not be a protective duty. He says that he cannot, carry a duty of  25, 30,  or  40  per cent., for which he has been clamouring all along, and he does not mind slipping from protective grace if he can in this instance carry a duty of  17^  per cent. I expected that protection would have at least one adherent who had no chink in his armour, and I have therefore been rather pleased to discover that even
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline>
                    has slipped so obviously, as to propose a revenue duty.

                        <para>- I have said that I think these are articles which our people should be enabled to get as free of duty as possible.  If we have to deal with a few more of these&#39; electrical appliances it will be difficult to say what is a protective duty. Protection is found to be very like- free-trade when the fiscal &#39;ship is sailing to Western ports, but when it is sailing very close to Hobson&#39;s Bay protection becomes strongly prohibitive. The percentage of duty sought to be imposed varies apparently according to the ports to which a ship is going. </para>

                        <para>- The ablest mathematician in the world, viewing the proceedings of this Committee, would be baffled to discover the principle on which we ask for any&#39; percentage of duty above or below a particular mark. He would never be more completely baffled than when finding that strong protectionists become revenue tariffists, and that while denying it prohibitionists fight as hard as possible for free-trade. I have before described this kind of thing as being more or less fiscal poker. Whenever the Government can get their way they get it, and whenever they cannot get their way they put up with the consequences. </para>

                    <para>. - The principal importers of steel rails are &#34;the Governments of the States. &#34;Under a decision of the Supreme Court of New South Wales they should be able to import them free of duty. The Commonwealth has not yet taken any . steps to test that judgment. We ought not to impose taxation upon rails imported by private persons when there is no duty on rails imported by a State. The Government now propose to put against every private importer a duty of 15 per cent., whilst the greatest of all consumers, the States themselves, will probably be able to get their steel rails free. If that is not a case of making fish of one and flesh of another. I do not know what is. I am inclined to agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> that steel rails should be entirely eliminated from the item. They are not only used for railways, but also largely for mines and tramways. I do not see why private persons who purchase them should not have the same advantages as the States Governments have. </para>

                    <para>. - I think it would be a most serious mistake to eliminate rails from the item. I have already mentioned a contract entered into by one of the States to encourage the manufacture of steel rails in Australia. That is a desirable precedent to follow. The firm with which the contract has been made has. I suppose, introduced the necessary plant to establish a large industry. A similar thing was done by Victoria in connexion with the pipe industry, and proved a most successful means of encouraging an important enterprise. When we have the precedent of New South Wales doing this, for the Senate of the Commonwealth to take any steps to hamper the firm in question in carrying out its contract would be a most serious mistake. Our object should rather be to encourage the firm by giving it command of the market. I urge that, the New South Wales Government having made such a serious advance, we, at least, should not discourage the manufacturers. </para>

The case, with regard to the manufacture of steel rails in Australia appears to be this - that some Government somewhere has made an agreement with somebody to make steel rails. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> has referred to the extensive uses to which these rails are put in connexion with- mining and so on. I may mention the sugar industry in connexion with which probably no less than  1.000  miles of steel rails are being used in Queensland. </para>

                        <para>-I am afraid that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray,</inline> free-trader as he is, will skid on rails if we do not put some sand on them. An enormous quantity of these rails are used in connexion with the sugar industry, and are largely the means of enabling it to get over the labour difficulty. They are invariably light steel rails, connected with steel sleepers. The item as it stands apparently deals with each of these things as if they were separate. If they are to be brought in together, it would be advisable to go further, and say that not only rails but rails and sleepers combined shall be brought under the item. At any rate, I urge the Committee, in the interests of the agricultural and kindred industries which use rails, to join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> in endeavouring to make the item free. </para>

                    <para>. - I listened with great interest to the argument of my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger. He urged that as there is some probability of the States Governments not being compelled to pay duty on the importation of rails, all industries which use rails should be placed on the same footing. But how is it possible for the iron, industry, which has been established, to prosper and become solid, IT the same argument is made to apply to iron in all its various forms? It appears to me to be one of the most &#34; cheeky &#34; arguments ever brought forward in this Chamber. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger come from Queensland, that land of bonus fed industries kept alive by the Commonwealth of Australia. The sugar industry would be dead to-morrow if it were not for the fact that every man, woman and child ih &#34;Australia is paying so much per head to keep it alive. We have seen something of geographical protection - honorable senators voting for. duties that benefited their own States. </para>

I announced before the Tariff was considered, that I should vote to put the iron industry, which is an absolute necessity to Australia, upon a sure footing. It is in a totally different position from any ordinary industry. As the railways are a means of developing the country and promoting settlement, so the iron industry must be considered from the point of view, not only of the development of the country, but of other industries which must depend upon it. </para>

                        <para>- Messrs. Hoskins are making provision for making them. The honorable senator and the Government have voted to tax this country for prospective industries which are not likely to develop for the next twenty years, on the mere say-so of outside individuals ; but in this case, Messrs. Hoskins, in undertaking to carry on the iron industry, have taken upon themselves one of the greatest responsibilities that any man ever shouldered in Australia. It will take all the assistance that Australia can in fairness give to keep those works going. They, are necessary also from a defence point of view. The iron industry must be a very great factor if we intend to make our own weapons and ammunition, or to undertake the repairing of vessels, should communication between the Old Country and Australia be at any time interrupted. Honorable senators will, by voting for the Government on this occasion, show that they can rise above those geographical considerations which appear  to have influenced so many votes in this chamber. This industry is necessary for the development of Australia, not only as regards her commercial prosperity, but also for the fulfilment of that policy which we must adopt, of providing within our own borders all that is necessary for our own defence. On those grounds, I intend to vote with the Government, and, if honorable senators like to term it so, to put aside for the moment the principles which I believe in, and which I would still hold on this occasion, but for the higher principles that I have enumerated. </para>

                    (New South Wales)  &#91;6.1&#93;.  - I am very charmed with the broad views expressed by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline>
                    particularly when I compare his anxiety for free rails with his even greater anxiety  for the free importation of blue cod, in order that it might be smoked in a back lane in Melbourne. When I compare the two things, which the honorable senator has advocated with equal sincerity, I find it difficult to keep a grave face. Perish the thought that there should be any duty upon rails for opening up the immense territory of Australia, and let us have free cod, in order that some chap may earn 5s. a week in smoking it ! I do not often pitch into the honorable senator, or into anybody else, except I feel in the humour to do so. But
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline>
                    has really established his position as a rampant representative of Victorian industries. If there has been any blessed thing on which he could advocate an extra 5 per cent., he has gone for it like the shark after the proverbial bit of pork. I do not see in his present proposition any provision for freeing the rails on which it is said to be dangerous for politicians to sit.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray&#39;s</inline>
                    facts are very solid, but his arguments are simply deplorable. I am. not going to argue. I intend to vote; but first I shall mention a few facts. I should like to know whether
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline>
                    would have moved this request if there had been a rail-making industry established within the four corners of Victoria? I believe there is a question before the High Court as to whether rails and other goods, imported by States Governments for the development of their respective territories, are or are not subject to duty under the Constitution. That remains therefore an open question. On the other hand, we know that an attempt is being made on a fairly large scale, involving  probably a larger expenditure of capital than is to be found in connexion with any&#39; other manufacturing industry in Australia, to develop the iron industry, and the investment in question -has been made under a 12 J per cent, duty, provided for in the Tariff which existed for nearly six years. One of the difficulties, in the eyes of a free-trader, surrounding the protectionist system is that when you begin to grant duties you never know where the mischief is going to end. Industries spring up, interests are created, and you cannot get rid of them. This big iron and! steel industry in New South Wales is a pertinent example of the mischievous effects of the protectionist system - mischievous, I mean, from the free-trader&#39;s stand-point. It has grown up under a deliberate parliamentary grant of some five or six years&#39; standing of 12 J per cent. It is now proposed by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline>
                    to strike a serious blow, not at a possible industry, but at an established one. For weeks past some honorable senator or other, . who has been proposing or defending a duty, or desiring to increase it,&#39; has first of all said: &#34; These things are being made ian the Commonwealth.&#34;; and when (hat did not do, another honorable senator lias exclaimed, &#34; These things can be made in the Commonwealth.&#34; We have been imposing duties on the consumer, week after week, on those pernicious pleas. In this case, -undoubtedly, the works which I and
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline>
                    have referred to are reasonably well established. They are turning cut a great deal of material, but, notwithstanding that, I should vote with
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline>
                    were it not that they have been established under a kind of State guarantee of &#34;duty.

                        <para>- Under very exceptional conditions. I am in complete agreement with the honorable senator as to the positive need of such works in Australia in connexion with defence matters. I need only instance the fact that the Commonwealth Government is now &#39; engaged in establishing in the same locality arsenal works, for which a supply of steel and  iron-and  a supply always at hand when required - is the most complete necessity that can be named. That arsenal is to be established practically next door to these works. If I were to vote for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl&#39;s</inline> proposal, I should be striking a positive blow both at the industry and at the defence of Australia, because I should be rendering difficult, if not impossible, the useful and proper working of the arsenal proposed. 1 cannot give such a vote. Whatever fiscal views I entertain, they were taken from me when the people of Australia voted for a Commonwealth on terms that positively involved protection, and did away with the chance of free-trade. I have given up calling myself an active free-trader. I say that I am a free-trader in principle, but I am not permitted to apply my principles. They have been taken from me by the vote of the people. I do not want to enlarge upon the matter. But. up to the last I fought against the acceptance of a Constitution which would render the operation of my principles an impossibility, and I have now to make the best of things. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger has voted once in a strange wild way - in favour of a duty on tapioca - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> and myself have voted time after time against proposals to protect industries in New South Wales. But here is a question that transcends the issue of free-trade or protection. The question which appeals to me is the necessity of having at hand a supply of iron and steel which is as necessary for the protection and defence of Australia, as even the strong hands and strong hearts that are necessary to use the weapons when created. My vote will be given for the item, first because the defence of Australia demands its imposition, and secondly because this great industry, which has already swallowed up  ,&#163;250,000,  or thereabouts, was brought into existence under the aegis of Commonwealth duties. I do not think that, in the circumstances I have named, I should be justified in voting in the direction of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl&#39;s</inline> request. As regards State imports, I am not without hope that some little consideration may be shown by the High Court in its decision, and that everything which comes in for the use of the States will not be penalized. But that is apart from the question. For the sake of defence and the maintenance of an industry positively needful to the wellbeing of Australia, I think it is my duty to put aside any ideas I may have as to what constitutes a free-trade or protective duty. I am going to vote for the bigger thing, and that is to maintain the duty. </para>

                        <para>- And because they did, he has discovered, after going halfway on our journey with the Tariff, that he has to sink his individuality and become a protectionist. It ought to be proclaimed in large letters throughout sunny New South Wales, that on the  17th  March,  1908, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> became a protectionist as regards steel rails, fish plates, fish bolts, tie plates and rods, switches, points, crossings and intersections. I do not know whether it is owing to the atmosphere of the anniversary of St. Patrick. But it is strange that he should rise here and say that as this industry has been established and has involved somebody or a large number of people in an expenditure of  &#163;^250,000,  he is prepared to maintain this duty. </para>

In my opinion, it is up to the honorable senator - the champion of free-trade, who has denounced, this Tariff as one which is a burden, and a handicap to every business and firm in the community - to show that the fish-plate industry is one which is worth assisting and protecting. </para>

                        <para>- I have always understood from honorable senators on the other side that Customs duties, no matter how high or how low they might be, were a burden upon the people. Steel rails are essential to railway construction, and the building of railways involves the expenditure of large sums. If the price of steel rails be increased by the imposition of a duty a larger expenditure will be required for railway building. According to the free-trade argument that will be a burden upon the primary producer, as well as everybody else in the community, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> crosscuts himself by saying that, apart from railway construction, we want to build - a navy I expect - cannons and sundry other things which will be necessary in connexion with modern warfare. On steel rails for railway building, and guns for .protecting Australia, the honorable senator has declared himself a strong protectionist. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator regrets that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> moved the request and he is satisfied that if one of the industries which are conducted at Lithgow were located at Footscray probably it would not have been moved. It has been a matter of indifference to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> in what State an industry might be established ; he would not vote protective duties for a particular industry. That is the line of conduct which he has assumed and followed ever since the Tariff was introduced here. .1 hope that he will now go one better. He knows that I am a sort of Himalaya protectionist. I do not believe in low duties. </para>

                        <para>- That, I venture to say, is an encouraging beginning. Having been initiated into the protectionist arena, I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> to take a bold and gallant step, and join hands with me to make this duty prohibitive. I do not think that a duty of  17 <inline font-style="italic">\</inline> per cent, is all the protection that the people at Lithgow desire. Let it go forth in large letters to the electors of New South Wales that on this day <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> became an effective protectionist. I suggest to him that he should move to make the duty at least  25  or  30  per cent. If he will move in that direction I shall give him all the support I can, and the members of our party will, I believe, assist him. </para>

Honorable senators know that in foggy and . wet weather the railway authorities have to sand the&#39; rails in order to prevent the locomotives from slipping. We surely ought to have adopted that expedient here, and as a protection against some of our fellow senators, sanded  these rails before we reached the item. I have no fault to find with the attitude taken, up by honorable senators on my side.

                        <para>- I intend to vote against the request in accordance with the declaration I have made here frequently, that I would not vote to lower a protective duty below the rate fixed in the Tariff of  1902.  To that extent I am entirely consistent. I have done that whether the industry was in New South Wales or elsewhere. I have frequently refused to reduce duties fixed by the old Tariff. But whilst in that regard I can say that I have been consistent, I have been subjected to gentle criticism by some of my colleagues for having taken up that attitude. The very reason which has been advanced here -and it is a. very strong reason - for a vote given against this request is exactly the reason which has supported me in all the votes 1 have given. Therefore, although my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> comes late to recognise the unanswerable wisdom of the course which he is taking on- this occasion, I think that he will do me the justice to say that I foresaw things before he did. I was able to see the true requirements which were placed upon honorable senators. And now that he has recognised the force of his reasoning, I venture to hope that he will continue to give effect to the unanswerable logic which he has put before the Committee, and will not let it be said that he was prepared to maintain the duties  011  which an industry was built up in New South Wales, but that he was not prepared to act in that way when the industry belonged to another State.  </para>

So far from having become a protectionist, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has suggested, I mav mention that a little later on in the Tariff we shall come to an article which is manufactured exclusively in New South Wales and in the Melbourne gaol, and I have given notice of a request to abolish the duty proposed in connexion with it. I refer to wire netting. In my opinion there is a wide difference between a duty that crushes individuals and one which is paid out of the pockets of the whole community, and is thus widely distributed. Honorable senators will recognise an immense difference in the incidence of taxation in respect of these duties. Dealing with this Tariff as we have done and must continue to do under the Constitution, it is not possible to maintain the niceties of particular fiscal principles. The arrangement of the Tariff in the circumstances in which we are called to deal with it must be largely a matter of give and take and compromise. I defy any protectionist in the Committee to say that he has throughout the consideration, of the Tariff been guided bv strictly protectionist principles. </para>

The point I desire to make is that hitherto there has been no duty differentiating between England and foreign countries, and T know, as does every business man, that a difference of 5 per cent, stands for a very great deal in large transactions. </para>

                        <para>- It is; and if you turn your money over four times in the year, it means, not 5 per cent., but  20  per cent, per annum on your capital. I am, therefore, very well satisfied that if in this Tariff we give a 5 per cent, preference to the Old Country, our railway material will be imported from Great Britain, rather than from foreign countries. I am, therefore, satisfied that the duties here proposed, of 15 per cent, under the general Tariff and  30  per cent.&#39; on imports from the United Kingdom, will not involve any larger impost on the total imports under this item than was involved in the old duty of  12j  per cent, all round. I think it is quite possible that under this new Tariff the. duty will be found to be very much more nearly  10  per cent, all round than  12j  per cent, all round. The proposal therefore appeals to me rather from the stand-point of reduction than of increase. I would like <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator Findley</inline> to understand that I do not intend to alter my attitude in future in the slightest&#34; degree where I can do anything to reduce a duty imposed upon an individual consumer. </para>

                        <para>- The Vice-President of the Executive Council, and, I think, honorable senators generally, know me too well to believe that I would be guilty of opposing anything merely for the sake of opposition, . or of doing anything other than that which I believe is as right as the&#39; circumstances permit me to make it. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> thinks that the propositions I have submitted indicate that I have become an aggravated protectionist, he will find that he is barking up the wrong sapling altogether, and that I have not altered my attitude towards this Tariff in the least. We have to consider in this instance that the- result of the imposition of a duty of 12&#189; per cent, under the old Tariff - which I opposed before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> or any other honorable senator that I see opposite me at the present time,  with the exception of the Vice-President of the Executive Council and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> entered the Senate - has been a creation of interests involving very large sums of money and of national interests, as well as the interests of a. particular firm, which cannot be lightlvplayed with. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend is-evidently &#34; gone &#34; on tapioca, and the manufacture of small arms does not appeal to him. Arrowroot would be more to his taste. Small arms, and larger arms also, are chiefly made from steel. You cannot turn out military weapons as you turn out a shot gun, from wound wire. The best fowling pieces are undoubtedly made from wire carefully welded, and a good gun of this description may cost &#163;60. But military weapons such as are to be made at the proposed arsenal at Lithgow are chiefly made from steel, and they cost only about &#163;3 a-piece, or less. To place difficulties in the way of obtaining a supply of steel in the vicinity of the Commonwealth arsenal in the Lithgow district would be distinctly to strike a blow at Commonwealth defence; and on that ground, and that chiefly, I am prepared to oppose the request which my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> has moved. </para>

                    <para>. - A well-known writer has said that &#34; patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel.&#34; Patriotism in this instance is the means by which free-traders cover up their tracks when they run away from their fiscal principles. All this talk about an arsenal, building men-of-war, providing for means of defence, and all that sort of nonsense, is so much fiscal chloroform. There is no denying the fact that our free-trade friends have developed into what has been very often seen in this Chamber during our fiscal debates. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild, Senator Gray, Senator Millen,</inline> and the rest of them have become geographical protectionists. All their talk about the defence of Australia is so much chaff to try to hide their real object. It cannot be denied that the iron works affected are situated in New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps before the Tariff debate comes to. an end we shall hear reasons for the votes of my honorable friends with regard to the oil works. At any rate, so far as steel rails are concerned, we have every clear proof that over and over again the fiscalism of the free-traders from New South Wales has been shown not to be very deep. You have only to scratch them a little bit and you find that the New South Wales free-traders are protectionists when New South Wales interests are affected. </para>

                        <para>- Oh, yes there are, but we have not been seeking for protection for them. We have the timber industry and several others of great importance, which are quite as real as the one which we are now considering. Because, after all, it is very much in the clouds yet, and no one knows whether it is_ going to be a success or not. I hope that it will be a success. I myself have moved in the matter of the establishment of a Commonwealth iron industry, and have spoken about it on several occasions In the Senate. Therefore, my opinions are fairly well known. What is the position so far as this industry is concerned? There can be no manner of doubt that the mining industry, the sugar industry - lo which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger have referred - the timber industry in Western Australia, and several either important industries which require I&#39;ght railways to be built for them, are to be taxed to keep an industry going in New South Wales, which, after all, is quite a problematical industry. There is no evidence to show that it can be developed under the present proposition. This is not the&#39; first occasion on which the so-called free-traders have tried to sneak in pro- tection for New South Wales industries. Protective assistance has been given in many different shapes and forms t.o the iron industry. </para>

                        <para>- I intended to&#39; oppose them in regard to this item, but after the speeches made by Senators Gray, Millen, and Neild, so-called- free-traders, what can a protectionist do but support the Government? I hope that the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> which has lately written a great deal about the votes of senators elected to support free-trade principles, will, if it has a representative present, pay attention to the votes given by the  representatives of New South Wales on this occasion. If it does, I am sure that we shall hear a great deal more about the matter in the near future. The debate  which we have had shows- that the so-called New South Wales free-traders are just as much inclined to vote for protection when it comes to assisting an industry carried on wholly in their own State as protectionists are to vote for protective duties to assist  the Commonwealth generally. </para>

                        <para>- I quite admit that Tasmania has quite as good iron stone as is to be found in any part of the world. But that is only part of the raw material for the making of iron rails. Other ingredients are necessary. New South Wales has by far the best natural advantages for the production of these commodities. She has the finest supplies of coke and coal in the Commonwealth ; and they are as essential as iron ore for the making of steel. However, there is nothing for it but for those who were inclined to vote against the proposed duty to support the Government, as the free-traders intend to do so. </para>

We may congratulate ourselves on the magnificent conversions to the principles of protection that we have had ; and as it would be a pity to deprive our friends, from New South Wales of the opportunity of registering their votes, I shall not withdraw the request. </para>

I believe it will bring forth good fruit. We have had interesting confessions from certain honorable senators, but unless the question goes to a vote, those confessions may be denied. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline> although a bit of a shoddy protectionist himself, will, in this instance, be doing his duty to the country by asking those new converts to vote according to the speeches they have made.. I am really proud of the attitude that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has taken. Like a statesman, he made that open confession which is said to be good for the soul. I hope it will not be. forgotten, but, for goodness sake, let us get it oh record. </para>

There was considerable discussion on the subject in another place, and the outcome was an arrangement to- insert 15 per cent, in the first column and 10 per cent. in the second column, as against the  12&#189;  per cent, proposed by the Government in both cases. As the present rates were the outcome of an arrangement between the parties below, I suggest that the duty is fair and reasonable, and should remain as printed. </para>

                        <para>- I should, if I thought I could carry it. The Government propose in the next item to make iron pipes, cast and wrought n.e.i., dutiable at  40s.  per ton. I understand that that is equivalent to from  22&#189;  to  25  per cent, according to the price. If so, I cannot see where the difference comes in, from an industrial point of view, between those articles and rails, fish plates, and other things enumerated in this item. How my honorable friends who have -strongly advocated protection for the makers of rails of any&#39; kind can suppose that those . persons will not manufacture other articles required in railway or tramway construction, I cannot understand. In Western Australia, we have had two foundries manufacturing wrought pipes- that is what are known as the Ferguson pipes. </para>

                        <para>- I have no desire to evade your ruling, sir, but merely wish to suggest that, in view of the fact that in a young State like Western Australia much work has been done in foundries for the purpose of carrying out big pipe works, honorable senators might well give protection to the industries in which would be made rails, fish plates, and other articles for the carrying out of public services. If the Government are justified in asking for a high duty in respect of . pipes they might well accept my request that in the case of foundry work an increased protection of  5  per cent, should be granted. </para>

                    <para>. - Originally the Government accepted the recommendation of the A section of the Tariff Commission, and proposed a duty of  12&#189;  per cent. In another place, it was the subject of much discussion, and the ultimate feeling was that it was desirable that a substantial preference should be granted in favour of the Mother Country. An arrangement was come to whereby the duty in the general Tariff was forced up to 15 per cent., and the duty in the preferential Tariff reduced to 10 per cent. As it represents the views of the other House, I suggest to honorable senators that they should adhere to the arrangement. </para>

                        <para>- It runs from &#163;8 to &#163;9 per ton. I have the estimates which were sent in some time ago for the supply of 800 tons of pipes to the municipality of Toowoomba, in Queensland. The difference between the foreign tenrjer, which got the contract, and which amounted to &#163;8,285,and the local- tender, which amounted to &#163;8,644, was &#163;359, or 4 per cent, on the entire cost. I am assured that if the duty per ton had been 45s. instead of 40s., the local pipemakers could have taken the contract and made a reasonable profit thereon. We should try to. encourage the local manufacture of pipes, as well as the many other things with which we have dealt during our consideration of the Tariff. </para>

Originally, the Government proposed duties of 30 and 25 per cent., . but finding themselves unable to secure those percentages, my honorable colleague, as the result of a compromise, not only agreed, but moved that the duties should be 40s. and 30s. per&#39; ton.

                        <para>- The Treasurer could not help himself in another place, but the representative of the Government in the Senate can help himself. What encouragement is it to honorable senators who believe in and fight for protection to find the Government running away on every conceivable occasion from their own Tariff? Not a single one of the duties upon which the Government have laid so much stress could have been carried if honorable senators generally had followed the example set them. We do not believe in warriors qf the John Cope style, who fight by running away. If the Government got into a hole in another place, there is no reason why they should not try to get out of it here. We are willing to help them to do so. I have voted consistently with the Government for high duties, but if this sort of thing is to go on I shall probably have tq .review my position </para>

                        <para>- I am not wavering, but I like to get a fair deal. I. do not like to see men running a flag up to the mast-head, and getting other people to associate themselves with it, and then running away in the most cowardly fashion when a little opposition is shown to them. If the Government really believe in high duties they should adhere to them. This duty of 40s. per ton has been proved in Toowoomba to be insufficient to enable the local manufacturer to compete with any chance of success against the imported article. I have pointed out that under the old Victorian Tariff pipes carried a fixed duty of ^3 per ton, which practically stopped importations. I am not asking for a duty of &#163;3 per ton, but for a duty of 45s. per ton. Since the Federal Tariff reduced the duty to 20 per cent. <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> pipes .required by gas companies and such institutions have, to a large extent, been imported. It is plain that this is not a protective duty at all, but a revenue duty. If the Government will not assist those of us who believe in protection to carry a duty of 45s. per ton on these pipes, we shall have tq consider whether we ought not to support a request that they should be admitted free. In South Australia the Government have an iron pipe factory of their own. but under the Federal Tariff a number of cast-iron pipes&#39; have been imported into that State, thus&#39; again proving that the </para>

                </continue>
                <para>Tariff is not sufficient to foster the local industry. In Western Australia the State Government have given a&#34; substantial preference to local manufacturers, with a consequence that pipe factories have been established in the State, and most of the pipes used there have been locally manufactured. In Queensland, before and since the Federal Tariff, . the great bulk of the pipes used have been imported, the Federal duty of 20 per cent., or as now proposed, of 30s. per ton, not being high enough to induce local manufacture, or to enable manufacturers in the other States lo pay coastal &#34;freights and compete with the importer. These are the facts with regard to this industry, and they prove conclusively that the present duty does not protect the industry, and should&#39; either be increased or reduced. So far as my information goes, it is merely a revenue duty, and if the Government will not assist myself and others to increase the duty in order to make it really protective, the probability is that I shall feel compelled to support a reduction of the duty. </para>

The honorable gentleman has&#39; never done anything of the kind. He has been a most vigorous fighter for high duties, but without the numbers behind him he could do no more than could any other .person. Having secured the highest duty he could get, he agreed to the compact to which I have already referred, and moved the duty which now appears in the schedule. In the circumstances. when he could not get all that he desired, he can hardly be fairly charged with running away from the original proposal of the Government in accepting a tactful arrangement which secures a reasonable duty. </para>

I think the honorable senator was referring to the representatives of the Government in the Senate. We all know very well that in the House of Representatives a course of action was taken by those opposed to the Treasurer which resulted in the cutting up of the duties in a manner which rendered the Tariff anomalous. But when this Tariff reached the Senate the Government had no right to hamper the action of honorable senators by continually declaring, &#34; It does not matter what the will of the majority of honorable senators may be we, as representatives of the Government, although we believe in higher duties, will always vote against them.&#34; That is the action to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has been referring. I wish that the representatives of the Government in the Senate during the consideration of the rest of the Tariff would forget about compacts in their own interests and in the interests of the framing of a protective Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly ; but that is not the course which they have pursued, and I regret it very much. From my own experience I can say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has put the position accurately before the Committee. Manufacturers in the different States are losing contracts because the duty is 4 or 5 per cent, too low. In the interests of local manufacturers we should increase the duty to that extent at least. In the matter of the manufacture of these pipes, South Australia is entirely independent of manufacturers in or out of the Commonwealth. When honorable senators realize what has been done in that State they should support the imposition of the very &#39;highest duty that the same thing mav take place in the other States of the Commonwealth. In South Australia we were at one time at the mercy of the importer and. foreign manufacturer, and the prices charged for these pipes were exorbitant. They were as high as <inline font-style="italic">&#163;9</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">&#163;10</inline> per. ton. The State Government determined that they would not submit to extortion of that kind any longer, and they established pipe factories by means of contracts let to local manufacturers. They found that even the local manufacturers did not serve them to the fullest extent, although their prices were lower than the prices quoted  by the importers. They wished to secure the whole benefit of low prices for themselves, and they started the manufacture of pipes on their own account. And it is in the parliamentary records of South Australia that in one year the Government by this means saved between &#163;20,000 and .&#163;30,000. If that could be done in South Australia what might not be done in the rest of the Commonwealth ? </para>

                        <para>- As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> interjects, they made  the saving to which I refer with an obsolete plant. Now that they have an &#39;up-to-date plant, they will be able to make greater savings in the future. In view of this experience is it any wonder that I should support a higher duty on pipes so as to give Australian manufacturers a chance when I know that if they do not carry out the wishes of the people the people will still have the power to see that in this respect their own interests are fully conserved? I hope that under circumstances of this description the representatives of the Government will stop the practice of being bound by compacts made in another place. The Senate has no right to take an\ cognisance of them, lt is only through members of the Government - who in many instances believe in higher duties - voting on the freetrade side, that we lose every request. Is it any wonder that such ardent protectionists as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> when they find the Government voting against their own &#34; declared principles, make up their minds that in the near &#39;future they will take a course of action that will surprise the Government themselves? One cannot be surprised at it. I hope that the members of the Government will reconsider their position, and will not in the future be bound by these compacts. Surely these things were not agreed to in Cabinet. If the members of the Ministry are earnest in their desire to bring about better conditions in Australia - more employment&#39;, and a wider scope for our manufactures- they should be willing to assist, in increasing duties whenever they can. I hope&#34; that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> request will be carried. </para>

What I meant to say was that the language of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> conveyed to certain senators the idea that because the Government entered into a. compact in the other Chamber, certain honorable senators must vote in a certain direction.  It was held out as something in the nature of a threat. I object to anything of that kind.  1  regret the position in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> is placed.

                        <para>- I think it would have been better if the Government had allowed their representatives in this Chamber, and especially the leader of the Senate, a free hand in such matters as this. I believe that in many instances <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has acted very much against his own inclinations. At any rate, we, as senators, are elected on the same franchise as are members of the other Chamber, and we have every right to assert our position on every item in the schedule. The request that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has moved is only a reasonable one. Manufacturers of cast-iron pipes in Australia have spent a considerable amount of money in erecting expensive plant for the purpose of departing from the old system of casting, and adopting the more up-to-date method of the vertical casting of pipes up .to 16, 17, and 18  inches. I think they ought to be encouraged. Some of the States Governments have also started pipe factories. There is no reason why we should not have in Australia, either under private enterprise or .through the instrumentality of the States Governments, factories for the supply of all our demands. As far as wrought-iron pipes are concerned, we have all the natural resources necessary for their manufacture. We have the ore, we have the smelters, and we have the skill for the manufacture of the pipes. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> request ought to be supported by those honorable senators who have boasted so frequently of the great natural resources of the Commonwealth. I hope that it will be carried. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline>
                    is unreasonable. What is the history of this matter? The A section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 25 per cent. Under the Tariff of 1902 cast-iron pipes were dutiable at 20 per cent., and wrought iron pipes over 6 inches in diameter were allowed to be imported free. The Government proposed a duty of 25 per cent, against the &#34;United Kingdom and 35 per cent, against the rest of the world. I Submit that after the&#39; careful consideration given to the matter by the A section of the Tariff Commission, we are not justified in imposing a duty higher than their recommendation. The duty now before us was accepted by a protectionist Government, led at the time by a Treasurer who has made no secret of his strong protectionist proclivities. In order to ascertain the effect of this duty, we must take into consideration the cost df freight on pipes imported either from the United States or from Great Britain. The freight would average
                    <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline>
                    or more per ton. Taking the average price per ton to be about
                    <inline font-style="italic">&#163;g</inline>
                    or
                    <inline font-style="italic">&#163;9,</inline>
                    the freight rate comes to about 12 J per cent. That is a natural protection  in addition to the rate imposed under the Tariff. So that the total protection would amount to 45 or 50 per cent. If that is not sufficient for any Australian manufacturer, in the name of common sense and common justice to the taxpayers of Australia I ask- what is a fair and reasonable duty? Where on earth will honorable senators stop? Their demand for protection is apparently insatiable. I beg to. point out that  every  municipality, every divisional board in mv own State and throughout the Commonwealth, every large city of Australia, requires, and will require, more and more pipes in order to give cheap water supply. If we are going to develop Australia we must recognise that the agricultural industry will demand extended means of irrigation. It would be a sort of madness to ask settlers to go into parts of Australia, where the rainfall is neither frequent nor heavy unless we can give them facilities for irrigating their crops.

I know that iron pipes are used on large farms to a comparatively considerable extent. In the dryer districts of Australia, where the villages are springing into small towns, they will require iron pipes to increase their water supply. We are entitled to protest strongly against increasing their burdens. </para>

                        <para>- If that be so, it takes a great deal of the force from my argument. I am glad to know that the pipes I referred to are free, and that irrigation works and the undertakings of smaller -.towns in remote portions of Australia will not be hindered in the way I thought they would be. But no matter what kind of pipes it applies to, the duty proposed in the schedule on this item is remarkably high. It must amount to nearly 45 or 50 per cent. I submit that that is quite sufficient for an Australian industry. </para>

                    <para>. - I support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> request. I am glad to say, in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, that most Australian public bodies have been patriotic enough, when spending public money, to spend it in the country from which their revenues are drawn. I believe that there have been one or two cases in Queensland where public bodies were not sufficiently patriotic to spend public money among the public who contributed it. But in the great majority of the States, through the assistance of the preference given by public bodies to local undertakings, we have a very sound industry in regard to this item.. I wish to refer to the difficulty I find myself in as a protectionist in this Chamber. I understand that this is another &#34; compact&#34; item, where, owing to the necessity of Cabinet solidarity, one or two honorable senators are tied down and are not free to vote according to their opinions. I do not wish to blame <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> or any other honorable senator, but one or two aspects of the question call for consideration from the protectionist members of this Chamber. It was proclaimed to the world by the Prime Minister, who was returned to carry out a protective policy for Australia, that two-thirds of the members of the Commonwealth Parliament were elected to support that policy. Analyzing the figures carefully, that is about the position in this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I will say nothing about the honorable senator, because I believe there is a little hope for him after the last vote he gave. Two-thirds of the members of this Parliament were returned either as protectionists, or as willing to support a protectionist Government. Between whom has the compact referred to been arrived at? Between some protectionists and the other one-third of the Parliament. Then one-third of the Parliament is to have the power, with the assistance of the protectionist Government, to dictate the policy of a protectionist Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I have no. doubt about it. I have the right to as sume, from the past career of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, who has supported high protection, that, if he were given a free hand, he would vote for a higher duty in this instance. Speaking; as a protectionist, entirely apart from the party to which I belong, I feel that it is about time that the fifteen protectionists, considered whether they or the other three are to determine the protectionist policy of this country. When I spoke on protection before the electors, one of the usual questions put to me was, &#34; Will you support the protectionist Government to carry out a protectionist policy if you are returned?&#34; I always replied that I would support the Government up to the hilt to carry a protectionist policy. I believe I have consistently fulfilled that promise, despite the action of the Government. The electors did not suspect the Government of compromising on protection, but apparently there, was a little suspicion that I would do so, and so they bound me to the Government. Now I find that, while I am voting for protection, I am not able, as a member of the Protectionist Party, to give protection to the Commonwealth, because the protectionist Government are voting against it.&#39; I regret that, through the action of those who have unwillingly become parties to &#39;the compact, and the co-operation of the freetraders or ex-free-traders on the other side, the protectionists find themselves in the minority- It is essential to have an increase of duty on this item.

                        <para>- I want prohibition against anything that is not manufactured in Australia. I hope, whatever has taken place to-day regarding compacts which the Government have entered into, that some arrangement will be made to enable the leader in this Senate of the protectionist Government to have a free hand on protectionist proposals. I am just about tired of being voted down by the members of a protectionist Government. If we are to be voted down on protectionist questions by a protectionist Government, as we have been to-day, I shall take the individual responsibility of letting the Government into a hole on one or two of these matters. I am not going to be beaten by a Government who owe their life to the protectionist policy. </para>

                    <para>. - If I could take as serious a great deal of the political fireworks to which we have been treated to-night, it would not be difficult to show that one honorable senator has most successfully answered another. We have the rather curious spectacle of honorable senators on the other side clamouring for solidarity in the ranks of protectionists, but denouncing it in the ranks of the Cabinet. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell claimed that there ought to be&#39; solidarity in the protectionist ranks. It was a magnificent thing then,&#39; and upon it great things were to be built, but when any one suggested that there should be such a thing as Ministerial solidarity and responsibility, honorable senators opposite had nothing but criticism and censure for it. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator had  in  reserve some awful threats about boiling oil if the Minister attempted to give that loyalty and adherence to his colleagues which it is his duty to give. I. ask honorable senators opposite to imagine what would happen if the doctrine which they are preaching now - upon occasion, and for obvious purposes - were given effect to. They practically say that every member of the Cabinet should give full effect to his individual views. If that was permitted, and a slight difference of opinion arose between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> as to the (proper measure of duty  on  an item, we should be pleased with the spectacle of Ministers voting against one another. There is just as much justification for claiming that Ministers in this Chamber should vote in that way as for asserting that one of their colleagues should take a course elsewhere, only to be defeated by them here. Those honorable senators who have criticised the Vice-President of the Executive Council have been a little unfair to him  in  attempting to show that, in indicating the attitude which he is bound to take up, he has therefore placed chains upon them. More ridiculous . language was never employed. Neither the members of another place nor the Vice-President of the Executive Council ever suggested that anybody in this Chamber was bound. The  Vice-President  of the Executive Council was not so foolish. </para>

                        <para>- If there is anything in the doctrine of Ministerial responsibility the two Ministers are fairly bound, but the compact binds  no  one else, and certainly binds none of those inflammatory critics who have been firing off for the last half -hour. I should like to see the Ministerial obligation that would bind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> ! <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell used the graphically descriptive term of  &#39; chains, &#39; &#39; and depicted himself as bound in leg irons and handcuffs. The whole position is abundantly clear. The Minister, recognising the collective responsibility of the Cabinet, says that he himself will abide by the arrangement made by one of his colleagues. Whenever that is departed from, we may say. good-bye to responsible government. The arrangement made by the Minister elsewhere may have been good or bad, but in these days when there has been a great tendency to depart from all that is meant by Ministerial responsibility, I appreciate and hail with pleasure any indication- </para>

                        <para>- I would point out to the honorable senator who cheers that on this Tariff arrangements may have been made whereby increases of duty should be agreed to. In that case, they would not object to the Minister saying, &#34; I shall stand by the compact made elsewhere.&#34; They would applaud it themselves; they would be the very men to say that the Minister ought to give effect to the arrangement made by his colleague. In this particular case, it happens that, because they fancy that they will lose something by the attitude of the Minister, they are a little angry. </para>

What is the proposal that the Ministry are attempting to defeat ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell asked us to believe that he as a protectionist was having the policy dear to his heart frustrated by the iniquitous section of the Ministry in the Senate. A duty of 40s. and 30s. per ton is a very substantial increase upon the duty which has prevailed since Federation. To say that a Minister who supports a substantial increase of the duty is voting against protection, is surely the most extraordinary and fantastic misuse of words which it is possible for even </para>

                    J. Russell to indulge in. Whilst he denies that the Minister ought to be loyal to his colleagues, he would lay down the doctrine that a Minister should carry out the behests of the most extravagant protectionist in the chamber. He practically lays down the doctrine that unless the Minister is prepared to vote for the highest duty moved by the most extravagant protectionist here, he is at. liberty to denounce the Minister as being false to protection. In my opinion, the Minister has altogether too high an ideal as to what a protectionist Tariff should be. Certainly, no Minister or protectionist will contend for a moment that he is bound to vote for any duty which any irresponsible man likes to put forward.

                    <para>. - By a peculiar line of reasoning, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> would make it appear that certain honorable senators on this -side have taken up an unfair attitude in their criticism of the Government, both to-night and this afternoon. He went on to say that because some compact had been arrived at between the Treasurer and probably some of his fiscal friends in another House, he appreciated the action of the leader of the Senate in faithfully adhering to the compact. Our position is clear. In the first place, the Government submitted a Tariff in which they put forward certain proposals. In another place, their duty was to stick rigidly by their proposals, and if defeated there, they should encourage their colleagues and supporters here to get back that which had been lost elsewhere. </para>

If the information which has been supplied to honorable senators be correct - and I have no doubt that it is - many men engaged in this particular line of industry have lost large contracts because they had not an adequate measure of protection. Surely the Government ought not to hesitate to stand at least by their first proposal, namely, 30 per cent. The difference between that proposal and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> request is a matter of only1&#189; or 2 per cent. What is the good of splitting straws over that amount of duty ? </para>

Can it be taken that the Government are pledged to adhere strictly to it? </para>

                        <para>- Three or four very important requests were under consideration to-day, and were decided by narrow majorities. If the three or four protectionists here, who have ever shown their consistency in regard to the establishment of Australian industries, had voted for those requests, they would have been carried ; and. I dare say that if we had been strong enough in our demands the other House would have agreed to them. In any case,, if that House is not going to agree to our requests, we are wasting so much time&#39; day after day in discussing matters and submitting requests, but I have a better opinion of another place so far as protection is concerned. I believe that the majority of its members are strong protectionists, and that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> request be carried- </para>

                        <para>-The Treasurer would know exactly his position. He would not have backed down by  1  per cent, if he had had the numbers on his side. We know that long anterior to a division being taken on an- item, particularly one on which a long discussion has taken place, heads are counted, and the votes are known. In this case the probability is that the Treasurer was informed that the numbers were against him, and so, in order to curtail discussion and get to the next item, he agreed to a reduced duty of  25  per cent. </para>

                        <para>- Aw my efforts have been in that direction. With respect to the- request before the Chair, I hope that the representatives of the Government in the Senate will depart from the rule they laid down for themselves this afternoon, and will not before this request goes to a division consent to be bound body and soul by any arrangement arrived at in another place. If they will free themselves from what, in my opinion, is an imaginary obligation, we shall be able in regard to many items of the schedule to secure that measure of protection which the industries of Australia deserve, ai:d of which the electors of the Commonwealth declared themselves in favour by an immense majority at the last general election. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to point out as briefly as possible that this item is unique, in that it covers two kinds of . pipes, the manufacture of which is entirely different. We cannot for many years to come hope to establish the manufacture in. Australia of wrought-iron or tube pipes. It has to be remembered that they come into direct competition with cast-iron pipes which do not require the laying down of an expensive plant for their manufacture, and which can be produced in almost any foundry and moulding shop in the Commonwealth. I therefore hold that a much higher duty is permissible upon cast-iron pipes which can be so easily made here than that which might fairly be levied upon wrought-iron pipes, which it is almost impossible to manufacture in Australia. In my opinion a protective duty, effective up to the point of prohibition, is justified on cast-iron pipes. I direct the attention of the Vice-President  of the Executive Council to this aspect of the item, which I dare say did not receive sufficient attention when the item was under consideration in another place. I should like to remind the honorable senator of what occurred when we were framing a Tariff in this Chamber five years ago. The Senate on that occasion! insisted on certain requests, and after a tug-of-war between the two Houses honorable members in another place gave way. </para>

                        <para>- I regret that there should have been any necessity for what have been looked upon as threats against the Government, but I can frankly say that anything that has been said by honorable senators of the Labour Party has been in the interests of the principles which the Government were returned to advocate. We think that it may even be worth while to run the risk of creating a little dissension between members of the Government if that should be necessary to keep them up to the principles they have put before the country. I have no wish to criticise their action in any hostile spirit, and I wish only to point out that the members of the Labour Party are behind them if they care to carry out a protectionist policy. I can assure the Vice-President of the Executive Council that if he allows himself to be bluffed into adopting a certain course by some of the newly-converted protectionists in the Committee he will be making a mistake. </para>

Before he commits himself to a policy of moderate protection, which is only a new phase of free-trade, I ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council to beware. </para>

                        <para>- I remind the Vice-President of the Executive Council, and other members of the Government also, that it is their duty to secure as high a duty as possible upon this particular item, because, as I have said, cast-iron pipes can be made in any little iron foundry in the Commonwealth. The industry is one which need not be confined to any particular State or any part of a State. &#39;The Government have an opportunity to secure the imposition of high duties in connexion with this item, and they should avail themselves of it. </para>

                        <para>- But it is not a part of the honorable senator&#39;s work to help the Government. It has been amusing to notice the turn which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has taken to-night, and I am just a little afraid that the honorable senator is trying to make use of the Government. Honorable senators have been elected on the same franchise and have certain duties to perform. Amongst others it is their duty to maintain the dignity of the Senate and the power given it under the Constitution. In my opinion the Government are neglecting that duty. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> interjected rather unworthily that certain honorable senators were bound by the caucus. Let me inform the honorable senator that since I have been a member of the Labour Party and have taken part in the work of the caucus we have never discussed the question of protection andfree-trade. </para>

I think that a duty of &#163;2 per ton on iron pipes is sufficiently high. Until we are in a better position to manufacture locally all the pipes we require the effect of a higher duty than that proposed would only be to interfere with the development of many important industries in the Commonwealth in connexion with which these pipes are used. </para>

                        <para>- Until it is known that we can make these pipes in Australia, we ought not to impose a higher duty than that which I am prepared to support. It is all a question of development. In.  South Australia alone there are many miles of pipes in country that would be practically valueless without them. I look at this matter largely from an agriculturist&#39;s point of view. We must do nothing to embarrass the primary producer in developing the dry patches of this country. We ought to allow him to have his pipes and other necessaries for reticulation purposes as cheaply as possible. I do not like to be found voting with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and the free-trade party, but as a farmer of long standing in South. Australia, and one who knows the necessity for cheap pipes, I cannot support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> request. </para>

I believe that a duty of , &#163;2 per ton would be quite sufficient. </para>

These pipes could be just as well made within the Commonwealth. Seeing that 20 per cent, was the old duty, and that under it the Toowoomba local authority has been able to accept a tender from a foreign firm for &#163;20,000 worth of cast-iron pipes, are honorable senators satisfied to allow the rate under which that contract could be fulfilled to remain as it was? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> at the commencement of this session, in referring to the Tariff, spoke of the necessity of levelling up duties. </para>

                        <para>- The duty was 20 per cent, on cast-iron pipes. It is now proposed that it shall be 20 per cent, under the preference Tariff. But about 90 per cent, of our pipes come from Great Britain. Under the old Tariff there were large importations, and the fact stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> shows that the 20 per cent, rate was not sufficient. If we do not increase the duty, other councils will follow the example of Toowoomba. Patriotism will not enter into their consideration. We have agreed to duties for the protection &#39; of our iron industry. What will become of the iron industry if we impose an insufficient duty on products of iron? These pipes are manufactured from material turned out by our iron works. I appeal specially to the protectionist section of this Committee to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> request,, which will give nothing but adequate protection to this particular branch of the iron industry. </para>

Straight tubes are admitted free for the Babcock and Wilcox boiler ; in fact, tubes are admitted free for several types of tubular boilers ; but, . under a Ministerial decision, as the. evidence given before the Tariff Commission will show, a duty was imposed on tubes for the Sterling type of boiler. It is a clear . penalty, on that particular type which is not uncommonly used throughout the Commonwealth. I appeal to the Minister to agree to a . request&#39; which will only mean that bent as well as straight tubes of this particular quality shall be admitted free. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> drew the attention of . the Minister to the matter of wrought and malleable iron&#39; fittings for pipes in connexion with tubular boilers, and I would point out to him that this item may . include all the connexions between pipes such as were laid in connexion with the Perth-KaJgoorlie water supply scheme. In laying, that pipe-line of about 400 miles, the lock-bar pipe was used. It was manufactured in Western Australia, where all the necessary connecting parts and fittings were made, too. I have little doubt that they could be made again in Western Australia or any other part of Australia. I see no reason why we should not protect the parts of pipes as well as the pipes themselves. I think that the protection which is offered to cast and wrought iron pipes should be given to the fittings, which are necessary for the proper laying of pipes in which to cirry&#39; out a water, gas, or other service.

It can be more easily made than a riveted 6-in. pipe In regard to. the words &#34; Wrought and Malleable Iron fittings for pipes,&#34; they cannot be intended to apply to pipes of all sizes, because, if we can make wrought iron or malleable pipes, we can surely make the fittings for them.

These fittings include such things as junctions, angles, tees, and elbows, and are, so to speak, the raw material for other kinds of work. We cannot make them here. </para>
