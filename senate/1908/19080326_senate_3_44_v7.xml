This is not a frivolous complaint.

Honorable senators will be aware that it has been determined to sewer the building at an early date. The work would have been entered upon before now had it not been represented that it would necessarily cause a great noise and inconvenience, a representation which rendered it necessary to postpone the work until the recess. I hope that, after the recess, honorable senators will have no further cause for complaint. </para>

                            <para>The offensive odour sometimes noticeable in the two corridors connecting with the tunnel on west front is, in my opinion, chiefly due to the two earth-closets - one in each corridor, close to tunnel. These closets (and pans in same) are kept in excellent order, deodorised sawdust and carbolic disinfectant is freely used, but during close, humid weather, when there is no movement in the air, a perceptible odour collects, and hangs about the tunnel and corridors until a breeze springs up and clears . it away. Occasionally poison is laid for rats, and it is probable that a dead rat adds to the nuisance complained of. </para>

                <para>All these handles are very similar, and should come within the same category and be subject to the same duty. I also desire to subsequently move that the House of Representatives be requested to increase the duties, for the reason that quite recently it has been proved that in North Queensland there are excellent timbers suitable for this purpose, as may be the case also in other parts of Australia. Two factories have already been established in Queensland for the manufacture of tool handles, which are being turned out on a large scale, and will probably, in the future, be produced in sufficient quantities to supply the whole of the Australian demand. Crowfoot elm is an eminently suitable timber for this purpose, being not too heavy and possessing a durability able to withstand great stress. In addition, there is, in Queensland, hickory and silk wood, also suitable for the making of handles. </para>

                        <para>- There are many varieties of suitable timber in Australia. Those engaged in this industry have gone to considerable initiatory expense, and are deserving of, at least, protection, similar to that extended in the case of other industries. This is eminently a natural industry ; and I do not ask for any extraordinary or prohibitive duty. My intention is to move that the duty in the general Tariff be made  30  per cent., and in the preferential Tariff,  25  per cent, though, as honorable senators know, I am not much of a believer in the preferential policy, and I so frame my request merely to preserve the balance of the Tariff. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> will not press his request that the duties be raised to  30  and  25  per cent. When the Tariff was introduced in another place, there was only one line with regard to those articles now included in items  309  and  310,  and that line was &#34; Tool Handles, unattached,&#34; upon which there was a duty of  20  per cent. It was considered that  20  per cent, was reasonable protection to afford tool handles manufactured in the Commonwealth, seeing that, notwithstanding the contention that many imported woods are exceptionally suitable, we have native timbers possessing the peculiar resilience necessary. In another place the duty of  20  per cent, on tool handles, unattached, was lowered, in the second column, to  15  per cent., on the casting vote of the  Chairman  of Committees against the Government. Subsequently, adze, axe, scythes, and bent wood handles were taken out of the item of &#34; Tool Handles, unattached,&#34; and made dutiable in the general Tariff at a lower rate of duty. Under the circumstances, I think I am justified in saying that, while I cannot agree to duties of  30  and  25  per cent., I can go so far as to support a request that the original duty of  20  per cent, be restored. I think that if the House of Representatives be requested to consider a decision which was arrived at only on the casting vote of the  Chairman,  there may be some hope of success. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt the discrimination made in respect of these particular handles was prompted by the consideration that they really fall within the category of tools of trade. We know perfectly well that under this Tariff the tools of trade of mechanics are admitted free, and, consequently, it would be an extraordinary anomaly if we increased the duty levied upon parts of them. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend&#39;s object in desiring to impose a duty of  20  per cent, or  30  per cent, upon these handles is to increase their price in the first instance. He is willing to rely upon internal competition to subsequently reduce their price to the normal level. But if he will look at the statistics before him, he will see that the great majority of the axe handles imported into the Commonwealth come from the United States. The reason is that the axe heads chiefly in use in Australia are of American origin. </para>

I merely wish to point out to him that the axe handles chiefly in  use  in the Commonwealth are specially made for American axe heads which are almost universally used in the very forests the use of the timbers of which he wishes to encourage. Until these handles  are  made here, the effect of the honorable senator&#39;s proposal would be to increase their price by  30  per cent. </para>

In my judgment, these adze and axe handles, instead of being dutiable at 15 per cent., ought to be admitted free. We ought to impose no hindrance upon the use of the axe in Australia. It is a national weapon. </para>

                        <para>- I do not wish to decry our own timbers, but in innumerable cases we seem to be unable to put them to the uses for which they are fitted. I have very grave doubts as to whether we can put them to proper use in making axe handles. The making of axe handles in Australia would be a comparatively small industry, but their use in the Commonwealth is f ar-reaching and important. Honorable senators, whether protectionists or free-traders, ought occasionally to put side by side the two industries concerned, and to endeavour to make some sort of comparison of their value and importance. I appeal to honorable senators not to hamper in any way the operations of our timber-getters. At the proper time I shall move a request that axe handles be free. It may be desirable that adze handles should also be free, but from my point of view it is certainly most desirable that axe handles should be exempt. </para>

                    <para>. - I would ask the Committee to consider whether it is worth while further discussing the proposed request? Time is precious, and it seems to me that an increase of 5 per cent, in the duty would make no difference to the axe-handle industry. If the industry has been unable to succeed under a duty of 15 per cent., I do not think it will be successful under a duty of 20 per cent. I am inclined to believe that an increased duty in this case would add to the cost of the article. No class of men work harder than the axemen in our forests. They receive a very small remuneration, and there is nothing which provokes and delays them more than a faulty axe handle. We ought to help them to obtain the very best tools that can be secured. In pre- Federation days, there was a duty of 25 per cent, under the Victorian, Queensland, and South Australian Tariffs, but it does not seem that it led  to  the establishment of the industry. That being so, is the industry likely to be established now? The fact that out of imports of axe handles valued at&#163;28,000, &#163;26,000 worth came in one year from America, seems to show that the class of handles supplied by the United States is superior to anything that can be obtained elsewhere. Having regard to all the circumstances, we ought to pass the duty as it stands. </para>

                        <para>- I am sure that neither <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W;</inline> Russell nor I could distinguish between an American axe handle and a hickory axe handle turned in Australia on exactly the same pattern, I am assured that <inline font-style="italic">we</inline> produce in Queensland wood possessing all the resisting power and elasticity of hickory, and that it is admirably adapted for axe handles.  <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> said that the industry of making axe handles- would be very small as compared with that of- timber-getting. . He must recognise, however, that work would be found for a considerable number of men in turning all the handles used in Australia. : I do not think the proposed increase, would mean an extra tax. It would mean rather a ready supply of suitable and excellent &#39;axe handles, made by Australian workmen out of Australian wood for Australian foresters and axemen generally. The immediate result would be, not that we should have to pay more, but that we should have to pay less. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> has urged that the proposed increase is so small that it would probably not make much difference to the wood-turning industry. In the same breath, however, he urged that it would be an additional handicap to the men who use axe handles. A duty of  5  per cent, is comparatively trifling, but added to  15  per cent, it makes a fairly considerable impost. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> that  20  per cent, is not an adequate protectionist duty, but it is by no means &#34;a revenue impost. I am positive that its first effect will be&#39; distinctly protectionist. While the industry is being developed here the dumper will be exercising his ingenuity to circumvent the duty, and it may, and probably will, be necessary in order to overcome his ingenuity, to still further increase the duty later on. </para>

It is assumed that in Queensland suitable timber for axe .handles is obtainable. We have the same belief as to certain timber, grown in Tasmania, but one axeman after another has given up handles made of native woods for those imported from America, finding that the local article has either too- much- or not enough elasticity. Like all other workmen, axemen are always anxious to obtain tools of the best quality. When the first Federal </para>

                    <para>. - The action of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> in proposing a request that the duty on axe handles be increased has led to my experiencing some difficulty in determining; how the item should be treated. I can say, from &#39;my own knowledge, that we have in Australia a number of woods eminently  suitable for handles of almost every description. I have had to use handles, and have found it neces1sary in certain circumstances to forsake the hickory &#34;for the myrtle or the water-gum handle. At the time I was engaged in a class of work in which- the use of hickory handles is a serious <inline font-style="italic">menace to the</inline> hands. That may be news to some honorable senators. &#34;Under certain conditions a hickory handle is inclined to become hotter than- either a myrtle or a water-gum handle, and subsequently has a bad effect on the hands. Unlike <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> I have not had much experience in the use of axe handles, but I recognise that the desire of the axeman is to secure a handle combining the greatest durability with the minimum of weight. My experience is that when a man has a heavy handle in his axe, he might as well be using a hammer. The difficulty under which I labour is that I have not had <inline font-style="italic">an</inline> opportunity of determining the suitability of the timber to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has referred. Knowing that he intended to take this action, the honorable senator ought to have produced samples so that honorable senators might examine them for themselves. </para>

                        <para>- If we. give them the benefit of the doubt, we may take a step in the dark,, and one for which, afterwards, we might be sorry. This,I repeat, is a peculiar item . Even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has admitted that he does not know anything about this timber, and I admit that previously I had not heard of it. But, knowing what is required for the handles of tools which have to be used in similar directions to those in which an axe is used, it makes me hesitate before I blindly cast a vote. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has made a very sad mistake in not showing us that an axe handle can be produced from Australian wood quite as durable and as light as is hickory. I can assure him that if he had afforded that proof, I should not have hesitated to give him as high a protective duty as he was prepared to ask for, since I am quite willing to take that course in other matters. I wish that he could see his way either to submit such proof or to allow axe handles to stand as they are in the schedule. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator said that for many years in Victoria there had been a duty of 25 per cent. levied on axe handles. So far as we know, an industry has not been established here, and it appears to me that if we now impose this duty there is no probability that an industry will be established under the altered conditions. In my opinion, no more conclusive argument has been adduced in favour of allowing the articles to come in free than the statement made by the honorable senator. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that probably it would enable every honorable senator to vote on a clearer issue if I were to move a request tip make axe handles free, under a separate paragraph. I am quite willing, if it is so desired, to move a request for the insertion of a special paragraph in respect of each kind of handle included in the item. But I think I can safely assume that most honorable senators regard adze, scythe, and bentwood handles as practically coming in the same category, and, therefore, in their opinion, properly dutiable at the same rate. Obviously there is a clear divergence of opinion in the mind of many honorable senators in regard to the case of axe handles, and therefore I move - </para>

I wish to say that the result of the last division surprised me, because I found protectionists voting for a duty of 15 per cent., which they cannot consider a protective duty... I am, in the circumstances, placed in a difficult position, because, do what I will now, I must propose some kind of revenue duty on axe handles, and, while I should prefer that if there is to be any duty at all it should be less than 15 per cent., I regard it as hopeless to move a request for a lower duty, and will not, therefore, pursue the matter further. </para>

                <para class="block">It has been pointed out that under the old Tariff, door-makers were scarcely able to compete against the importation of American doors. I find that, in 1906, when the duty on the raw material of the door-makers was lower than we have now made it, over 3,000 doors were imported. Some were imported from America, some from the United Kingdom, some from New Zealand, but most of them came from the United States. The material of which doors are made was cheaper under the old Tariff than it will be under this, and it is a perfectly fair thing, having increased the duty on the raw material of the door-makers, to give a slightly increased duty on the finished article. </para>

The duty under the 1902 Tariff was 7s. 6d. The Commission recommended that duty, and it is the amount now submitted to the Committee. There is no disturbance of pre-existing conditions. If there were a necessity for an increased duty, the protectionist section, having heard the evidence, would have made a recommendation. I hope, therefore, that the honorable senator&#39;s request will not be carried. </para>

                    <para>It was stated that in South Australia it cost about 9s. to make a door out of door stock, by hand labour. The cost of machinery is about 1s. a door in quantities. It takes a man eight hours to make a door by hand, at a cost of 9s. ; on the other hand, by milling, the labour on the machine is1s., and the cost of joining and finishing off is 2s. 6d., or a total of 3s. 6d. for labour. A Victorian witness said that the cost of making the smallest door,1&#189; inch and under, by milling, is nearer 2s. 6d. than. 3s. 6d. Another Victorian witness took exception to the statement that the making of 500 doors per week would employ 100 men. His firm can make 500 doors per week with twenty-six men with machinery, Door-making by hand does not pay at 10s. each. In Queensland it was stated that, taking the ordinary common door generally used for inside purposes, the machine labour cost is between 3s. and 4s. The value of labour is from 2s. to 2s. 6d., in putting together, finishing, moulding, &#38;c, common doors; but with other doors runs up from 10s. to 12s.. </para>

                    <para>.- Under the Tariff Treaty with South Africa, doors may be allowed to come in at a duty of 7s. 6d., less 25 per cent. That is to say, they may be ad- mitted at a duty of 5s. 3d. It seems rather ridiculous, therefore, to talk of making an advance on the duty of 7s. 6d. I should like honorable senators to bear in mind how small an amount of wood goes into the making of a single door. I suppose that about 20 feet would make a door. So that on the basis of100 feet we have a duty of about 37s. 6d. per 100. From whatever point of view honorable senators look at the matter, they will find that a duty of 7s. 6d. is really very extravagant. I should imagine that, taking the entire cost of a door into account, probably one of this class would be made in America for about 7s. 6d., so that the duty is really about 100 per cent. </para>

                <para>I confess that I should like to make the item free. I see no earthly reason for taxing photograph frames. I shall not move to that effect, because. I do not think that it is practical. But I shall move that the duty be no more than it was under the old Tariff. A duty of 35 per cent, is far too heavy for a revenue duty. I see no reason for an increase beyond 20 per cent. We have agreed to protectionist items in the Tariff on which duties of 20 per cent, have been accepted. We agreed to a duty of 15 per cent, on handles, which it has been asserted all round are made in Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - It is proposed in this item to make dutiable at 30 per cent, an article which was originally free. That is not only a very alarming increase, but it makes shafts in the rough dutiable at the same rate as those which are bent and dressed. Even from the protectionist stand-point, there ought to be a difference between the two. It was argued yesterday, in the case of timber, that where much labour has been spent on an article, the duty should be increased, and where less labour has been put into it the duty should come down. But here there is the same duty on shafts which are ready to fit in with the cross-bars as on shafts in the rough. The latter might come in at a very nominal figure. </para>

                        <para>- I might well have asked the honorable senator that question when we were dealing with certain mining items. My inclination is that these articles should come in at as low. a rate of duty as possible, or even free. But, as I am anxious to expedite matters, and with a view of focussing the attention of the Committee upon what I regard as a quite sufficient duty, I move - </para>

                    <para>-It is perfectly true that under the old Tariff this item was free, but the Tariff Commission recommended a specific duty of 3s. per pair. The Government proposed that rate to another place. At the same time, the Government recognised that there should be a distinction between &#34;Shafts, n.e.i., in the rough,&#34; and the next item, &#34; Shafts, n.e.i., dressed,.&#34; and therefore proposed a duty, of 4s. per pair on the latter. However, what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> would be pleased to term a compact was agreed to in another place, by which <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties were substituted for the specific duties on items 314 to 321 inclusive. It must be remembered that the value of shafts, n.e.i., dressed is greater than the value of shafts, n.e.i., in the rough, and that 30 per cent, on the latter would not return as much in the way, of actual revenue as would 30 per cent, on the former. If a specific duty were proposed, there would undoubtedly be a necessity for discrimination, but an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> dutydoes not mean the same amount upon the one as upon the other. Seeing that these rates were agreed to on the voices in another place, I hope <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will not press his request. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister&#39;s argument about <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rates would apply to every item in the Tariff which is the raw material of some other item. Even protectionists ought to support the discrimination which I propose, because if it is desirable-as we all admit - to increase labour in the Commonwealth by means of the Tariff, everything should be done to encourage the introduction of material with as little labour done on it as possible. The Minister&#39;s argument might have been applied with equal force to saddletrees last night, but he did not urge it on that occasion. &#39; The matter is not worth arguing about, because it has been a principle generally accepted by protectionists, free-traders, and even revenue tariffists, that an article which is a raw material should be subjected to a lighter duty than the finished article. </para>

                <para>Many barrels which have been emptied in the canteens of &#39; India, and afterwards packed with Indian goods, have been imported into Western Australia without paying any duty. There is a very good reason why we should levy a duty on a barrel whether it contains commodities or not. We know that many tanks have been brought into the Commonwealth duty free. When it is mentioned that our coopers have to meet competition of the sort I have described, honorable senators will admit, I think, that it is quite unnecessary for me to point out the advisability of levying a duty on barrels which are brought in with commodities for no other purpose than to escape taxation. </para>

This schedule should not be framed in such a way that Australian workmen can be displaced by the introduction of such articles. As there is a general desire to get on with the business as rapidly as possible I content myself with offering these few remarks in support of the request. </para>

                        <para>- Then some of the witnesses before the Tariff Commission should be prosecuted for perjury. They certainly gave evidence to show that the industry is waning, and one of the principal reasons advanced in support of their contention was that importers of casks take advantage of the Customs Act to escape the duty under this item. I am sure it is not the desire of honorable senators to permit any one, by means of a subterfuge, to evade the Customs Act. </para>

                    <para>- The previous request was for the insertion of the words &#34; full or.&#34; Casks might be full of solids or of liquid. It appears to me that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch&#39;s</inline> proposed request is a modification of the previous request, and does not go so far as was proposed in that case. It is possible that the Committee might have no objection to the free importation of casks containing liquid, whilst honorable senators might object to the free importation of casks containing solids. I think that the request can be received. </para>

                        <para>- I have given an example, and the honorable senator will admit that, if brewers wish to import hops, they can import them in tanks. I say that when they use casks for the purpose of. importing hops they do so to evade the duty on the casks. The natural purpose of a cask is to hold liquid, and when casks are used to import dry goods which could be imported in cases or in tanks the allegation that the Customs Tariff is evaded is proved. </para>

                    (Tasmania- Minister of Home Affairs &#91;2.45&#93; - What
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline>
                    desires to establish is that persons shall not, under the guise of importing certain goods, put them into casks, and so escape the duty on casks, barrels, or vats. If we could word the item so as to say that casks containing liquid shall be free, and all other casks or casks with contents other than liquid dutiable, it would achieve
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch&#39;s</inline>
                    object. But it would certainly go further than I think is justifiable, because casks, barrels, and vats are frequently used as the containers or outside packages of other articles than liquids. For instance, cement is imported in casks. In Canada, with which country our trade has increased in recent years, barrels are commonly used for the transport of apples. Fish and  thick ink are also imported in casks. The object and policy of the Tariff is so to arrange the list of articles that no opportunity shall be given to persons, by such devices as have been referred to&#39; by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch;</inline>
                    to get in any article at a lower rate of duty than that properly chargeable on it. Under item 450, outside packages n.e.i., including the sole containing package in which the goods are ordinarily imported, are made free. Those words, &#34; in which the goods are ordinarily imported,&#34; meet
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch&#39;s</inline>
                    poin&#39;t. If casks are imported with contents which are ordinarily imported in casks they come in free.  If they contain something else, they are dutiable, and the Customs will
                    <inline font-style="italic">tw.sk</inline>
                    them as dutiable. So that if a cask or a barrel came in filled with shavings or stationery, or something else that is not ordinarily imported in a cask, it would be an independent article, not a package, and would be subject to duty. Under  these  circumstances there is hardly any necessity for
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline>
                    to move a request.

                <para class="block">The Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 12s. on  hogsheads,  and as the schedule was introduced in another place, that also was the proposition of the Government. There are very strong reasons why there should be a fixed duty in respect of hogsheads secondhand empty. I have definite information that these hogsheads can be obtained in Calcutta for 6s. each, and when broken up into shooks, for 6s. 6d. That is not an idle statement. It is confirmed by a perusal of a circular issued by Calcutta agents to persons&#39; in Melbourne, stating their ability to supply an unlimited quantity of hogsheads in shooks at the prices I have mentioned. For many purposes, I am informed hogsheads and shooks, after having been once used, are better than they would be if absolutely new. There is no doubt whatever that injury is being done to the coopering trade by the excessive importation of hogsheads from India. Evidence was given before the Tariff Commission by various men engaged in the coopering trade, to the effect that in Victoria, for a long time, the business had been in a very depressed state. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robert</inline> Lynch, Secretary of the Victorian .Society of Coopers, said that there were from 150 to 200 coopers in Victoria, the average number of employes being not more than three at each cooperage. For years, he said, there had been no apprenticeship, whereas formerly there was at least one apprentice at each cooperage. He pointed out that fifty men were engaged in Melbourne and suburbs in repairing old casks. The brewers do not use. 5 per cent, of locally-made casks. Of course, coopers are employed in the breweries, but there are not so. many as there were a few years ago, owing to the fact that the breweries  are importing secondhand hogsheads from India. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lynch</inline> also stated that the effect of the Commonwealth Tariff had been almost to crush the coopering industry. When my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> submitted his request a few moments ago, with a view of having a duty imposed upon casks and barrels filled with other than liquids, certain honorable senators opposite asked him to state what was placed inside these barrels. According to the evidence given before the Tariff Commission, casks are imported containing seeds, sausage skins, colour, sugar, glucose, vinegar, and many other things. It was pointed out before the Tariff Commission that between 1,500 and 2,000 beer casks, and 2,000 oil casks, and 10,000 spirit casks come into the Commonwealth every year. Another witness, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> J. T. O&#39;Brien, stated that 15,000 secondhand casks arrive in Victoria every year. Whatever may be the opinions of honorable senators with regard to my request, I hope they will remedy the anomaly which exists in the schedule at present. The item before us proposes a &#39; duty of 35 per cent.. But under item 324, barrels, secondhand, are&#39; made dutiable at 5s. each. Another place agreed to a duty of 5s. on every barrel imported in the form of shooks. To assemble a barrel from shooks, 3s. worth of labour is employed. So that it is proposed to charge a duty of 5s. on a barrel imported in shook form, whilst the duty on a complete hogshead is to be 35 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem.</inline> As there is indisputable evidence that a hogshead can be purchased at Calcutta for 6s., a 35 per cent, duty on that would amount to 2s. </para>

                        <para>- At any rate, a hogshead is purchasable at 6s., and the duty would be 2s., making the cost of the complete hogshead coming to Australia 8s., duty paid ; whereas in connexion with shooks, which certainly do provide labour, there is a fixed duty of 5s. That is an anomaly. There should at least be the same duty on the complete hogshead as upon the shook. Shooks are bundles of staves, and involve labour in turning them into hogsheads. Whether the duty on them is too high or too low, the anomaly is apparent. As these casks are obtainable at Calcutta at 6s. each, it will be a matter of impossibility, unless there is a high duty on them, for the coopering trade to prosper. I am credibly informed that it would cost at least 25s. to make a hogs- head in Great Britain, where the labour is not so well- paid as in Australia.. Yet secondhand ones are introduced into Australia at about 6s. each. Whatever the Committee decides with regard to the fixed duty of 1 2s. , which I now propose, I trust that they will recognise the undoubted anomaly that exists, and at least place the same rate of duty on the complete hogsheads as on shooks. I want the higher duty of 12s. on secondhand hogsheads, with a view to getting a duty of 10s. on the shooks, both of those rates being recommended by the Tariff Commission. If they are agreed to, the coopering trade will be  given the protection to which it is entitled, and no injury will be done to any one in the Commonwealth. </para>

                    should like an explanation from the Minister of the anomaly which I have pointed out. A duty of 35 per cent, on a 6s. hogshead amounts to about 2s. I have here a copy of a circular sent to Melbourne, firms offering to supply secondhand hogsheads at 6s. each. If the Government cannot agree to my request, surely, for the sake of uniformity and consistency, they- will agree to fix the same rate on the whole hogshead as on shooks.

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> falls into the error of assuming that no work is necessary on secondhand hogsheads when imported. As a matter of fact, the extra expense in putting them in order, in regard to shrinkage, &#38;c, averages at least from 2s. to 2s. 6d. each. I acknowledge that the duty on shooks is out of proportion to this one. It is absolutely outrageous, and ought to be considerably reduced. Honorable senators opposite do not appear to realize the value even of empties to many Australian industries. I know one Australian firm whose works have been closed because they could not get barrels and small casks at a value that would enable them to continue the manufacture of oils. </para>

                    <para>. - According to the return, which in this instance I have some reason to think is correct, under the old Tariff buckets were free, and tubs dutiable at 20 per cent. It is now proposed by the Government to take buckets from the free list, and make them dutiable at 30 and 25 per cent., which, I submit, is a fairly substantial increase. The duty on tubs has been increased by 50 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- Unfortunately the Senate did not have the advantage of the honorable senator&#39;s presence six. years ago. This, is not a mere question of increasing a duty by 5 or 10 per cent., but a question of removing an article from the free list and subjecting, it to a very heavy duty. I ask &#39; the Minister whether there is any particular reason for taking this departure, or. whether buckets have been included in this item, because, ordinarily speaking, buckets and tubs are grouped together, placed- on the same shelf, and sold by the same storekeeper? If that is the only reason he can assign I invite the Committee to make buckets free again. </para>

                    <para>. - It is true that under the old Tariff there was no duty on buckets ; but the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended that a duty of 35 per cent, should be imposed on both buckets and tubs. The Government proposal was to levy a duty of 45 per cent, under the general Tariff and 35 per cent, under the preferential Tariff. I understand that evidence was tendered to the Tariff Commission in regard to the price at which buckets could be made here and the price at which they could be imported. If my memory serves me correctly it was pointed out then that buckets imported for the purpose of holding raspberries could be sold here at is., whereas the cost of making similar buckets locally was over 2s. It was also mentioned I think by the witness that buckets of that character and fern and other tubs could be made in the Commonwealth, and if _ made would give&#39; a considerable amount of light employment, particularly to older workers. These reasons, amongst others, I suppose influenced the protectionist members of the Tariff Commission in making the recommendation which they did, and the Government in submitting their proposals. </para>

Of course, if the Committee think that buckets ought to be sold at over 2s. 6d., and should hot be sold at is., in order to help other industries, as they do to a certain extent, it can vote for the retention of the duty. The witness stated in most clear and unqualified terms that if we put on a heavy duty the price would undoubtedly be more than doubled. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly his evidence was that in Melbourne they could not make buckets at- less than 2s. 6d., and that they were sold here at is. He wanted the duty to be raised so that some of the coopers could make buckets. Of course the old argument immediately recurs that it would be infinitely - cheaper to the Commonwealth to pay all those persons an annual subsidy for doing nothing in order to allow the public generally to get their buckets at a reasonable price. </para>

I venture to say that 99 per cent, of the articles which it embraces are articles which we are not making in Australia and do not wish to make here, as our work-people might be better employed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> may contend that there are hundreds of hands in Melbourne employed in making paper parasols, thimbles, shoe-horns, buttons, or serviette rings, but, speaking comprehensively of the item, the duties attached to it are revenue duties, and I see no reason for them.

Commonwealth, but it should not be forgotten that a very great many, such as footballs, rubber balls, cricket bats, cricketing gloves, guards, and nets, requisites for croquet, lawn, and table games, purses, serviette rings, toys, and various kinds of ornamental jewellery, are made in the Commonwealth. Even from the revenue aspect I hope that honorable senators will not forget that whilst the revenue looked very rosy in the earlier part of the year-- </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the Committee will not agree to a preference duty of 20 per cent. I, and other honorable senators, supported the Government in regard to the duty in the first column. &#39; It does seem an extraordinary thing now, however, that the Government should run away from their own Tariff. It is admitted that 20 and 25 per cent, are purely revenue duties. Duties of 30 and 25 per cent, would be in a measure protective. Here we have an opportunity of giving effective protection to industries that are not well established, but give every indication of being established early in some parts of the Commonwealth. But the Government run away from a protective proposal which they could have carried without any difficulty, and start to bargain with the Opposition who, from the very day when the Tariff was introduced, have vigorously and tenaciously voted against protective principles. I feel very strongly in regard to this matter. Honorable senators opposite profess to desire that these goods shall be admitted free, in the belief that they cannot be made in the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- It is not effectively protective. Times out of number we have been told by honorable senators opposite that 20 per cent, is merely  a  revenue duty. The Government are now trying to placate honorable senators who have been doing . all they can to break down the protective principle of the Tariff. Is there anything unreasonable in a duty of 30 per cent? </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to congratulate this protectionist Government on their adhesion to revenue Tariff principles. I was in favour of wiping out the item altogether, because I did not want to have revenue duties in this Tariff. But when the Government themselves, to suit their own purposes, propose a protective duty, and then run away from it, and support a revenue duty, they cannot expect consistent support. I will have a protective duty or none at all. That is my fiscal principle. Let us have a duty that will be effectually protective if we are to have one at all. </para>

I was deserted by them, and now that I have had to make the best arrangement I could, they turn round upon me for accepting a reasonable compromise in deference to the general feeling of the Committee.

                        <para>- Although some of the articles may be made in a by-street in Melbourne, this is purely a revenue duty, That is proved by the fact that this protectionist Government, although they generally go up as high as 40 per cent., for really protective duties, propose only 25 per cent, in this case. The free-trade section of the Tariff Commission recommended 20 per cent, on combs, and 15 per cent, on mugs and brushes, or almost as much as the protectionist Government propose. </para>

                    <para>- - This is in some measure a revenue duty, . but, so far as it is such, it is excusable, as  it  applies to some articles of luxury, such as silver backed and jewelled combs and brushes, and shaving sets  of  a high class, which are imported. Shaving sets are made here. The articles of luxury upon which this is a revenue duty are used by persons who are well able  to  contribute more than is ordinary to the revenue-. But even where the item is at present revenue producing, it is incidentally protective, because it  is  encouraging our local people into industry after industry. The <inline font-style="italic">2</inline> 5 per cent. duty proposed against the world, while not as completely effective for protection as I should like  on  many things,  is  as much as we ought  to  impose  on  articles that we are only just beginning  to  produce, especially  as  we are only producing some  of  those covered by this item. </para>

If we were making the whole or nearly the whole of these articles, or likely to make them in the near future, I should say that the duty should be higher, but as we are making some, although possibly not nearly all, of them, and as many of them are articles that are not often required to be bought, and that in certain degrees of quality are luxuries, the duty proposed is reasonable. </para>

The duty recommended by the Tariff Commission was 25 per cent. We propose 25 per cent, (general Tariff) and 20 per cent. (United Kingdom). I hope the Committee will adhere to the schedule. </para>

                    <para>. - In order to explain the hilarity which apparently offended <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> I may state that this item includes artists&#39; colours. Some of the great artists in Great Britain have had to go to Winsor and Newton&#39;s, and other leading paint manufacturers, to superintend operations, in order to get the particular colour which they require. Of course, those paints could be made in Australia. We could make diamonds in Australia, but it would not pay. Why should not our artists have the advantage of getting the best paints that are produced? The cause of my hilarity was because I thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> was thinking of paints required for the back-yard fence. </para>

                <para class="block">That is an exceedingly important item, because it affects most seriously one of our most valuable industries. These unfinished  articles are made up very cheaply abroad and introduced here, thereby preventing work which could naturally and most easily be done locally. This question has been considered very carefully, and it is proposed to make the unfinished article liable to a higher duty. In the circumstances duties of 40 per cent, and 35 per cent are not equal to the protection, and I think the very reasonable protection, which was asked for by the workers in the industry. </para>

                    (New South Wales) &#91;4.20&#93;. - Forty -per cent, seems to be an extravagant duty to levy on an article which cannot possibly be classed as a luxury, and which is used by persons who are not perhaps sufficiently well off to provide themselves with articles of better quality. I think, sir, that we might as well have a quorum.

                    Rolled gold supplies the place of the real article to many persons. I think that the duty might reasonably be reduced on an article which cannot possibly be regarded as a luxury, and which is in very general use amongst the toilers and others whose bank accounts are not over large.

                <para class="block">That request, if carried, will give me an opportunity of moving a request for a reduction of the preferential duty from 35 to 25 per cent.

I hope that the Minister will see that this is a reasonable suggestion. </para>

                        <para>. - I remind my honorable friend that rolled gold and jewellery under 9-carat is looked upon as being practically &#34; Brummagem &#34; stuff, by means of which the public are deceived. Rolled gold articles are imported on cards, then removed from the cards and palmed off on the public as genuine articles. Of course the general mass of the people are not sufficiently alive to the fact that they are being imposed upon. They believe that they are buying a genuine article in a shop, whereas, in fact, they are buying &#34; Brummagem &#34; stuff. As it displaces the real and genuine article it is our duty to discourage its importation in any form. </para>

                        <para>- In some cases the goods are stamped, and, if I remember rightly, commerce regulations have recently been promulgated to insure that they should be stamped. The ordinary purchaser, however, does not look to see whether an article is properly stamped and marked, and probably, if it were stamped and marked he would not understand what it meant. We should have no hesitation in discouraging the importation oft his &#34;Brummagem&#34; stuff, particularly when it is recollected that it displaces the genuine article. I think that the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 35 Per cent. I suggest that in the circumstances <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> should not persist with his request. </para>

A number of communications have also reached me suggesting that the duties on watches particularly should be materially reduced, chiefly on the ground that they are not made in the Commonwealth and are not likely to be made here, and that the proposed duties represent heavy taxation. But in view of. the fact that the duty proposed on imports from the United Kingdom is the same as the duty under the old Tariff, arid in view also of the disposition of the Committee, as shown by one or two divisions on previous items,&#39; I feel &#34; that it would be perfectly hopeless to expect to carry a request for a reduction of these duties..

I believe is in accordance with a recommendation of the Tariff Commission. Under the revised Tariff I understand that microscopical instruments are still to be admitted free, whilst a duty is imposed, on microscopes under the item now before the  Committee. I do not see how we can differentiate between microscopes&#39; and microscopical instruments. Microscopes are used in many important industries in Australia, and it seems to me that it would be proper to leave them- out of this item, and place them with microscopical instruments. I am prepared to move a request in that direction.

                    <para>. - Honorable senators will remember that some time ago. when we were dealing with another division, I carried a request to put certain articles of glassware on the same footing as to duty as manufactures of glassware n.e.i. I now propose to move a request for the omission of the words &#34; Barometers and Thermometers except advertising &#34; with the object of bringing them automatically under item 253, Glassware, n.e.i. I need not repeat what I previously said on the subject, but I remind honorable senators that they have all seen illustrations of barometers and thermometers manufactured in Brisbane, and that I was informed by the Brisbane firm on whose information I took action that they could give me the names of a number of other firms manufacturing these articles in other parts of the Commonwealth.

                <para class="block">Under the old Tariff, those engaged in the manufacture of the horns - used with most&#39; of these machines - enjoyed a protection  from the duty imposed on manufactures of metals n.e.i. When they had established their industry, for some reason which is not known to them, these horns were transferred to the &#39; free list. I know of no justification for extending protection to an industry in order to establish it, and then withdrawing that projection. There is no attempt to make a new item, but simply to retain the protective duty as it is stated in the old Tariff. No good reason actuated those who re-drafted the Tariff in putting these articles upon the free list. In &#39; Australia, we use something like 20,000 of these horns annually. They are made in a variety of patterns, mostly of tin, japanned in various colours.  They sell for something like 5s. 6d. each. - All other forms of tinware enjoy protective duties of 30 and 25 per cent., and there is no sound reason for discriminating in this&#39; case. </para>

                        <para>- It cannot be, and is not made in Australia. The honorable senator was a member of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, which recommended that the item should be free. The honorable senator now asserts that this is only a preference duty. I do not want the people who have the misfortune to have weaker eyes than have others to be taxed for the benefit of manufacturers in Great Britain any more than for the benefit of manufacturers in other parts of the world. This is a ridiculous duty. These articles are free if imported from Great Britain, but the pebbles come mainly from Brazil, and many lenses are made in other countries than England. We are to be taxed 10 per cent, for a bogus preference. </para>

                        <para>- No. Great Britain pays in this highly scientific work very nearly, if not quite, the same rates of wages as we do. It is not work that an apprentice can do. The common shilling glasses - the culls, which are the experimental field of the apprentice - are practically not affected by this duty. I should be glad to see them prohibited from every part of the world, because I believe more eyes are ruined by them than we have any conception of. In this country, either eye difficulties are on the increase or else wc know very much more about the subject than we did years ago, because it is extremely common to see children of tender years compelled to wear glasses. The &#39; glasses they should wear ought to be scientifically and accurately ground to measurements prescribed by clever specialists, and therefore ought to be ground upon the spot. They have to be ground, not for general, but for specific cases, which differ in almost every instance. It is extremely important, in view of these facts, that we should develop on the spot the skill necessary to meet the continually growing necessities of our people. </para>

The pair which I put on now - the strongest that I wear, the bi-focal lens - were prescribed and ground for me six or seven years ago. </para>

I am told that any number of graded or varied lenses come in, and that persons with defective eye-sight can get them very much more cheaply than they could procure glasses prescribed by an oculist. All of us who are afflicted, unfortunately, ought to have opportunities of getting these aids to eye-sight - it is really giving sight to the blind - at the least expensive rate. I hope, therefore, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> will see the expediency of agreeing with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> to make these articles free as before. </para>

                    <para>.- I intend to support the request, because there is not the slightest doubt that  10  per cent, is a revenue and not a protective duty. I have voted consistently against the imposition of revenue duties. So far as the Government is concerned, this talk of giving British preference is all humbug, because on many occasions they have deliberately forsaken their proposal for a British preference for the sake of securing a higher revenue duty. Spectacle glasses are a necessity, not only to old people, but also to very many young persons. I was delighted at the eloquent appeal which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> who really is a good protectionist, made on behalf of the Government - probably he feels bound to do that kind of thing --to retain that which is and always will be a revenue duty. </para>

                    <para>. - I cordially support the request, and appeal to the Government to give way, now that it has been made manifest to them that the feeling of the Committee is in favour of these glasses being admitted free. I have in my possession three pairs of glasses, and I have had to wear spectacles since I was four years old. I can scarcely see to read except during daylight, and in Australia there are thousands of persons who, from one cause or other, are in perhaps a more unfortunate position than myself. Not only those persons, but also growing children should have an opportunity to secure glasses of the proper quality as cheaply as possible, in order to retain their eye-sight. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> hit the nail on the head when he said that the imports represent simply raw material. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith&#39;s</inline> argument was strongly in favour of the request if he could by any means get away from the bias of his fiscal opinion. He made a grand free-trade speech, but he did not&#39; happen to know that. We should do all in our power to enable poor persons to get the best material to enable them to maintain their eyes in a healthy and strong condition. This duty if retained means the addition of  10  per cent, to the value of the raw materials from which spectacles have to be made. </para>

Probably the Government wanted the articles included in this item to be free, but having come to that conclusion they said, &#34; We will make that freedom apply to Great Britain only - it will furnish a splendid opportunity for us to give a preference.&#34; Why should the Committee vote for a purely preferential duty? </para>

                    who is undoubtedly quite correct as to the great mischief which is being done in many cases by unsuitable glasses being supplied. I have no doubt that the vendors of glasses should be placed under a law just as much as medical men and. dentists are. Unauthorized, unqualified, ignorant persons should not be allowed to sell glasses to anybody, according to their own fancy. I recognise that for many years glasses have been ground and fitted in Australia. I have here a pair of glasses which were made for me as long ago as 1895, and, thank God, I have not had to get them altered since then. These, however, are very different glasses because of a slight accident I met with. An ordinary pair purchased in the shop would not do me the slightest good; it would only injure me. Therefore I quite sympathize with the view of

                    On the other hand, if we carried his arguments to a logical conclusion, we should find ourselves insisting upon high duties on drugs, because otherwise people might not have the right ones prescribed to them. I admit that that is a proposition which is not likely to be supported by any one. If the right things are here we must hope that sufferers, whether in the matter of sight or health generally, will be supplied with them. I have shown fairly well that I am strongly in favour of British preference, But I tell the Committee, on the strength of about as competent and as high a trade authority as exists in Australia, that these cheap glasses are not made in England. I think that I am justified in making a short quotation from a letter which was written to me last November.

In asking for this duty of 10 per cent, the Government are seeking to get revenue from a source from which it ought not to be obtained. We could get no more powerful proof of how the question of British preference has been used both here and elsewhere than is here afforded. If we wanted any evidence of the real intention of the Government in that regard it is furnished by this item. When we began to consider the Tariff I declared that British preference was being used by Ministers for the purpose of obtaining higher duties. Ought not this item to satisfy any reasonable person that it is being used by them simply as a vehicle for securing high duties? On this occasion  1  shall vote very cordially with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> and also with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline></para>

                    <para>. - Honorable senators will notice that in the  j  902 Tariff, infants&#39; boots were made dutiable at a- much lower rate than those of larger size. Whilst, perhaps, the conditions of the industry have altered slightly since that Tariff was passed, there is still strong reason for differentiating in favour of these smaller sizes, which, if made here at all, are not made extensively, and the larger sizes, which are being made here extensively. I intend to propose that infants&#39; boots and shoes of sizes o to 6 should be dutiable at 20 per cent. </para>

They supply the citizen soldier with either a right or- a. left boot. I do not know which, and he has to provide the balance for himself. It occurs to me that this state of affairs in the Defence Department must be due to the abnormally high taxation imposed by the Government on boots. I propose to ask some questions on the subject to-morrow, but in the meantime I wish to move to reduce the duty on imports under the general Tariff to 30 per cent. that, the Government may be in a position to supply the citizen soldier with the other boot.

                    <para>. - I hope the Committee will agree to the item as printed. It should be noted that under the old Tariff a duty of 15 per cent, was imposed on infants&#39; boots of sizes o to 6, and duties of 30 and 25 per cent, on the larger sizes.- The Tariff Commission took a great deal of evidence in connexion with the lower duties imposed on infants&#39; boots, and the result of their investigations was a recommendation that all should be subject to the same duty, viz.. 30 per cent. What the Government have done has been to submit that rate of duty on imports from the United Kingdom, and to provide for a preference of 5 per cent., making the duty on imports under the general Tariff 35 per cent. So far as the imports are concerned, I wish to inform honorable senators that in 1905 we imported from the United Kingdom boots of sizes other than infants&#39; to the value of ,&#163;87.259, and infants&#39; boots to the value of &#163;44,454, or a total import valued at &#163;131,713. From other countries we imported the larger sizes of boots to the value of .&#163;85,761, and infants&#39; boots to the value of &#163;3,588, or a total import from countries other than the United Kingdom valued at &#163;89,349. That is to say, that in 1905 our importations from abroad amounted in value to &#163;221,062. In 1906 the importations from the United Kingdom were valued at &#163;.146,749, a substantial increase on. the imports for the previous year, and from places other than the United Kingdom they amounted to &#163;85,774, or a total importation valued at &#163;232,523. When we bear in mind the enormous development of the boot-making industry in the Commonwealth and its importance in each of the States, we may well ask whether it is really necessary that we should continue these importations. They were made in the face of a 30 per cent, duty previously prevailing, and in the circumstances the proposal now made to impose a duty of 35 per cent, under the general Tariff and 30 per cent, on imports from the United Kingdom against boots of all sizes is reasonable. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that honorable senators should know something about the history of this matter before they vote. There was a time in Australia when it was a wise thing that infants&#39; boots,0 to  6,  should be free. They are largely made from cuttings from establishments where larger boots are made. When we had not many bootmaking establishments in Australia, and when there were scarcely any where the finer kinds of boots were made, the material for the production of infants&#39; boots was not available. But as we developed our factories, and made more and better men&#39;s and women&#39;s boots, we began to have available the material for the cheap production of infants&#39; sizes. Now there is a high standard of production all over Australia. We have a considerable amount of material, excellent in character, that is not large enough for the making of the larger sizes of boots, but is available chiefly for the production of infants&#39; boots. The making of them finds profitable employment for people of not very robust physique. It is pleasant and light employment. We are now making infants&#39; boots of great variety, excellence, and cheapness. Therefore I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> request will not be agreed to. </para>

                    <para>. - The departmental officer explains to me that the words &#34; and Stuff &#34; are so indefinite that it is very difficult for the Customs to interpret them. Consequently what is suggested is that the word should be left out. If the stuff imported for slipper making is wool, it will be liable to the duties imposed on other woollens ; if it is cotton material, it will be dutiable at the same rate as other cotton, namely, 5 per cent, and free. </para>

                        <para>- I do not want to fix the responsibility upon any one in particular. For us the responsibility rests on the Minister. I do not believe that it is impossible to get over the difficulty. I cannot think that the Customs would be unable to. separate &#34;Stuff &#34; used in the manufacture of slippers or boots from stuff that might be used for some other purpose. I see no reason for taking&#34; Stuff &#34; out of the item and making it dutiable at 30 per cent., and I hope that the Committee will refuse to delete the word. Later on I intend to move that the whole item be free. </para>

The great bulk of these articles come from England, and a 5 per cent, duty under the general Tariff is a pure sham. The whole of these articles are the raw material for boot and shoe manufacturers. It seems absurd for the Government to impose a 5 per cent, duty on the raw material of an industry which they propose to encourage with a heavy duty of 35. per cent. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia)  &#91;6.19&#93;.  - I should like the Minister to state what reasons there are for increasing the duty by  10  per cent. Under the old Tariff, it was  15  per cent., and now it is proposed that it should be increased to  25  per cent. If the manufacture of rubber hose has been established in the Commonwealth, it must have been done with a duty of  15  per cent., which, as
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline>
                    has said, has enabled the manufacturer to produce miles of it. I take it that this item deals with the sort of hose which is used for irrigation and gardening generally. It seems a very hard thing that a duty of  25  per cent, should be imposed on a tool of trade. We know that now-a-days, there is nothing more essential in gardening and producing various crops, than irrigation. Where the water cannot be taken on to the ground by gravitation, it has to be applied with the aid of sprinklers. On the hills near Adelaide, there are a hundred sprinklers used to-day, where ten years ago, or perhaps less, not one was used. The consumption of rubber hose is very large ; and, considering the hardships which market gardeners have to undergo, and the toil which they have to undertake in many cases for a very small profit, it is very hard indeed that this duty should be increased so heavily as is proposed.

                        <para>- The Government accepted the recommendation of the A section of the Tariff Commission, and put that rate in the preferential column. It is a matter of common knowledge that india-rubber hose is made in the Commonwealth. I hold in my hand a copy of Dunlop&#39;s price list, and they represent, by means of illustrations, the particular classes of hose which they manufacture, and are ready to sell at specified prices. I have purchased hose from the firm. Every honorable senator who has made the slightest inquiry must be aware that the article is made in the Commonwealth. Surely that is a good and sufficient reason why its production should be encouraged ?I admit that a considerable quantity of rubber hose is still imported ; but the object of this duty is to discourage importations and encourage the local industry. I ask the Committee to accept the duty, which is a very moderate one. </para>

                    <para>.-It is practically correct to say that no evidence was taken by the Tariff Commission in connexion with the manufacture of rubber, but it must be recollected that shortly after it was appointed, and when witnesses were beginning to attend to give evidence, or send in their names as intending witnesses, there was a very big disturbance in the arrangements connected with the manufacture of rubber in Australia. Nobody came before the Tariff Commission, because it was not any one&#39;s direct interest to attend. At the same time it was the duty of the members of that body, particularly the protectionists, to find out, even though persons did not attend to give evidence, how the industries of Australia were being affected by the existence or the want of duties. </para>

                        <para>- Whether I am a member of a Royal Commission or not, it is always my business to go and find out all that I possibly can. If the honorable senator wants to act justly and intelligently towards the whole community, it is also his duty to take that step. When I learned that the rubber industry was carried on inVictoria, I took the train to Montague railway station, where I found a rubber works employing over 500 persons in the production of rubber goods under the most favorable conditions, so far as the workshop and other accommodation were concerned, that I have seen any where. I learned that they were manufacturing, not only rubber rings and rubber heels, but all kinds of rubber goods. I also found that they were labouring under very considerable difficulty, owing to the competition from other parts of the world. The very name of the company - the Dunlop Rubber Company - may convey to the minds of honorable senators a suggestion which is not correct. I ascertained that the company had bought the interest of the Dunlop Rubber Tyre Company of Great Britain, and are carrying on the works on their own account with Australian capital and Australian people, so far as they possibly can. They manufacture every article from garden hose to the smaller articles I have mentioned. Even sanitary gloves are made there out of the finest rubber. I have used rubber hose for the last twenty-five years, and I know that since this company commenced operations the price has decreased by considerably more than one-third, and that was not because the price of the raw rubber had decreased. I suppose that everybody knows that owing to the numerous uses to which it has been put the price of raw rubber has steadily advanced, so that that could not have been the cause of the reduction in the price of rubber goods. </para>

                <para class="block">Committee, as the result of a personal inspection, that he was able to vouch for the fact that the proprietors of the establishment referred to employed 500 hands. That is certainly evidence of the establishment of a substantial industry; but I remind the Committee that the development referred to has occurred under a Tariff of 15 per cent. Every remark which has been made by honorable senators on the other side has shown that a duty of 15 per cent, affords ample protection to this industry. Those interested in it did not approach the Tariff Commission with any complaint that they were suffering from outside competition or any other cause, and we are entitled therefore to assume that it was because they believed they were making satisfactory progress under the old Tariff. That being so, I am not disposed to give to this industry a higher measure of protection than has been shown to be ample. Both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> and I regard the proposed rate of duty as too high. The honorable senator, I suppose, wishes to reduce it to 15 per cent., the duty levied under the old Tariff, but I remind him that in the Committee there are certain honorable senators who, rightly or wrongly, believe in a preferential duty, and I therefore suggest that he should propose to make the duty on imports under the general Tariff 20 per cent., since if that is done honorable senators who believe in preference may be induced to agree to the old duty on imports from the United Kingdom. </para>

                        <para>- That is so; but the rubber manufactures which the importations for 1906 cover are practically all being made in the local factory. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> I have had the advantage of an inspection of the works of the Dunlop Rubber Company, and I know that they manufacture almost every article of rubber that is in general use.I therefore say that the value of the importations of rubber in 1906 is a sufficient reply to those who ask why this duty should be raised to  25  per cent, and  20  per cent. If we. wish to increase the manufacture of rubber goods in Australia, it is clearly necessary that we should impose a higher duty on these articles than that imposed under the old Tariff. </para>

                    <para>- - My main reason for suggesting a reduction of this duty is that the item rubber and other hose covers an article which is almost entirely used .by gardeners; by the ordinary householder, and also by market gardeners generally. I think that the duty proposed is too heavy a duty to impose upon such .an article. With regard to the factory established in Melbourne and the remarks which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> to a large extent directed to me as a member of the Tariff Commission, I should like to say that I never considered it my duty .as a member of that Commission to make a personal investigation of the establishments or factories of any persons carrying on business in Australia. I venture to say that few, if any other, members of the Commission, with the exception of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> consider that to be their duty. The appointment of the Commission was advertised broadcast, and an invitation was extended to every manufacturer who considered that he w-as suffering any hardship by the imposition of an unfair or a low duty to come before the Commission and state his case. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> must agree with me that the only proper method by which the Commission could arrive at any conclusion was by the taking &#39;of evidence on oath. The honorable senator must know that the impressions  derived&#39; from a personal inspection by members of the Commission would not be evidence of any value in a Court of law, and would-not have any real value for a Tariff Commission. We have been told that  500  people are employed in- the Dunlop factory, but I have no doubt that Senator McGregor will admit that only a very small percentage of that number is- employed in the manufacture of rubber hose. At the works referred to, a great quantity of .rubber goods is manufactured that is not covered bv the item now under discussion: To that extent. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> was not intentionally, but actually, misleading the Committee,  when he induced honorable senators to believe that this item represented the labour of  500  people. It probably does &#39;not represent the labour in the factory referred to of more than, perhaps, twenty at the most </para>

                        <para>- I notice that&#39; it does, now that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> has. drawn attention to the fact, and I naturally ask why, in the circumstances, the two items have been separated. Possibly, the reason i; that the use to which rubber and other&#39; hose is &#39; applied can be defined pretty clearly, whilst rubber manufactures cover a very great variety of articles made of rubber. The people who manufacture these goods had ample opportunity to appear before the Tariff Commission, if, in their opinion, the duty under the old Tariff is not sufficiently high, and they suffered any injustice on that account. L do not believe for a moment that they considered that they were suffering any injustice, or that they could not manufacture these goods to any extent they pleased under the old rate of duty. . But I do say that if the duty is increased as proposed the effect undoubtedly will be to increase the price of rubber hose. </para>

                        <para>- In the manufacture of innumerable articles in this Tariff, enormous strides have been made in England, Germany, and elsewhere, in lessening the cost of production. The world does not stand still in these matters. Hundreds of things which we buy are cheaper than they used to be. That cheapness does not depend on any Tariff. It is due to the perfecting of means of production. It is because I feel that this duty will mean placing an increased burden on a class of people . who ought not to be asked to bear it, and because the people in Australia who manufacture hose have not asked for an increased duty, and have apparently done fairly well under the lower rate, that I think that it is a fair thing to go back to the duty of 15 per cent. I therefore move - </para>

                    for calling my attention to the imports for 1906, under the heading of rubber hose and other manufactures of rubber. But the information which he has so kindly supplied does not solve the difficulty. It does not show in any respect that an increase of 10 per cent, in the duty is required.

                        <para>- Yes, there is. . Under item 350, all the expensive manufactures of rubber are included. The articles include, first of all, surgical goods, and then- we come down to rubber tyre fabric, tyre rubber, tyres not &#39; accompanying cycles or vehicles, and tubes, valved or unvalved. We are all aware of the enormous extent to which rubber tyres have come into general use in recent years, and we must know that a great proportion of these importations are due to the use of rubber tyres. </para>

                        <para>- It is obvious from what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> has been good enough to say, that Australia is an exporter of rubber hose. Of course, in the absence of definite information, it is impossible for us to be certain. We cannot say how much is represented by hose. But when we consider the extent to which the importation of tyres has necessarily gone on, we must certainly attribute a very large proportion to the use of these things. The fact that we have been exporting under a 15 per cent, duty is a reason why we need not increase it. </para>

The articles are enumerated in the recommendations of the B section of the Tariff Commission. The reason for their omission is fairly obvious to every one. They are used by invalids, being practically all medical appliances. They are surgical bandages, elastic stockings, leggings, knee-caps, thigh-pieces, and wristlets.

                <para class="block">I propose this increase because the importation of these articles has very largely increased during the last year or two. They are somewhat incongruous in this collection and should be dealt with in a separate way. We have just been authoritatively informed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> that the importations have largely increased, because he said that the bulk of the importations in the last year or two had been mainly of these tyres. The rubber industry is capable of very great expansion, and may with proper care become one of our leading industries, affording employment to a very large number of people. There has not only been an increase in the importations of late years, but there has also been a decrease in the number of hands employed. According to the Victorian <inline font-style="italic">Year-Book</inline> there were employed in 1904 in Victorian rubber factories 499 males and 199 females. These diminished to 446 males and 158 females in 1906. The rubber imports in 1902 were as follow: - British, &#163;157,572; American, &#163;18,076; German, &#163;8,692. These increased in 1906 to: - British, &#163;290,926; American, &#163;23,057; and German, &#163;33,058, showing an increase during the four years of - British, 84 per cent. ; American, 27 per cent. ; and German, 280 per cent. Consequently the importations have been overtaking the local production, showing that the support given to the local manufacturers was not sufficient. The trade and finance returns show that the imports of rubber goods were in November, 1906, &#163;33,108 worth, and in November, 1907, &#163;42,405 worth. For the first eleven month&#39;s of 1906 they were &#163;322,724 worth, and for the first eleven months of 1907 they had increased to &#163;355,905. According to the very latest figures which I can get, the imports for December, 1906, were &#163;24,671 worth, and for December, 1907, &#163;35,130 worth, showing an increase of over 42 per cent, for that one month alone. While it may be urged that the duty has been increased, I believe that with a further increase we shall stimulate the industry to a much greater extent. It may be argued that this will raise the price, but the additional duty that has been put on has not had that effect. In fact, during the last three years - from 1905 up to the present - prices have substantially decreased in the case of the Continental and Wyngeel tyres, and the Dunlop and Oceanic tyres. On the other hand, the promise of higher duties has started new factories. Where there were only one or two before, there are now six in the Commonwealth. There may be others, but those six are the Dunlop Rubber Company, Barnett Glass, Wallace, and Commonwealth Rubber Company in Victoria ; and in New South Wales the Continental Rubber Company, and Perdriau. It may be contended that motor tyres are not being made here; but the Dunlop Rubber Company have just engaged an expert who is going to manufacture a variety of these articles, especially motor rubber tyres. To show that confidence is felt in the work of the firm, I may mention that they are engaged in making tyres for the motors to be run in the great road race from Adelaide to Melbourne. Chauffeurs and others, who have to risk their lives, and those who own the machines, certainly would not put their business into the hands of a local firm unless they could turn out a good article which would suit their purpose. Considering these various points, I think it is only right that we should give the industry the support that it requires. I believe that, if we do, it will become one of the leading industries in the Commonwealth. At the present time, the greater portion of the rubber has to be imported from South Africa and South America; but it is now being grown largely in Ceylon and Java, and plantations are being laid down in New Guinea, so that in the course of a few years our supply of rubber will be produced very much nearer to us than at present. In view of the importance of the industry, its great capacity for expansion, the large number of employes, and the amount of capital that will be invested therein, I ask the Committee, with confidence, to increase the duties on these items to the amounts I have stated. </para>

In these circumstances, I find myself called upon to adhere to the rates as proposed by the Government and as they now appear in the schedule. </para>

It is quite apparent that even the existing protection is not sufficient to enable the local manufacturers to cope with the enormous increase in- the importations. </para>

                        <para>-- We have had a little experience of it. Durking last December, as compared with the previous December, there was an increase of ever &#163;11,000 worth in the importations, show-ing that the duty is not sufficiently high. A lot of ridicule has been heaped upon those protectionists who at some time or other have said that we had starving industries. If this is not a starving industry it is certainly not one which is hold ing its own. For instance, in Victoria last year we had an increase of about) 11,000 hands in our various manufacturing industries, but in the rubber .industry we had a decline of over 200 hands. </para>

                        <para>- This cannot be described as a two-men-and-a-boy industry. I am glad to say that it is or.e of the few industries which employ a very large number of adult males in proportion to the child labour. Although they are not receiving wages as high as I should like them to get, still if we take the 499 men, women, and children engaged in Victoria,&#39; we find that they average &#163;1 6s. 10d. per week,, showing that the industry is paying reasonable wages. When we compare that average with the rates paid in various countries, we can easily perceive in what way our manufacturing industries are handicapped. It is always said, particularly by honorable senators on the opposite side, that whenever a protective duty is imposed upon a commodity it is a tax upon the consumer. I wish to cite a few facts in order to prove that in the rubber industry protection has been the cause of bringing about a decrease in the price of the article,&#39; and strange to say the higher the amount of protection the greater. has been the fall in the price. For instance, in the season 1904-5 the Dunlop Rubber Company charged 47s. and 18s. 8d. for tyres, and 5s. for tubes, but in subsequent seasons the prices were 40s. and 15s. for tyres, and 5s. for tubes. I am quite prepared to go through the catalogues issued by the various firms to prove beyond a doubt that as the protection has been raised in this industry&#39; the price has &#39;decreased accordingly.  </para>

                        <para>- Not always. The price of rubber has-, advanced considerably the world over- but despite that fact, and the imposition of an additional duty, in Victoria the price of the finished commodity has decreased to a considerable extent. Seeing that the effect of a little protection has been to establish, to a certain extent, the rubber industry, that it i? giving employment to a considerable, number of persons,  and that it has decreased the price of the commodity to the consumer; what more can even the most ardent free-trader desire? The protection of the industry has had a- very beneficial effect throughout the Commonwealth, and the imposition of a higher duty will secure to our manufacturers an increased &#39; command of the home market, enable them to give further employment, thereby increasing the wage fund, and also, owing to their larger -turnover, to reduce the price of the article to a far&#39; greater .extent . to the consumer. . - </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and a higher duty on rubber goods  will reduce the price of locally-made articles to the consumer.  Why ? . Because if we reduce the volume  of importations,- the local manufacturers will be able to buy their raw material at cheaper rates, employ their plant more fully, and consequently will be able to sell their product at even lOwer prices than they do. It must be clear to any- one who is open to reason,- as I trust <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> is, that that is a fact.  I hope- that this- industry, which .has . been going backward, as -is shown by the. fact that .the number of employe&#39;s -engaged in it has decreased, within the last three years, will be given an opportunity for full development in order that a good- class of work may be given to our own people in -the production of rubber goods in this country. </para>

                        <para>- It does not pay dividends as high as are paid in the businesses of the importers whose cause <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> consistently champions in this Chamber. In view of what we have heard from honorable senators opposite about the improved position of industries throughout the Commonwealth, it is sad to reflect that the rubber manufacturing industry has been decreasing the number of its employes. That is certainly a proof that the industry is on the wane. What is the remedy proposed? It is to give an additional protection of  5  per cent. That is what is proposed to bring about a more satisfactory condition of affairs in this industry than has prevailed in the past. We have to arrest the downward tendency of the industry, and to start it on the up-grade, and an additional duty of  5  per cent, is quite inadequate for that purpose. I remind honorable senators that in the Bounties Act we grant a maximum bounty of  &#163;30,000  for the production of the raw material of this industry, and when, in the face of that fact we find that the Industry itself is in a declining position, it is our duty to give it the assistance it requires. It is for this reason that I am prepared to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl&#39;s</inline> request. </para>

                <para class="block">If honorable senators will look at item  380,  paragraphJ <inline font-style="italic">(b),</inline> they will find that &#34;chassis for motor cars and rubber tyres for one car &#39; &#39; are to be admitted at  5  per cent, under the general Tariff, and free from the United Kingdom. Unless the amendment I have now proposed be agreed to, there will be an absurd anomaly contained in the Tariff, inasmuch as tyres imported with the under gear of motor cars might be admitted free, whilst tyres imported alone under this item would be dutiable at  25  and  20  per cent.

The duty set down in the schedule is 20 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem.</inline> I desire to request that that dutv be struck out, and a duty of 2d. per square foot inserted. The tanners and bootmakers were for some time unable to agree in regard to this matter. Ultimately, the Victorian and New South Wales tanners and bootmakers met in conference, and, as a result, a request was made to the Minister of Trade and Customs&#39; that 2d. per square foot should be the duty chargeable. </para>

                        has made rather an interesting admission. He has told us, in language quite plain, that the best classes of leather must be imported, and that it is an inferior class that is made in the Commonwealth. He wants to have a higher duty on that inferior class. While I object to a protective duty with regard to the boot industry, I also object to any duty which would hamper it when it is established., whether under protection or otherwise. Leather is the raw material of the boot industry, and, as most honorable senators know, the better class of leather is only sparsely made in Australia. On the other hand, it is very valuable to the bootmaker. I say without fear of contradiction that if the bootmaker were able to get the superior classes of leather cheap, it would be a decided help to him in carrying his industry to the state of perfection to which protectionists desire to see it brought. That being so, I desire to make the item free. I believe that it would be for the benefit of the boot industry to make the item free.

                    <para>. - Speaking as a bootmaker of very large experience, I have no hesitation in saying that the bootmakers have derived material advantage from the imposition of duties on leather. They have led to the development of leather production in Australia to the extent that we have not now to import an enormous number of lines at all, because we have developed the local production. The bootmaker finds it a very great convenience to be able to order a small quantity of leather from day to day as he requires it, instead of having to import or buy from importers in large quantities, as he had to do before the imposition of duties. In addition to that, the price of imported leather has been materially reduced because of the duties imposed - not because the importer likes to pay the duty and sell his leather cheaper, but because leather produced in Australia has been so largely used that he had. to sell cheaper or not sell at all. The local competition was so keen and effective as to displace the imported leather unless it were sold cheaper. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, it is. I am dealing with lines already developed. The leather industry has been progressing. Ten or twelve years ago there were lines of leather which were not produced in Australia at all. They are now being produced of so excellent a quality, that, although in some respects they are not yet equal to the best that the world can produce, they are so good that they are used in a very large range of manufactures in the boot line, and they are good enough to compel the sale of the very best leather that the world can produce, at a lower price than that for which it would otherwise have been sold. These are deductions arrived at as the result of an experience extending over a very long period, and very extensive in character. It happens that I have been a bootmaker for many years; in addition to which I occupied in the boot trade the position of appraiser of values. I was for a long time secretary of the Bootmakers&#39; Union. In the boot trade, prices for making are gauged by the quality and description of the material employed. The men are not paid so much for a pair of boots, but so much according to the quality of the leather used. Therefore I had - compelled by my position - to acquire a more than ordinary knowledge of the variations of quality in leather.I can speak with a greater degree of confidence in that respect than most bootmakers could, or than most leather dressers. </para>

It is most undesirable, for the sake of the Customs administration, and for other reasons, to have one specific duty in the midst of a number of <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties, and will surely create confusion. </para>

                    <para>A useful comparison may be made with the duty on glace kid, which now stands at 20 per cent., about the lowest rate at which the local manufacture can be kept alive. We contend that the duty on white leather should be materially higher than that upon kid, as compared with kid. The percentage of wages to cost of the finished product is 20 per cent, higher. No compensating savings can be made, nor can any larger profits be obtained. Taking the present rates, the percentage of duty to wages, which, for reasons stated, should be greater in the case of white leather than in the case of kid, is actually about 35 per cent. less. </para>

                    <para>. - That letter was evidently a copy of one which has been forwarded to me. I was at first inclined to move in the direction in which the writer wished, for he seemed to have made out a good case, but I have been astonished to learn, from further inquiries, that he has since written to the Customs Department absolutely withdrawing from the position which he set out in his communication to myself and my colleague. I believe that that letter is in official possession to-day. That is the reason why I have taken up my present attitude. I do not wish to give the name of the author, but he has written to the Department to say that, on further inquiry and consideration, he is unable to sustain the position which he originally took up. </para>

                    but, as I have had some correspondence with the writer of the letter from which I read the extract, and have not received from him any sign of withdrawal, I am dubious about the statements contained in the local document which has reached me.

With regard to the other portion of the honorable senator&#39;s proposed request, &#34; except prospectuses of school scientific and technical science illustrations.&#34; I would say that I see no reason why specimens of the nature of that which the honorable senator has produced should not be printed in the Commonwealth. . The specimen produced is simply an advertisement of a particular book which is described as <inline font-style="italic">The Modern Encyclopaedia: The Cheapest and most Reliable Work of its kind in the Language.</inline> Illustrations are given showing how the book would look on the owners&#39; shelves. There is depicted a street scene in Cairo, and some aeronautic illustrations reduced, I presume, from illustrations appearing in. the book itself. I think honorable senators must agree that there is no reason why this kind of specimen or catalogue should not be produced in the Commonwealth. It is a trade catalogue. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. The firm publishing the work probably hopes to supply the whole of the English-speaking world with this scientific book. As the book itself will be admitted free, I can see no reason why the prospectus describing it should not also be admitted free. From the Minister&#39;s explanation, it would appear that if a specimen consists of a single illustration or picture it is free of duty, but if there is a line or two of print on the page explaining the illustration it becomes dutiable. That is an interpretation of the item which I think will not commend itself to the Committee. The fact that these books are admitted free is an overwhelming reason for the free admission of samples and prospectuses describing them. The only reason I can ascertain for the objection to the suggested request is that some time ago a prospectus of the <inline font-style="italic">Windsor Magazine</inline> was imported and made dutiable, and apparently the publishers of scientific works are to be treated in the same way as the publishers of a more&#39; or less rubbishy magazine. Perhaps it would be better that I should move my request as a separate item, but in view of the fact that I am dealing with- the prospectuses of scientific books that would be of use to students throughout the Commonwealth, I am inclined rather to press the matter than to apologize to the Committee for detaining it&#34;. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope that the door will not be opened in the way desired by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger. I ask honorable senators to consider the far-reaching effect of the proposed request. I suppose that it is intended that the specimen illustrations and prospectuses shall be descriptive of scientific publications, but it is very difficult to say what might not be described as a scientific publication. Nothing would be easier than for the publisher of a book to take out the title page and one or two plates and pages of the work, have them stereotyped, and from the stereotypes print thousands of prospectuses advertising the publication, which could afterwards be sent into the Commonwealth without paying any duty. That would be a considerable handicap upon the Australian printer. </para>

                    <para>- - I wish to direct the attention of the Minister and honorable senators to what is not merely an anomaly but an absolute injustice presented by the different treatment extended to different sections of the community under paragraphs a and b of this item. For the purpose of my argument it may be said that both paragraphs cover the same class of goods ; but under paragraph a it is proposed to charge a duty of 6d. per . lb. for any printed matter introduced into Australia if brought here by or on behalf of people who have a business established in  our- midst, whilst under paragraph b it is proposed to permit the same printed matter to come in free if brought- in by those who have no business place in Australia. If . there is to be any distinction, the position should certainly be reversed. If there is one thing about which we can all be in agreement, it is a desire to see in our midst representative establishments of persons carrying on&#39;  business -abroad! and doing business with -us. I take the instance of Cadbury Brothers, and I believe I am correct in saying that they have an establishment in Australia of some magnitude. Under the schedule as it stands it is proposed to charge this firm 6d. per lb. for printed matter they import because they have an establishment in Australia, whilst a competitor who is not established here but merely sends printed matter out to an agent is allowed to send it into Australia free of duty. The only question now is how to correct the anomaly. </para>

                        <para>- I thought we should reach a point at which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> would go the wrong way whilst I am resolute to continue on the right way. I say that the anomaly can best be corrected by leaving out paragraph  b  except in so far as it relates to printed matter and photographs the property of any public institution and intended for deposit or exhibition therein. No doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> would desire to have paragraph  b  deleted, or a duty of 6d. per lb. placed against it. I think that 6d. is too high. My opinion is that we might reasonably reduce the duty on paragraph  a  to what it was under the old Tariff. I have learnt something about the temper of the Committee during the last few weeks. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope that the Committee will not agree to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> request. I agree with him regarding the anomaly which he has pointed out, namely, that under the schedule as presented to us taxation is imposed on the enterprising man, whilst we allow the bird of passage to get his printed material into Australia absolutely free. But I do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> when he suggests that we should lower the duty. I hope that the Committee will agree to the proposed duty of 6d. per lb., and, later on, I hope that the anomaly pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will be rectified by the imposition of the same duty with respect to printed material introduced by one who has not an establishment in Australia, as is paid by those who have business houses here. </para>

                <para class="block">I confess that I am taking up a somewhat anomalous position in this matter, because, although I am in the printing trade, I have never asked for a duty to the extent of a single penny. I started my business when there was no protection in South Australia, and was never afraid of any competition whatever. But the printing trade has just as much right to ask for protection as has any other trade in the Commonwealth. The members of the trade have been holding a meeting in Melbourne to-day, and they have brought under my notice something that seems to be an anomaly, and which justifies the request I am now making. The printers fear the invasion of the yellow peril. Australian printers seem likely to be brought into severe competition with Japan. I hold in my hand an illustration of what I mean. It is a placard issued by Anthony Hordern and Sons in Sydney. It was printed in Japan. I understand that this firm advertise in some of the magazines the fact that their goods are made in Australia. This appears to be an exception to that rule. </para>

                        <para>- They are necessarily very large importers, because they profess to be universal providers. They will, I suppose, provide anything, &#34; from a needle to an anchor,&#34; as the saying is. But in this instance they seem to have adopted a course which brings them into conflict with the printing trade. I have before me an extract which contains a story told by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sidney</inline> Day, a Victorian master printer, to a gathering held in Melbourne - </para>

                    <para>While on a visit to Japan, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Day</inline> discovered by the merest accident that the printers of Australia were being deprived of a considerable amount of work which, according to all rules of fair trading, should legitimately be theirs. Referring to the matter at the last meeting of the Victorian Master Printers&#39; Association, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Day</inline> stated that at Yokohama he found a Japanese printing establishment, managed by a cute American, turning out lithographic printing in a style which would not discredit any Australian printery. The wages paid were about one-sixth the wages of the printers doing similar work in Melbourne or Sydney. </para>

                <para class="block">I understand that a journeyman&#39;s wage in Japan is9s. per week, which is only about one-sixth - barely that - of the wage paid to a journeyman printer in Australia. Under these circumstances, the trade are not making an unreasonable request in asking for the addition to the item of provision for a duty of  35  per cent. I may add that prior to this action on the part of the trade, I had not proposed to submit any request upon the matter. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator does not want to do that, the proper thing for him to do is to fall in with the suggestion which I made some time ago, and to which I am now trying to give effect. If my proposal be adopted, the deleted articles will fall automatically into paragraph  a.  Whilst I very much regret to. propose a duty, I still contend that it is manifestly unfair to allow persons who have established a business here to be placed in the position of having to pay a duty, whilst those who send out first a circular, and then a commercial traveller to gather up orders, are exempt from such impost. I am not prepared to agree to such treatment. I. want to put them all on the one level. </para>

It was considered to be a great advantage to the community to know  what was going on elsewhere, and therefore this paragraph was inserted. We should know what our competitors in other countries are doing, .and not penalize them for sending us gratuitous information. </para>
