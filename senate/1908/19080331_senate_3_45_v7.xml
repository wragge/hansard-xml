On Saturday, the aist, a message was* received for &#34; Finlayson, Temperance Hall,&#34; at 12.51 p.m., and was taken out for delivery at 1.5 p.m. on the same date. . The messenger found&#39; the hall closed, and left a slip under the office door at the hall, and the. message was eventually delivered at 8.37 a.m. on Monday, the 23rd instant, to the caretaker, at the hall.&#39; As there arc no instructions from Messrs. Finlayson and Sons as to the disposal of their messages after office hours, there was no unavoidable delay in delivery. </para>

                <para>These boards are used for avery special class of work. Last week I endeavoured to get coated boards made free, because they are used for a special class of work, but it was ascertained afterwards that coating is done in Australia, and, therefore, the proposal has been changed with a view to having uncoated boards made free,as they are foot made here. . I have seen the manufacturers, who have informed me that they do not make the boards, but do the coating. It ought to be very gratifying, indeed, to honorable senators to find that we have artists, engravers, and printers who can turn out postcards so well as they do. I have not seen anywhere a superior class of work. The postcards I have here depict Australian scenes painted by Australian artists. I do not an ticipate any objection to my proposal. The coating of the boards is- practically a monopoly ; but the manufacturers have guaranteed that they will not raise the price, and, if possible, will lower it. The present price is 31s. per gross, Imperial size, and in no case will this be exceeded; but it may possibly be reduced. </para>

I suppose that the meaning of the two definitions is almost identical, but if the Minister insists upon having his own definition, of course, I must accept it. </para>

                    <para>. - The object of the honorable senator&#39;s request is to cut down the protection proposed. The duty of 3s. per dozen packs on playing cards is the same as that imposed under the Tariff of 1902, and is the duty that was recommended by both sections of the Tariff Commission. Obviously, it was recognised by the members of the Tariff Commission, as it has been by the Government and by Parliament in the past, that playing cards should be subjectto a higher duty than the duties proposed under item 357, paragraph  a.  Under the 1902 Tariff the industry for the manufacture of these cards has grown up, and has been well established in Sydney. I believe that they are also made in Melbourne, and that considerable employment is given in connexion with their manufacture. I am&#39; sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> does not wish the Committee to misunderstand the object of his request, and to construe it as a desire on his part to cheapen playing cards to the user. The honorable senator has frankly admitted that his object is to reduce the protection proposed to be afforded, and I hope the Committee will not accept the request. </para>

                        <para>- I dare say that on some kinds of playing cards this duty would be as high as 100 per cent., but the average, according to the declared value of last year&#39;s imports, is over 75 per cent. I say that it is outrageous that a protective duty at the rate of 75 per cent. should be imposed in the form of a specific duty, when perhaps very few members of the Committee are aware that such a very extravagant <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty is being submitted. If the Minister is not prepared in this case to accept a duty of 30 per cent., as imposed on the cards included in item  &#34;357, paragraph a, let him ask for 40 per cent. If the honorable senator wants 75 per cent., let him have the pluck to say so straight out. </para>

                    <para>That the House of Representatives be requested to make item 356, paragraph aa, free. &#91; have frequently moved in cases like this that articles which cannot be made here should be admitted duty free, so that revenue should not.be collected upon them, and that the people who require to use them should get them at the lowest possible cost. I must confess that I have not had, so far, much support from the alleged freetraders in the Committee in giving effect to so laudable an object. I find that, whilst free-traders are perfectly willing to impose taxation on Australian taxpayers in order to protect manufacturers in the United Kingdom, they absolutely refuse to give protection to Australian manufacturers. I hope that honorable senators will permit typewriting paper to be admitted free. </para>

                    <para>. - The duty proposed in this case is 5 per cent. on imports under the general Tariff, whilst imports from the United. Kingdom are to be free, and, of course, the objectisto give a preference to the United Kingdom. It is hoped that the imposition of a duty of 5 per cent. on this paper imported from countries other than the United Kingdom will serve to divert the trade from those countries to Great Britain. This paper is made in the United Kingdom, and it would therefore be only in respect of importations from other countries that the duty, small as it is, would be operative. </para>

If this duty is to be operative, it can only be where countries other than the United Kingdom can supply Australiaat a cheaper rate. I hope that honorable senators who refuse to give protection to Australian manufacturers will assist me in this case to refuse to give protection to British manufactures. If they do not believe in protection at all, where is the logic in voting for protection to British manufactures. If this paper is imported from countries other than the United Kingdom, we shall raise revenue on it, and I am opposed to a purely revenue duty. For these reasons I shall persist with my request, and I hope that it will be carried. </para>

We talk of a White Australia, and I earnestly hope that Australia will be kept white, but in pursuance of that policy we should prevent the possibility of imports from Japan and other countries where coloured labour is employed. </para>

                <para class="block">This matter was discussed when we dealt with item  187,  under which electrotypes and stereotypes are dutiable at the same rates as I now propose for printers&#39; matrices. These matrices are, roughly speaking, moulds from matter already in type. They are imported and have been admitted at a very low duty, with the result that work which should have been done in Australia has not been done here, to the disadvantage of, at any rate, some printers. A duty of 30 per cent. upon them is practically no duty at all, because, probably, the value of the matrice itself would not amount to more than1d. Even a duty of 100 per cent. would only be equal to a fixed duty of 2d., and would not stop the importation. These moulds should be treated in the same way as electrotypes and stereotypes. </para>

                        <para>- The matrices leave only a small amount of work to be done in stereotyping. A satisfactory protective duty will cause the whole of the work to be done here. Under the present fixed duty very few stereotypes and electrotypes&#39; will find their way into the Commonwealth, and I hope that the duty I now propose will stop the importation of these cheap moulds. When the 1902 Tariff was introduced I understand that a similar proposal was operative for a short while. Much of the matter contained in the <inline font-style="italic">Review of Reviews,</inline> which has a. fairly large circulation in Australia, was up to then printed from casts or stereotypes made from imported moulds, but when the duty was imposed those moulds ceased to come in, and from that time to the present the work in that office has been done by Australian workmen, from matter set up by linotype or monoline machines or by hand. For uniformity, if for no other reason, the freetrade members of the Committee ought to agree to my request, which not merely comes from the artisans and . printers, but&#39; is also approved of by the employing printers of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- That is the first I have heard of that undertaking, although I have gone through my divisions carefully to ascertain if any such arrangements existed. When the honorable senator referred to item 187, it struck me that there was a substantial difference in that case, because it covers stereotypes and electrotypes &#34; for advertising purposes.&#34; I suppose that printers&#39; matrices might be brought into the Commonwealth to set up a book that had been printed abroad, and have nothing to do with advertisements at all. Of course they might come in as advertisements. If they were brought in for the purpose of printing in the Commonwealth a book that had been printed abroad it is obvious that they would not come in as single matrices. In regard to advertisements it is plain that the bulk of the matter imported would not be very large, but, on the other hand, the greater parti of the matter brought in for magazines, books, and literary purposes would be very bulky, and the duties of 30 and 25 per cent. would have some appreciable operation on them. </para>

                    The matrices referred to are really taken from type, and are sent here so that stereotypes may be made from them in order that books or other matter may be printed from those stereotypes. No doubt if these matrices come in it tells somewhat against the printers, because the whole of the work of&#39; the setting of the type is done abroad.

                    <para>- At present I am assuming nothing of the sort. The object of importing matrices is to save the setting up of type here. I do not see exactly how the value of the matrices is to be fixed in the way proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> because matrices of 12 inches square or less need not necessarily be of anything like the same value. The duty on matter set up in the larger type might be as much as the setting up is worth, but matter set up in the smaller type would be of greater value so far as the printer&#39;s labour is concerned. There is a great deal of difficulty in connexion with this proposal. I do not know that there is much need for such an alteration as is suggested. I am not aware that matrices are being sent here at the present time, and at any rate I have not heard of it in the course of business. After all, considering the type printing machines we possess, the value of the matrices is not very great. I think we might let the duty stand as it is. </para>

                        <para>- I will deal with that. Since the alteration of duty was made in another place there is no doubt that news printing inks have been so invoiced that not even an expert could tell the correct value of some of the inks invoiced between 6d. and1s. 6d. a lb. They could not tell whether the price was correct if invoiced at 6d., or incorrect if invoiced at1s. It is only after the work has been completed that one can really judge the quality of a particular ink, and give an approximate estimate of its value. That much harm is done by the alteration made elsewhere is evidencedby the fact that a considerable amount of dumping is being carried on by the makers of various kinds of ink, particularly throughout Great Bri tain. I hold in my hand an invoice giving the price of jobbing black ink at 7&#189;d. per lb. Nothing would be easier than for the makers to invoice that ink at 6d. per lb. </para>

                        <para>- They are not likely to do that, because that would be a bit below the mark. We find printers&#39; blue ink invoiced at1s. 3d., and ultramarine ink invoiced at1s.

                        <para>- Because the inks on which the honorable senator proposes to levy a duty of 30 per cent. are those with which newspapers are printed, but all inks which are valued atmove than 3d. per. lb. are to be brought under the previous item, which imposes a duty of6&#189;d. per lb. For instance, inks which were valued at from 4d. to 6d. per lb. will fall under item 358, which deals also with &#34; Inks, n.e.i., and be dutiable at 6&#189;d. The duty will range from 100 to nearly 200 per cent. on the value of the ink. I am afraid that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> does not quite understand the effect of his request. He says that his sole object is to prevent the fraudulent manipulation of invoices, but I tell him that that can be carried on under his proposal. If the value is prescribed at 6d. per lb-, men who have ink valued at 7d. per lb. may be under a temptation to falsely invoice it at 6d., and it is exactly the same withmen who have ink valued at 6d. per lb. I ask the Committee to refuse to impose a duty which will equal nearly 200 per cent. on certain kinds of ink, and run down to 100 per cent. on other kinds. If a dutyof30 per cent. is not high enough, let <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> submit a straight proposition to increase the rate, and not attempt to bring news ink under item 358. </para>

                    <para>. -I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> will achieve his object sufficiently if he is content with the insertion of the word &#34; News.&#34; The intention of another place was to prevent inks which are not newspaper inks from being imported at a lower duty than they should be, and that appears to be what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> desires. I agree that the reduction&#39;  in value per &#39; lb. of the inks Which are to come in at that duty will not avail anything where the exporters or importers are dishonest. . If, however, the word &#34; News &#34; is inserted before the words &#34; Printing Ink,&#34; the importers will have to make a declaration, and should they declare falsely they will be liable to a prosecution for perjury. I do not know whether the package provision ought not to be insisted upon in order to secure the wholesale instead of retail packing of the article. </para>

                    <para>. - Iamglad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has agreed to alter the wording of his request. I do not think that the use of the word &#34; News &#34; is material, but I shall not object to its insertion. The difference between news ink and jobbing ink is only a question of quality. There is nothing to prevent news ink from being used for jobbing work. It would be very difficult to get a country printer to declare that ink which is being sent to him for news ink primarily wouldnever be used on a rough poster. The main thing which determines the character of any ink is the package in which it is imported, and ink primarily intended and used for newspaper work comes out in . large packages. Jobbing inks are exported in small packages. If the words &#34;one cwt.&#34; are inserted the honorable senator will secure the object which he has in view, even withoutthe insertion of the word &#34; News.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- How can we expect a country printer, to clean up his rollers, and get out a new variety of ink in order to strike off a few posters which are wanted in a hurry? The declaration to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has referred is most necessary I admit; but I fear that it would lead to a crop of perjury cases. People would be declaring that they were importingink for newspaper purposes., and hardly a day would pass by without a lie being given to the declaration, made, perhaps, in pure forgetfulness. Country printers certainly wouldnot clean up their rollers merely to print posters or dodgers or anything wanted in a hurry, and a great deal of the work which is done in country offices is required hurriedly in connexion withtravelling shows. It isridiculous to suppose that they would clean the rollers, carefully put away the ink in respect of which declarations have been made, and get out new ink in order to do work required in a hurry. </para>

                    <para>. - &#34; News&#34; ink is a very wellunderstood term. It does not mean ink that is used solely for the purpose of printing newspapers. It is a term applied to a quality of ink which the proprietors of small&#39; newspapers can purchase cheaply, and which they can use in the printing of posters as well as of their newspapers. If we were to describe this ink as &#34; newspaper &#34; ink, with the condition that it was only to be used for the printing of newspapers, the position would be very different. But &#34;news &#34; ink is merely descriptive of a quality of ink. </para>

I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> when circulating his list of requests, intended to move this. He was probably influenced to some extent by a letter which, I suppose, in common with other honorable senators, he received during the day. I was aware that there had been some considerable conflict of opinion in another place with respect to the duties to be imposed on this and the previous item. I knew that the matter had been dealt with by the Tariff Commission, after listening to a great deal of evidence pro and con. Certain representations were made to the Government with respect to the duties which should be imposed in connexion with these two items, but other representations were made by master printers in other parts of the Commonwealth, and it was precisely because it was impossible at this stage to get the opinion of master printers in other parts of the Commonwealth in reply to the representations in the letter received to-day, that I determined to take no notice of &#39;. the latter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> proposes that item 359 should read - . </para>

                        <para>- That may be, but, as a matter of fact, item 358 was passed in another place as it stands in the schedule on the distinct understanding that item 359 would be altered from the form in which it was first introduced to the form in which it now appears. One strong argument put forward for the adoption of that course was that item 359, as originally introduced, would be manifestly unfair to  persons who wished to use ink which would be invoiced at from 3d. to 6d., and would also prejudice the proprietors of country printing offices who did jobbing work as well as the publication of newspapers. Until <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> spoke just now, I was under the impression that &#34; news &#34; printing ink was ink used solely in the-, printing of newspapers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> has explained that &#34;news&#34; printing ink has a definite trade acceptation, and is merely ink of inferior quality, the use of which is not confined solely to the printing of newspapers. In view of that explanation, and as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has altered his original proposal from 3d. to <inline font-style="italic">66..,</inline> I see no objection to the restoration of the word &#34;news.&#34; But I must say that at first the request came rather as a surprise to me.

                        <para>- Of course we can, but if new and artistic patterns are prepared elsewhere, our manufacturers will be debarred their use unless they are prepared to pay duty upon them. The Government seem to have gone mad in submitting proposals for an insane preference; which amounts to nothing. A dutyof 5 per cent, would not keep out artistic patterns produced in countries other than the United Kingdom if they were approved by the public taste, and our manufacturers should be in a position to obtain the most artistic patterns produced in any part of the world so that their goods may be made as attractive as pottery manufactured elsewhere. For these reasons, it is altogether inadvisable that the proposed preference should be agreed to, when its only effect will be to impose an unnecessary tax upon the people who will be called upon to pay the duty. </para>

                <para class="block">My object is subsequently to move requests asking the House of Representatives to make the duty1&#189;d. under the general Tariff and1d. on imports from the United Kingdom. This may appear to be a some-  what insignificant matter, but it is most important to those who have made any inquiries into it. The owners of a few London periodicals, which have no literary pretensions&#39; whatever, give away these paper patterns gratis with their periodicals. Sometimes *as many as three or four separate patterns are given away with a twopenny journal. I, have here a sample of high-class work done in Australia by Australian hands. Besides those engaged in the trade of making the patterns, a large amount of employment is given to sten.cillers, printers, and artistic designers. Those engaged in the trade of making patterns for women&#39;s apparel, find that the free patterns given away by British periodicals compete seriously with them. It is unnecessary to impress upon the Committee the need for supporting those who have already started , the industry here, by giving them a reasonable degree of protection against the unfair form of competition with which they have been struggling. </para>

                        <para>- Very well. I will withdraw all phrases and let the proposal stand on its own merits or demerits, whatever &#39;they may be, but no proposal has yet been made which will serve outside this Chamber as a better illustration of the spirit which pervades the Tariff as a whole. The paper patterns referred to . are&#39; used by nearly every woman in Australia. We are to impose taxation of an absurd character upon the women of Australia because, perhaps, half-a-dozen women or girls are getting a small amount of employment. </para>

                        <para>- I suppose they reproduce patterns which have been created in the great fashion centres of the world. The majority of Australian women get in  the course of the year a number of patterns, and a proposal&#39; to tax them in this absurd fashion for the sake of a few people&#39; will surely not commend itself to the judgment of the Committee.  We have sought in various ways in dealing with the Tariff&#34; to lower - taxation wherever possible &#39;on the women of Australia.&#34; I understand- that a special reduction was made in the&#39; case of gloves. I hope we shall not take the step now suggested, because if we do. we shall put ourselves in a position which you, sir, would not allow me fully to describe. </para>

                <para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator FINDLEY</inline> (Victoria) &#91;4.&#39;24T.- Some honorable senators are under the impression that this is&#39; a  small matter which should not engage the serious attention of the Committee, but from a protectionist point of view it is very important. There are in this State, as well as in two or three others, industries that have been created in this particular line, giving employment to a considerable number of women. It is a very nice line of occupation, but the industry is now, and has been for some time, seriously threatened by the manifestly unfair competition of those engaged in similar work abroad. </para>

The publishers, as they receive an advantage from the pattern people, are only too glad to put the patterns inside their periodicals. </para>

The main complaint of those engaged in making patterns was that they had to pay  15  per cent. upon the paper which they used, and it was suggested that that should be made free. Some of the manufacturers said it would satisfy them if that were done. One witness, a dealer in art needlework and paper patterns in Sydney, objected to the imposition of a duty upon paper patterns on the grounds that - </para>

                <para class="block">It must be apparent that these articles are used practically as tools of trade by many persons. There has hitherto been no duty upon them while their manufacturers have been paying  15  per cent. on their raw material. Considering that the finished articles are used for the purposes of other industries, and that the manufacturers have in the past been subjected to a duty of  15  per cent. on their raw material, while they have had no protection against competing patterns coming from abroad, they&#39; are surely in a very much better position now with the  15  per cent. duty removed from their raw material, and a  5  per cent. duty imposed on completed patterns coming from foreign countries. I hope the Committee will see the wisdom of adhering to the duties as they stand. If honorable senators refer back to item  356,  paragraph  bb,  they will notice that copying, tissue, and tissue cap paper, and paper for paper patterns are now free. They have been relieved of the  15  per cent. duty, and although paper patterns come in freely from Great Britain, as before, they do not come in freely from abroad. As to the necessity of these papers for pattern purposes, the position is, I think, a much improved one for the paper pattern manufacturers, and conserves the interests of other workers who are interested. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope the Committee will follow the advice given by the Minister, of Home Affairs. If there are any goods which should be admitted duty free, they are those which come under this item. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> stated that the patterns imported, are surplus patterns, I- really think he knew that his statement was .inaccurate.  His  experience must teach him that in. all publications the greater the circulation the more valuable the production is. These patterns are published by hundreds of thousands, and distributed throughout the civilized world. Artists of the very highest class, receiving large salaries, are engaged to produce them, and I venture to say that, with the limited circulation in Australia, they could not be produced at a cost of less than about ten .times the price at which people are at present enabled to buy them. There is scarcely a home in Australia the wives and daughters of which do not receive a benefit from having these patterns placed within their reach at a nominal price, and to impose such a duty as is proposed on such articles, the value of which is inestimable, is absurd. Local publishers are not in a .position to give the same value as regards artistic work of this kind as the publishers of London and Paris, who employ the best artists. </para>

Perhaps the honorable senator will be able to explain what steel rails have to do with patterns, when I have done. I can only say that if this item were one pertaining to Western Australia, I am sure- my honorable friend would jump to the rescue of the Minister of Home Affairs at once. But he indicates that he is going to support a duty on an article which goes into the home of every woman in Australia, and is valuable to her in regard to her home affairs. It is proposed to put a duty on a large number of artistic newspapers, which the ladies and women of Australia know the value of. </para>

Some honorable senators, when they find they have no evidence to back up then arguments, immediately fly to some single instance that has nothing to do with the subject under discussion. If the mover of the request had as much evidence before him on this matter as I and &#39; other honorable senators had in favour of the duty on steel rails, I venture to say he would not have made such a foolish proposition as to put a tax on these patterns ; and not only that, but to indirectly increase &#39;the cost of the magazines which import the patterns. I hope, that considering all sides of the case, the Committee will support the Government. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not know what relation the duty proposed bears to the value of the article, and, possibly, the duty indicated may be somewhat high. At the same time, I must certainly dissent from the view that our own people cannot design these patterns. We have been told that they would simply pirate what has been done in other countries. I think we should encourage the artistic faculties of our people. 1 have shown to the Committee some postcards produced in Australia, and I have never seen them surpassed, and rarely equalled. There is a 30 per cent. duty on postcards now, . which has encouraged the artist to get them out. If we. do not make a start in encouraging our people we shall not attain to anything like perfection. The duty proposed may be somewhat, high, but if the mover were to&#39; modify it I think <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Committee might support him. At any rate, I willvote for his request. </para>

There are a number of penholders of bone, metal, and wood, all priced at1d. I desire to make bone and metal holders duty free. They are clean and wholesome. The youngsters cannot chew them, and thus there are no chewed ends to be-, come the medium of infection. Here is a school pencil with a metal protector for its top. It is used in every public school. It seems to me that after we have been freeing school requisities, it would be preposterous to charge a duty on these small items. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable senatorpractically proposes to leave, as the only pens and penholders that will be dutiable, those which are manufactured wholly or partly of gold or silver. I have  no objection to that object being achieved, but I draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that I have given notice of a series of requests for the insertion of new paragraphs, ranging from  d  to 1, in item 364, for the purpose of transferring to that item articles which appear elsewhere in the schedule. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> will refrain from pressing his request just now, I shall be agreeable to  allow him, without specifically mentioning &#34;bone&#34; or &#34; wood,&#34; to move a request practically stating that all penholders except those made partly or wholly of gold or silver shall be free. If .we make a request for the insertion of a new paragraph - j- that will cover everything which he desires to achieve. The intermediate paragraphs, in respect of which I propose to move requests, are a little complicated, as honorable senators will observe if they will read them, but they are required in order to validate practices which have taken place up to the present time. </para>

                        <para>- New paragraph  f  will include pencils of wood with metal, rubber, or other attachments. At the present time, they are being charged as fancy goods, under item 326 ; but, under the new paragraph, they will be admitted free from the United Kingdom, and at 5 per cent, from other countries. That will cover pencils. So far as pens are concerned, I shall be agreeable to make free all except those which are made wholly or partly of gold or silver. </para>

                    LEDGER (Queensland) &#91;4.56J. - I should like to know what is- the Minister&#39;s idea of a fancy pencil. I suppose that it is one which takes a man&#39;s fancy. &#34;Fancy pencils&#34; will be an extraordinary working phrase. We are really asked to impose  a duty without underStanding what articles will be covered by the phrase, or how the Department can possibly interpret what it is meant to cover. I suggest to the Minister that he should not press the request for the insertion of this new paragraph  e,  but should deal with the matter in new paragraph  g  by adding the words &#34; Fancy Cases made wholly or partly of gold, silver, aluminium, or nickel.&#34; That is, I think, the common or trade definition of a fancy pencil or pencil case. A very large number of the pencils which are. used are really pencil cases, because they can be folded and put in one&#39;s pocket. Some of them are made of wood, and these probably will be taxed at 5 per cent, when imported from foreign countries, and admitted free from Great Britain. But a fancy pencil might be made of any kind of material. If we fail to define what we mean by &#34; Fancy Pencils,&#34; it will be very hard for the Department to interpret the words.

                        <para>. - Although to some of ais it may appear rather difficult to define a &#34;fancy&#34; pencil, it is such a pencil as would ordinarily be regarded by the trade as coming within the category of &#34; fancy goods,&#34; and there has been very little dispute between the Customs authorities and the trade as to the goods which come within that general designation. I point out further that to accept the honorable senator&#39;s suggestion, to include these goods in&#39; paragraph  g  would not effect one of the purposes I have mentioned for moving my request, . namely, the validation of the&#39; collection of duty that has  hitherto taken place under the Tariff. If it were not necessary to validate the collection of duty on these articles at 35 per cent., I should be prepared to fall in with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger&#39;s suggestion. </para>

I take it that any man who wishes to have a gold penr.il - to hang on his watch chain - should be prepared to pay a reasonable duty on it; but the ordinary fancy folding pencil cases which many of us like to have should not be dutiable at so high a rate. I am afraid that notwithstanding the Minister&#39;s expressed intention, unless we are very careful, the Customs officers may depend upon the letter of the law, and impose higher duties on these goods than honorable senators generally believe they should bear.

I have pointed out that the; request I have submitted proposes a bodily transfer of these articles from the very comprehensive item 32 7  a  under which they would be dutiable at 30 and 25 per cent. , and under which those . duties have already been collected upon them. These requests are being made in; order that any one may readily see the duties imposed on these articles. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger considers the other allied items in conjunction with the request which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> intends to propose, and which I have agreed to support, he will see that it is not at all likely that duties of 30 and 25 per cent, will be charged on the cheaper kinds of pencil cases. I think also that it would be wise not to specifically set out the materials of these goods, as by so. doing it is possible we might omit one or two which ought to be mentioned. </para>

There was a necessity in the previous item for making some differentiation between the maps ofAustralia and of other countries, because there is at present being very extensively used in all the States of the Commonwealth a recently-issued map of Australia- </para>

                    <para>. - Is there any objection to using the English term for licht-pausrohpapier? It means light tracing paper unprepared. It is brought in, sensitized in Australia, and used for the purpose of reproducing architects&#39; and engineers&#39; plans by a very simple process known as heliographing. This paper is also imported prepared and ready for use-. In that state it is called &#34; Licht-paus-  papier,&#34; the syllable &#34;roh&#34; meaning raw, or unprepared.. Under the old Tariff the prepared paper paid 15 per cent. duty, and the unprepared came in free. The Minister proposes now to allow the unprepared paper free, but a duty of 30 per cent. is imposed in this schedule upon the prepared or sensitized paper. I wish to ask the Committee to approve of a lower duty on the prepared article. As the Tariff reached us there was a full difference of 25 per cent. between the unprepared and the prepared, because this paper comes from Germany. The duty which the Minister now asks us to take off is a purely revenue one on a German production. Having taken off that 5 per cent., and allowed free the raw material for the one individual in Australia who is engaged in sensitizing this formof paper, we may reasonably reduce the duty upon the prepared article. </para>

                        <para>- It might just as well be dealt with here under the paper division. If the Minister will agree to a duty of 20 per cent. upon the prepared paper, it will be a great concession to the large number of draughtsmen and engineers who use it. I think I am correct in saying that there is only one man in the Commonwealth who is attempting to sensitize licht-pausrohpapier. There is a difference of 25 per cent. between the prepared and unprepared paper. If we make this itemfree, assuming the duty on item 410 is carried at 30 per cent., there will be a difference of 30 per cent. instead of 25 per cent. </para>

I do not know one paperfrom another, but the honorable senator can lookat the sample I have if he likes. By meansof these&#39; papers draughtsmen&#39;s plans  are  produced. They are known as helios. They are not photographic papers in the ordinarysense. The method is to place plans on the papers and to expose them to the sun&#39;s rays, but they cannot be used for photographic purposes. </para>

As I have stated; the paper is not used for the purpose of taking an ordinary photographic landscape or subject, but is used for a photographic or sun-print process by which replicas of plans and designs are taken. </para>

                <para class="block">I wish to point out that, at the outset, in another place, as honorable senators are aware, a heavy specific duty was proposed to be imposed on bicycles imported into the Commonwealth. In the discussion that took place elsewhere, it was considered that a general Tariff of 35 per cent. <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> with a preference of 30 per cent., was very reasonable protection, but since the specific duties ceased to operate, and the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties have been operative, it has been found that in actual practice, while another place was dealing with the whole completed bicycle, and taking that as the article in respect of which the duty was to be imposed, as a matter of fact the only articles made here to any extent are bicycle frames and forks.Provision is made in the Tariff for the admission, at a very low rate of duty, or free, of most of the parts of bicycles for assembling here. The duties of 35 and 30 per cent., which are supposed to operate as a duty against the completed bicycle, are absolutely inoperative in that regard altogether, because completed bicycles are not imported. On the other hand, the frames and forks are imported. Frames and forks are also made very largely in the Commonwealth, and form the basis of an industry for what is called the manufacture of bicycles from locally-made frames and forks and imported parts. </para>

                        <para>- No; because so many of the parts come in free. Pretty well everything but the small leather bags will come in free. Inquiry has shown that the reduction of the duties on the frames would have a very injurious effect on the local industry, and that it would be more profitable to build bicycles here from imported and ready-made frames and forks. The invoiced prices of frames and forks range from10s. to  15s.  for the cheapest, up to  30s.  for the dearest. </para>

                        <para>- I think so. The object is to encourage the local making ot frames and forks - a thing which is very desirable. If we can conserve the local making of the frames and forks - what is really the most essential part of a bicycle so far as strength and durability are concerned - practically all the other parts will come in at a lower rata or free, and give a considerable amount of employment to those who are concerned in making the frames. Other parts, some of which are patented, will come in at lower rates, or, in some instances, free from the United Kingdom. I hope that the Committee will see its way to concur in the request, because, as a duty on completed bicycles, it is really inoperative. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister has made rather a&#39; startling proposition. Quite apart from the heavy duty which he proposes to levy on the frames and forks, he is asking the Committee to agree to the same duty being charged on a part of a machine ason the machine itself. It is quite true that under the old Tariff occupation was given to a number of persons in importing parts and putting them together here, but there was a reason for that, as my honorable friend will discover if he makes inquiry. He is seeking to destroy that reason, because any one outside could send in a machine for exactly the same duty- as would be charged if it were sent in in parts. When a frame will pay as much duty as a machine, what inducement will there be for any one to bring out the parts? A machine will pay only  25s.  or  20s.  whether it is imported inparts or complete. That does not appear to be good policy, even from the protectionist stand-point. </para>

                        <para>- The item covers bicycles, tricycles, and similar vehicles and frames. A duty of 25s. on a frame which the Minister says is imported at a cost of 10s., represents a duty of 250 per cent. It is really anomalous to have completed bicycles and parts dealt with in one item. In the case of the timber division, we did not deal with vehicles and parts in that way. but separately. Here, for some reason or other, it is sought to group one portion of the machines with the completed machines. Do protectionists mean to say that they seriously want a duty of 250 per cent. on any article? Are they going to admit that our conditions are so far behind those prevailing elsewhere that our manufacturers cannot hope to carry on the industry unless they have a duty equal to 250 per cent., unless we levy a duty of 25s. on an article which can be landed here from the other side of the world for 10s. ? I think that the Minister has had this request placed in his hands by persons who have not seen the effect of their own argument. Is it to be supposed that frames will be made here, if they cost <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2,</inline> when they could be imported at the low price which the Minister has stated ? I am inclined to think that the Minister has been misinformed bv his advisers. </para>

Under the old Tariff complete bicycles were dutiable at 20 per cent., and the importers introduced machines that were invoiced at from &#163;3 to &#163;5. Since the new Tariff has been introduced, with the exception of frames and forks, all parts of bicycles have been duty free.

                        <para>- That is a manifestly unfair way of putting if. So far as these people have had their &#34; cut in &#34; they have demonstrated that they can put bicycles together and turn them out as well as any imported &#39; article. They import! certain necessary parts that are not made here, but the machines they turn out give as much satisfaction as do imported bicycles, and their prices are as reasonable as are those of the people with whom they are competing </para>

                        <para>- That is so. Some of the big foreign factories are indebted&#39; to other people for certain parts of the bicycles they turn out. I admit that it is difficult to secure for the manufacturers of bicycles a truly protective duty because of certain attempts on the part of importers to take advantage of the Tariff. The request now submitted proposes an improvement upon  the Tariff as it originally reached the Senate, and I hope it will- be&#34; supported. </para>

                    <para>. - I sincerely hope that the Committee will not agree to the request. I can assure honorable senators that there was no duty in the Tariff as originally proposed which created more- surprise in . the Old Country than that on bicycles. &#39; It was referred to, I believe,- in every newspaper published in the United Kingdom, and the alteration of the duty to 30 per. cent, <inline font-style="italic">&#39;ad valorem</inline> was accepted as some sort of . a reasonable compromise. If honorable senators will give the matter attention they must see that 30 per cent., with 10 per cent, on the English price added, or a duty of 33 per cent, should be sufficient protection for any local industry. Honorable senators must,- if they look into the matter, admit how very important it is to the workers in the interior of Australia who have to travel vast distances that they should be able to get a good bicycle at .a fair price. </para>

                        <para>- I suppose there is no country in the world1 in which it is so desirable that bicycles should be available at a moderate price. I do npt think there can be any doubt that if the views of the users of bicycles, and their name is legion, could be ascertained, they would be found to be in favour of a reduction of the duty of. 30 per cent, rather than of an increase on that duty. There is another point of view from which this matter might be considered. There is such a large demand for bicycles that desirable material of which they can be made should be imported at  as low a rate of duty as possible. We are doing our utmost to establish a large bicycle manufacturing industry here by admitting bicycle parts at a moderate rate of duty. Personally, I would say at once that bicycles should be admitted absolutely free of duty, because of the extent - to which they are used, but&#39;, having in view the desirability of cheap bicycles, and the amount of work which the industry affords at the present time, I do not think there can be any solid basis on which to prefer this request. Although I am but repeating what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has already so ably said, I think we should give some attention to the fact that the specific duty asked for represents an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty of quite an extraordinary amount. Even the most ardent protectionist might well be asked to pause before he inflicts such a duty upon this industry. I suppose that every member of the Committee has been supplied with th&#39;e circular from which the Minister has already quoted. I find that amongst other things, it states - </para>

                <para class="block">It was afterwards said that the price runs up to 30s. The circular goes on to inform us that the frames and forks, which cost in Birmingham ios. and 15s. complete, cost from 35s. to 40s. to produce in Australia. In the- name of common sense, and on behalf of the tens of -thousands of men throughout the length and breadth of Australia who use bicycles, I ask whether it is desirable that we should increase the cost of &#34; these machines at this extraordinary rate ? I point out that when an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate is imposed, and includes both the completed article and Darts. that is a fair adjustment, but where a&#39; specific, duty is imposed on parts and on the completed article, it is an unfair duty, even from the protectionist point of view-. However honorable senators choose to look at this matter, I think they cannot but desire that the Minister should withdraw his request. </para>

                    <para>. - At first glance there does seem to be some force in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> &#39;s argument that the imposition of the same duty on parts as on the completed article must &#34;have the effect of discouraging the&#39; assembling of the parts here, and lead to the importation of the completed bicycle. However, &#39; I think that, after all, it can be shown that that is not necessarily the result. Whilst it is. proposed to impose a duty on forks and frames, the great bulk of the parts of bicycles are admitted free, and the effect is to induce people to assemble the parts in the. Commonwealth rather, than to . import the completed machine. The allegation that this duty represents an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty of 250 per cent. is not well founded&#39;. The duty is undoubtedly very high on the&#39; cheaper frames, but these cheaper frames would probably be made here even if the duty were lowered. We can make the cheaper frames and forks, but people sometimes require very high-class forks and frames, which we do not make here, and it seems to me that the duty on these should be comparatively light. I believe that if our people require something which we cannot make here, they should be permitted to obtain it without having to pay a tax, and, in the case of an article which we cannot make, a duty is obviously a tax. With reference to the increased cost which it is said we have to dread if duties are imposed, I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> that since duties were imposed on these articles, and since the commencement of the partial manufacture of bicycles in Australia, these machines have gone up in quality and down in price very materially. The honorable senator probably knows that in the early history of the bicycle, when, probably, the cost of manufacture was very little more than it is to-day, the price was three times as high as it is how. </para>

                        <para>- I know as a matter of fact that it is possible to pay. a very much higher price for bicycle frames produced in Australia than that for which they can be produced abroad, and . still supply to the consumer a cheaper bicycle than the imported article. All our experience teaches that protection to the locallymade article - and consequently to bicycle frames - makes it impossible for the importer to charge the fancy prices which he is able to charge where there is no local . competition. I firmly believe that the effect of this duty, high though it may be, and is, on the lower class of frames, will be to give employment to our people, and at the same time enable those who use bicycles in the bush or elsewhere to procure a more reliable and cheaper machine than they could get if we imposed no duty, and thus left them open to the exploitation of the importers.  <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. RUSSELL (Victoria) &#91;6.15&#93;. - There seemsto be some idea in the minds of honorable senators opposite that it is a little ridiculous to charge the same duty on&#39; parts of bicycles as on the completed machine.

                        <para>- The difference in wages cannot be so much as the difference between ios. and 40s., because the labour  is not in . it. Even if the English workmen Worked for nothing, and the English manufacturer got his material for nothing, a 1 os. duty would be ample.  I  have no desire to delay the completion of the Tariff or to keep this Chamber sitting, but when a startling proposition of this kind is brought forward honorable senators cannot be expected to allow it -to go to a division in silence. The duty proposed is outrageous. No difference in labour conditions can. make up the difference between the value of ios. and the duty of 25s. This is the one portion of the machine which a few people in Australia are making, and, no matter what the cost will be to the men who have to use the! machines, we are asked now. practically to prohibit the introduction of these frames and forks in order to enable  a few people to make here at a cost of 40s. that which can be imported for ios. </para>

                        <para>- But, as the bicycle is admitted free, barring the frame and forks, so long as it comes in in parts, that argument does not apply. In order that the frames shall be made here, to give employment to a handful of people - not even a handful - we are asked to put a tax upon the thousands of people who use bicycles, because it .cannot be contended that this; duty will lower prices. Its effect must be to increase them, because the local manufacturers have told us, by means of their circular, that it costs them from  35s. to 40s. to make this particular portion of the machine, which is to-day imported for ios. or upwards. </para>

                        <para>-I am quoting the statement of the person who calls himself the secretary to the conference of representatives of employers and employes engaged in the trade. The honorable senator may rest assured that those people have not put forward anything except in the light most favorable to themselves. They complain that they have to compete with a frame sent out from the Old Country at as low a price as ios., and that it costs them from 35s. to 40s. to produce a frame. If they are honest in making this statement - if it is not a deliberate lie - it is clear that the duty cannot lower, but must raise, the price of the completed bicycle. Therefore, whatever may be the effect of duties in other cases, it will in this case&#39; be an additional impost upon every man who buys a bicycle. The bicycle is met with with increasing frequency in country districts. It is used by men travelling to look for a livelihood, where, twenty years ago, horses were used. In those days, it was easier to find free agistment for the horse. To-day, with country becoming enclosed and fenced, a man has to pay nightly for accommodation for his horse when travelling, and even then has difficulty in getting it. The consequence is that the bicycle is largely taking the place of the horse in that direction, and also in a hundred other ways in the business life of the community. It is obvious, on the showing of the man who speaks for those interested in the trade, that the duty will increase the price of the bicycle out of all proportion to the benefit which will be conferred upon the small handful of people engaged in the trade. </para>

The Tariff Commission, after taking evidence, recommended a duty of  &#163;55sper  bicycle. That would have had the effect of absolutely shutting out cheap and unsuitable bicycles. If I cannot get a higher duty, I shall cheerfully support that proposed by the Minister, because it will have a tendency to shut out the cheap unreliable machines, which have been responsible for hundreds of accidents and a good many deaths.

The Minister&#39;s request, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell&#39;s amendment&#39;, will have the effect of partially but not wholly shutting out the Canadian bicycles, because the Massey-Harris factory in Canada turns out such immense numbers of machines that it will pay them to ship their surplus stock to Australia rather than to build the machines in Australia, even with the duty proposed. </para>

It does not seem right to tax the parts at the same rate as the complete bicycle. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J.&#39; Russell&#39;s proposal will not make it any better, because the duty of 25s.. on the frames and forks will nearly always be more than 30 per cent.

To charge such extraordinary duties as 25 per cent. and 20 per cent. on children&#39;s toys seems to me to savour of more than extravagance. The previous duty was 20 per cent., but even that I considered an extortion, and protested against it. I think it my duty to move a request to the House of Representatives to make the duty in the general Tariff 20 per cent. I do not think I should accomplish any good purpose by speaking at length on the matter. The  request is one which must surely appeal to every one who has a child in his house, orhopes to have one. These tricycles are toys, and the duty, in my opinion, is far too high. I move -

                    <para>. - As far as the United Kingdom is concerned,&#39; the duty is the same as was the general duty originally. The reason for placing a duty of. 25 per cent. on tricycles imported from other countries is simply to retain the rate of duty against the United Kingdom at 20 per cent., and to give her a preference over foreign countries. When the item originally came before the House of Representatives it dealt with &#34;children&#39;s bicycles,&#34; but it was not very long before certain importers prepared to take advantage of the item by trying to introduce into the Commonwealth under it bicycles ostensibly for the use of children, but really for verv grown-up children. Therefore, it was altered to its present description. The duty of 25 per cent. on general imports has been put in to give Great Britain a preference. I will follow the excellent example of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> and leave the question to the Committee. </para>

The duties, as originally introduced, were general Tariff, each&#163;10 10s., or ad val. 30 per cent, and United Kingdom Tariff, each &#163;10, or ad . val. 25 per cent. Those duties were afterwards altered by the House of Representatives to the existing&#39; duties of 30 and 25 per cent., but, in doing so, and in transmitting the measure to the Senate, an omission occurred, and the original duties do not appear in the schedule. It is necessary, in order to validate the collection of the duties up to the time they ceased to operate, to restore them in the schedule. Honorable senators will understand that they are simply validating the operation of the &#34;original duties up to the time they ceased to be operative. I move - </para>

                        <para>- No ; but they may import the bodies, other parts, and under - gear. This alteration is necessary to remove an anomaly in the incidence of the Tariff on British goods. Under the present wording of items 376 and 377, . complete undergears from America are imported at ao per cent., whereas British undergears, being minus the springs, are dutiable at 25 per cent., as &#34; parts thereof,&#34; under item 376. We are really penalizing the English undergear because it is charged duty under item 376, and giving preference to the American article, which comes in as a complete undergear under item 377. I understand that the present practice of the trade is to have the springs of go-carts manufactured locally, but the wheels and the axles are imported from England, and complete undergears for perambulators are obtained from America, so that the preference to the English manufacturer desired to be given by item 377 cannot operate. As a matter of fact, instead of it operating, the contrary is the case. I hope that honorable senators will see the advisableness of transposing the words in the way I have proposed. </para>

                    <para>.- I understand that the Minister wants to give the protection which the manufacturers of these articles desire. On this occasion the requests do not come from Victorian, but from New South Wales manufacturers. The manufacturers of the latter State point out that they can make every part of the undergear except the wheels and the axles. They mention that the undergear consists of the following parts :  - </para>

If they can make all the parts with the exception of those which I have stipulated, surely they ought to getthe same measureof protection in that regard as they do under item 376. </para>

                        <para>- I intend the term &#34; wickerwork &#34; to cover those materials. At the present time we are only considering the importation of Chinese wickerwork, which is mostly composed of cane. Here is an illustration of a perambulator body which was imported lately from China. The shipment included 150, and the selling price in Melbourne was 8s. each. I am informed on the best authority that if would take an expert wickerworkef at least a day of ten hours to produce the article, so that the labour cost of the locally-made article would be more than the wholesale price of theimported article. I am sure that it is not the desire of theCommittee to allow perambulator bodies made of this material to be treated more favorably than wicker lounges, settees, and chairs coming from the cheap-labour countries. </para>

                    <para>. - The proposal of the honorable senator will go simply as far as wickerwork, although heseems to desire that it should go beyond what is ordinarily known as wickerwork and cover other material. I do not think that it would be competent for the Customs officers to give that extensive interpretation to the term &#34; wickerwork.&#34; They would have to giveit the more limited meaning unless Parliament expressly mentioned the other materials, and I presume that the honorable senator intends it to go only so far as perambulator bodies. When the Tariff was submitted to another place the question of bodies was under consideration in connexion with item  377.  Realizing that they are mostly made of materials such as the honorable senator ;has mentioned, it was proposed to levy a specific duty of  5s. 3d.  each, but when the item was reached the Treasurer, in consequence of further consideration, put forward a substituted proposal, and that is the one which is now attached to item   377,  which imposes duties of  20  and  15  per cent. I have just moved successfully in the direction of having the bodies transferred to item  376,  in order to get the benefit of the higher duties of  30  and  25  per cent., and I hope that my honorable friend will regard that as sufficient in the circumstances. My honorable colleague, as I have said, intended to propose a high specific duty, but decided subsequently to propose an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty. It should,  I hope, satisfy <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> if we can induce the House of Representatives to make these bodies dutiable at  30  and  25  per cent. </para>

That should, to some extent, lessen the force of the claim which the honorable senator now puts forward for a specific duty. </para>

                        <para>- When we reached this item -a few minutes ago bodies of perambulators and go-carts were dutiable at  20  per cent. We have decided to request that they should be made dutiable at  30  per cent, under the general Tariff, and in proportion as we have raised the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty we have lessened any complaint which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> might feel justified in urging on behalf of those interested in the trade. The next point to which I should like to direct the attention of the honorable senator is that in none cf the circulars which have been sent to honorable senators in connexion with these matters have the manufacturers expressed the opinion that they are not quite satisfied with the measure of protection accorded by the Tariff, subject to the removal of the anomaly with which the Minister has dealt. That having been adjusted, they are perfectly satisfied. I do not for a moment say that it should be sufficient for the Committee that the manufacturers are satisfied, but there should certainly be a very strong case made out before we venture to give them a higher measure of protection than that - which they regard as sufficient. </para>

                    <para>.- I should like to ask the Minister whether any of the articles enumerated in item  378  are manufacture&#39;d in any part of the Commonwealth. If they are, does the honorable senator think that duties of  15  and  10  per cent, are protective duties? If these articles are not manufactured here, I, as a protectionist, contend that they should be admitted duty free.  The Minister can scarcely contend that these are protective duties, especially in view of the fact that as the Tariff was originally introduced, the duties proposed were  25  and.  20  per cent. </para>

With regard to some of them, the work of plating, brazing, enamelling, and permanently joining is carried on here.

                    <para>.-I am reluctant to do any thing to arrest the splendid progress which we are now making with the Tariff, but I think we have come to an item which requires a little attention. I propose to move a request for the restoration of the duties on this paragraph as originally proposed. I cannot understand how the Government came to adopt <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> instead of fixed duties on these articles. I have looked through the debate in another place, but failed to discover any reasons for the departure of the Government from their original proposal. The building of vehicles is an industry that can be carried on in almost any country town in Australia. There isvery little probability of anything in the nature of a combine or monopoly being formed in it, so that any duty that we may fix upon vehicles will be for the benefit solely of an industry that can be established in all parts of Australia. The A section of the Tariff Commission recommended fixed duties, which the Government adopted, with a little addition in order to give a preference to the Old Country. In the digest of the evidence given in the report of the protectionist section of the Commission many reasonsare stated why a fixed is very much to be preferred&#39; to. an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty. The greatest competition which our workmen have to face comes from the cheaper kinds of imported vehicles. I am no advocate of giving any advantage to the rich man, who is well able to pay a handsome price for any vehicle that he may require. I look at this question solely from the stand-point of the worker. Are we giving that amount of protection that will really protect and give additional Work to our own people? A great deal of the work which is now being sent out of the country for the building of vehicles is for the very cheapest kinds. That is the best reason for imposing a fixed duty which will undoubtedly protect and insure that the whole of the work is done in Australia. This is an industry in which Australia can supply her own requirements. We have the raw material, if any country in the world has it, for the building of all kinds of vehicles. Consequently our own requirements should be supplied by our own workmen. A very suspicious circumstance in regard to the cheaper kinds of vehicles imported, as I am informed by those in the industry, is that the majority of them bear no maker&#39;s name, which suggests that they are practically prison-made. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say that every buggy produced in Australia is all that it should be, but the honorable senator will admit that we have the raw material here, and that there is no great amount of craftsmanship required in the making of buggies that our own workmen cannot master. As we wish to make the Tariff protective, and as these articles can be made in almost any country town in Australia, we should impose a duty that will be protective beyond the shadow of a doubt. I am told &#39; that the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty now fixed is little better than a mere revenue duty. We do not want revenue duties on articles of this kind that we can make in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I have not the figures here, but looking at them recently, I noticed that they are increasing. We have, therefore, every reason for raising the duty to the level originally proposed by the Government. If we place a properly protective duty on them we shall insure that they will all be Australian made. In some of the items which we. have already dealt with we have raised the duty on the raw material of these vehicles. We have, for instance, put a duty on hubs. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie was good enough to tell me during the dinner adjournment that he intended to test the feeling of the Committee upon some of these duties. I was in a position to inform him that, owing to the action taken by the Government in another place, with a full knowledge of the circumstances, it will be impossible for us to support his proposal to revert to the fixed duties originally proposed. When the item was before another place, my colleague, following out the recommendation of the Tariff Commission, endeavoured to get fixed duties imposed upon all these vehicles. He fought very strenuously to induce the Committee of another place to agree with him, but unfortunately it was impossible to hide from ourselvesthe fact that one of the disadvantages of a fixed duty in regard to articles of this kind, which range in value to very great extremes, was that upon the cheaper articles a very high rate was imposed if it was converted into its <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> equivalent, whereas on the much dearer articles it bore very lightly. Many of these articles which have been imported are of very high cost. They are imported because they are costly, and because there is a disposition on the part of people who use them to believe that they cannot be turned out of such quality in the Commonwealth. It is desirable that the rate of duty upon such articles should be at feast as high as that imposed upon cheaper ones. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">The Government, influenced by that consideration, and by the fact that the proposition for fixed duties did not seem to be even a practicable or acceptable one for theconsideration of another place, announced through the Treasurer that they would move to substitute for those originally tabled the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rates now shown in the schedule. It was moved in regard to paragraph  a  to replace the fixed duties with <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rates of 35 per cent. (General Tariff) and 30 per cent. (United Kingdom). The Treasurer induced the Committee of another place to adopt those rates in respect of the whole of these paragraphs from  a  to  h,  including paragraph  f,  in regard to which the Government&#39;s original proposal was for rates of 30 and 20 per cent. Even those, and others subsequent, the Committee of another place, on the general understanding, raised to 35 and 30 per cent. Personally, I think 35 per cent. and 30 per cent. so far from being revenue duties, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie would suggest, taken all round on the various goods, give very fair and reasonable protection. Of course, I can quite under-&#39; stand, with the honorable senator, that there may be a few varieties of articles, in respect of which 35 per cent. or 30 per cent. may not amount to very much. But, taking the general run of the articles comprised in the paragraphs, I think any fair-minded man will admit duties of 35 per cent. and 30 per cent., or practically one-third the value of these goods, to be very reasonable protection. </para>

                        <para>- The Customs returns as to vehicles, n.e.i., for 1906 show that the value of the imports was , &#163;25,409. That must only represent the smallest fraction of the total value of the vehicles used in Australia, and, assuming that the figures are correct, the coachbuilders of Australia must have had 99 per cent. of the trade. Having an immense portion of the trade already under the lower duty, what reason can there be for increasing the duty, and adopting the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie? The places of origin of the imports were the United Kingdom, Canada, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Belgium, Germany, and the United States. The imports from Hong Kong under this item only amounted to &#163;12; so that, . if the question of the goods being manufactured in eastern countries or in gaols is raised, the whole thing comes to only&#163;12. With regard to the proposed specific duty of&#163;6 12s. on any vehicle landed in Australia under paragraph (a), by the time it was taken to the interior parts the freight would amount to as much again. To ship a vehicle from Melbourne or Sydney to Western Australia or Queensland must cost more than &#163;612s. I think the case for increasing the dutyis not very strong, and there is not the shadow of a reason for the large specific duty proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. I hope&#39; the- Government will be able to carry their proposal, because I recognise that it is hopeless to endeavour to increase the duty. </para>

                    <para>.- I cannot allow this series of duties to pass by without saying a word to indicate my sense of the high rate that already exists.I doubt very much whether some honorable senators are not losing sight to some extent of what big figures really mean. A duty of 35 per cent. General Tariff, plus one- tenth, comes to 38&#189; per cent., and a United Kingdom Tariff of 30 per cent, plus one- tenth, comes to 33 per cent. Surely such duties, on articles which - are so bulky that the freight of them of itself constitutes an enormous protection, should give our carriage-makers everything that the most ardent protectionist could desire. If I could see the shadow of a. chance of carrying anything of the sort I would propose a very material reduction. I believe that the duty under the last Tariff was only 25 per cent. and under that Tariff the vast bulk of the trade of Australia in vehicles of all kinds was undoubtedly in the hands of the Australian makers. To ask for an increase on the rates that have already been agreed upon by another place, is to verge very closely on the point of prohibition. That is practically what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie aims at; I suppose that the best thing honorable senators can do is not to waste the time of the Committee in seeking for reductions, on these rates, but quietly to submit. </para>

I am satisfied that their present attitude must be very pleasing to free-trade senators, because it means a reduction of duty. If, however, we had been invited to restore the original proposal for levying fixed duties, they would have had very much fault to find. I regret very much indeed that the Government have not seen fit to adhere to their original proposal. </para>

                    <para>. - If the duty be increased it will have a far more reaching effect than is imagined by some honorable senators who believe in protection. It will certainly encourage the local manufacture of wheels, spokes, and hubs. In Australia we have a gum known as the York gum, which is admittedly the best timber in the world for the manufacture of hubs. Undoubtedly the duty, if increased, will givean impetus to the coachbuilding trade. I remind honorable senators that exactly the same price is charged for the imported vehicle, which carries no guarantee, as for the locally-made vehicle, which is guaranteed to the purchaser. In my opinion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has submitted a reasonable request. I am surprised at the Government in so tying the hands of their representatives in the Senate that, in the light of further information which has been supplied during the consideration of the schedule, they cannot support their protectionist friends in the desire to impose an effective duty on vehicles. I sincerely hope that the request will be carried. </para>

                    <para>. - I had hoped that the recent vote would have been accepted as an indication of the sense of the Committee with regard to all articles in this item. When the fixed duty on paragraph  a  was displaced elsewhere by <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties of 35 and 30 per cent., those rates were applied to the remaining paragraphs of the. item, and even to paragraphs in respect of which the duties. originally proposed by the Government were lower than those rates. The inequality of the fixed duty became very apparent to the Government on account of the difference in quality and price of the imported articles. The imposition of different fixed duties on the various classes of vehicles led, in some instances, to confusion, and, at any rate, to claims being made that certain vehicles should come in under one head, when, properly speaking, they should come in under another head. There is one advantage in having <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties of  35  and  30  per cent. on vehicles generally, and that is that every vehicle comes in under these paragraphs at the one rate, and no dispute can arise between the importer and the Customs House. It simplifies administration. I remind honorable senators that under the old Tariff the highest duty on any of these articles was  25  per cent., and that we are now proposing duties of  35  and  30  per cent. </para>

                        desires that chilled iron wheels should be excepted from this item, in Order to improve the classification proposed. I understand on reference to the Customs authorities that what the honorable senator pro- poses would not improve the classification, and that the wheels referred to are properly included in this item, under which they are dutiable at 35 and 30 per cent.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline>
                        does not desire to reduce the duties which these articles have to bear under this item, but if they are transferred to item  170A,  Manufactures of Metals n.e.i. they will be dutiable at 25 and  20  per cent., which would be a reduction of 10 per cent. on imports whether under the General Tariff or from the United Kingdom. The honorable senator referred also to item  222,  of Division VI., which covers steel and steel rimmed wheels of over 30 inches diameter in the tread, for trucks and waggons, and which bears a duty of 5 per cent. under the General Tariff, andis freeon imports from the United Kingdom. These chilled iron wheels are a different class of wheels altogether, and the low rate of duty on steel wheels indicates that they are not manufactured in the Commonwealth. To remove chilled iron wheels from the item now under discussion would be to make them dutiable at a lower rate than is now proposed, and I therefore ask the honorable senator not to press his request. If he desires that the general reader of the Tariff should know exactly where to find these articles he should request that they may be specifically mentioned in the item. That might be done by requesting the House of Representatives to insert after the letters &#34;n.e.i.&#34; the words &#34;including chilled iron wheels&#34;; and that would not interfere with the duties now imposed on such articles.

                    (New South Wales) &#91;9.26&#93;. - I have been so occupied since I left the chair a few minutes ago in getting up a little information which I wish to put before the Committee, that I must be excused if I do not know how best to secure an amendment which I desire should be made in this paragraph of item 380. It includes axles and springs when imported separately, and I wish to direct the attention of the Minister to the desirability of fixing some materially lower rate of duty than 35 per cent. on the patent American axle known as the Timken Roller Bearing Axle. I obtained from the local agents two samples, one of a ball and one of a roller-bearing axle, which can be inspected in the corridor. I was asked by the Sydney representatives of this very valuable invention to see whether I could not obtain, in the interests of the users of axles, some reduction of the very high rate of 35 per cent.

                        <para>- I suppose that the importing firm get a&#39; commission on the business. I believe that importers generally do not transact business for philanthropic purposes, whatever manufacturers are said to do. It appears that the reduction in the draught of vehicles and waggons , to which roller-bearing axles are attached amounts to from 40 to 80 per cent., according to the grade conditions, and for heavy drawing, especially in the country, these axles would be of the greatest value. They are also used in connexion with motor cars. As the chassis for motor cars are free under the Tariff, and as these axles would be free if they came in attached to the chassis for motor cars, it -is not asking very much to request a reduction in the rate of duty on these articles when imported separately. I may point out that they are costly, and are worth from <inline font-style="italic">&#163;6</inline> up to&#163;30forasetoffourarms. I should be glad if an opportunity were afforded to enable some Government expert to inspect them, as it would be seen at once that they are exceedingly elaborate, and by no means to be included amongst ordinary axles. I believe that&#39; they are the only axles of the kind which are made at the present time. In what form would it be most convenient for me to&#39; submit a request that the duty should be left at the old rate of 15 per cent.? </para>

We have dealt with axles for motor cars, but these ball-bearing and roller-bearing axles are of the greatest use in the country for heavy loading, and I am asking for the old rate of duty. In the last Tariff I believe the axles were dutiable at 15 per cent., and I am suggesting that that rate should be imposed instead of having the very high rate we have passed on axles of a general character. </para>

I suggested to him that the best course would be to insert after &#34;Axles&#34; the letters &#34; n.e.i.&#34; so as to deal specifically with certain classes of axles in a subsequent sub-item, and then paragraph  g  of item 380 would leave the higher rate of duty operative against all axles not specifically dealt with. I suggested that when we got to paragraph j the honorable senator should move that those axles imported for the purpose of motor cars, motor lorries, and motor waggons should be dutiable at the lower rates. The present position with regard to all axles other than the ones we have lowered to 5 per cent. and free is that they remain at 35 per cent. and 30 per cent. That is the duty that will remain operative. If the honorable senator wishes to make rollerbearing and ball-bearing axles, n.e.i., dutiable at 15 per cent. and 10 per cent., I am sorry to say that I cannot go that far. I hope the Committee will adhere to the present position. </para>

                    (New South Wales) &#91;9.50&#93;. - There seems to be some misapprehension on the part of the Minister of Home Affairs. Unfortunately, he did not Catch what I said on the subject. I must say that I desired to move the request in a general way, as is shown by the following paragraph from the letter I referred  to -

                    <para>The reduction in draught of vehicles and waggons with Timken roller-bearing axles attached is from 40 per cent. to 80 per cent., according to the conditions ; and for heavy drawing, especially in the country, they will become indispensable. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">Having read that paragraph clearly, I was of the opinion that the Minister understood the position, and that I would have the opportunity later on of moving what I then mentioned - a request for the old rate of duty of 15 per cent. That the Committee assented to the importation of roller-bearing axles for motor car purposes at 5 per cent. and free shows that there was some reason for their introduction for that purpose. If they are of advantage for motor cars, surely they are of advantage to the general waggon users of the country, and as the Committee placed a duty of 35 per cent. on axles generally, I desired to have a duty of 15 per cent. on these particular axles. While the Minister objects to a duty of 15 per cent., I hope he understands that these articles are not made here. </para>

                        <para>- - I intend to move a. request to the House of Representatives to make the duty on imports under the General Tariff 20 per cent. Much as I value time at present, seeing that we are all anxious in the interests of the Commonwealth to dispose of the Tariff, I recognise that this item should be carefully considered in all its details before allowing an increase &#39;of duty upon the old rate to take place. Therefore, I shall have to ask the indulgence of the Committee for giving reasons why the old rate of duty on pianos should be adhered to. There are two aspects from which this item can be debated. The first is. to view it from a purely business aspect, as has been &#39;done with regard to the manufacture of other goods such as starch, woollens, boots, and furniture. Then I would call the attention of the Committee to the higher stand-points from which a matter of this kind must be viewed. From the protectionist&#39; stand-point, we have first to consider the terms and conditions under which&#39; this industry was established, and is carried on. I am pleased to say that in New South Wales it has been conducted in a manner which has been highly creditable to its initiators. Not only was it started there under a freetrade Tariff, but it was developed to a very large extent indeed under that policy. It has been stated, I believe, that up to the introduction of the first Federal Tariff, when a general duty was imposed, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> had been producing600 pianos per annum. When his manager was giving evidence before the Tariff Commission he did not ask for the imposition of an additional duty. He admitted that the out-&#39; put from the factory had been increasing year by year since 1900. Other evidence in the same direction was given. It is quite evident that when he began to operate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> believed that in Australia there was an opening for a pianoforte industry under conditions that were very dissimilar from those which exist to-day. He must have held the opinion that the industry could be carried on without the aid of a duty, because he could not know that Federation would become an accomplished fact, or that New South Wales would have any other fiscal policy. Seeing that the industry progressed under free-trade conditions, we may assume that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> thought that no duty was required to make it a success from the ordinary business stand-point. Under the Federation a duty of 20 per cent. was levied on pianofortes, and that also gave satisfaction to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale.</inline> Not one iota of evidence has been adduced to show that from a business aspect he needs an additional duty as a manufacturer. From the report of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, I findthat <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale&#39;s</inline> manager claimed that his instruments were equal, if not superior, to any instruments made in any other part of the world. He did not ask for an increased duty, but stated that it would be to the interests of the Commonwealth if a higher duty were imposed on pianos in order to induce foreign manufacturers to start factories here. Both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> and his representative admitted that every development which they could possibly desire was taking place in the business. The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission based their report on very shallow grounds, and &#39;with practically no evidence to support their recommendation. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Marland,</inline> of Maryborough, in Queensland, told the Tariff Commission that he employed  no hands, and desired a duty of 30 per cent. I find that equally poor evidence was given on the other side, because there was practically only one witness examined, and I do not suppose that the evidence is very reliable. I wish to deal with the cost of the imported and Australian pianos. It is a business axiom that the greater the output the larger the reduction in manufacturing expenses. Every manufacturer knows that, regardless of the output up to a certain point, his business lias to bear such charges as rent, taxes, salaries, interest, depreciation, and management. Of course, I do not include the cost of en- larging works or effecting alterations and repairs. May I be permitted, sir, to submit my request in a form different from that which I indicated at the beginning of my remarks? </para>

Honorable senators realize that the manufactured cost of any article is decreased according to the increase in the output.. We are, therefore, justified in assuming that, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale&#39;s</inline> annual output of pianos was 600 under free-trade, 1,500 under a duty of 20 per cent., and. is now between 1,700 and 1,800, the present manufacturing cost of his pianos must be very considerably less than it was when&#39; he turned out only 600 under free-trade. </para>

                        <para>- I am arguing that the manufacturing cost must be less, and I think&#39; the facts in connexion with the industry will show that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> is able to manufacture as cheaply as are manufacturers elsewhere. If he was doing well, and his business was developing under free-trade with an output of only 600 each year, it is not unreasonable to assume that he is now doing an extraordinarily good business when he is selling three times the number of pianos, and has, besides, the advantage of this very high duty. It has been stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wertheim,</inline> a very large importer of pianos, intends to manu facture these instruments in Australia. He has stated that he would be perfectly satisfied to commence the manufacture of pianos in the Commonwealth under a duty of 25 per cent. When, in addition to that statement, it is known that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale,</inline> on his own evidence, does not require any increased duty, I should like to be told what practical reason can be given for the increased duty proposed in this Tariff. When a local manufacturer is doing so well, making such large profits, and developing his business to such an extent as has been stated, and is satisfied with a duty of 25 per cent., and when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wertheim</inline> is prepared to start the manufacture of pianos in Australia under that duty, why should we tax the purchasers of pianos in Australia to the tune of 5 per cent. more to encourage an industry that is already thriving and progressing?

                <para class="block">It should be noted that these invoice prices include the following&#39;: - Manufacturing cost, case and cost of packing, all freight and other expenses of shipment to Melbourne, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale&#39;s</inline> factory profit.  His  cost prices therefore must be very much less than the figures referred to in the invoice. From corrected and departmental figures furnished by the Customs authorities, I find that in 1906, 12,263 pianos were imported at an average cost of  &#163;22  10s., which is higher than the factory cost of Beale&#39;s pianos in 1897 and 1898, notwithstanding his then limited output. The imparted pianos included a number of very cheap instruments imported by furniture shops, which tended to lower the average price of pianos in good repute imported from first-class makers. The statement has been made by Beale and Company that the cost of importing is very much less than some of the importers make out, inasmuch as freights have been as low as 5s. per ton. We know that a few years ago, owing to a freight war which sometimes exists among shipping companies, very low freights were in vogue.

                        <para>- I am treating the subject at present from a purely . business aspect, although I regard it from a very much higher stand-point. The present duty is almost prohibitive on the ordinary pianos . which the middle and working classes can buy. There is scarcely a home in Australia in which, if the man is of  sav-ing  habits, there will not be found two articles which are both absolute necessaries in their respective ways - a sewing machine and a piano. The use of the piano should be encouraged in every possible way in order to promote the .cultivation of the great gift of  harmony  which the Almighty has given to us - </para>

                <para>The average expenses connected with the importation of a piano invoiced at &#39;^20 are, as previously shown, <inline font-style="italic">&#163;8</inline> 11s. gd. per instrument. On a piano invoiced at ^35 they amount to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;9</inline> ios. gd. per instrument. That is a- natural protection, of 42 per cent, on a piano invoiced at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;20,</inline> and of 30 per cent, on a piano invoiced at ^35. </para>
                <para class="block">The present duties were only carried by one vote in another place - </para>
                <para>Only about one-tenth of the pianos imported are of British manufacture (see Customs Returns for 1906) as a considerable number of German pianos come <inline font-style="italic">vid</inline> England. Hence the duty will on nine-tenths of the imports be 30 per cent. In assessing the value for duty one-tenth is added to the invoice, price under the Customs Act, making the duty 33 per cent., and the duty is also collected on all expenses to f.o.b. at port of shipment at the same rate. This will make the duty over 35 per cent, on prime cost. Add the natural protection to the duty of 33 per cent., and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> will have a total protection on pianos invoiced at ,&#163;20 of about 77 per cent., and&#39; on those invoiced at ,&#163;35 a protection of about 65 per cent. It is safe to say that very few manufacturers receive or expect to receive such a prohibitive protection as the proposed Tariff offers to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale.</inline></para>
                <para>As for the pianoforte industry languishing, it is admitted by all manufacturers, present and prospective, that it was in a most flourishing condition under free-trade conditions and under a 20 per cent, duty, and is so under the present rates. That is proved by the profits <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> was making- under free-trade, when he was satisfied with that condition of affairs. Those profits must be very much greater now, taking into consideration the large additional output and the necessarily decreased expenses. When a manufacturer is satisfied with things as they are, and a prospective manufacturer asks for nothing more than 25 per cent., the Committee, in the interests of the public at large, should realize that any increase of duty will simply be a tax upon all those who use pianos over and above those manufactured here - </para>

                    <para>Under Federation he obtained free access to the markets of all the other States, from which he had previously been excluded by heavy duties. Aduty of 20 per cent. was imposed on all imported pianosby the first Federal Tariff, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> was thus put in a very strong position. As before shown, his output has increased from 439 pianos in the year 1897-8 to over 1,500 in the year 1905, and is still increasing. These facts demonstrate that the business is not languishing for want of a higher duty, and the duty of 30 per cent. and 25 per cent. makes the position of Beale as the holder of a monopoly sounder than ever. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Beale, in a letter written and signed by himself- </para>

Much of the charm of the music of that famous band came from the highly-trained skill of the English workmen composing the band, but much of it came also from the quality of the instruments themselves. . Musical instruments of that kind can be made in Australia, but no leading band would think of using an Australian-made instrument unless its quality had been proved to the satisfaction, not of politicians, but of the best musicians in the world. The conditions which make it necessary that those instruments should be admitted free absolutely rule with regard to pianos. </para>

Whilst I have given some facts which I have discovered for myself and others which have been given me by importers interested in the matter, I may state that I do not put forward theopinions furnished me as absolutely being my view of the question, because if I wereto take the importers&#39; view I might be a little biased in their direction, and if I took <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale&#39;s</inline> view I might be a little biased in his direction. Therefore I ask the Committee to take the evidence and test it from a practical stand-point. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> poses as a very strong protectionist. Yet we find that. the advertisements of his pianos on the railway stations are imported, whereas he could get them printed here.

In my opinion 25 per cent. is too much.I have a circular which has been issued by a very large number of importers, but I confess that it is very much on the same lines as the position which I have endeavoured to place before the Committee, and therefore I do not think it necessary to read it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> made some very unfair charges against the importers, but I will only take a few items in respect to which . complaint has been made. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> made a statement with regard to certain pianos being sold retail at very large profits as against their cost to the importers.

Having regard to the freight, advertising, and other charges, as well as the fact that these instruments are sold in many cases on the deferred payment system; ^50 is, I venture to say, a reasonable price, and about equal to that which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> would charge for a piano of his own manufacture.

                <para class="block">I feel very strongly upon this question. The gift of music is one of the greatest with which man is endowed, and adds materially to his social&#39; enjoyment. The Australians are a musical people. - Our climate has perhaps something to do with our leanings in that direction, whilst the love of music so common amongst the people of- the Commonwealth may be accentuated by the fact that owing to our sparse population we have not the opportunity for enjoyment in other directions which more thickly-populated countries offer. There are few homes in Australia in which there is- not a piano.- Every parent is ready 10 incur considerable expenditure in giving his children a musical education. In Victoria alone 2,500 music teachers signed a petition praying the Parliament not to increase the duty on pianos under the first Fe&#39;deral Tariff. A similar petition was signed by 700 teachers in New South Wales. Had the pianoforte teachers, throughout Australia been appealed to, I am sure that at least 10,000 would have petitioned Parliament not to increase the old rates of duty. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> also desires to speak to the question, and I think therefore that the Minister should either agree that progress be reported at&#39; once, or accept the compromise I have suggested. .1 have produced conclusive evidence that there is . no necessity for this increased duty. &#39; Nevertheless, I am prepared to agree to the old rate being increased by 5 per cent., and I hope that that- compromise will be accepted. Surely music teachers should be capable of expressing an opinion upon this question. The Vice-President of the Executive Council would consider it little short of impertinence for a layman to express an opinion upon a question of law, and surely  he should be ready to concede that those who devote their time and attention to the teaching of music are competent to express an opinion upon this question. There is not a great singer, or young pianist of promise, who. does not leave Australia for Berlin, Leipsic,  or some other place to- finish his musical education .for the simple reason that in this respect Germany sets a standard. </para>

                        <para>- There is, inasmuch as the music teacher tries to bring to fruition the gifts which have been given the children; and to that end the best instruments possible must be obtained. No musician is satisfied with any but the best, which should be freely admitted as a means of education to all concerned in the advance of music. Of  course, other  conditions being equal, preference&#39; &#34;will be given to the local article, but, for all the reasons I have suggested, I think the compromise offered ought to be accepted. </para>

                    <para>. - I am surprised at the attempt toincrease the duties on pianos. Under theTariff of 1902 a duty of 20 per cent, wassufficient to enable this industry to prosper.. I have no desire to depreciate the colonial made instrument, which I have every reason to believe is good in- all respects; but when a manufacturer is able, under the duty I have mentioned, to expand his business andflourish, it is somewhat indecent to suggest a higher impost. I regard a tax on pianos, as a tax on the home. We ought to do all we can to cultivate the art of music, thar* which there is no more&#39; refining influence, and I should like to see a piano in the home of every man, because it is very often the means of keeping the family together, and. out of mischief : A piano is good in every home. </para>

We ought to do everything possible to cultivate music as a refining influence amongst our people. The facts which have been put before us show that a duty of20 per cent. would give adequate protection to the local manufacturer of pianos, and if that rate is moved for  1  shall support the request. </para>
